https://openalex.org/W2530887700,"Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read-write memory."
https://openalex.org/W2530596944,"Despite advances in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis, there are currently no molecular HAT catalysts that are capable of homolysing the strong nitrogen-hydrogen (N-H) bonds of N-alkyl amides. The motivation to develop amide homolysis protocols stems from the utility of the resultant amidyl radicals, which are involved in various synthetically useful transformations, including olefin amination and directed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond functionalization. In the latter process-a subset of the classical Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag reaction-amidyl radicals remove hydrogen atoms from unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds. Although powerful, these transformations typically require oxidative N-prefunctionalization of the amide starting materials to achieve efficient amidyl generation. Moreover, because these N-activating groups are often incorporated into the final products, these methods are generally not amenable to the direct construction of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. Here we report an approach that overcomes these limitations by homolysing the N-H bonds of N-alkyl amides via proton-coupled electron transfer. In this protocol, an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and a weak phosphate base cooperatively serve to remove both a proton and an electron from an amide substrate in a concerted elementary step. The resultant amidyl radical intermediates are shown to promote subsequent C-H abstraction and radical alkylation steps. This C-H alkylation represents a catalytic variant of the Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag reaction, using simple, unfunctionalized amides to direct the formation of new C-C bonds. Given the prevalence of amides in pharmaceuticals and natural products, we anticipate that this method will simplify the synthesis and structural elaboration of amine-containing targets. Moreover, this study demonstrates that concerted proton-coupled electron transfer can enable homolytic activation of common organic functional groups that are energetically inaccessible using traditional HAT-based approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2531829504,"Carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation is paramount in the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules, modern synthetic materials and commodity chemicals such as fuels and lubricants. Traditionally, the presence of a functional group is required at the site of C-C bond formation. Strategies that allow C-C bond formation at inert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds enable access to molecules that would otherwise be inaccessible and the development of more efficient syntheses of complex molecules. Here we report a method for the formation of C-C bonds by directed cleavage of traditionally non-reactive C-H bonds and their subsequent coupling with readily available alkenes. Our methodology allows for amide-directed selective C-C bond formation at unactivated sp3 C-H bonds in molecules that contain many such bonds that are seemingly indistinguishable. Selectivity arises through a relayed photoredox-catalysed oxidation of a nitrogen-hydrogen bond. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a starting point for functionalization at inert C-H bonds through a strategy involving hydrogen-atom transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2531578105,"The first synthetic genetic oscillator or ‘repressilator’ is simplified using insights from stochastic theory, thus achieving remarkably precise and robust oscillations and informing current debates about the next generation of synthetic circuits and their potential applications in cell-based therapies. The first genetic oscillator, known as the 'repressilator', was arguably a leader in the field of synthetic biology at the beginning of this century. It is, however, notoriously unreliable. Now Johan Paulsson and colleagues have succeeded in reducing error propagation and information losses in the original design, not by adding control loops, but by removing existing features, achieving remarkably precise and robust oscillations. The fact that such precise behaviour can be achieved in a relatively simple circuit, despite interaction with a noisy organism, should instruct current debates about cell-based therapies and the reliability of synthetic approaches in complex and variable environments. Synthetically engineered genetic circuits can perform a wide variety of tasks but are generally less accurate than natural systems. Here we revisit the first synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator1, and modify it using principles from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for circuit design in synthetic biology."

Seagrass ecosystems play a multi-functional role in human well-being, e.g. food through fisheries, control of erosion and protection against floods. Quantifying these services reveals their contributions to human well-being and helps justify seagrass conservation. There has been no comprehensive assessment as to whether seagrass ecosystem services are perceived to vary over the globe or amongst genera. Our study compiles the most complete list of ecosystem services provided by seagrasses so far, including bioregional- and genus-specific information from expert opinion and published studies. Several seagrass ecosystem services vary considerably in their (known) provision across genera and over the globe. Seagrasses genera are clearly not all equal with regard to the ecosystem services they provide. As seagrass genera are not evenly distributed over all bioregions, the presence of an ecosystem service sometimes depends on the genera present. Larger sized seagrass genera (e.g. Posidonia, Enhalus) are perceived to provide more substantial and a wider variety of ecosystem services than smaller species (e.g. Halophila, Lepilaena). Nevertheless, smaller species provide important services. Our findings point out data gaps, provide new insight for more efficient management and recommend caution in economic valuation of seagrass services worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2531598980,"Social media has created networked communication channels that facilitate interactions and allow information to proliferate within professional academic communities as well as in informal social circumstances. A significant contemporary discussion in the field of science communication is how scientists are using (or might use) social media to communicate their research. This includes the role of social media in facilitating the exchange of knowledge internally within and among scientific communities, as well as externally for outreach to engage the public. This study investigates how a surveyed sample of 587 scientists from a variety of academic disciplines, but predominantly the academic life sciences, use social media to communicate internally and externally. Our results demonstrate that while social media usage has yet to be widely adopted, scientists in a variety of disciplines use these platforms to exchange scientific knowledge, generally via either Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or blogs. Despite the low frequency of use, our work evidences that scientists perceive numerous potential advantages to using social media in the workplace. Our data provides a baseline from which to assess future trends in social media use within the science academy."
https://openalex.org/W2530082208,"The post-translational modification of proteins with polyubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of cell biology. Eight distinct chain linkage types co-exist in polyubiquitin and are independently regulated in cells. This 'ubiquitin code' determines the fate of the modified protein. Deubiquitinating enzymes of the ovarian tumour (OTU) family regulate cellular signalling by targeting distinct linkage types within polyubiquitin, and understanding their mechanisms of linkage specificity gives fundamental insights into the ubiquitin system. Here we reveal how the deubiquitinase Cezanne (also known as OTUD7B) specifically targets Lys11-linked polyubiquitin. Crystal structures of Cezanne alone and in complex with monoubiquitin and Lys11-linked diubiquitin, in combination with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, enable us to reconstruct the enzymatic cycle in great detail. An intricate mechanism of ubiquitin-assisted conformational changes activates the enzyme, and while all chain types interact with the enzymatic S1 site, only Lys11-linked chains can bind productively across the active site and stimulate catalytic turnover. Our work highlights the plasticity of deubiquitinases and indicates that new conformational states can occur when a true substrate, such as diubiquitin, is bound at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W2531450644,"Nicotinic α-7 acetylcholine receptor (nAChRα7) is a critical regulator of cholinergic anti-inflammatory actions in several diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Given the potential importance of α7nAChR as a therapeutic target, we evaluated whether PNU-282987, an α7nAChR agonist, is effective in protecting the lung against inflammation. We performed intratracheal instillation of LPS to generate acute lung injury (ALI) in C57BL/6 mice. PNU-282987 treatment, either before or after ALI induction, reduced neutrophil recruitment and IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), and IL-10 cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P < 0.05). In addition, lung NF-κB phosphorylation decreased, along with collagen fiber deposition and the number of matrix metalloproteinase-9+ and -2+ cells, whereas the number of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1+ cells increased (P < 0.05). PNU-282987 treatment also reduced lung mRNA levels and the frequency of M1 macrophages, whereas cells expressing the M2-related markers CD206 and IL-10 increased, suggesting changes in the macrophage profile. Finally, PNU-282987 improved lung function in LPS-treated animals. The collective results suggest that PNU-282987, an agonist of α7nAChR, reduces LPS-induced experimental ALI, thus supporting the notion that drugs that act on α7nAChRs should be explored for ARDS treatment in humans.-Pinheiro, N. M., Santana, F. P. R., Almeida, R. R., Guerreiro, M., Martins, M. A., Caperuto, L. C., Câmara, N. O. S., Wensing, L. A., Prado, V. F., Tibério, I. F. L. C., Prado, M. A. M., Prado, C. M.

Handwriting is impaired early in PD and can be evaluated using computerized analysis of drawn spirals, capturing kinematic, dynamic, and spatial abnormalities and calculating indices that quantify motor performance and disability. Digitized spiral drawing correlates with motor scores and may be more sensitive in detecting early changes than subjective ratings. However, whether changes in spiral drawing are abnormal compared with controls and whether changes are detected in early PD are unknown.Methods138 PD subjects (50 with early PD) and 150 controls drew spirals on a digitizing tablet, generating x, y, z (pressure) data-coordinates and time. Derived indices corresponded to overall spiral execution (severity), shape and kinematic irregularity (second order smoothness, first order zero-crossing), tightness, mean speed and variability of spiral width. Linear mixed effect adjusted models comparing these indices and cross-validation were performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to examine discriminative validity of combined indices.ResultsAll indices were significantly different between PD cases and controls, except for zero-crossing. A model using all indices had high discriminative validity (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.81). Discriminative validity was maintained in patients with early PD.ConclusionSpiral analysis accurately discriminates subjects with PD and early PD from controls supporting a role as a promising quantitative biomarker. Further assessment is needed to determine whether spiral changes are PD specific compared with other disorders and if present in pre-clinical PD."
https://openalex.org/W2529867006,"The mammalian visual cortex massively innervates the brainstem, a phylogenetically older structure, via cortico-fugal axonal projections. Many cortico-fugal projections target brainstem nuclei that mediate innate motor behaviours, but the function of these projections remains poorly understood. A prime example of such behaviours is the optokinetic reflex (OKR), an innate eye movement mediated by the brainstem accessory optic system, that stabilizes images on the retina as the animal moves through the environment and is thus crucial for vision. The OKR is plastic, allowing the amplitude of this reflex to be adaptively adjusted relative to other oculomotor reflexes and thereby ensuring image stability throughout life. Although the plasticity of the OKR is thought to involve subcortical structures such as the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei, cortical lesions have suggested that the visual cortex might also be involved. Here we show that projections from the mouse visual cortex to the accessory optic system promote the adaptive plasticity of the OKR. OKR potentiation, a compensatory plastic increase in the amplitude of the OKR in response to vestibular impairment, is diminished by silencing visual cortex. Furthermore, targeted ablation of a sparse population of cortico-fugal neurons that specifically project to the accessory optic system severely impairs OKR potentiation. Finally, OKR potentiation results from an enhanced drive exerted by the visual cortex onto the accessory optic system. Thus, cortico-fugal projections to the brainstem enable the visual cortex, an area that has been principally studied for its sensory processing function, to plastically adapt the execution of innate motor behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W2530718874,"Despite many studies on the effects of heat on mental health, few studies have examined humidity. In order to investigate the relationship among heat, humidity and mental health, we matched data from the Social, Economic and Environmental Factors (SEEF) project with gridded daily temperature and water vapour pressure data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Logit models were employed to describe the associations among heat (assessed using temperature, °C), humidity (assessed using vapour pressure, hPa) and two measures of mental health, (i) high or very high distress (assessed using K10 scores ≥ 22) and (ii) having been treated for depression or anxiety. We found a one-unit increase in temperature and vapour pressure was associated with an increase in the occurrence of high or very high distress by 0.2% (p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.1-0.3%) and 0.1% (p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.0-0.3%) respectively. However, when humidity rose to the 99th percentile of the sample, the estimated marginal effect of heat was more than doubled (0.5%, p < 0.001, 99% CI: 0.2-0.7%). Neither heat nor humidity was related to having been treated for depression or anxiety in the last month. Humidity compounds the negative association between hot weather and mental health and thus should be taken into account when reforming the health care system to respond to the challenge of climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2530154446,"Gentamicin is a commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotic. However, its therapeutic use is limited by its nephrotoxicity. The mechanisms of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity are principally from renal inflammation and oxidative stress. Since atorvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, exerts lipid-lowering effects, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-apoptotic effects, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of atorvastatin against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used and nephrotoxicity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of gentamicin, 100 mg/kg/day, for 15 days. Atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg/day, was administered by orally gavage 30 min before gentamicin injection on day 1 to 15 (pretreatment) or on day 10 to15 (delayed treatment). For only atorvastatin treatment group, it was given on day 1 to 15. At the end of the experiment, kidney weight, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine as well as renal inflammation (NF-κB, TNFαR1, IL-6 and iNOS), renal fibrosis (TGFβ1), ER stress (calpain, GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12) and apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2) as well as TUNEL assay were determined. Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was confirmed by marked elevations in serum urea and creatinine, kidney hypertrophy, renal inflammation, fibrosis, ER stress and apoptosis and attenuation of creatinine clearance. Atorvastatin pre and delayed treatment significantly improved renal function and decreased renal NF-κB, TNFαR1, IL-6, iNOS and TGFβ1 expressions. They also attenuated calpain, GRP78, CHOP, caspase 12, Bax, and increased Bcl-2 expressions in gentamicin-treated rat. These results indicate that atorvastatin treatment could attenuate gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, substantiated by the reduction of inflammation, ER stress and apoptosis. The effect of atorvastatin in protecting from renal damage induced by gentamicin seems to be more effective when it beginning given along with gentamicin or pretreatment."
https://openalex.org/W2531083575,"Chondrogenesis can regulate bone formation. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, highly expressed in chondrocytes, is a negative regulator of bone growth. To investigate whether chondrocyte FGFR3 regulates osteogenesis, thereby contributing to postnatal bone formation and bone remodeling, mice with conditional knock-out of Fgfr3 in chondrocytes (mutant (MUT)) were generated. MUT mice displayed overgrowth of bone with lengthened growth plates. Bone mass of MUT mice was significantly increased at both 1 month and 4 months of age. Histological analysis showed that osteoblast number and bone formation were remarkably enhanced after deletion of Fgfr3 in chondrocytes. Chondrocyte-osteoblast co-culture assay further revealed that Fgfr3 deficiency in chondrocytes promoted differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts by up-regulating the expressions of Ihh, Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7, Wnt4, and Tgf-β1, as well as down-regulating Nog expression. In addition, osteoclastogenesis was also impaired in MUT mice with decreased number of osteoclasts lining trabecular bone, which may be related to the reduced ratio of Rankl to Opg in Fgfr3-deficient chondrocytes. This study reveals that chondrocyte FGFR3 is involved in the regulation of bone formation and bone remodeling by a paracrine mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2531039840,"The lack of sleep, both in quality and quantity, is an increasing problem in modern society, often related to workload and stress. A number of studies have addressed the effects of acute (total) sleep deprivation on postural control. However, up to date, the effects of chronic sleep deficits, either in quantity or quality, have not been analyzed. Thirty healthy adults participated in the study that consisted of registering activity with a wrist actigraph for more than a week before performing a series of postural control tests. Sleep and circadian rhythm variables were correlated and the sum of activity of the least active 5-h period, L5, a rhythm variable, obtained the greater coefficient value with sleep quality variables (wake after sleep onset WASO and efficiency sleep). Cluster analysis was performed to classify subjects into two groups based on L5 (low and high). The balance tests scores used to asses postural control were measured using Biodex Balance System and were compared between the two groups with different sleep quality. The postural tests were divided into dynamic (platform tilt with eyes open, closed and cursor) and static (clinical test of sensory integration). The results showed that during the tests with eyes closed, the group with worse sleep quality had also worse postural control performance. Lack of vision impairs postural balance more deeply in subjects with chronic sleep inefficiency. Chronic poor sleep quality impairs postural control similarly to total sleep deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2531217322,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) is currently devastating the United States pork industry by causing an 80–100% fatality rate in infected piglets. Coronavirus spike proteins mediate virus entry into cells, a process that requires the spike proteins to be proteolytically activated. It has been a conundrum which proteases activate PEDV entry. Here we systematically investigated the roles of different proteases in PEDV entry using pseudovirus entry, biochemical, and live virus infection assays. We found that the PEDV spike is activated by lysosomal cysteine proteases but not proprotein convertases or cell surface serine proteases. Extracellular trypsin activates PEDV entry when lysosomal cysteine proteases are inhibited. We further pinpointed cathepsin L and cathepsin B as the lysosomal cysteine proteases that activate the PEDV spike. These results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism for PEDV entry and identify potential antiviral targets for curbing the spread of PEDV."
https://openalex.org/W2531504191,"This study examined the trainability of the proprioceptive sense and explored the relationship between proprioception and motor learning. With vision blocked, human learners had to perform goal-directed wrist movements relying solely on proprioceptive/haptic cues to reach several haptically specified targets. One group received additional somatosensory movement error feedback in form of vibro-tactile cues applied to the skin of the forearm. We used a haptic robotic device for the wrist and implemented a 3-day training regimen that required learners to make spatially precise goal-directed wrist reaching movements without vision. We assessed whether training improved the acuity of the wrist joint position sense. In addition, we checked if sensory learning generalized to the motor domain and improved spatial precision of wrist tracking movements that were not trained. The main findings of the study are: First, proprioceptive acuity of the wrist joint position sense improved after training for the group that received the combined proprioceptive/haptic and vibro-tactile feedback (VTF). Second, training had no impact on the spatial accuracy of the untrained tracking task. However, learners who had received VTF significantly reduced their reliance on haptic guidance feedback when performing the untrained motor task. That is, concurrent VTF was highly salient movement feedback and obviated the need for haptic feedback. Third, VTF can be also provided by the limb not involved in the task. Learners who received VTF to the contralateral limb equally benefitted. In conclusion, somatosensory training can significantly enhance proprioceptive acuity within days when learning is coupled with vibro-tactile sensory cues that provide feedback about movement errors. The observable sensory improvements in proprioception facilitates motor learning and such learning may generalize to the sensorimotor control of the untrained motor tasks. The implications of these findings for neurorehabilitation are discussed."

The anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory and venotonic properties of β-escin have been the most extensively clinically investigated effects of this plant-based drug and randomized controlled trials have proved the efficacy of β-escin for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. However, despite the clinical recognition of the drug its pharmacological mechanism of action still remains largely elusive. To determine the cellular and molecular basis for the therapeutic effectiveness of β-escin we performed discovery and targeted proteomic analyses and in vitro evaluation of cellular and molecular responses in human endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. Our results demonstrate that in endothelial cells β-escin potently induces cholesterol synthesis which is rapidly followed with marked fall in actin cytoskeleton integrity. The concomitant changes in cell functioning result in a significantly diminished responses to TNF-α stimulation. These include reduced migration, alleviated endothelial monolayer permeability, and inhibition of NFκB signal transduction leading to down-expression of TNF-α-induced effector proteins. Moreover, the study provides evidence for novel therapeutic potential of β-escin beyond the current vascular indications."
https://openalex.org/W2531640315,"Populations in sub-Saharan Africa are shifting from rural to increasingly urban. Although the burden of cardiovascular disease is expected to increase with this changing landscape, few large studies have assessed a wide range of risk factors in urban and rural populations, particularly in West Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based survey of 3317 participants from Ghana (≥18 years old), of whom 2265 (57% female) were from a mid-sized city (Sunyani, population ~250,000) and 1052 (55% female) were from surrounding villages (populations <5000). We measured canonical cardiovascular disease risk factors (BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids) and fibrinolytic markers (PAI-1 and t-PA), and assessed how their distributions and related clinical outcomes (including obesity, hypertension and diabetes) varied with urban residence and sex. Urban residence was strongly associated with obesity (OR: 7.8, 95% CI: 5.3-11.3), diabetes (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 2.3-5.7), and hypertension (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 2.6-4.0). Among the quantitative measures, most affected were total cholesterol (+0.81 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.73-0.88), LDL cholesterol (+0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99), and t-PA (+0.56, 95% CI: 0.48-0.63). Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol profiles were similarly poor in both urban and rural environments, but significantly worse among rural participants after BMI-adjustment. For most of the risk factors, the strength of the association with urban residence did not vary with sex. Obesity was a major exception, with urban women at particularly high risk (26% age-standardized prevalence) compared to urban men (7%). Overall, urban residents had substantially worse cardiovascular risk profiles, with some risk factors at levels typically seen in the developed world."

Besides RNA editing, ADAR1 has recently been shown to play important roles in maintaining the body balance, including tissue homoeostasis, organ development, and autoimmune regulations, by inhibiting both IFN production and subsequent IFN-activated pathways. Accordingly, the question was raised how IFN signaling induced by viral infections overcomes the inhibitory effect of constitutively expressed ADAR1 (ADAR1-P110) to execute efficient antiviral activity. Here we unexpectedly found that IFN signaling promoted Lys48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of ADAR1-P110. Furthermore, we identified the E3 ligase β transducin repeat-containing protein responsible for IFN-mediated ADAR1-P110 down-regulation. IFN signaling promoted the interaction between β transducin repeat-containing protein and ADAR1-P110 as well as protein turnover of ADAR1-P110. Moreover, we found that both lysine 574 and 576 are essential for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. Critically, we demonstrated that down-regulation of ADAR1-P110 is required for IFN signaling to execute efficient antiviral activity during viral infections.

So far, three classes of IFNs (type I, II, and III) have been identified. Among them, the type I IFN (IFN-I or IFNα/β) family has been extensively studied and well characterized. IFN-I family members trigger their signaling through activation of IFN-I receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2), which is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinase family (JAK1 and Tyk2). Activated JAK1 and Tyk2 subsequently induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, which form a transcriptional complex. This complex translocates into the nucleus to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 3The abbreviations used are: ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; PKR, RNA-activated protein kinase; β-TrCP, β transducin repeat-containing protein; Z-VAD, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD; Ub, ubiquitin; CHX, cycloheximide; MOI, multiplicity of infection; ADAR, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-I signaling could play deleterious roles in some normal biological functions, especially when cells undergo excessive activated IFN-I signaling.

Forte G.M. Szynkiewicz M. Chase D.S. Aeby A. Abdel-Hamid M.S. Ackroyd S. Allcock R. Bailey K.M. Balottin U. Barnerias C. Bernard G. Bodemer C. Botella M.P.

IFN-I also has important effects on lethality in diverse models of sepsis or endotoxic shock (8.Trinchieri G. Type I interferon: friend or foe?.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous studies have suggested that excessive IFN-I signaling could be involved in impairing normal organismal homoeostasis, including the maintenance of both fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells (9.Hartner J.C. Walkley C.R. Lu J. Orkin S.H. ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis and suppression of interferon signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), intestinal homoeostasis (10.Qiu W. Wang X. Buchanan M. He K. Sharma R. Zhang L. Wang Q. Yu J. ADAR1 is essential for intestinal homeostasis and stem cell maintenance.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e599Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and liver morphological and functional integrity (11.Wang G. Wang H. Singh S. Zhou P. Yang S. Wang Y. Zhu Z. Zhang J. Chen A. Billiar T. Monga S.P. Wang Q. ADAR1 prevents liver injury from inflammation and suppresses interferon production in hepatocytes.Am. J. Pathol. 2015; 185: 3224-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the complex biological activity of IFN-I, the maintenance of normal organismal functions requires balanced IFN-I signaling. Sufficient IFN-I signaling must be maintained in cells to produce the protective effects for antipathogen responses, and, at the same time, IFN-I signaling must be restricted to prevent harmful effects on tissue homoeostasis. Therefore, some intracellular mechanisms have evolved to limit excessive activated IFN-I signaling. For example, suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins 1 (SOCS1) inhibits cytokine-induced activation of the JAK family (12.Coccia E.M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. Negative regulation of type I interferon signaling: facts and mechanisms.Cell. Mol. Biol. 2006; 52: 77-87PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase D2 (PKD2) promotes IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation to limit IFN-I signaling (13.Zheng H. Qian J. Varghese B. Baker D.P. Fuchs S.

Recently, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) has attracted much attention because of its important negative regulatory effect on IFN-I production and subsequent IFN-I-activated pathways (9.Hartner J.C.

Genet. 2012; 44: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). ADAR1 is a double-stranded RNA binding protein that catalyzes RNA editing (converting adenosine to inosine) of cellular and viral RNAs (20.Samuel C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There are two protein size forms of ADAR1 (P110 and P150). ADAR1-P110 is constitutively expressed in ubiquitous types of cells, whereas P150 is only expressed when cells are stimulated by some activators (20.Samuel C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21.Gélinas J.F. Clerzius G. Shaw E. Gatignol A. Enhancement of replication of RNA viruses by ADAR1 via RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8460-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The adenosine-to-inosine editing is of broad physiological function. Therefore, ADAR1 executes complex biological activities, including proviral or antiviral effects dependent on different virus types and the interaction between hosts and viruses (20.Samuel C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Despite the complexity, ADAR1 has been shown to promote the infection of numerous types of viruses, including VSV; measles virus; EBV; influenza virus; dengue virus; HIV, type 1; human respiratory syncytial virus; and human herpesviruses 8 (20.Samuel C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21.Gélinas J.F. Clerzius G. Shaw E. Gatignol A. Enhancement of replication of RNA viruses by ADAR1 via RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8460-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that ADAR1-mediated enhancement of viral infections is mainly through RNA editing or inhibition of IFN activity (including both IFN-I production and IFN-activated PKR antiviral activity) (21.Gélinas J.F. Clerzius G. Shaw E. Gatignol A. Enhancement of replication of RNA viruses by ADAR1 via RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8460-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of constitutively expressed ADAR1 on IFN-I signaling maintains the IFN-I signaling balance and tissue homoeostasis. However, it is also of vital importance that the balance of IFN-I signaling should be able to be broken and regulated under some pathological conditions, such as viral infections. Virus-activated IFN-I signaling must act to overcome the ADAR1-mediated inhibitory effect to achieve efficient antiviral activity. However, the action mechanisms still remain unexplored. Here we discovered that IFN-I signaling down-regulated the level of constitutively expressed ADAR1-P110, which is dependent on Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of ADAR1-P110 mediated by IFN-I signaling. Furthermore, we identified the E3 ligase β-TrCP, which interacts with ADAR1-P110 and is responsible for IFN-mediated ADAR1-P110 down-regulation. Moreover, we found that both lysine 574 and lysine 576 are essential for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. Critically, we demonstrated that down-regulation of ADAR1-P110 is required for IFN signaling to achieve efficient antiviral activity during viral infections. Our findings reveal the action mechanisms by which IFN signaling achieves efficient antiviral functions and may provide potential targets for IFN-based antiviral therapy. To determine the possible effect of IFN signaling on ADAR1-P110, we first analyzed the change of ADAR1-P110 protein levels in cells under conditions of IFN treatment. To this end, HEK293T cells were treated with IFNα for various times. Using a specific antibody against ADAR1-P110, we found that endogenous ADAR1-P110 levels were gradually down-regulated with IFNα (1000 IU/ml) treatment (Fig. 1A). ADAR1-P110 levels were reduced by around 80% when cells were treated with IFNα for 6 h, although its levels went back up slightly with 12-h IFNα treatment (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that IFNα signaling is capable of promoting the down-regulation of ADAR1-P110, FLAG-ADAR1-P110 was overexpressed in cells that were subsequently treated with IFNα. The result showed that exogenous FLAG-ADAR1-P110 levels were also substantially down-regulated with IFNα treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). When cells were treated with increased amounts of IFNα, we found that endogenous ADAR1-P110 was down-regulated by IFNα treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, IFN-mediated ADAR1-P110 down-regulation was significantly inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1E). An interesting report showed that ADAR1-P150 can be down-regulated in a caspase-dependent manner (30.Toth A.M. Li Z. Cattaneo R. Samuel C.E. RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 suppresses measles virus-induced apoptosis and activation of protein kinase PKR.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29350-29356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of caspase in ADAR1-P110 down-regulation, we utilized a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD, to block caspase activity. Our data showed that inhibition of caspase activity by Z-VAD did not block IFN-induced ADAR1-P110 down-regulation (Fig. 1F). These data strongly suggest that IFNα signaling negatively regulates cellular levels of ADAR1-P110 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Given that IFN signaling was able to down-regulate ADAR1-P110 levels, we questioned whether IFN treatment promotes ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. Cells were treated with IFNα, and then the ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, IFNα treatment noticeably increased the polyubiquitination of endogenous ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, we confirmed that IFNα treatment promoted exogenous ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cells were treated with increased amounts of IFNα. The result showed that ADAR1-P110 polyubiquitination was up-regulated by IFNα treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Two lysine residues of ubiquitin, Lys48 and Lys63, have been extensively studied and are most commonly used for the analysis of protein polyubiquitination. We sought to determine whether IFN signaling affects the Lys48-linked or Lys63-linked ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110. We transfected cells with FLAG-ADAR1-P110 together with HA-tagged Ub-WT or HA-Ub-Lys48 only (R48K) or HA-Ub-Lys63 only (R63K). Then cells were treated with IFNα. We found that IFNα treatment remarkably promoted the Lys48-linked ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 2D) but did not obviously affect IFNα-induced Lys63-linked ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 2D). Collectively, our data demonstrated that IFN signaling promotes Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110. To find the ubiquitin ligase of ADAR1-P110, we first analyzed the amino acid sequences of ADAR1-P110. We noticed that there is a putative DSG(X)2+nS motif in ADAR1-P110 conserved across various species, including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus (Fig. 3A). The DSG(X)2+nS motif has been shown to be an important characteristic of substrates for β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the serine mutation in this motif of a substrate results in its inability to interact with β-TrCP (22.Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. The many faces of β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligases: reflections in the magic mirror of cancer.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that β-TrCP is a potential ubiquitin ligase of ADAR1-P110. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, the Ser578 of human ADAR1-P110 was mutated to alanine (SA). Furthermore, both Ser578 and Ser585 were mutated to alanine (AA). Cells transfected with FLAG-ADAR1-P110 (WT, SA, or AA) were treated with IFNα for 30 min, and then ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination levels were analyzed. We found that the ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110 mutants, especially the AA mutant, was significantly weaker than that of ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 3B). To further demonstrate the effect of β-TrCP on the specific motif of ADAR1-P110, cells were transfected with FLAG-ADAR1-P110-WT/SA/AA together with HA-tagged β-TrCP (HA-β-TrCP). As expected, β-TrCP induced much higher levels of ADAR1-P110-WT ubiquitination compared with the ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110 mutants (Fig. 3C). These results imply that the interaction between β-TrCP and ADAR1-P110 contributes to ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. To delineate the possible effect of β-TrCP on ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination, cells were transfected with FLAG-ADAR1-P110 together with or without HA-β-TrCP. Our data showed that overexpression of β-TrCP substantially promoted ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination (Fig. 3D). Then the shRNAs against β-TrCP (shBTR) were used to knock down β-TrCP. However, knockdown of β-TrCP significantly decreased the ubiquitination levels of ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 3E). To functionally demonstrate that β-TrCP is responsible for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination in IFN signaling, cells were treated with IFNα. The result showed that IFNα-mediated ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination was significantly inhibited by knockdown of β-TrCP (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these results suggest that the ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP promotes ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination in IFN signaling. To further understand the effect of β-TrCP on ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination, we analyzed the interaction between β-TrCP and ADAR1-P110. Cells were co-transfected with FLAG-ADAR1-P110 and HA-β-TrCP. The result confirmed the interaction between FLAG-ADAR1-P110 and HA-β-TrCP (Fig. 4A). Also, FLAG-ADAR1-P110 can interact with endogenous β-TrCP (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we found that endogenous β-TrCP can interact with endogenous ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 4C). Given that the serine mutations in the DSG(X)2+nS motif of protein substrates block the recognition of β-TrCP by its substrates, we detected the interaction between β-TrCP and ADAR1-P110-SA/AA mutants. The result was consistent with our hypothesis that the DSG(X)2+nS motif of ADAR1-P110 is important for β-TrCP binding (Fig. 4D). Next we sought to determine whether IFN signaling up-regulates β-TrCP levels. Cells were treated with IFNα for 2 or 6 h. The result showed that IFN signaling did not obviously affect β-TrCP levels within 6 h (Fig. 4E). However, we found that IFN treatment promoted the interaction between β-TrCP and ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 4F). All of these data suggest that β-TrCP can interact with ADAR1-P110 and that this interaction is promoted by IFN signaling. It has been clarified that Lys48-linked ubiquitination of a protein substrate usually leads to its degradation (23.Sun L. Chen Z.J. The novel functions of ubiquitination in signaling.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Given that IFN signaling is able to promote the Lys48-linked ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110, we speculated that the protein stability of ADAR1-P110 could be regulated by IFN signaling. To address this hypothesis, we conducted cycloheximide (CHX) pulse-chase analyses on ADAR1-P110 protein stability. Cells transfected with FLAG-ADAR1-P110 were treated with or without IFNα together with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. The results showed that IFNα treatment accelerated the degradation of ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 5A). Given that β-TrCP was able to promote ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination and degradation, we speculated that β-TrCP could affect cellular levels of ADAR1-P110. Cells were transfected with increased amounts of β-TrCP, and then the level of endogenous ADAR1-P110 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The result showed that overexpression of β-TrCP obviously decreased endogenous ADAR1-P110 levels (Fig. 5B). Next, ADAR1-P110 protein stability was analyzed by cycloheximide pulse-chase assay. We found that knockdown of β-TrCP substantially blocked ADAR1-P110 protein degradation (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the protein stability of ADAR1-P110-S578A (SA) or ADAR1-P110-S578A,S585A (AA) was analyzed. Compared with ADAR1-P110-WT, the degradation rate of ADAR1-P110-SA and -AA was much lower (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the binding of β-TrCP to ADAR1-P110 contributes to the degradation of ADAR1-P110. Taken together, we conclude that β-TrCP promotes protein turnover of ADAR1-P110. Given that β-TrCP promoted the ubiquitination of ADAR1-P110, we next tried to identify the ubiquitin acceptor lysine residues in ADAR1-P110. Previous studies of the substrates of β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase showed that the lysine residues for ubiquitin conjugation mostly locate in positions 9–13 upstream of this DSG(X)2+nS motif in protein substrates (22.Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. The many faces of β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligases: reflections in the magic mirror of cancer.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we generated the ADAR1-P110-K564R mutant, which harbors a lysine mutation upstream of the DSG(X)2+nS motif of ADAR1-P110. Cells were transfected with either FLAG-ADAR1-P110-WT or -K564R. We found that the ubiquitination level of the ADAR1-P110-K564R mutant was similar as that of ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 6A). This result suggests that lysine 564 could not be the ubiquitin acceptor residue of ADAR1-P110. We further generated the ADAR1-P110-K574R,K576R mutant, which harbors two mutation sites (lysine 574 and lysine 576) very close to the DSG(X)2+nS motif of ADAR1-P110. Of note, the ubiquitination level of ADAR1-P110-K574R,K576R mutant was much lower than that of ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 6B). To further identify which lysine residue, lysine 574 or lysine 576, is essential for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination, we generated two mutants, ADAR1-P110-K574R and ADAR1-P110-K576R (Fig. 6C). Cells were transfected with either the ADAR1-P110-K574R mutant or the ADAR1-P110-K576R mutant. Compared with ADAR1-P110-WT, both mutants had lower levels of ubiquitination (Fig. 6C), suggesting that both of these two lysine residues are the ubiquitin acceptor residues of ADAR1-P110. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both lysine 574 and lysine 576 are essential for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. Given that type I IFN promoted the ubiquitination and protein turnover of ADAR1-P110, we sought to determine the pathophysiological significance of ADAR1-P110 down-regulation in IFN signaling. To assess IFN-mediated signaling and antiviral activity, we chose human fibroblast-derived cell line 2fTGH. 2fTGH cells are widely used for IFN studies because of their high sensitivity to IFN-I and excellent ability to produce IFN-I during virus infection (24.McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Müller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. High-frequency mutagenesis of human cells and characterization of a mutant unresponsive to both α and γ interferons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). VSV is a very sensitive virus model that is usually used to assess IFN antiviral functions (25.Haller O. Kochs G. Weber F. The interferon response circuit: induction and suppression by pathogenic viruses.Virology. 2006; 344: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26.Randall R.E. Goodbourn S. Interferons and viruses: an interplay between induction, signalling, antiviral responses and virus countermeasures.J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Firstly, 2fTGH cells were infected with VSV for various times, and then ADAR1-P110 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. We found that ADAR1-P110 levels were also gradually down-regulated during VSV infections (Fig. 7A), which was consistent with the observation that IFNα promoted ADAR1-P110 down-regulation (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that ADAR1-P110 down-regulation occurs during actual viral infections. Next we analyzed the effect of ADAR1-P110 on IFN-mediated antiviral activity in our infection model, although a previous report has demonstrated that ADAR1 knockdown promoted the effect of IFN on the down-regulation of viral titers (27.Li Z. Wolff K.C. Samuel C.E. RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 deficiency leads to increased activation of protein kinase PKR and reduced vesicular stomatitis virus growth following interferon treatment.Virology. 2010; 396: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we pretreated cells with IFNα and then infected them with VSV. The VSV-encoded protein VSV-G was analyzed by immunoblotting. As expected, IFNα treatment significantly decreased the content of VSV-G (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2). We found that knockdown of endogenous ADAR1-P110 remarkably decreased VSV replication (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 3). This result suggests that ADAR1-P110 inhibits cellular antiviral ability in an basal IFN-secreting environment. Furthermore, when exogenous IFN was involved in the antiviral response, we observed that IFNα-mediated anti-VSV ability was significantly enhanced by knockdown of ADAR1-P110 (Fig. 7B, lane 3 versus lane 4 and lane 5 versus lane 6). Taken together, our data suggest that endogenous ADAR-P110 inhibits IFN-mediated antiviral activity. Based on the above results, we speculated that, during viral infections, IFN production and subsequent IFN signaling would encounter the inhibitory effect of ADAR1-P110. In conjunction with our previous data, which showed that IFN signaling actually down-regulated endogenous ADAR1-P110 levels through ubiquitin-dependent degradation, we hypothesized that IFN-mediated ADAR1-P110 down-regulation could be important for IFN antiviral activity. Given that we have demonstrated that the ADAR1-P110-S578A,S585A mutant (AA) impaired ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination and down-regulation (Fig. 3, B and C), we transfected cells with ADAR1-P110-AA, after which cells were infected with VSV-GFP, a VSV construct with the GFP gene. As expected, IFN treatment significantly inhibited VSV infection, as shown by a decreased VSV-GFP signal (Fig. 7C). Overexpression of ADAR1-P110-WT inhibited IFN-mediated antiviral activity (Fig. 7C). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of ADAR1-P110-AA on IFNs-mediated antiviral function was much more significant than that of ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, cells were collected for the FACS analyses. The result confirmed that ADAR1-P110-AA had a stronger inhibitory effect on IFN antiviral activity than ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 7D, top panel), which can be explained by the enhanced stability of ADAR1-P110-AA under conditions of IFN treatment compared with ADAR1-P110-WT (Fig. 7D, bottom panel).

https://openalex.org/W2530739174,"Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity. Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of bodyweight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion. VitaminAderivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place inwhite adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high–vitamin A conditions in mice. A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signalingwas selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal–vitaminA, high-fat diet. Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high–vitamin A diet. Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α- and RAR γ-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists. We conclude that reduced adiponectin expression under high-fat dietary conditions is dependent on 1) increased ALDH1A1 expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) further RAR ligand–induced, WAT-selective, increased retinoic acid response element–mediated signaling; and 3) RAR ligand–dependent reduction of adiponectin expression.—Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mihály, J., Béke, G., Weiss, K., Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, A.

https://openalex.org/W2530931683,"Training to reach with rotated visual feedback results in adaptation of hand movements, which persist when the perturbation is removed (reach aftereffects). Training also leads to changes in felt hand position, which we refer to as proprioceptive recalibration. The rate at which motor and proprioceptive changes develop throughout training is unknown. Here, we aim to determine the timescale of these changes in order to gain insight into the processes that may be involved in motor learning. Following six rotated reach training trials (30° rotation), at three radially located targets, we measured reach aftereffects and perceived hand position (proprioceptive guided reaches). Participants trained with opposing rotations one week apart to determine if the original training led to any retention or interference. Results suggest that both motor and proprioceptive recalibration occurred in as few as six rotated-cursor training trials (7.57° & 3.88° respectively), with no retention or interference present one week after training. Despite the rapid speed of both motor and sensory changes, these shifts do not saturate to the same degree. Thus, different processes may drive these changes and they may not constitute a single implicit process."

Recently, we have shown that NE utilizes redox signaling as evidenced by increased superoxide (O2●-) causally linked to the observed changes in these cells; however, the source of this reactive oxygen species (ROS) remains elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that the source of increased O2●- in NE-stimulated T-lymphocytes is due to disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics. To address this hypothesis, we utilized purified mouse splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes stimulated with NE and assessed O2●- levels, mitochondrial metabolism, cellular proliferation, and cytokine profiles. We demonstrate that the increase in O2●- levels in response to NE is time-dependent and occurs at later points of T-lymphocyte activation. Moreover, the source of O2●- was indeed the mitochondria as evidenced by enhanced MitoSOX Red oxidation as well as abrogation of this signal by the addition of the mitochondrial-targeted O2●--scavenging antioxidant MitoTempol. NE-stimulated T-lymphocytes also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which suggests disruption of mitochondrial metabolism and the potential source of increased mitochondrial O2●-. The effects of NE in regards to redox signaling appear to be adrenergic receptor-dependent as specific receptor antagonists could reverse the increase in O2●-; however, differential receptors regulating these processes were observed in CD4+ versus CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Finally, mitochondrial O2●- was shown to be mechanistic to the NE-mediated T-lymphocyte phenotype as supplementation of MitoTempol could reverse specific changes in cytokine expression observed with NE treatment. Overall, these studies indicate that mitochondrial metabolism and O2●--mediated redox signaling play a regulatory role in the T-lymphocyte response to NE."
https://openalex.org/W2530357616,"This study developed light cured dental composites with added monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM), tristrontium phosphate (TSrP) and antimicrobial polylysine (PLS). The aim was to produce composites that have enhanced water sorption induced expansion, can promote apatite precipitation and release polylysine.Experimental composite formulations consisted of light activated dimethacrylate monomers combined with 80 wt% powder. The powder phase contained a dental glass with and without PLS (2.5 wt%) and/or reactive phosphate fillers (15 wt% TSrP and 10 wt% MCPM). The commercial composite, Z250, was used as a control. Monomer conversion and calculated polymerization shrinkage were assessed using FTIR. Subsequent mass or volume changes in water versus simulated body fluid (SBF) were quantified using gravimetric studies. These were used, along with Raman and SEM, to assess apatite precipitation on the composite surface. PLS release was determined using UV spectroscopy. Furthermore, biaxial flexural strengths after 24 hours of SBF immersion were obtained.Monomer conversion of the composites decreased upon the addition of phosphate fillers (from 76 to 64%) but was always higher than that of Z250 (54%). Phosphate addition increased water sorption induced expansion from 2 to 4% helping to balance the calculated polymerization shrinkage of ~ 3.4%. Phosphate addition promoted apatite precipitation from SBF. Polylysine increased the apatite layer thickness from ~ 10 to 20 μm after 4 weeks. The novel composites showed a burst release of PLS (3.7%) followed by diffusion-controlled release irrespective of phosphate addition. PLS and phosphates decreased strength from 154 MPa on average by 17% and 18%, respectively. All formulations, however, had greater strength than the ISO 4049 requirement of > 80 MPa.The addition of MCPM with TSrP promoted hygroscopic expansion, and apatite formation. These properties are expected to help compensate polymerization shrinkage and help remineralize demineralized dentin. Polylysine can be released from the composites at early time. This may kill residual bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2530357256,"The angular velocities of ATPase-dependent power strokes as a function of the rotational position for the A-type molecular motor A3B3DF, from the Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 A-ATP synthase, and the thermophilic motor α3β3γ, from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly known as Bacillus PS3) F-ATP synthase, are resolved at 5 μs resolution for the first time. Unexpectedly, the angular velocity profile of the A-type was closely similar in the angular positions of accelerations and decelerations to the profiles of the evolutionarily distant F-type motors of thermophilic and mesophilic origins, and they differ only in the magnitude of their velocities. M. mazei A3B3DF power strokes occurred in 120° steps at saturating ATP concentrations like the F-type motors. However, because ATP-binding dwells did not interrupt the 120° steps at limiting ATP, ATP binding to A3B3DF must occur during the catalytic dwell. Elevated concentrations of ADP did not increase dwells occurring 40° after the catalytic dwell. In F-type motors, elevated ADP induces dwells 40° after the catalytic dwell and slows the overall velocity. The similarities in these power stroke profiles are consistent with a common rotational mechanism for A-type and F-type rotary motors, in which the angular velocity is limited by the rotary position at which ATP binding occurs and by the drag imposed on the axle as it rotates within the ring of stator subunits."

The LRC-TriCEPS experiment with CTRP3-FLAG protein as ligand and insulin as a control ligand was performed on the H4IIE rat hepatoma cell line.Initial analysis demonstrated efficient coupling of TriCEPS to CTRP3. Further, flow cytometry analysis (FACS) demonstrated successful oxidation and crosslinking of CTRP3-TriCEPS and Insulin-TriCEPS complexes to cell surface glycans. Demonstrating the utility of TriCEPS under these conditions, the insulin receptor was identified in the control dataset. In the CTRP3 treated cells a total enrichment of 261 peptides was observed. From these experiments 5 putative receptors for CTRP3 were identified with two reaching statistically significance: Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) and Lysosome membrane protein 2 (LIMP II). Follow-up Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the association between LAMP1 and CTRP3 and further testing using a polyclonal antibody to block potential binding sites of LAMP1 prevented CTRP3 binding to the cells.The LRC-TriCEPS methodology was successful in identifying potential novel receptors for CTRP3.The identification of the receptors for CTRP3 are important prerequisites for the development of small molecule drug candidates, of which none currently exist, for the treatment NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2530698837,"We aimed to examine progress in global road injury mortality since the initiation of Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. We examined annual percent changes in age-adjusted road traffic mortality using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Association between changes in road traffic mortality and legislative efforts in individual nations was explored using data from Global Status Reports on Road Safety 2013 and 2015. We found that global age-adjusted mortality, both overall and for user-specific road traffic injuries, decreased significantly between 2010 and 2013 (annual percent change in rates range from -1.43% to -0.99%). Developed countries witnessed a larger decrease than developing countries in both overall and user-specific road mortality (about 2.0-4.6 times). However, there were substantial disparities within developed countries and within developing countries, with some countries seeing large reductions in mortality rates and others seeing none. The annual percent change in road traffic mortality during 2010-2013 was significantly correlated with total national law enforcement score (Spearman rs = -0.38). We concluded that results highlight the need for continued effort to reduce the burden of road injury mortality, especially in LMIC countries."
https://openalex.org/W2530809761,"In many cultural landscapes, the abandonment of traditional grazing leads to encroachment of pastures by woody plants, which reduces habitat heterogeneity and impacts biodiversity typical of semi-open habitats. We developed a framework of mutually interacting spatial models to locate areas where shrub encroachment in Alpine treeline ecosystems deteriorates vulnerable species’ habitat, using black grouse Tetrao tetrix (L.) in the Swiss Alps as a study model. Combining field observations and remote-sensing information we 1) identified and located the six predominant treeline vegetation types; 2) modelled current black grouse breeding habitat as a function thereof so as to derive optimal habitat profiles; 3) simulated from these profiles the theoretical spatial extension of breeding habitat when assuming optimal vegetation conditions throughout; and used the discrepancy between (2) and (3) to 4) locate major aggregations of homogeneous shrub vegetation in otherwise suitable breeding habitat as priority sites for habitat restoration. All six vegetation types (alpine pasture, coniferous forest, Alnus viridis (Chaix), Rhododendron-dominated, Juniperus-dominated and mixed heathland) were predicted with high accuracy (AUC >0.9). Breeding black grouse preferred a heterogeneous mosaic of vegetation types, with none exceeding 50% cover. While 15% of the timberline belt currently offered suitable breeding habitat, twice that fraction (29%) would potentially be suitable when assuming optimal shrub and ground vegetation conditions throughout the study area. Yet, only 10% of this difference was attributed to habitat deterioration by shrub-encroachment of dense heathland (all types 5.2%) and Alnus viridis (4.8%). The presented method provides both a general, large-scale assessment of areas covered by dense shrub vegetation as well as specific target values and priority areas for habitat restoration related to a selected target organism. This facilitates optimizing the spatial allocation of management resources in geographic regions where shrub encroachment represents a major biodiversity conservation issue."

Despite effective vaccines, inexpensive alternatives such as probiotics are needed. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of probiotic candidate Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 to inhibit rotavirus infection. Bacterial adhesion to intestinal cells and interference with viral attachment were evaluated in vitro. B. thermophilum RBL67 displayed adhesion indexes of 625 ± 84 and 1958 ± 318 on Caco-2 and HT-29 cells respectively and was comparable or superior to four other bifidobacteria, including B. longum ATCC 15707 and B. pseudolongum ATCC 25526 strains. Incubation of B. thermophilum RBL67 for 30 min before (exclusion) and simultaneously (competition) with human rotavirus strain Wa decreased virus attachment by 2.0 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.1 log10 (by 99.0% and 96.8% respectively). Displacement of virus already present was negligible. In CD-1 suckling mice fed B. thermophilum RBL67 challenged with simian rotavirus SA-11, pre-infection feeding with RBL 67 was more effective than post-infection feeding, reducing the duration of diarrhea, limiting epithelial lesions, reducing viral replication in the intestine, accelerating recovery, and stimulating the humoral specific IgG and IgM response, without inducing any adverse effect. B. thermophilum RBL67 had little effect on intestinal IgA titer. These results suggest that humoral immunoglobulin might provide protection against the virus and that B. thermophilum RBL67 has potential as a probiotic able to inhibit rotavirus infection and ultimately reduce its spread."
https://openalex.org/W2530141987,"Background A continuous influx of poor people to urban slums poses a challenge to Bangladesh’s health system as it has failed to tackle maternal morbidity and mortality. BRAC is the largest non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh. BRAC has been working to reduce maternal, neonatal and under-five children morbidity and mortality of slum dwellers in cities. BRAC has been doing this work for a decade through a programme called MANOSHI. This programme provides door-to-door services to its beneficiaries through community health workers (CHWs) and normal delivery service through its delivery and maternity centres. BRAC started the ‘MANOSHI’ programme in Narayanganj City Corporation during 2011 to address maternal, neonatal and child health problems facing slum dwellers. We investigated the existing maternal health-service indicators in the slums of Narayanganj City Corporation and compared the findings with a non-intervention area. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2012, in 47 slums of Narayanganj City Corporation as intervention and 10 slums of Narsingdi Sadar Municipality as comparison area. A total of 1206 married women, aged 15–49 years, with a pregnancy outcome in the previous year were included for interview. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive and maternal health-care practices like use of contraceptive methods, antenatal care (ANC), delivery care, postnatal care (PNC) were collected through a structured questionnaire. The chi-square test, Student t test, Mann Whitney U-test, factor analysis and log-binominal test were performed by using STATA statistical software for analysing data. Results The activities of BRAC CHWs significantly improved four or more ANC (47% vs. 21%; p<0.000) and PNC (48% vs. 39%; p<0.01) coverage in the intervention slums compared to comparison slums. Still, about half of the deliveries in both areas were attended at home by unskilled birth attendants, of which a very few received PNC within 48 hours after delivery. The poorest and illiterate women received fewer maternal health services from medically trained providers (MTPs). The poorest had a lower likelihood of receiving services from MTPs during delivery complications. Conclusion The MANOSHI programme service coverage for delivery care and PNC-checkup for women who prefer home delivery needs to be improved. For sustainable improvement of maternal health outcomes in urban slums, the programme needs to facilitate access to services for poor and illiterate women."
https://openalex.org/W2531307539,"Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a standard method for treating post-traumatic stress disorder. EMDR treatment consists of desensitisation and resource development and installation (RDI) stages. Both protocols provide a positive alternating bilateral stimulation (BLS). The effect of desensitisation with BLS has been elucidated. However, a role for BLS in RDI remains unknown. Therefore, it is important to measure feelings as subjective data and physiological indicators as objective data to clarify the role of BLS in RDI. RDI was administered to 15 healthy volunteer subjects who experienced pleasant memories. Their oxygenated haemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]), a sensitive index of brain activity, was measured from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the temporal cortex using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy during recall of a pleasant memory with or without BLS. The BLS used was alternating bilateral tactile stimulation with a vibration machine. The psychological evaluation suggested that RDI was successful. The results showed that, compared with non-BLS conditions, accessibility was increased and subjects were more relaxed under BLS conditions. A significant increase in [oxy-Hb] was detected in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), and a decrease in the wide bilateral areas of the PFC was observed in response to BLS. The significant BLS-induced activation observed in the right STS, which is closely related to memory representation, suggests that BLS may help the recall of more representative pleasant memories. Furthermore, the significant reduction in the PFC, which is related to emotion regulation, suggests that BLS induces relaxation and comfortable feelings. These results indicate an important neural mechanism of RDI that emotional processing occurred rather than higher cognitive processing during this stage. Considering the neuroscientific evidence to date, BLS in RDI may enhance comfortable feelings about pleasant memories. Based on the current findings, the use of BLS in RDI may be warranted in some clinical situations."

We aimed to 1) determine the risk of suicide within the first year after death of a close relative, 2) investigate if and how the risk changes within this time window and 3) determine if sex, age, and type of relationship, affect this association.A self-matched, case-crossover study was performed by linking Swedish registers. In total, 31 059 individuals with suicide between 1990 and 2011 were included. Different periods within the year prior to the suicide were compared with corresponding periods one year earlier in the same individual's life. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for suicide after death of a close relative.Increased ORs of suicide were seen during the first month, OR 1·77 (95% CI 1·35-2·34), and the first half-year, 1·27 (1·13-1·43). An even higher OR was found within the first week, 3·43 (1·89-6·22). Patterns were similar for women and men and across age groups. Death of a partner or child but not death of a sibling or parent was associated with a significantly increased suicide risk. The strongest association was seen after death of a partner in individuals aged 45 and older.These findings provide knowledge of sensitive time periods and at-risk groups in the early period of bereavement. Due to the use of a self-matched study design, methodological challenges of unmeasured residual confounding could be overcome."
https://openalex.org/W2531338762,"This paper presents a study on multi-modal human emotional state detection while riding a powered wheelchair (PMV; Personal Mobility Vehicle) in an indoor labyrinth-like environment. The study reports findings on the habituation of human stress response during self-driving. In addition, the effects of “loss of controllability”, change in the role of the driver to a passenger, are investigated via an autonomous driving modality. The multi-modal emotional state detector sensing framework consists of four sensing devices: electroencephalograph (EEG), heart inter-beat interval (IBI), galvanic skin response (GSR) and stressor level lever (in the case of autonomous riding). Physiological emotional state measurement characteristics are organized by time-scale, in terms of capturing slower changes (long-term) and quicker changes from moment-to-moment. Experimental results with fifteen participants regarding subjective emotional state reports and commercial software measurements validated the proposed emotional state detector. Short-term GSR and heart signal characterizations captured moment-to-moment emotional state during autonomous riding (Spearman correlation; ρ = 0.6, p < 0.001). Short-term GSR and EEG characterizations reliably captured moment-to-moment emotional state during self-driving (Classification accuracy; 69.7). Finally, long-term GSR and heart characterizations were confirmed to reliably capture slow changes during autonomous riding and also of emotional state during participant resting state. The purpose of this study and the exploration of various algorithms and sensors in a structured framework is to provide a comprehensive background for multi-modal emotional state prediction experiments and/or applications. Additional discussion regarding the feasibility and utility of the possibilities of these concepts are given."
https://openalex.org/W2212093192,"When differently sized species feed on the same resources, interference competition may occur, which may negatively affect their food intake rate. It is expected that competition between species also alters behaviour and feeding patch selection. To assess these changes in behaviour and patch selection, we applied an experimental approach using captive birds of three differently sized Anatidae species: wigeon (Anas penelope) (~600 g), swan goose (Anser cygnoides) (~2700 g) and bean goose (Anser fabalis) (~3200 g). We quantified the functional response for each species and then recorded their behaviour and patch selection with and without potential competitors, using different species combinations. Our results showed that all three species acquired the highest nitrogen intake at relatively tall swards (6, 9 cm) when foraging in single species flocks in the functional response experiment. Goose species were offered foraging patches differing in sward height with and without competitors, and we tested for the effect of competition on foraging behaviour. The mean percentage of time spent feeding and being vigilant did not change under competition for all species. However, all species utilized strategies that increased their peck rate on patches across different sward heights, resulting in the same instantaneous and nitrogen intake rate. Our results suggest that variation in peck rate over different swards height permits Anatidae herbivores to compensate for the loss of intake under competition, illustrating the importance of behavioural plasticity in heterogeneous environments when competing with other species for resources."
https://openalex.org/W2530017749,"Noun compounds, consisting of two nouns (the head and the modifier) that are combined into a single concept, differ in terms of their plausibility: school bus is a more plausible compound than saddle olive. The present study investigates which factors influence the plausibility of attested and novel noun compounds. Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) are used to obtain formal (vector) representations of word meanings, and compositional methods in DSMs are employed to obtain such representations for noun compounds. From these representations, different plausibility measures are computed. Three of those measures contribute in predicting the plausibility of noun compounds: The relatedness between the meaning of the head noun and the compound (Head Proximity), the relatedness between the meaning of modifier noun and the compound (Modifier Proximity), and the similarity between the head noun and the modifier noun (Constituent Similarity). We find non-linear interactions between Head Proximity and Modifier Proximity, as well as between Modifier Proximity and Constituent Similarity. Furthermore, Constituent Similarity interacts non-linearly with the familiarity with the compound. These results suggest that a compound is perceived as more plausible if it can be categorized as an instance of the category denoted by the head noun, if the contribution of the modifier to the compound meaning is clear but not redundant, and if the constituents are sufficiently similar in cases where this contribution is not clear. Furthermore, compounds are perceived to be more plausible if they are more familiar, but mostly for cases where the relation between the constituents is less clear."

Here, we demonstrate PI3-kinase (CgVps34) to be essential for maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis. We examine how CgVps34 regulates the fundamental process of iron acquisition, and underscore its function in vesicular trafficking as a central determinant. RNA sequencing analysis revealed iron homeostasis genes to be differentially expressed upon CgVps34 disruption. Consistently, the Cgvps34Δ mutant displayed growth attenuation in low- and high-iron media, increased intracellular iron content, elevated mitochondrial aconitase activity, impaired biofilm formation, and extenuated mouse organ colonization potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that C. glabrata cells respond to iron limitation by expressing the iron permease CgFtr1 primarily on the cell membrane, and to iron excess via internalization of the plasma membrane-localized CgFtr1 to the vacuole. Our data show that CgVps34 is essential for the latter process. We also report that macrophage-internalized C. glabrata cells express CgFtr1 on the cell membrane indicative of an iron-restricted macrophage internal milieu, and Cgvps34Δ cells display better survival in iron-enriched medium-cultured macrophages. Overall, our data reveal the centrality of PI3K signaling in iron metabolism and host colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2530768591,"NOD-like receptors represent an important class of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors that play key roles in the regulation of inflammatory signalling pathways. They function as danger sensors and initiate inflammatory responses and the production of cytokines. Since NLR malfunction results in chronic inflammation and auto-immune diseases, there is a great interest in understanding how they work on a molecular level. To date, a lot of insight into the biological functions of NLRs is available but biophysical and structural studies have been hampered by the difficulty to produce soluble and stable recombinant NLR proteins. NLRP1 is an inflammasome forming NLR that is believed to be activated by binding to MDP and induces activation of caspase 1. Here, we report the identification of a soluble fragment of NLRP1 that contains the NACHT oligomerization domain and the putative MDP-sensing LRR domain. We describe the biophysical and biochemical characterization of this construct and a SEC-SAXS analysis that allowed the calculation of a low resolution molecular envelope. Our data indicate that the protein is constitutively bound to ATP with a negligible ability to hydrolyse the triphosphate nucleotide and that it adopts a monomeric extended conformation that is reminiscent of the structure adopted by NLRC4 in the inflammasome complex. Furthermore, we show that the presence of MDP is not sufficient to promote self-oligomerization of the NACHT-LRR fragment suggesting that MDP may either bind to regions outside the NACHT-LRR module or that it may not be the natural ligand of NLRP1. Taken together, our data suggest that the NLRP1 mechanism of action differs from that recently reported for other NLRs."
https://openalex.org/W2531264584,"We analyzed six apiaries in several natural environments with a Mediterranean ecosystem in Madrid, central Spain, in order to understand how landscape and management characteristics may influence apiary health and bee production in the long term. We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1.5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement of the apiary to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two of the six apiaries showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one of these apiaries showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average number of viruses. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and good sanitary practices to maximize apiary health and honey productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2556457319,"Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are highly detrimental DNA lesions, which may be repaired by the homologous recombination-mediated repair pathway. The 5′ to 3′ direction of long-range end resection on one DNA strand, in which 3′-single-stranded DNA overhangs are created from broken DNA ends, is an essential step in this pathway. Dna2 has been demonstrated as an essential nuclease in this event, but the molecular mechanism of how Dna2 is recruited to DNA break sites in vivo has not been elucidated. In this study, a novel recombination factor called Cdc24 was identified in fission yeast. We demonstrated that Cdc24 localizes to DNA break sites during the repair of DNA breaks and is an essential factor in long-range end resection. We also determined that Cdc24 plays a direct role in recruiting Dna2 to DNA break sites through its interaction with Dna2 and replication protein A (RPA). Further, this study revealed that RPA acts as the foundation for assembling the machinery for long-range end resection by its essential role in recruiting Cdc24 and Dna2 to DNA break sites. These results define Cdc24 as an essential factor for long-range end resection in the repair of DSBs, opening the door for further investigations into the enzymes involved in long-range end resection for DSB repair."
https://openalex.org/W2531374527,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality and predisposes patients to life-threatening aortic complications including aortic aneurysm. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most commonly used methods to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms involved in aortopathy. The accuracy of the gene expression data is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping (HK) genes, whose expression should remain constant regardless of aortic valve morphology, aortic diameter and other factors associated with aortopathy. Here, we identified an appropriate set of HK genes to be used as endogenous reference for quantifying gene expression in ascending aortic tissue using a spin column-based RNA extraction method. Ascending aortic biopsies were collected intra-operatively from patients undergoing aortic valve and/or ascending aortic surgery. These patients had BAV or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and the aortas were either dilated (≥4.5cm) or undilated. The cohort had an even distribution of gender, valve disease and hypertension. The expression stability of 12 reference genes were investigated (ATP5B, ACTB, B2M, CYC1, EIF4A2, GAPDH, SDHA, RPL13A, TOP1, UBC, YWHAZ, and 18S) using geNorm software. The most stable HK genes were found to be GAPDH, UBC and ACTB. Both GAPDH and UBC demonstrated relative stability regardless of valve morphology, aortic diameter, gender and age. The expression of B2M and SDHA were found to be the least stable HK genes. We propose the use of GAPDH, UBC and ACTB as reference genes for gene expression studies of BAV aortopathy using ascending aortic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2551845121,"Single-molecule photobleaching has emerged as a powerful non-invasive approach to extract the stoichiometry of multimeric membrane proteins in their native cellular environment. However, this method has mainly been used to determine the subunit composition of ion channels and receptors at the plasma membrane. Here, we applied single-molecule photobleaching to analyze the oligomeric state of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident candidate ceramide sensor protein, SMSr/SAMD8. Co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking studies previously revealed that the N-terminal sterile alpha motif (or SAM) domain of SMSr drives self-assembly of the protein into oligomers and that SMSr oligomerization is promoted by curcumin, a drug known to perturb ER ceramide and calcium homeostasis. Application of cell spreading surface-active coating materials in combination with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy allowed us to image GFP-tagged SMSr proteins as single fluorescent spots in the ER of HeLa cells in which expression of endogenous SMSr was abolished. In line with our biochemical analysis, we find that the number of bleaching steps in SMSr-GFP-positive spots displays a substantial drop after removal of the SAM domain. In contrast, treatment of cells with curcumin increased the number of bleaching steps. Our results document the first successful application of single-molecule photobleaching to resolve drug-induced and domain-dependent changes in the oligomeric state of an ER-resident membrane protein, hence establishing a complementary method to unravel the mechanism by which SMSr controls ceramide levels in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2531787351,"The present study examines how the composition of social networks and perceived relationship content influence peer clustering in smoking, and how the association changes during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood.The analysis was based on a Swedish two-wave survey sample comprising ego-centric network data. Respondents were 19 years old in the initial wave, and 23 when the follow-up sample was conducted. 17,227 ego-alter dyads were included in the analyses, which corresponds to an average response rate of 48.7 percent. Random effects logistic regression models were performed to calculate gender-specific average marginal effects of social network characteristics on smoking.The association of egos' and alters' smoking behavior was confirmed and found to be stronger when correlated in the female sample. For females, the associations decreased between age 19 and 23. Interactions between network characteristics and peer clustering in smoking showed that intense social interactions with smokers increase egos' smoking probability. The influence of network structures on peer clustering in smoking decreased during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood.The study confirmed peer clustering in smoking and revealed that females' smoking behavior in particular is determined by social interactions. Female smokers' propensity to interact with other smokers was found to be associated with the quality of peer relationships, frequent social interactions, and network density. The influence of social networks on peer clustering in smoking decreased during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2531686209,"In facultative partial migrants some individuals in a population are migratory and others are resident and individuals decide each year anew which strategy to choose. While the proportion of birds migrating is in part determined by environmental conditions and competitive abilities, the timing of individual departure and behaviours on route are little understood. Individuals encounter different environmental conditions when migrating earlier or later. Based on cost/ benefit considerations we tested whether behaviours on route were affected by time constraints, personality and/or age in a partially migrating population of Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We captured female Blue tits on migration at the Southern tip of Sweden during early, peak and late migration and measured latency to feed in an unfamiliar environment, exploration of a novel object and hesitation to feed beside a novel object (neophobia). Lean birds and birds with long wings started feeding earlier when released into the cage indicating that foraging decisions were mainly determined by energetic needs (lean and large birds). However, juveniles commenced feeding later with progression of the migratory season in concordance with predictions about personality effects. Furthermore, lean birds started to explore earlier than birds with larger fat reserves again indicating an effect of maintaining threshold energy reserves. Moreover, late migrating juveniles, started to explore earlier than early migrating juveniles possibly due to time constraints to find high-quality foraging patches or a suitable winter home. Finally, neophobia did not change over the migratory season indicating that this behaviour is not compromised by time constraints. The results overall indicate that decisions on route are mainly governed by energetic requirements and current needs to learn about the environment and only to a small extent by differences in personality."

Moreover, utilizing the patent citation method, which is an effective indicator of technology flow, we constructed patent citation network models and performed network analysis in order to reveal the features of different technology clusters. As a result, we identified the stagnant status of anti-HBV drug development and pointed the way for development of domestic pharmaceuticals in developing countries. We also discussed about therapeutic vaccines as the potential next generation therapy for HBV infection. Lastly, we depicted the cooperation between entities and found that novel forms of cooperation added diversity to the conventional form of cooperation within the pharmaceutical industry. In summary, our study provides inspiring insights for investors, policy makers, researchers, and other readers interested in anti-HBV drug development."

Inference of refuges via genetic tools is useful for conservation management as it can identify populations whose preservation may help retain a species' adaptive potential. Such investigation is needed for Australia's southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons), whose conservation status has recently deteriorated, and whose phylogeographic history during the Pleistocene may be atypical compared to other species. Its contemporary range spans approximately 2000 km of diverse habitat on either side of the Spencer Gulf, which was a land bridge during periods of Pleistocene aridity that may have allowed for migration circumventing the arid Eyrean barrier. We sampled from animals in nearly all known sites within the species' current distribution, mainly using non-invasive methods, and employed nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses to assess alternative scenarios for Pleistocene impacts on population structure. We found evidence for mildly differentiated populations at the range extremes on either side of Spencer Gulf, with secondary contact between locations neighbouring each side of the barrier. These extreme western and eastern regions, and four other regions in between, were genetically distinct in genotypic clustering analyses. Estimates indicate modest, but complex gene flow patterns among some of these regions, in some cases possibly restricted for several thousand years. Prior to this study there was little information to aid risk assessment and prioritization of conservation interventions facilitating gene flow among populations of this species. The contributions of this study to that issue are outlined."
