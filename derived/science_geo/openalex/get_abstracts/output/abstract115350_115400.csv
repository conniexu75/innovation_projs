https://openalex.org/W2068555261,"A gene discovered by positional cloning has been identified as the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease tumor suppressor gene. A restriction fragment encompassing the gene showed rearrangements in 28 of 221 VHL kindreds. Eighteen of these rearrangements were due to deletions in the candidate gene, including three large nonoverlapping deletions. Intragenic mutations were detected in cell lines derived from VHL patients and from sporadic renal cell carcinomas. The VHL gene is evolutionarily conserved and encodes two widely expressed transcripts of approximately 6 and 6.5 kilobases. The partial sequence of the inferred gene product shows no homology to other proteins, except for an acidic repeat domain found in the procyclic surface membrane glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2092550686,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes a variety of infections in immunocompromised hosts and individuals with cystic fibrosis. Expression of elastase, one of the virulence factors produced by this organism, requires the transcriptional activator LasR. Experiments with gene fusions show that gene lasl is essential for high expression of elastase. The lasl gene is involved in the synthesis of a diffusible molecule termed Pseudomonas autoinducer (PAI). PAI provides P. aeruginosa with a means of cell-to-cell communication that is required for the expression of virulence genes and may provide a target for therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2075517727,"A human complementary DNA was isolated that encodes a widely expressed protein, hSos1, that is closely related to Sos, the product of the Drosophila son of sevenless gene. The hSos1 protein contains a region of significant sequence similarity to CDC25, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras from yeast. A fragment of hSos1 encoding the CDC25-related domain complemented loss of CDC25 function in yeast. This hSos1 domain specifically stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on mammalian Ras proteins in vitro. Mammalian cells overexpressing full-length hSos1 had increased guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Thus hSos1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The hSos1 interacted with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) in vivo and in vitro. This interaction was mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of hSos1 and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of GRB2. These results suggest that the coupling of receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras signaling is mediated by a molecular complex consisting of GRB2 and hSos1."
https://openalex.org/W1969930180,"The localization of sites of memory formation within the brain has proven to be a formidable task even for simple forms of learning and memory. In order to localize a particular site of memory formation within the brain, the rabbit eyeblink response was classically conditioned while regions of the cerebellum or red nucleus were temporarily inactivated by microinfusions of the γ-aminobutyric acid agonist muscimol. Cerebellar inactivation completely blocked learning but had no effect on subsequent learning after inactivation, whereas red nucleus inactivation did not prevent learning but did block the expression of conditioned responses. The site of memory formation for this learned response thus appears to be localized within the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1973019272,"A method is described here for identifying good protease substrates among approximately 10(7) possible sequences. A library of fusion proteins was constructed containing an amino-terminal domain used to bind to an affinity support, followed by a randomized protease substrate sequence and the carboxyl-terminal domain of M13 gene III. Each fusion protein was displayed as a single copy on filamentous phagemid particles (substrate phage). Phage were then bound to an affinity support and treated with the protease of interest. Phage with good protease substrates were released, whereas phage with substrates that resisted proteolysis remained bound. After several rounds of binding, proteolysis, and phagemid propagation, sensitive and resistant substrate sequences were identified for two different proteases, a variant of subtilisin and factor Xa. The technique may also be useful for studying the sequence specificity of a variety of posttranslational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2038853266,"The perception of shape is independent of the size and position of the shape and also of the visual cue that defines it. The same shape can be recognized whether defined by a difference in luminance, by motion, or by texture. Experiments showed that the shape selectivity of individual cells in the macaque inferior temporal cortex did not vary with the size and position of a shape and also did not vary with the visual cue used to define the shape. This cue invariance was true for static luminance and texture cues as well as for relative motion cues--that is, for cues that are processed in ventral and dorsal visual pathways. The properties of these inferior temporal cells meet the demands of cue-invariant shape coding."
https://openalex.org/W2026895094,"Repeating glycosidic linkages of oligosaccharides can be synthesized by solid-phase methods. Glycals were attached to a polystyrene copolymer with a silyl ether bond and were activated to function as glycosyl donors with 3,3-dimethyldioxirane. Glycosidation was performed by reactions with a solution-based acceptor (itself a glycal). Excess acceptor and promoter were removed by rinsing after each coupling, and the desired oligosaccharides were then easily obtained from the polymer by the addition of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride. By this method, glycosidations are stereospecific and interior deletions are avoided."
https://openalex.org/W1978274895,"Members of the Trk tyrosine kinase family have recently been identified as functional receptors of the NGF family of neurotrophins. Here we show the rat trkC locus to be complex, encoding at least four distinct polypeptides. Three of the encoded polypeptides are full-length receptor tyrosine kinases that differ by novel amino acid insertions in the kinase domain. A fourth protein is a truncated receptor that lacks the catalytic domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation, cross-linking, and ligand binding assays indicate that TrkC receptors interact with NT-3 and not with the related neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, xNT-4, or hNT-5. Furthermore, high and low affinity NT-3-binding sites are associated with the TrkC receptors. Stable and transient expression of TrkC receptors in PC12 cells indicates that the neurite outgrowth response elicited by NT-3 is dramatic in receptors lacking the novel kinase insert (gp150trkC) but absent in receptors containing the 14 amino acid insert in the kinase domain (gp150trkC14). These data suggest that the trkC locus encodes receptors that may be capable of mediating different biological responses within the cell. This could have important implications in understanding the role of neurotrophins in the development of the vertebrate nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2054827263,"Although protection in animal models against intravenous challenges with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has been reported, no previous vaccines have protected against a heterosexual route of infection. In this study, five of six macaques were protected against vaginal challenge when immunized with formalin-treated SIV in biodegradable microspheres by the intramuscular plus oral or plus intratracheal route. Oral immunization alone did not protect. After a second vaginal challenge, three of four intramuscularly primed and mucosally boosted macaques remained protected. The data suggest that protection against human immunodeficiency virus vaginal transmission could be provided by microsphere-based booster vaccines when used to immunize women who are systemically primed."
https://openalex.org/W1968345966,"The cytotoxicity of human natural killer (NK) cells is modulated by the major histocompatibility complex human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C molecules on the surface of the target cell. Alloreactive NK cells specific for the NK-1 alloantigen could be reproducibly generated from individuals that were homozygous for HLA-C with asparagine at residue 77 and lysine at residue 80 [HLA-C(Asn77,Lys80)] by stimulation with target cells that were homozygous for HLA-C(Ser77,Asn80); the reciprocal stimulation yielded NK cells specific for the NK-2 alloantigen. However, neither homozygous target cell stimulated the generation of alloreactive NK cells from heterozygous individuals. Thus, these data reveal an unanticipated difference between human NK alloreactivity defined by this system and murine ""hybrid resistance."""
https://openalex.org/W2111089659,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an inherited human disease associated with neurologic degeneration, immune dysfunction, and high cancer risk. It has been proposed that the underlying abnormality in A-T is a defect in genetic recombination that interferes with immune gene rearrangements and the repair of DNA damage. Recombination was studied in A-T and control human fibroblast lines by means of two recombination vectors. Unexpectedly, spontaneous intrachromosomal recombination rates were 30 to 200 times higher in A-T fibroblast lines than in normal cells, whereas extrachromosomal recombination frequencies were near normal. Increased recombination is thus a component of genetic instability in A-T and may contribute to the cancer risk seen in A-T patients."
https://openalex.org/W1503719518,"11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been proposed to play an important role in aldosterone target cells by degrading endogenous glucocorticoids, thus allowing aldosterone to bind to the relatively nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor. The physiologically important species of this enzyme in renal aldosterone target cells appears to be kinetically and antigenically distinct from the previously characterized liver enzyme. Here we show that 11 beta-steroid dehydrogenase in the microsomal fraction of isolated renal collecting duct cells has a Km for corticosterone of 25.9 +/- 2.4 nM, about 100 times lower than the rat liver enzyme. Surprisingly, the collecting duct enzyme utilizes almost exclusively NAD as cofactor versus NADP used by the liver form. Conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone is 2.6 +/- 0.5 and 0.07 +/- 0.01 fmol/min/mg protein with 100 microM of NAD and NADP, respectively, demonstrating a 37.4 +/- 3.5-fold preference for NAD versus NADP. There is practically no conversion of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone either with NADH or NADPH, indicating that in collecting duct cells the enzyme operates only in the direction of oxygenation. In addition, 11 beta-steroid dehydrogenase activity is dose dependently inhibited by the end product 11-dehydrocorticosterone while the liver enzyme does not show end product inhibition. We conclude that renal collecting duct cells, the major physiological targets of aldosterone, are protected from circulating glucocorticoids by a hitherto undescribed enzyme of the 11-dehydrogenase family, which differs from the known liver enzyme in having a significantly higher affinity for corticosterone and a different cofactor requirement."
https://openalex.org/W2063393407,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are the major receptors for viral peptides and serve as targets for specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) specifically decreased activity of an MHC class I gene promoter up to 12-fold. Repression was effected by the HIV-1 Tat protein derived from a spliced viral transcript (two-exon Tat). These studies define an activity for two-exon Tat distinct from that of one-exon Tat and suggest a mechanism whereby HIV-1-infected cells might be able to avoid immune surveillance, allowing the virus to persist in the infected host."
https://openalex.org/W2091564367,"The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979382407,"We have isolated a cDNA encoding a high affinity, Na+/Cl(-)-dependent glycine transporter, GLYT-2, which is distinct from another glycine transporter, GLYT-1. While the 3' sequences of these two cDNAs are identical, the 5' noncoding regions and the N-termini are completely different. GLYT-1 is found only in the white matter of the CNS, while GLYT-2 is found in the gray matter of the CNS as well as in macrophages and mast cells in peripheral tissues. Our findings suggest that tissue-specific alternative splicing or alternative promoter usage from a single gene results in two mRNA products encoding similar but distinct glycine transporters. The anatomic distribution of GLYT-2 mRNA supports the emerging status of glycine as a supraspinal neurotransmitter and suggests that glycine may function as a chemical messenger outside the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1557371306,"The bcl-2 gene can potentially encode 26- and 22-kDa proteins that differ only in their carboxyl tails because of an alternative splicing mechanism. The larger of these proteins contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain within its carboxyl terminus, resides (at least in part) in mitochondrial membranes and has been shown to prolong cell survival by blocking programmed cell death (also termed apoptosis). To explore the function of the shorter 22-kDa Bcl-2 protein that lacks a transmembrane domain, DNAs encoding p26-Bcl-2-alpha or p22-Bcl-2-beta were expressed in an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic cell line 32D. In contrast to p26-Bcl-2 alpha that markedly prolonged cell survival, p22-Bcl-2-beta did not extend the survival of 32D cells when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Expression in 32D cells of a chimeric DNA that fused portions of the open reading frame common to Bcl-2-alpha and Bcl-2-beta (amino-acids 1-195) with sequences encoding the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the IL-2 receptor-alpha protein resulted in production of a Bcl-2/IL-2R fusion protein that was capable of prolonging 32D cell survival in the setting of IL-3 withdrawal. Based on fractionation of cells to produce crude heavy membrane, light membrane, nuclei, and cytosolic preparations, much of the p22-Bcl-2-beta protein appeared to reside in the cytosol, whereas Bcl-2-alpha and the Bcl-2/IL-2R chimeric proteins were found exclusively in fractions that also contained the inner mitochondrial membrane protein F1-beta-ATPase. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of membrane association for the function and intracellular targeting of the apoptosis-blocking Bcl-2 protein. Furthermore, despite the strong evolutionary conservation of the carboxyl regions of Bcl-2-alpha proteins observed previously for mammalian and avian species, these data suggest that a heterologous transmembrane domain can be substituted without loss of function."
https://openalex.org/W2044529881,"Repeated exposure to olfactory ligands (odorants) increased peripheral olfactory sensitivity in mice. For two unrelated ligands, androstenone and isovaleric acid, induction of olfactory sensitivity was odorant-specific and occurred only in inbred strains that initially had low sensitivity to the exposure odorant. These data demonstrate stimulus-induced plasticity in a sensory receptor cell, suggesting a form of stimulus-controlled gene expression. Induction with two unrelated odorants implies that olfactory induction is a general phenomenon that may occur in a large fraction of the human population."
https://openalex.org/W1606298617,"Phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters widely used for investigating mechanisms of cell transformation with protein kinase C (PKC) generally considered as being their only protein target. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) can act as a mitogen, affecting cell shape and the actin cytoskeleton. There is no identified functional target for LPA. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a protein n-chimaerin that is a high affinity phorbol ester receptor and a p21rac-GTPase activating protein (rac-GAP). p21rac is a member of the ras superfamily of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, which stimulates actin microfilament formation in Swiss 3T3 cells and superoxide production by the neutrophil oxidase. We now show that the rac-GAP activity of n-chimaerin is stimulated by phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) and that phorbol esters can synergize with PS and PA. LPA, in contrast, was found to inhibit n-chimaerin. The phospholipid/phorbol ester modulation of the rac-GAP activity requires the PKC-like cysteine-rich domain of n-chimaerin. Thus, n-chimaerin is a novel functional target (distinct from PKC) for both phorbol esters and LPA. These data suggest that the physiological role of n-chimaerin is to link events initiating at the cell surface/membrane with p21rac effector pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2102116608,"The folding of the all-beta sheet protein, interleukin-1 beta, was studied with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence. Ninety percent of the beta structure present in the native protein, as monitored by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, was attained within 25 milliseconds, correlating with the first kinetic phase determined by tryptophan and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate fluorescence. In contrast, formation of stable native secondary structure, as measured by quenched-flow deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments, began after only 1 second. Results from the NMR experiments indicated the formation of at least two intermediates with half-lives of 0.7 to 1.5 and 15 to 25 seconds. The final stabilization of the secondary structure, however, occurs on a time scale much greater than 25 seconds. These results differ from previous results on mixed alpha helix-beta sheet proteins in which both the alpha helices and beta sheets were stabilized very rapidly (less than 10 to 20 milliseconds)."
https://openalex.org/W2069739793,"To understand better the cellular basis of late-onset neuronal degeneration, we have examined the brain of the drop-dead mutant of Drosophila. This mutant carries an X-chromosomal recessive mutation that causes severe behavioral defects and brain degeneration, manifested a few days after emergence of the adult. Analysis of genetically mosaic flies has indicated that the focus of the drop-dead mutant phenotype is in the brain and that the gene product is non-cell autonomous. We examined the adult drop-dead mutant brain prior to onset of symptoms and found that many glial cells have stunted processes, whereas neuronal morphology is essentially normal. Adult mutant glial cells resemble immature glia found at an earlier stage of normal brain development. These observations suggest that defective glia in the drop-dead brain may disrupt adult nervous system function, contributing to progressive brain degeneration and death. The normal drop-dead gene product may prevent brain degeneration by providing a necessary glial function."
https://openalex.org/W2036767900,"The CD4 antigen is a membrane glycoprotein of T lymphocytes that interacts with major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and is also a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus. The extracellular portion of CD4 is predicted to fold into four immunoglobulin-like domains. The crystal structure of the third and fourth domains of rat CD4 was solved at 2.8 angstrom resolution and shows that both domains have immunoglobulin folds. Domain 3, however, lacks the disulfide between the beta sheets; this results in an expansion of the domain. There is a difference of 30 degrees in the orientation between domains 3 and 4 when compared with domains 1 and 2. The two CD4 fragment structures provide a basis from which models of the overall receptor can be proposed. These models suggest an extended structure comprising two rigid portions joined by a short and possibly flexible linker region."
https://openalex.org/W1568777255,"We have developed a transient transfection method to measure protein secretion from non-dividing, primary bovine chromaffin cells and from the continuous cell line, PC12. A plasmid coding human growth hormone (GH) was expressed in sufficient amounts in bovine chromaffin and PC12 cells to allow precise measurements of secretion from the small fraction (less than 1%) of transfected cells in a dish. GH was secreted in a similar proportion to endogenous catecholamine upon nicotinic stimulation, depolarization with elevated K+, and upon permeabilization with digitonin and subsequent stimulation with micromolar Ca2+. GH in homogenates from GH-transfected chromaffin cells cosedimented with catecholamine on discontinuous sucrose gradients. The data indicate that transiently expressed human GH in chromaffin and PC12 cells is localized predominantly in secretory vesicles in the regulated secretory pathway. With transient transfection there is a high probability of coexpression in the same cell of two plasmids which are cotransfected. Coexpression of a plasmid for GH and a plasmid for the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor, GluR1, created chromaffin cells in which Ca(2+)-dependent GH secretion could be stimulated by the glutamatergic agonist kainate. The ability to coexpress a plasmid of interest with a plasmid for GH will allow the investigation of the role of other cloned proteins in the regulated secretory pathway in differentiated, non-dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075845834,"Guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are key elements in transmembrane signaling and have been implicated as regulators of more complex biological processes such as differentiation and development. The G protein Gαi2 is capable of mediating the inhibitory control of adenylylcyclase and regulates stem cell differentiation to primitive endoderm. Here an antisense RNA to Gαi2 was expressed in a hybrid RNA construct whose expression was both tissue-specific and induced at birth. Transgenic mice in which the antisense construct was expressed displayed a lack of normal development in targeted organs that correlated with the absence of Gαi2. The loss of Gαi2 expression in adipose tissue of the transgenic mice was correlated with a rise in basal levels of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and the loss of receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylylcyclase. These data expand our understanding of G protein function in vivo and demonstrate the necessity for Gαi2 in the development of liver and fat."
https://openalex.org/W1607456835,"Abstract Deoxyoligonucleotide 49-mers containing a central cis-syn, trans-syn-I, (6-4), or Dewar photoproduct of TpT were constructed for use in repair and replication studies by ligation of shorter photoproduct-containing oligonucleotides. A (6-4) product-containing 6-mer was prepared in 3.4% yield by 254 nm irradiation of d(AATTAA) and converted in nearly quantitative yield to the Dewar isomer by irradiation with Pyrex- and Mylar-filtered medium-pressure mercury arc light. d(CGAATTAAGC) containing a site-specific cis-syn or trans-syn-I dimer was prepared via automated solid-phase DNA synthesis utilizing photoproduct building blocks. The photoproduct-containing 49-mers were characterized by their susceptibility to base cleavage and a number of enzymes routinely used to map the sites of DNA photoproduct formation. 1 M piperidine at 90 degrees C cleaved the Dewar product faster than the (6-4) product, but did not cleave the cyclobutane dimers. The 3'-->5' exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase was completely blocked by all the lesions except the (6-4) product, which it slowly bypassed. T4 endonuclease V did not cleave the (6-4) or Dewar photoproduct, but unexpectedly cleaved the trans-syn-I dimer at most 1% the rate of the cis-syn dimer in double-stranded DNA. The trans-syn-I dimer was cleaved at a 50-fold higher rate in double- than in single-stranded DNA. Escherichia coli photolyase was found to be specific for the cis-syn dimer at low concentrations. Implications of this work to methodology for mapping and quantifying DNA photoproducts are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515848954,"Expression in mouse cells of the cloned human IFN alpha receptor (IFN alpha R) subunit selectively confers response and binding to human IFN alpha 8, indicating that other subunits are involved in IFN alpha binding. We report here that a new monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed IFNaR beta 1, recognizes a novel IFN alpha R subunit different from the one recently cloned and distinct from the alpha subunit recognized by the IFN alpha R3 mAb. The IFNaR beta 1 mAb blocks the biological effect of seven different Type I IFNs. Immunoprecipitations after cell surface iodination demonstrate that the IFNaR beta 1 mAb recognizes a protein with a molecular mass of 100 kDa in Daudi and U-266 cells that express normal IFN alpha R. However, a 55-kDa protein instead of the 100-kDa product was immunoprecipitated in the IFN alpha-resistant U-937 cell line that express the variant form of the receptor. We also demonstrate that the gene that codes for this novel IFN alpha R subunit maps to human chromosome 21, as do the cloned IFN alpha R subunit and the alpha subunit, indicating the existence of a locus on this chromosome that regulates binding for Type I IFNs."
https://openalex.org/W1561391029,"Recombinant nidogen fragments comprising the globular domains G1 plus G2, the rod-like domain, and the rod connected to the globe G3 were prepared from the culture media of transfected human cell clones. In addition, domains G1 and G2 were separated from each other after cleavage with chymotrypsin. The purified fragments were characterized by N-terminal sequences, electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and radioimmunoassays and the cell clones by Northern hybridization. Transfection with a construct comprising a large part of domain G3 showed high mRNA levels but no secreted protein, indicating a protein folding problem. All these fragments were used as soluble and/or immobilized ligands in binding assays. This demonstrated major binding sites on domain G2 for collagen IV and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Affinity chromatography on zinc- and cobalt-loaded columns showed binding of domains G2 and G3 and the rod. Protein binding, but not metal binding, was abolished by reduction and alkylation of nidogen. This allowed for the isolation of several zinc-binding tryptic peptides, four from G2, two from the rod, and one from the G3 domain. Most of these short peptides contained several histidines that are likely to mediate binding. Zinc inhibited efficiently G3-mediated nidogen binding to laminin at 4 degrees C (IC50 approximately 5 microM) but less at higher temperatures. Similarly, zinc inhibited binding to collagen IV and proteoglycan at low temperatures but not at high (37 degrees C) temperatures. This indicates a complex modulation of nidogen binding to other basement membrane proteins by some, but not all, transition metals. Whether the particularly striking effects shown for zinc are of biological relevance remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1580635092,"Five site-directed mutations were introduced at the most conserved amino acids in region I (YGDTDS) of the human DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit. Mutant proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system by an improved method and purified by a rapid one-step purification in high yield and high specific activity. The Asp1004 to Asn mutation produced a protein with no detectable polymerase activity while other mutations gave activities from 1 to 20% of the wild type polymerase activity. Steady state kinetic analysis of the active mutants indicates that none of the mutations caused a change in Km(dNTP) or KD(DNA), but all active mutants showed a decrease in kcat. Thus, the effect of these conserved mutations is manifest in altered rates of catalysis. Two mutations, Asp1002 to Asn and Thr1003 to Ser, caused the enzyme to utilize Mn2+ more effectively in catalysis than Mg2+, suggesting that these amino acids are involved in metal binding. Rates of catalysis by the D1002N and T1003S mutants, as well as Y1000F mutant were improved 80-, 30-, and 70-fold, respectively, on homopolymer templates when Mn2+ replaced Mg2+ as the activator metal. The results from these mutational studies suggest that this highly conserved region binds the metal which is essential for catalysis. The Asp1002 may participate directly in chelating the metal. Results from the T1003S mutant suggest that the beta-methyl group of the threonine side chain might be locked in a hydrophobic pocket preventing free rotation around the C alpha-C beta bond, thus positioning the Thr1003 hydroxyl group to form a crucial bond with the metal ion. In addition, D1002N and T1003S displayed a 20-fold resistance to aphidicolin compared to the wild type polymerase alpha, and all of the active mutants displayed altered sensitivity to butylphenyl-dGTP. Models of the involvement of region I in catalysis and aphidicolin interaction are proposed. The mutational studies presented in this report will serve as a prototype for the functional role of region I in catalysis for all alpha-like DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1975170174,HIV and AIDS are present in countries around the globe. The incidence of HIV infection increases in Latin America and the Caribbean North Africa and the Middle East eastern Europe and Asia despite the research communitys comparatively extensive knowledge on HIV and the existence of methods of proven efficacy for preventing its transmission. The majority of the estimated 13 million individuals infected with HIV as of mid-1993 acquired it through heterosexual intercourse. Since HIV is essentially a sexually transmitted disease (STD) which can also be transmitted through blood and perinatally slowing its transmission through sexual routes will curb the AIDS pandemic. Vaccines are being developed which may eventually be capable of preventing HIV transmission. A safe and effective vaccine should not however be expected to reach the market until the end of the decade and it will not be 100% effective. A vaccine should thus be considered complementary to other prevention methods. Research must continue in a multidisciplinary multicultural and multinational cooperative fashion toward the development of a vaccine appropriate for the needs of developing countries yet with considerable priority given to the following: development of a vaginal microbicide; improving the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and immune response; improving approaches to the care of STDs; and finding better ways to encourage people to adopt and sustain personally appropriate forms of low-risk behavior. Great effort must also be made to confront the stigma denial and taboo associated with AIDS and especially accept and understand the fact that children and adolescents are experiencing sexual intercourse at ever younger ages; abstinence is not a viable alternative for most. These youths need to know that nonpenetrative sex does not transmit HIV and that condoms significantly reduce the risk of infection. Scientists are well placed to promote this plan of action both domestically and abroad.
https://openalex.org/W1598256573,"The subcellular site of xylosylation, the first carbohydrate modification of the core protein that initiates glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis, was characterized in situ. Methods were developed to combine electron microscopic (EM) autoradiography and the radiolabeling of semi-intact chondrocytes. In the accompanying paper, Kearns et al. (Kearns, A. E., Vertel, B. M., and Schwartz, N. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11097-11104) presented biochemical and subcellular fractionation studies that utilized semi-intact chondrocytes and radiolabeled UDP sugars to overcome obstacles to the direct analysis of xylosylation. The results suggested that xylosylation begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and continues in the Golgi. The site of xylosylation was not specified further due to the limitations of subcellular fractionation techniques. The studies described in this report were undertaken to localize these modifications directly in situ. Semi-intact cell preparations were optimized for ultrastructural preservation by modifications of permeabilization methods utilizing nitrocellulose filter overlays. Biochemical analysis demonstrated the exclusive incorporation of UDP-xylose into the cartilage chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (aggrecan) core protein and 3‘-phosphoadenosine 5‘-phosphosulfate (PAPS) into the highly modified proteoglycan monomer. Immunolocalization studies showed the equivalence of cytoplasmic subcompartments in normal and semi-intact chondrocytes at the levels of light and electron microscopy. Once the biochemical and morphological equivalence of intact and semi-intact cells was established, EM autoradiographic studies were pursued using UDP-[3H]xylose and [35S]PAPS. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data, silver grains resulting from incorporated sulfate were concentrated in the perinuclear Golgi, while those resulting from incorporated xylose were found at the cis or forming face of the Golgi and in vesicular regions of the peripheral cytoplasm associated with the late ER. These data support the view that xylose addition begins in a late ER compartment and continues in intermediate compartments, perhaps including the cis-Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1526474070,"In order to define the location and organization of the numerous reactions involved in polysaccharide assembly during synthesis of proteoglycans and glycoproteins, the topography of some of the glycosylation reactions in chondroitin sulfate synthesis was examined using a relatively new technique for generating permeable cells. Permeable chondrocytes were shown to directly take up nucleotide sugar precursors and incorporate them into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), allowing specific labeling at each step in chondroitin sulfate synthesis. Subcellular fractionation following labeling with UDP-[14C]xylose, UDP-[14C]galactose, UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid, or [35S]PAPS localized the labeled CSPG to the compartment where each glycosylation reaction occurred. From these experiments it appears that xylose addition begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues in the Golgi apparatus where galactose, glucuronic acid, and sulfate are added. This conclusion was confirmed by direct visualization of xylose incorporation using electron microscopic autoradiography (Vertel, B. M., Walters, L. M., Flay, N., Kearns, A. E., and Schwartz, N. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11105-11112). Further examination of xylose addition showed that permeable chondrocytes can utilize both exogenous UDP-xylose transported into the lumen and UDP-xylose generated from UDP-glucuronic acid within the lumen. The enzyme responsible for this reaction, UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase, co-localized with xylosyltransferase activity in subcellular fractions. Orientation toward the lumen in subcellular compartments was determined by trypsin sensitivity in the permeable chondrocytes. Therefore, we conclude that UDP-xylose can be produced in the lumen of the compartment where it is utilized in CSPG synthesis, obviating the need for a direct transport mechanism for this nucleotide sugar and providing close regulation of UDP-xylose and UDP-glucuronic acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W1897003623,"The three-dimensional structures of bovine plasma retinol-binding protein (bRBP) complexed with retinol (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 46.08, b = 49.12, c = 76.10 A) and of the unliganded protein prepared in vitro by extracting retinol with ethyl ether (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 46.55, b = 48.97, c = 76.87 A) have been solved at 1.9 and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. The final crystallographic R factors are 0.190 for holobRBP and 0.196 for the unliganded bRBP. The model for the bovine holoprotein is quite similar to that of the human protein, with which it exhibits 92% sequence similarity. The root mean square deviation between the alpha-carbons in the two proteins is 0.31 A. The retinol binding site is almost completely preserved. The loops that surround the opening of the beta-barrel are also particularly conserved, in contrast with the presence of several substitutions in parts of the RBP molecule opposite the opening of the calyx that binds retinol. Despite the fact that unliganded bovine RBP was prepared and crystallized using procedures completely different from those used to obtain the unliganded human RBP, the conformational differences between unliganded and liganded forms of bRBP are almost identical to those found previously between the same forms of human RBP. They mainly involve a few residues in the region extending from amino acid residues 32 to 37. Therefore, similar differences are very likely to exist between holoRBP and the physiologically occurring apoprotein. A not yet identified electron density, different in shape and orientation from retinol, also occupies the central cavity of the beta-barrel in the unliganded bRBP, as found for unliganded human RBP. The functional consequences of the conformational change induced by the removal of retinol on the interaction between RBP and transthyretin, coupled with the conservation of the entrance loops of the beta-barrel in mammalian RBPs, are consistent with their participation in molecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1576895396,"Ras GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) contain an invariant motif, -FLR-, within the most conserved region of their catalytic domains. Certain mutations in this motif have greatly reduced activity (Skinner, R. H., Bradley, S., Brown, A. L., Johnson, N. J., Rhodes, S., Stammers, D. K., and Lowe, P. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14163-14166), but it was not determined whether the reduced activity was due to loss of binding or impaired catalysis. In order to address this question, we have developed a simple physical method to study formation of GAP.p21ras complexes. This utilizes the increase of fluorescence anisotropy upon binding of GAP to p21ras complexed with 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (mant) derivatives of guanine nucleotides. Dissociation constants obtained for the catalytic domains of either p120-GAP (GAP-344) or neurofibromin (NF1-GRD) with normal and Leu-61 p21ras proteins are comparable with those obtained by kinetic methods. In the course of these studies, we found, in contrast to previous observations, that both GAP and NF1-GRD can weakly activate the GTPase of Leu-61 mutant p21, showing that Gln-61 is not absolutely required for the stimulation of GTPase activity by GAPs. The fluorescence anisotropy method allowed us to show that mutation of Arg-903, within the FLR motif of GAP, can result in protein defective in catalysis but not in binding to p21ras. These data suggest a direct role for this residue in catalyzing GTP hydrolysis on p21ras, possibly by contributing a catalytic group to the p21 active site. This method is independent of the catalytic activity of the proteins, and so it could be extended generally to the measurement of binding of effector molecules, exchange factors, or other macromolecules to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1672440999,"Abstract H+ and Mg2+ are known to inhibit Ca2+ binding to the transport sites of sarcoplasmic reticulum-ATPase. Evaluation of the affinity for the Ca2+ binding sites requires measurement of the amount of Ca2+ bound to ATPase as a function of the free Ca2+ concentration imposed by a Ca2+ chelator. The choice of the chelator is crucial as it determines the accuracy of the free Ca2+ concentration. At pH > 7, the EGTA affinity for Ca2+ is higher than that of ATPase, inducing artifacts that alter the shape of the binding curves. Thus, we have used 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), whose affinity is unchanged at pH > or = 7. Ca2+ binding was studied at equilibrium, from pH 6 to pH 8 and from 0 to 10 mM Mg2+, using EGTA and/or BAPTA and [45Ca]Ca2+. Under all conditions, the stoichiometry was 2 Ca2+/ATPase. At variance with previous studies, the Hill coefficient was 1.1-2 and higher at pH 6 than at pH 8. In addition, it decreased in the presence of Mg2+. The Ca2+ binding curves were analyzed according to a model in which they result from a sequential binding of two Ca2+, each binding step being modified by H+ and Mg2+. The effect of H+ is described by two steps involving two H+ and one H+, with pK 7 and 7.9, respectively. At pH 6, ATPase must lose two H+ for the first Ca2+ to bind and a third H+ for the second Ca2+ to bind. At pH 9, both Ca2+ bind without any H+ exchange. Mg2+ can bind to all species, except to that saturated with Ca2+. The species having lost two H+ has a higher affinity for Mg2+ (< or = 1 mM) than the species having bound three H+ (4 mM). The above model allows us to analyze the effects of H+ and Mg2+ at each Ca2+ binding step and to explain the changes in the apparent affinity and cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1479664019,"Bacterial luciferase is a heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of reduced FMN, O2 and an aliphatic aldehyde to yield the carboxylic acid and an excited flavin that emits blue-green light upon return to ground state. The two subunits of the luciferase from Vibrio harveyi, alpha and beta, have molecular weights of 40,108 and 36.349, respectively; the single active center resides primarily, if not exclusively, on the alpha subunit. We have found that bacterial luciferase can be unfolded in urea-containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and refolded by dilution of the urea with final luciferase concentrations of 5-25 micrograms/ml. We have analyzed the urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of bacterial luciferase by monitoring changes in both the far ultraviolet circular dichroism (predominantly secondary structure) and intrinsic fluorescence emission (predominantly tertiary structure) resulting from incubation in various concentrations of urea at 18 degrees C for 18-24 h. Both spectral methods indicated a biphasic unfolding transition; the first phase was protein concentration-independent, whereas the second phase was protein concentration-dependent. Equilibrium unfolding curves showed an increase in fluorescence up to 2 M urea followed by a decrease in intensity and red shift of the emission maximum. The ratio of the fluorescence emission in the presence of 2 M urea relative to that in the absence of urea was greater when fluorescence was excited at 295 nm than at 280 nm. The fluorescence increase in the 0-2 M urea range corresponded to the first phase of the biphasic unfolding process. The urea-induced loss of luciferase enzymatic activity appeared to correspond to the first transition observed with the spectroscopic methods, and likewise to be protein concentration-independent. These observations suggested a three-state unfolding mechanism in which the native heterodimeric enzyme rearranges to an inactive heterodimeric species that is well populated, followed by dissociation and unfolding of the alpha and beta subunits. The data were fit to a three-state mechanism using a nonlinear least squares method. At 18 degrees C in 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, the free energy change for the interconversion of the active heterodimer and the inactive heterodimeric species was estimated to be 4.52 +/- 0.30 kcal/mol; the free energy change for the interconversion of the inactive heterodimer and the individual subunits was 19.7 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1607652069,"The molecular mechanisms of depolarization-induced calcium-dependent acetylcholine (ACh) release and its inhibition by botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoTx) are not clear. We studied these mechanisms in an in vitro cholinergic neuronal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line model. Cultured monolayer PC12 cells were differentiated by treatment with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) for 4 days to enhance cellular ACh synthesis and release. Stimulation of these cells with high K+ (80 mM) in the perfusion medium caused a marked increase (three to four times) in [3H]ACh release in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. K(+)-stimulated [3H]ACh release was totally inhibited by pretreatment of cells with BoTx (2 nM) for 2 h. High K+ also stimulated the release of arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) from the cell membrane, which was inhibited by BoTx (2 nM). Addition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors (quinacrine, 4-bromophenacyl bromide, manoalide) to the perfusion medium inhibited K(+)-stimulated [3H]ACh and [3H]AA release in a dose-dependent manner. Inclusion of exogenous AA, the PLA2 activator melittin, or PLA2 itself prevented the effect of BoTx. These results demonstrate that in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, AA release is associated with ACh release, BoTx inhibits both processes, and increased AA can protect against BoTx."

CDh bound tropomyosin with a Kd of 1.5 microM; N578, 230-419, and 606C bound with affinities at least 2-5 fold lower; N128 bound weakly; and 658C did not bind. Only N128 and N578 bound to smooth muscle myosin, both about 10-fold weaker than CDh and CDl. Only 606C and 658C bound to actin-tropomyosin with affinities CDh = 606C > 658C. The binding to actin-tropomyosin was biphasic, whereas the binding to actin was monophasic, corresponding to the weak binding component found in the presence of tropomyosin. Calmodulin bound only to the C-terminal fragments with the same affinity as CDh. CDh, 606C, and 658C inhibited actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase, with maximal inhibition correlated with 1 caldesmon bound/14 actins, and inhibition was reversed by Ca(2+)-calmodulin. Thus, the actomyosin ATPase regulatory function, calmodulin binding, and most actin binding is located within the C-terminal 99 amino acids, whereas tropomyosin binding is distributed throughout the rest of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1609895380,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins initially identified by their ability to enhance in vitro cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and subsequently shown to participate in vesicular transport in the Golgi and other cellular compartments. By cDNA and genomic cloning, at least six mammalian ARFs were identified. Brefeldin A (BFA) disrupts Golgi membranes and inhibits binding of soluble high molecular weight proteins to Golgi fractions. We examined the effects of BFA on binding of ARF1, -3, and -5 to a Golgi fraction in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and a fraction of soluble, high molecular weight, accessory proteins (SAP), presumably containing complexes identified by others as coatomers that are involved in vesicular transport. ARF binding in all instances was dependent on guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and increased by the ATP-regenerating system. Binding of ARF1 and -3, but not ARF5, was enhanced by SAP. BFA inhibited the SAP-dependent, but not the SAP-independent, binding of ARF1 and -3. It had no effect on the increment in binding produced by an ATP-regenerating system. B36, an inactive derivative of BFA, did not inhibit SAP-dependent binding of ARF1 and -3. Binding of ARF5, which was SAP-independent, was not affected by BFA. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that mammalian ARFs differ in their dependence on accessory proteins for interaction with Golgi and, perhaps, other cellular membranes and that BFA specifically inhibits SAP-dependent ARF binding."
https://openalex.org/W2114275322,"Bacterial luciferase is an alpha beta heterodimer with a single active center in which the reaction of reduced FMN, O2, and an aliphatic aldehyde yields a photon of blue-green light. We have shown that refolding of the luciferase subunits from 5 M urea occurs via the intermediacy of several species, one of which is an inactive heterodimeric structure, resulting from the dimerization of alpha and beta, which isomerizes to the active alpha beta structure in a first-order reaction (Ziegler, M. M., Goldberg, M. E., Chaffotte, A. F., and Baldwin, T. O. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10760-10765). We have also demonstrated the existence of an inactive heterodimeric species that is well populated at equilibrium in the presence of 1.6-2.8 M urea (Clark, A. C., Sinclair, J. F., and Baldwin, T. O. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10773-10779). We have separated the alpha and beta subunits by ion exchange chromatography and investigated the effects on reformation of active luciferase of allowing the individual subunits to refold separately prior to mixing. These investigations show that the lag in formation of active luciferase is due to slow steps in folding of the individual subunits. The beta subunit appears to fold faster than the alpha subunit, but folding of the beta subunit also shows a distinct lag. When the alpha and beta subunits were allowed to refold from urea for periods of several hours or more prior to mixing, the yield of active heterodimeric luciferase was compromised, which is consistent with the finding that individual subunits produced in vivo fold into structures incompetent to interact with each other to form the active heterodimer (Waddle, J. J., Johnston, T. C., and Baldwin, T. O. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4917-4921). It appeared that the rate with which the beta subunit assumed the heterodimerization-incompetent structure was faster than the rate with which the alpha subunit became heterodimerization-incompetent. These observations support a model for folding and assembly of the subunits of luciferase in which the two subunits fold into assembly-competent structures that associate to form the heterodimer. In a slow competing process, the subunits undergo a conformational rearrangement to form stable structures incompetent to form heterodimers. It appears that the association of the luciferase subunits might constitute an example of one polypeptide modifying the folding pathway of another, a model that is consistent with the suggestion that the formation of the heterodimeric structure of luciferase is a kinetic trap on the folding pathway of the individual subunits (Sugihara, J., and Baldwin, T. O. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2872-2880)."
https://openalex.org/W1541441966,"In addition to reducing hemoglobin-O2 affinity, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) is known to modulate the mechanical properties of the erythrocyte membrane. By fluorescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we demonstrate that DPG binds the cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte membrane band 3 in two stages characterized by apparent KD values of approximately approximately 2 and 12 mM. DPG was also shown to perturb the stability of ankyrin, protein 4.1, and protein 4.2 in situ and to directly bind to protein 4.1. In studies of membrane-skeleton interactions, DPG was observed to inhibit the fast and slow phases of ankyrin binding to band 3 and to reduce both the number of ankyrin sites and affinity of ankyrin for each class of site. The inhibition was biphasic, similar to the band 3-DPG binding isotherm; however, at physiological DPG concentrations a reduction in only 15% of the ankyrin sites was observed. In contrast, inhibition of protein 4.1 binding to the membrane reached 65% at physiological DPG concentrations (approximately approximately 5.9 mM); at more elevated concentrations, blockade was nearly quantitative, affecting glycophorin and band 3 sites alike. Taken together with previous observations, these data suggest that DPG's effect on O2 delivery may extend beyond its well recognized impact on hemoglobin-O2 affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1491751291,"Conditions have been established that allow reversible refolding of luciferase from 5 M urea. The kinetics of formation of the active enzyme showed a concentration-independent lag, suggesting the existence of intermediate structures on the pathway of refolding. The rate of approach to the final level of activity was strongly concentration-dependent at protein concentrations below 10 micrograms/ml, but at concentrations above about 20 micrograms/ml, the rate of approach to the final activity value did not change with concentration. The concentration dependence presumably reflects the second-order step yielding the heterodimeric structure. The finding that at concentrations above 20 micrograms/ml, the rate becomes insensitive to concentration suggests that under these conditions, some step subsequent to dimerization become rate-limiting. When the refolding reaction was initiated by dilution out of 5 M urea at 50 micrograms/ml followed at various times by a secondary dilution to a final concentration of 5 micrograms/ml, it was found that the increase in activity continued at the rate characteristic of the higher protein concentration for a period of about 1-2 min following the dilution before slowing to the rate expected for the lower protein concentration. These observations indicate that there are inactive heterodimeric species that form from assembly of the individual subunits and that these species must undergo further folding to yield the active heterodimeric species. At protein concentrations of 5-50 micrograms/ml, the final yield of active enzyme was about 65-85%, decreasing at higher and lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, aggregation probably accounts for the limit in recovery, whereas at lower concentrations, it appears that the reduced yield of activity is due to the competing process of the folding of one or both individual subunits into some form incompetent to interact with each other. These experiments demonstrate the existence of slow steps in the refolding of luciferase subunits from urea and the formation of the active heterodimeric structure, both preceding and following the dimerization. Furthermore, the failure of protein at low concentrations to efficiently reassemble into the active heterodimer is consistent with the prior finding that luciferase subunits produced independently in Escherichia coli fold into conformations that cannot interact to form the active heterodimer upin mixing (Waddle, J. J., Johnston, T. C., and Baldwin, T. O. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4917-4921)."
https://openalex.org/W1530720426,"Glutathione is excreted into bile via a low affinity, electrogenic, ATP-independent transport system which is cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated by certain organic anions (Fernandez-Checa, J. C., Takikawa, H., Horie, T., Ookhtens, M., and Kaplowitz N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1667-1673). This transport system differs from the sinusoidal carrier in several respects, such as affinity for transport and inhibitor specificity. Another differential aspect is the selective increase by phenobarbital pretreatment of GSH excretion into bile without changing the sinusoidal release into blood. To determine if phenobarbital induces the GSH transporter in the canalicular membrane and if this is reflected in the induction of organic anion transport, we have used rat liver canalicular (cLPM) and sinusoidal (bLPM) enriched membrane vesicles from liver of control (saline) and phenobarbital-treated rats. cLPM vesicles prepared from phenobarbital-pretreated rats exhibited a significant, 46% increase in Vmax for transport (9.02 +/- 0.3 versus 6.17 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg/15 s) without a change in the Km for GSH transport (14.0 +/- 1.1 versus 16.7 +/- 2.7 mM, respectively). Kinetic parameters for GSH transport in bLPM vesicles remained unchanged after phenobarbital treatment versus control (Vmax, 4.67 +/- 0.2 versus 4.77 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg/15 s; Km, 7.79 +/- 0.8 versus 6.95 +/- 0.8 mM, respectively). Phenobarbital treatment increased the electrogenic transport of [35S]sulfobromophthalein (BSP) (5 and 50 microM) but not the electrogenic uptake of [14C] glycocholic acid (10 and 200 microM). In addition, the ATP-dependent transport of [35S]BSP, [3H]leukotriene C4, and [14C]glycocholic acid into cLPM vesicles was not altered by phenobarbital treatment. The ATP-independent transport of [35S]BSP in cLPM was cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated by GSH, supporting the view that BSP and GSH share a common multispecific transporter. Thus, among the various canalicular transport systems, the multispecific electrogenic organic anion and GSH transport system is selectively induced by phenobarbital treatment."

Under control conditions, tetanic stimulation of glutamatergic corticostriatal terminals caused long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic potentials. Acute lithium treatment did not affect the peak of the induction phase, but it reduced the following phases of LTD. LTD was completely blocked in slices obtained from rats chronically injected with LiCl. Lithium treatment failed to affect the intrinsic membrane properties of striatal neurons and the presynaptic inhibitory effects of carbachol and t-ACPD. We suggest that the lithium-induced blockade of LTD may contribute to the therapeutic action of lithium salts in mania and depression."
https://openalex.org/W1590160734,"The experiments reported in the present paper were designed to check the model proposed for Ca2+ binding in the preceding paper (Forge, V., Mintz, E., and Guillain, F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10953-10960). The pH dependence of the Mg(2+)-induced variation of the intrinsic fluorescence, as well as that of the phosphorylation by Pi, confirmed that there are several species of Ca(2+)-deprived ATPase. Kinetics of Ca2+ binding as a function of pH suggested that the deprotonated form of the ATPase binds Ca2+ rapidly (k > 50 s-1), whereas the protonated forms bind Ca2+ slowly (1.3-2.7 s-1). At variance with other models which are linear, slow and rapid Ca2+ binding take two different routes, and intermediate pH values and Mg2+, which favors the deprotonated forms, result in biphasic kinetics. Mg2+ binds to all Ca(2+)-deprived species and to species having one bound Ca2+ but does not bind to ECa2. This is the reason why Mg2+ inhibits Ca2+ binding, and this inhibition is removed in the presence of adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) which drives Mg2+ into the catalytic site."

Conditions are described for the formation and characterization of 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-27-al as an enzymatically generated intermediate in the oxidation process. Incubation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol or 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,27-tetrol with sterol 27-hydroxylase in 18O2 atmosphere resulted in the incorporation of one or two 18O atoms in the carboxyl group of 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid. Similar incubations with 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-27-al resulted in the incorporation of one 18O atom in the 27-carboxyl group.

https://openalex.org/W1550837995,"Mannosamine (ManN) has been reported to inhibit the formation of Man alpha-1,2Man linkages and to prevent the anchoring of membrane proteins by glycoinositol phospholipids (GPIs). In this paper, the effect of ManN on the synthesis of putative GPI anchor precursors in mammalian cells was studied. Three different cell lines were analyzed: HeLa cells and Thy-1 negative lymphoma mutants B and F that accumulate two-mannosyl GPI (Man2GPI) and three-mannosyl GPI (Man3GPI) species, respectively. ManN did not alter the incorporation of [3H]Man into the Man2GPI in mutant B cells. However, when either HeLa cells or mutant F cells were labeled with [3H]Man in the presence of ManN, [3H]Man incorporation into Man3GPi species was blocked and the TLC profile of [3H]Man-labeled glycolipids resembled that obtained with mutant B cells. Further characterization of the predominant labeled glycolipid that accumulated in ManN-treated HeLa cells by enzymatic and chromatographic criteria and permethylation analysis confirmed the structure as a Man2GPI indistinguishable from the Man2GPI that accumulates in mutant B cells. Based on previous reports that ManN inhibits Man alpha-1,2Man linkage formation and that in GPI-anchored proteins the third Man residue is attached by a Man alpha-1,2Man linkage, these results indicate that the third Man residue that distinguishes the putative Man2GPI precursor from the Man3GPI precursor also is attached by a Man alpha-1,2Man linkage. Furthermore, the observation that Man2GPI rather than a new GPI species containing ManN accumulated during ManN treatment revealed that the mechanism of ManN inhibition primarily involved inhibition of an alpha 1,2-mannosyltransferase rather than incorporation of ManN into an aberrant GPI species."
https://openalex.org/W1597537678,"The kinetic mechanism of alanine dehydrogenase from soybean nodule bacteroids was studied by initial velocity experiments with or without product inhibitors, dead-end inhibitors, or alternate substrates. Without inhibitors, double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity experiments showed intersecting lines, indicating a sequential mechanism. These initial velocity experiments also revealed rapid-equilibrium ordered binding of NH4+ prior to pyruvate. When NAD was varied at changing-fixed concentrations of L-alanine, a nonlinear, concave down double-reciprocal plot was obtained. Substrate inhibition by pyruvate or L-alanine with cosubstrates varied was uncompetitive giving further support to an ordered mechanism. Product inhibition studies showed that both NAD and NADH and pyruvate and L-alanine were competitive. This suggested a Theorell-Chance mechanism. When product inhibition by L-alanine was studied with NH4+ varied in a series of experiments at increasing concentrations of pyruvate, the inhibition was eliminated, as expected for a Theorell-Chance mechanism. Furthermore, when NADH, NH4+, and pyruvate were varied simultaneously, maintaining their concentrations at a constant ratio to each other, an infinite Vmax was obtained. pH studies of the kinetic parameters indicated that NH4+, rather than NH3, was the true substrate that binds to a residue on the enzyme with a pK of 8.1. In conclusion, the kinetic mechanism at pH 8.5 was determined to be a Ter-Bi Theorell-Chance. In the amination direction, the substrates add in the order: NADH, NH4+, pyruvate, with NH4+ binding in rapid-equilibrium. In the reverse direction, NAD adds first, followed by L-alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1529032532,"In pancreatic islets stimulated with carbamylcholine (carbachol), hydrolysis of both phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (Ptd-InsP2) occurs and can be measured as the inositol monophosphates Ins(1)P1, or Ins(4)P1, respectively (Biden, T. J., Prugue, M. L., and Davison, A. G. M. (1992) Biochem. J. 285, 541-549). Our current aim was to establish whether these two events were independently regulated. Rats islets were labeled with either [3H]inositol or [3H]arachidonic acid for measurement of InsP1s by high performance liquid chromatography or diacylglycerol by TLC, respectively. The rise in Ins(1)P1 due to carbachol (1 min) was inhibited by 50% by concomitantly raising extracellular KCl ([K+]e) from 6 to 30 mM, thereby depolarizing the islets. Similar results, obtained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, exclude the involvement of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Conversely, hyperpolarization, by lowering [K+]e to 3 mM, increased by 30% the rise in Ins(1)P1. In fact, over the [K+]e range of 3 to 48 mM, stimulated Ins(1)P1 accumulation was directly proportional to the calculated membrane potential. In contrast, raising [K+]e from 6 to 48 mM exerted no significant effect on carbachol-stimulated Ins(4)P1 levels, and both Ins(1)P1 and Ins(4)P1 were unaffected in the absence of carbachol. The rises in Ins(1)P1 (but not Ins(4)P1) were also inhibited by depolarization with the sodium pump inhibitor, ouabain, or the K+ channel blocker, tolbutamide. Stimulated diacylglycerol accumulation and insulin secretion (20 min) showed a biphasic dependency on [K+]e, being less pronounced at 6 mM than at either 3 or 30 mM KCl. This reflects a selective potentiation of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 hydrolysis, due, respectively, to hyperpolarization and the gating of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The differential regulation of these two hydrolytic events is probably important for independent control of the activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+ mobilization and might play a role in modulating the secretory response in vivo."

Treatment of the cells with 0.5-4 microM A23187 or 1-4 microM ionomycin induced a concentration-dependent decrease in c-myb mRNA; this decrease was abolished by EGTA. c-myc mRNA levels were only moderately affected. After 12-24 h of calcium ionophore exposure, c-myb mRNA returned to pretreatment levels. No similar decrease in c-myb mRNA was seen with the sodium ionophore monensin (up to 16 microM). The dimethyl sulfoxide-induced suppression of c-myb and also of c-myc mRNA levels was not prevented in Ca(2+)-free medium and thus appeared Ca(2+)-independent. A23187 and ionomycin were capable of inducing beta-globin mRNA synthesis in F4-6 cells. Prolonged calcium ionophore exposure, however, strongly reduced cell viability and resulted only in a slight hemoglobin increase at lower concentrations. These results suggest that a rise in [Ca2+]i may be a signal leading to a transient decrease in c-myb mRNA and the initiation of erythroid differentiation in Friend cells. The transient suppression of c-myb mRNA levels represents a common feature of the action of dimethyl sulfoxide and calcium ionophores."

Irreversible biscarbethoxylation of the His-15 imidazole ring by DEPC was observed when lysozyme was pretreated with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 2-ME plus 8 M urea, or 2-ME plus 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Circular dichroism difference spectra were measured for the mono-N-carbethoxyimidazole derivatives of lysozyme, N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine, angiotensin-II, and O-carbethoxy-N alpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine. The circular dichroism difference spectrum for mono-N-carbethoxy lysozyme had one main band (delta [theta]244 nm = +17,000 degree. cm2.dmol-1) in the 240-260 nm region. Denaturing mono-N-carbethoxy lysozyme with 2-ME and 8 M urea (55 degrees C) or 1% SDS (100 degrees C) essentially abolished its circular dichroism difference spectrum in the 240-260 nm region without any decarbethoxylation. In this same region the circular dichroism difference spectra of DEPC-modified N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine and DEPC-modified angiotensin-II had two much weaker bands (delta [theta]233 nm = +1000 degree.cm2.dmol-1 and delta[theta]252nm = -600 degree.cm2.dmol-1 for N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine). This study reports the first characterization of circular dichroism associated with mono-N-carbethoxyhistidine in an enzyme (lysozyme), a peptide (angiotensin-II), and a model compound (N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine)."
