https://openalex.org/W1571821264,"With the use of a rapid, sensitive fluorometric assay, tryptophan hydroxylase from rabbit hindbrain has been partially purified. The enzyme resembles phenylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylases in many respects. For example, the hydroxylation reaction shows an absolute requirement for a tetrahydropterin and is stimulated by reduced pyridine nucleotide, dihydropteridine reductase, and catalase. Fe2+ also stimulates the reaction but only in the absence of catalase; this finding suggests that catalase or Fe2+ protects a sensitive component of the tryptophan hydroxylation system from inactivation by H2O2. Just as with the other pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, the apparent Km of tryptophan hydroxylase for its amino acid substrate and for oxygen are markedly lower in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin than they are in the presence of the cofactor analogue, dimethyltetrahydropterin. In addition, high concentrations of tryptophan inhibit the reaction in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, but not in the presence of the dimethylpterin. The stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin has been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1483556659,"Abstract The liver microsomal hydroxylation system which metabolizes drugs and steroids was separated into fractions containing cytochrome, cytochrome reductase, and lipid, all of which are needed for maximal catalytic activity. The enzyme system isolated from rats treated with either phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene has been fractionated, and the role of the hemoprotein, lipid, and reductase fractions in influencing substrate specificity has been studied. The results obtained indicate that the specificity for hydroxylation resides primarily in the cytochrome fraction, rather than in the reductase or lipid fraction. For the hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene, the cytochrome P-448 fraction prepared from rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene was much more active than the cytochrome P-450 fraction from phenobarbital-treated rats. In contrast, the cytochrome P-450 fraction was more active than the cytochrome P-448 fraction for benzphetamine N-demethylation. For chlorcyclizine N-demethylation, the cytochrome P-448 fraction was about 60 to 70% as effective as the cytochrome P-450 fraction. Studies on the hydroxylation of testosterone in the 6β,7α, and 16α positions revealed that the cytochrome P-450 and P-448 fractions were about equally active for either testosterone 6β- or 7α-hydroxylation, whereas the cytochrome P-448 fraction was only 10 to 20% as active as the cytochrome P-450 fraction for the 16α-hydroxylation reaction. These results indicate that the cytochrome P-450 and P-448 fractions have different substrate specificities and are consistent with the view that cytochromes P-450 and P-448 are different hemoproteins. Depending on the susbtrate used, the reductase fraction may also play a role in determining substrate specificity. The reductase fraction prepared from 3-methyl-cholanthrene-treated animals was only 50 to 60% as active as the reductase fraction from phenobarbital-treated rats in supporting benzphetamine N-demethylation, while the lipid fractions from both sources were equally active. No differences between the two reductase fractions or the two lipid fractions were observed for the hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene."
https://openalex.org/W1554911791,"Abstract Rat brain tyrosine hydroxylase exists in two distinct physical forms, a soluble and a membrane-bound form. The two forms are brain-region specific, with the membrane-bound or particulate form predominating in the striatum, an area enriched in catecholamine nerve endings and associated with a specific membrane fraction. Whereas the soluble and the particulate enzymes exhibit an identical Km for the substrate tyrosine (0.055 mm), the particulate form, which can be simulated by the addition to the soluble enzyme of microgram amounts of the sulfated mucopolysaccharide heparin, has a lower Km (0.15 mm) for the synthetic co-factor 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (DMPH4) than does the soluble (0.75 mm) and a 2-fold increased apparent Vmax. The particulate enzyme also has a greater affinity for the competitive feedback inhibitors norepinephrine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine). Dopamine exhibits a greater affinity for both forms of the enzyme than norepinephrine and, in addition, dopamine but not norepinephrine induces cooperative DMPH4 kinetics in soluble but not particulate tyrosine hydroxylase. It is suggested that dopamine may be the more significant regulatory metabolite of the striatal biogenic amine biosynthetic pathway, and that tyrosine hydroxylase activity may be regulated by alterations in the physical state of the enzyme."

The special pore structures of marine invertebrate skeletal materials such as echinoid spines and corals, which are difficult or impossible to create artificially, can thus be copied in useful materials. Of immediate interest is the possibility of using these replicated microstructures in the fabrication of orthopedic prosthetic devices. By means of this technique, prosthetic materials having a controlled pore microstructure for optimum strength and tissue ingrowth may be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W76784570,"The inducible p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase of Pseudomonas fluorescens which catalyzes the conversion of p-hydroxybenzoate to protocatechuate has been obtained in crystalline form as an electrophoretically homogenous protein which is very stable in the absence of added cofactors. The molecular weight is estimated to be 65,000. The enzyme contains 1 mole of flavin adenine dinucleotide per mole of protein. In the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate the enzyme-bound flavin is rapidly reduced by TPNH, but not by DPNH or reduced acetyl pyridine nucleotide. Under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions the enzyme can catalyze the rapid reduction of ferricyanide by TPNH. This rapid reaction requires the presence of the aromatic substrate. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme in the visible region is perturbed and the fluorescence of the enzymebound flavin is quenched in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate. The binding of p-hydroxybenzoate to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase follows 1:1 binding at concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoate less than 3 x 10-4 m . At higher concentrations, deviations from 1:1 binding are observed which correspond to the excess substrate inhibition observed in steady state kinetic analysis. A substrate analogue, 6-hydroxynicotinate, activates the enzyme with respect to reduction of the enzyme-bound flavin by TPNH, but is not hydroxylated during the subsequent reoxidation by molecular oxygen. During anaerobic reduction of the enzyme in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate, two transient spectral intermediates are observable. These intermediates also occur during catalytic turnover. The intermediates are generated in sequential fashion. No electron paramagnetic resonance signals are associated with the transient spectral intermediates. The affinity of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase for TPNH is enhanced at least 9-fold by p-hydroxybenzoate. The first order rate constant for the reduction of the enzyme-bound flavin by bound TPNH (i.e. kred) is increased 40,000-fold by p-hydroxybenzoate."

https://openalex.org/W1579858516,"Abstract A flavoprotein, salicylate hydroxylase (salicylate, DPNH: oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylation, 1-decarboxylating)), has been induced and isolated from a soil bacterium grown on salicylate as sole carbon source. In contrast to a similar enzyme studied by Yamamoto, S., Katagiri, M., Maeno, H., and Hayaishi, O. ((1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 3408) this enzyme is dimeric with two subunits and two FAD per 91,000 molecular weight (rather than one FAD per 57,000). When benzoate is substituted for salicylate, DPNH is oxidized with the same Vmax as with salicylate but with higher Km for both benzoate and DPNH. With salicylate, the reaction products are catechol and H2O; with benzoate, the benzoate is unchanged, but H2O2 is formed stoichiometrically with DPNH oxidized. Both salicylate and benzoate facilitate DPNH binding. Benzoate binds at the salicylate site, competitively inhibiting salicylate hydroxylation, and permitting DPNH binding and oxidation. But since benzoate, a pseudosubstrate, cannot be hydroxylated, the oxygen utilized decomposes to H2O2, and oxygen reduction is considered as from hydroxylation. A search for possible active intermediates in the reduction of O2 to H2O2 by the uncoupled reaction has failed to yield evidence for any oxygen radical species. An examination of various substituted benzoates and salicylates has revealed a range of behavior intermediate between the substrate (salicylate) and pseudosubstrate (benzoate) modes. These compounds are hydroxylated, (in several cases more rapidly than salicylate), but some of the oxygen utilized is diverted to H2O2. These compounds are bound to enzyme with a Km higher than the inducer, salicylate, and also facilitate DPNH binding, but less effectively than does salicylate. Other properties of this enzyme, including inhibition by some monovalent anions, are described."
https://openalex.org/W95866195,"Abstract A general method is described for the quantitative determination of the binding of glycoproteins, and their enzymatically modified derivatives, to the plasma membranes of rat liver. The assay is based upon the competitive inhibition of the binding phenomenon in an operationally irreversible system. Utilizing this procedure, a quantitative estimate of the ability of the membranes to bind four normally circulating serum glycoproteins, as well as their asialo and agalacto derivatives, has been made. The results obtained extend the previous qualitative observations in vivo and provide the basis for a systematic analysis of the structural determinants involved in the binding process."
https://openalex.org/W1589377261,"Abstract Membrane vesicles of Bacillus subtilis actively transport amino acids in the presence of electron donors. The effectiveness of each physiological electron donor depends on the presence of the necessary membrane proteins that allow substrate oxidation and couple it to amino acid transport. Some of these proteins are present in all membranes while others (e.g. oxidizing glycerol phosphate) appear only in certain growth media (containing glycerol). Physiological electron donors are NADH, NADPH, l-α-glycerol phosphate, l-lactate, and succinate. NADH stimulates amino acid uptake at the highest initial rate whereas glycerol phosphate is the most effective electron donor since it energizes the transport of the largest number of amino acid molecules per nmole of substrate oxidized per min. Reduced phenazine methosulfate (PMS) is a very efficient nonphysiological electron donor which energizes amino acid transport at a high initial rate. At the membrane concentrations usually employed (1 to 5 mg of membrane protein per ml), NADH, NADPH, and reduced PMS consume oxygen so rapidly that special oxygenation is required to maintain the uptake of amino acids at a high rate. This uptake stops when the energy source has been oxidized; the accumulated amino acid then leaks out at a rate of 8% per min. With reduced (by ascorbate) PMS as electron donor, the Km and Vmax values of the uptake of 18 amino acids were determined. The Km values range from 10-5 to 10-6 m whereas the Vmax values vary widely for the different amino acids. Competition experiments have shown the presence of at least nine different amino acid transport carriers in the vesicles. The energy for active transport appears to be produced in the cytochrome-linked electron transport chain: all electron donors effective in amino acid transport cause the reduction of the membrane-bound cytochromes. The electron transport inhibitors antimycin, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, cyanide, and azide also inhibit amino acid transport, for all energy sources. Rotenone and oligomycin inhibit only the lactate-energized transport. Under conditions under which amino acids are transported no net ATP synthesis has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W1560489541,"Abstract Our studies with 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-ethanolamine and 1-akyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanol-amine, both labeled with 14C in the alkyl moiety, have shown that 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine is converted to 1-alk-1-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-ethanolamine (plasmalogen) by enzyme preparations from tumors. The conversion of the O-alkyl to O-alk-1-enyl linkage requires molecular oxygen and a reduced pyridine nucleotide (either NADH or NADPH) and is inhibited by cyanide, but not by carbon monoxide. The data implicate the involvement of a microsomal electron transport system that requires cytochrome b5 instead of P-450 in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens. These findings indicate that a microsomal mixed function oxidase, similar to the one required in the biosynthesis of monoenoic fatty acids, is involved in the biosynthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogens. ATP and Mg++ stimulated the synthesis of plasmalogens."
https://openalex.org/W1506041082,"Abstract Glutamine synthetase, purified from rat liver, is homogeneous on acrylamide gel electrophoresis and on ultracentrifugation (s20,w, 15.0 S). The enzyme, which consists of eight subunits (subunit molecular weight, 44,000), resembles ovine brain glutamine synthetase in its physical properties, amino acid composition, and substrate specificity. Complete inhibition of the liver enzyme by methionine sulfoximine is associated with the binding of 4 moles of inhibitor per mole of enzyme. The enzyme is activated by α-ketoglutarate (in the presence of Mg++ or Mn++) and is inhibited by glycine, l-alanine, l-serine, and carbamyl phosphate (with Mn++ only). Evidence is presented that inhibition by carbamyl phosphate is produced by the binding of this compound to the active site of glutamine synthetase. Thus, the enzyme can catalyze the synthesis of ATP from carbamyl phosphate and ADP. When glutamine synthetase is incubated with ADP, carbamyl phosphate, and glutamate, glutamine is formed. Enzyme inactivated by treatment with methionine sulfoximine and ATP did not utilize carbamyl phosphate. Liver glutamine synthetase also catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP and acetyl phosphate; this reaction is competitively inhibited by glutamate. Glutamine synthetases from ovine brain, rat brain, and Escherichia coli also catalyze ATP synthesis from carbamyl phosphate and ADP."

https://openalex.org/W2005281973,"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 4 weeks of daily periods of immobilization stress. One of two experimental groups was allowed 1 month of recovery. After 4 weeks of stress, there was a significant increase in shockinduced fighting, in the activity of serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and in the activity of hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase. The concentration of hypothalamic norepinephrine was not decreased. After 4 weeks of recovery, only serum dopamine-betahydroxylase activity returned to normal; it therefore appears that longterm stress may increase central catecholamine synthesis. possibly resulting in a persistent increase in aggressive behavior."

When foreskin was cultured for 16 hours in the presence of 10 micromolar benz[alpha]anthracene, a two- to fivefold increase in activity of benzo[alpha]pyrene hydroxylase was obtained. An evaluation of the basal activity and inducibility of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes in human tissues may provide a means of determining the ability of different individuals to metabolize carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1603511621,"The reductions of either acyl or alkyl derivatives of dihydroxyacetone phosphate by enzymes from ascites tumor cell microsomes with NADPH were studied. The reaction rate was measured by determining the formation of labeled lipid from [4-3H]NADPH. The products were characterized as either 1-acyl or 1-alkyl [2-3H]glycerol 3-phosphate formed from the corresponding keto derivatives. The enzymes were found to be distributed in both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions obtained from different organs, i.e. brain, liver, kidney, etc. When [4-3H]NADH was substituted for [4-3H]NADPH, very little formation of labeled lipid from the dihydroxyacetone phosphate derivatives was observed, showing that the enzymes are specific for NADPH as the coenzyme. The same results were obtained when the reduction was studied with nonradioactive NADH or NADPH and 32P-labeled acyl or alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Experiments with A-[4-3H]NADPH and B-[4-3H]NADPH proved that only the B-hydrogen from the nicotinamide ring was transferred to reduce the keto compounds. Some preliminary results indicated that one enzyme may be responsible for the reduction of both acyl and alkyl derivatives of dihydroxyacetone phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W24116936,"A broad substrate specificity, low molecular weight, TPNH-linked aldehyde reductase has been purified from the soluble cytoplasm of pig kidney cortex. The enzyme reduces aromatic aldehydes, such as 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, and 4-cyanobenzaldehyde; aldoses, such as d -glyceraldehyde, d -lactaldehyde, pyruvaldehyde, and d -glucuronate; and α-diketones, such as (+)-camphorquinone and diacetyl. It also catalyzes a slow TPN-linked oxidation of the corresponding alcohols, as well as Tris. The enzyme, a 30,200 dalton monomer, is homogeneous by gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; but on standard polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis it gives multiple bands which have the same relative substrate specificity. A diagnostic property of this reductase is its sensitivity to barbiturate inhibition. Due to its kinetic constants and pH optima, this enzyme probably functions physiologically as an aldehyde reductase rather than an alcohol dehydrogenase. The broad substrate specificity of this reductase overlaps several previously described, apparently unrelated, but perhaps identical, TPN-specific mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1543169489,"Abstract The TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase of pig heart, which is here shown not to contain zinc or manganese as essential constituents, is most effectively activated by divalent manganous ions. On the basis of the effect of isocitrate concentration on the apparent Michaelis constant for manganous ion and the reciprocal influence of manganous ion concentration on the apparent Michaelis constant for isocitrate, as well as the results of studies of the direct binding of manganous ion and isocitrate (Colman, R. F., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, (1969) 191, 469; Villafranca, J. J., and Colman, R. F. (1972), J. Biol. Chem., 247, 209), it is concluded that the metal-isocitrate complex is the actual substrate for the enzyme. Significant activation is exhibited by divalent manganous, cadmium, zinc, cobaltous, and magnesium ions; whereas calcium and strontium function as competitive inhibitors with respect to manganese. The first five metals exhibit differential ability to enhance the rate of the over-all oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate, over-all reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate and reduction of oxalosuccinate. The metals also differ in their ability to influence the course of chemical modification of the enzyme by diazo-1H-tetrazole. Manganous ion potentiates the inactivation by the reagent by increasing the availability of lysyl residues; zinc and cadmium increase the inactivation by the reagent but do so by altering the reactivity of residues other than lysyl residues; and magnesium and cobaltous ions do not observably influence the modification reaction. It is concluded that the catalytic activity and the conformation of isocitrate dehydrogenase is determined in part by the particular metal which is functioning as activator."
https://openalex.org/W1499949894,"Abstract Palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate and [1-14C]hexadecanol were found to serve as precursors of O-alkyl lipids in a microsomal system from Ehrlich ascites tumor. Both acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were tested. The system required no CoA when acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate was used as the glycerol source, and significantly lower concentrations of acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate than dihydroxyacetone phosphate were required for the optimal biosynthesis of O-alkyl lipids; a similar reaction was catalyzed by microsomal preparations from mouse preputial gland tumors. These findings indicated that acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate is a more efficient precursor of O-alkyl lipids than dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The CoA, ATP, and Mg++ that are required when dihydroxyacetone phosphate is the glycerol source are necessary for the formation of the acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate; the synthesis of acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate from [14C]dihydroxyacetone phosphate and palmitic acid was demonstrated in the microsomal system. The O-alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate formed in the system was reduced by either NADPH or NADH to 1-O-alkylglycerophosphate and subsequently acylated to form 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerophosphate. The data also indicated that acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate was reduced to acylglycerophosphate by both NADH and NADPH. The organic synthesis of acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate is outlined as well as the identification of biosynthetic products."
https://openalex.org/W1597200622,"Abstract Subcellular distribution and cofactor requirements of the alkylglycerol cleavage enzyme system of rat liver have been investigated. The bulk of the enzyme system could not be removed from the microsomal fraction by washing procedures. Reduced glutathione (10 mm) increased the extent of the reaction 5-fold. The optimal concentration of ammonium sulfate was 4.8 mm. Ammonium ions increased the extent of the reaction and in addition appeared to activate the enzyme. Several other cations and anions did not stimulate the enzyme. Reduced pteridine was absolutely required for enzyme activity and the optimal concentration was 1.25 mm. The cleavage activity was stimulated 1.2-fold by NAD+ or NADH; NADP+ and NADPH had no effect. In the presence of near optimal concentrations of all known cofactors, rat liver-soluble fraction stimulated the cleavage activity 1.4- to 1.5-fold. The stimulation was produced by a heat-labile, nondialyzable component. The optimum pH for the reaction is approximately 9.0. In the absence of added pyridine nucleotides the long chain products of the cleavage reaction are aldehydes. Fatty acids were formed in the presence of the reduced as well as the oxidized nucleotides in this crude system and fatty alcohols were isolated only in the presence of NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1673729525,"Abstract 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DOHB), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (2,4-DOHB), and benzoate increase the rate of TPNH oxidation by p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and are therefore effectors of this enzyme. During the enzymatic reaction, in the presence of excess TPNH and O2, all of the 2,4-DOHB, l5% of the benzoate, and none of the 3,4-DOHB is hydroxylated. During the reactions with the non-hydroxylatable effectors, oxygen serves only to reoxidize the reduced flavin prosthetic group thereby producing hydrogen peroxide. No hydrogen peroxide is produced during the reactions with the hydroxylatable effectors (substrate effectors). All effectors cause significant perturbations in the absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectra of the enzyme. Dissociation constants for the effectors from the enzyme complex were obtained from absorbance and fluorescence titrations. Studies on the nature of the intermediates produced during the static reduction of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in the presence and absence of the substrate effectors were performed with three different reductants. Small amounts of the neutral (blue) flavin semiquinone are produced during reduction in the absence of any effector and in the presence of 2,4-DOHB, but not in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate (p-OHB). The free enzyme or the enzyme complexed with a substrate effector required 2.8 to 3.5 reducing eq per mole of flavin for complete reduction, but only donated 2.0 eq per mole of flavin during the reoxidation with potassium ferricyanide. The nature of the binding site at the active center was investigated with a number of p-OHB analogs. These compounds were found to be competitive inhibitors with respect to p-OHB. The inhibition and dissociation constants for some of the stronger inhibitors were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1481726785,"Abstract The slow reaction of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (2,4-DOHB) with p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in the presence of TPNH and oxygen, and the absence of auto-inhibition at high concentrations of 2,4-DOHB has facilitated a study of the hydroxylation reaction mechanism of this enzyme. The Vmax (45 min-1) of the over-all reaction and other kinetic constants were determined with steady state kinetics. Stopped flow spectrophotometric studies of the anaerobic reduction of the p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase-2,4-DOHB (E-S) complex by TPNH has demonstrated the formation of at least three intermediates during this process. All three species exhibit long wave length absorption bands but lack any detectable free radical EPR signals. Stopped flow studies on the reoxidation of the reduced E-S complex by oxygen have revealed the formation of a spectral intermediate that is believed to be an oxygenated form of the enzyme-bound flavin prosthetic group. A second intermediate tentatively identified as the oxidized enzyme-product complex is also detected during the reoxidation. This species decays at a rate similar to that of the Vmax; it is therefore likely that product dissociation is the over-all rate-limiting step."
https://openalex.org/W1535442687,"Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) was localized in the mitochondrial fractions of liver from three uricotelic species. These were chicken (Gallus domesticus), pigeon (Columba livia), and snake (Thamnophis elegans). In rat liver, glutamine synthetase is an extramitochondrial enzyme being mainly associated with microsomes during cellular fractionation. Agents causing the dissociation of the mammalian enzyme from liver microsomes did not release the activity from chicken liver mitochondria. However, the activity was released by agents known to release other mitochondrial enzymes suggesting that glutamine synthetase is an integral part of mitochondrial structure in uricotelic species. The amount of activity in uricotelic liver was two to six times greater than that in rat liver. Both the higher level of activity and the mitochondrial localization of glutamine synthetase in uricotelic liver suggest that the enzyme functions to detoxify ammonia generated intramitochondrially via amino acid catabolism by converting it to glutamine. Glutamine could then exit the mitochondrion for conversion to purine in the cytosol. This system is thus very similar to the system in ureotelic liver where intramitochondrially generated ammonia is converted to citrulline which exits the mitochondrion to be converted to urea in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1563536549,"Abstract Fatty acid and alkane hydroxylation in Pseudomonas oleovorans requires three protein components: DPNH-rubredoxin reductase, rubredoxin, and the ω-hydroxylase. Homogeneous preparations of the reductase catalyze electron transfer not only to the rubredoxin of P. oleovorans but also to the lower molecular weight rubredoxins of the anaerobic bacteria, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, Clostridium pasteurianum, and Desulfovibrio gigas. In contrast, the reductase is inactive with nonheme iron proteins such as spinach ferredoxin, putidaredoxin, and adrenodoxin, all of which contain labile sulfide. The reductase transfers electrons directly to ferricyanide and dichlorophenolindophenol, and indirectly to cytochrome c; the latter reaction is completely dependent upon the presence of rubredoxin. DPNH is highly superior to TPNH as an electron donor. Since two electron equivalents are accepted per mole of reductase, as shown by anaerobic titrations with DPNH or dithionite, and since 1 mole of FAD is present, it is concluded that no active oxidation-reduction group is present other than the flavin. The absorbance noted at long wave lengths when the enzyme is quantitatively reduced by DPNH or by EDTA and light in the presence of DPN, but not when it is reduced by dithionite or by EDTA and light in the absence of DPN, suggests the formation of a charge transfer complex between the reduced flavoprotein and DPN. A stable semiquinone was not formed during the titrations, as judged by the spectral changes observed. An interaction between rubredoxin and the reductase was demonstrated both by spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques. Measurements of the decrease in fluorescence of the reductase in the presence of rubredoxin indicated that these components form a complex in a 1:1 ratio; the dissociation constant of the complex was determined to be 2.1 x 10-7 m. The energy of activation of the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of rubredoxin by DPNH was found to be 5400 cal per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1496181110,"Abstract Glutamine synthetase activity in Chinese hamster cells in tissue culture possesses properties identical with purified liver glutamine synthetase. The cellular level of enzyme is regulated by the concentration of glutamine in the growth media. Induction by removal of glutamine leads to an 8- to 10-fold increase in enzyme activity within 48 hours. Repression is a much more rapid process. Half of the activity is lost within 12 min after adding 1 mm glutamine to the media, and full repression occurs in 8 hours. The decrease in enzyme activity is directly proportional to glutamine for concentrations less than 0.3 mm. Actinomycin D has little effect on induction or repression, indicating that regulation does not occur at the level of messenger RNA synthesis. Cycloheximide blocks induction, indicating that protein synthesis (perhaps of new enzyme) is required for increased enzyme levels. Protein synthesis is not required for repression. We propose that a glutamine-mediated modification of glutamine synthetase is responsible for repression of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1550736140,"Abstract Purification procedures to prepare homogeneous glutamine synthetase from Chinese hamster liver and a sensitive radioisotope assay for the enzyme are described. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 335,000 as determined by sedimentation in a glycerol gradient, and consists of 8 identical subunits with molecular weights of 42,000 as determined by mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent Michaelis constants determined for glutamate, ATP, and ammonia are 3.1 mm, 1.2 mm, and 0.16 mm, respectively. Alanine and serine are noncompetitive inhibitors of glutamate. ATP is competitively inhibited by adenosine diphosphate, noncompetitively inhibited by phosphate, and uncompetitively inhibited by cytidine triphosphate. The maximum velocity of the reaction is increased by α-ketoglutarate. Preincubation of Chinese hamster glutamine synthetase with ATP protects the enzyme from inactivation by heat and by the sulfhydryl-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide. However, preincubation of glutamine synthetase with ATP is required for inactivation of the enzyme by the glutamine analogs 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and 5-diazo-4-oxo-l-norvaline, suggesting that ATP combines with the enzyme to form part of the glutamate binding site."

The 4α-carboxylic acids are further metabolized to carbon dioxide and 3-ketosteroid; the decarboxylation occurs under anaerobic conditions, and NAD+ is required. Partial purification of a NAD+-dependent microsomal enzyme that catalyzes decarboxylation of 4α-carboxylic acids has now been accomplished. Solubilization has been achieved with sodium deoxycholate, and the solubilized enzyme has been purified free of other enzymes of methyl sterol demethylase by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-50. The partially purified enzyme catalyzes decarboxylation of 3β-hydroxy-4β-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-4α-oic acid; approximately equal amounts of CO2 and 4α-methyl-5α-cholest-7-en-3-one are formed. With the 4β-methyl-4α-carboxylic acid substrate, the enzyme exhibits a Km of 7 µm and a Vmax of 94.5 nmoles per min per mg of protein. The enzyme is selective for NAD+; with NADP+ the rate is about 5% of the net rate observed with NAD+. The pH optimum is 9.0; the enzyme is completely inactive in acidic media. Removal of bound phospholipid by treatment with either phospholipase A or C results in no loss of enzymic activity. The enzyme is not inhibited significantly by either EDTA (up to 10 mm), CN-, Fe++, GSH, Mg++, pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one, androst-4-ene-3, 17-dione, isocitrate, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Zn++, on the other hand, inhibits at concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 mm. Anaerobic conditions result in a 20 to 25% decrease in reaction rate. Under anaerobic conditions, addition of various electron acceptors, e.g. cytochrome c, methylene blue, or K3Fe(CN)6, did not fully restore activity."
https://openalex.org/W1494894896,"Abstract The effects of intravenous administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase systems in rat liver have been studied. It was found that PGE1 caused a significant decrease in synthetase I activity that was not influenced by alterations in nutritional status or presence or absence of adrenal glands. Furthermore, β adrenergic and ganglionic blockade did not diminish the response of the synthetase system to PGE1. PGE1 promoted a significant increase in liver phosphophosphorylase activity in fasted intact rats which could be completely inhibited by ganglionic blockade and partially inhibited by β adrenergic blockade. Following PGE1 there occurred a significant decrease in liver phosphophosphorylase activity in fasted adrenalectomized rats. It was concluded that the in vivo effects of PGE1 on the synthetase and phosphorylase systems are mediated through different mechanisms. Preliminary evidence suggests that the effect on the synthetase system may be mediated, at least in part, by a direct inhibitory action on synthetase D phosphatase. The effect of PGE1 on the phosphorylase system is considered to be mediated secondarily through a reflex release of adrenal catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1514765443,"Abstract Native TPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase binds 1 mole of Mn(II) per mole of enzyme with a dissociation constant of 45 µm which remains unchanged in the presence of coenzymes, α-ketoglutarate, or bicarbonate, but is lowered to 2.2 µm in the presence of isocitrate. A specific influence of isocitrate on the affinity of enzyme for manganese is implied. Inactive N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme binds 1 mole of manganous ion with a dissociation constant of 48 µm in the presence or absence of isocitrate, suggesting that modification of critical sulfhydryl groups disrupts interaction between the manganous ion and isocitrate sites. In contrast, carboxymethylmethionyl enzyme exhibits a dissociation constant of 8.0 µm in the presence and 18 µm in the absence of isocitrate. Isocitrate dehydrogenase enhances the effect of Mn(II) on the proton relaxation rate of water at 22° and 24.3 MHz giving an enhancement, eb, due to bound manganous ion of 11.0 ± 0.5. Isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate (but not TPN or TPNH) lower this enhancement by approximately twothirds. Dissociation constants of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate from their respective ternary complexes were calculated to be 2 ± 1 µm and 290 ± 80 µm, and are essentially unchanged in the presence of TPN or TPNH. These results are consistent with the formation of ternary metal bridge complexes involving enzyme, Mn(II), and substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2067941030,"The disaggregation of brain polysomes which is produced by giving large doses of L-dopa to rats is not reproduced by administering its metabolite, 3-O-methyldopa, by giving D-dopa, which also depletes the brain of S-adenosylmethionine but is not converted to catecholamines, or by giving the L-dopa after a decarboxylase inhibitor. Polysome disaggregation is potentiated by the prior administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, indicating that formation of a catecholamine is an obligatory requirement. These observations suggest that the mechanism by which L-dopa disaggregates brain polysomes involves its conversion to dopamine within the majority of brain cells."

https://openalex.org/W1539542105,"Abstract Changes in the weight average molecular weight and the spectrum of the reduced coenzyme subsequent to addition of coenzyme and guanine nucleotides to bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase have been measured using stopped flow techniques. The data are consistent with an ordered sequence of events with respect to ligand-induced depolymerization of the enzyme. A mechanism is proposed for the ligand-induced effects which assumes that the ligand binding steps are in rapid equilibrium and that after ligands bind to the enzyme there are at least two conformational changes with the one induced by the guanine nucleotide occurring after that induced by the coenzyme. When DPNH is used as coenzyme, an additional, relatively slow conformational change is observed as a consequence of DPNH binding to a second, presumably nonactive site. A computer data fitting program is described which, using the assumed mechanism, allows determination of the apparent rate constants for these processes for each of the four pairs of nucleotides (TPNH-GTP, TPNH-GDP, DPNH-GTP, and DPNH-GDP). It is shown that each pair of nucleotides is associated with a different set of rate constants and, as a consequence, yields a rather different time and nucleotide concentration dependence of isomerization and depolymerization of the polymeric enzyme. Of most complexity are the results observed for the DPNH-GDP pair, in which depolymerization is clearly biphasic. For this case, the extent of one phase relative to the other is dependent on enzyme concentration. Only half-saturation with coenzyme (0.5 mole per mole of polypeptide chain) is required to give complete depolymerization in the presence of saturating GTP concentrations. There is no evidence for cooperative interactions between sites on the six polypeptide chains of the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1566452072,"Abstract An octapeptide from Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase has been isolated and sequenced; it contains the cystine previously shown to take part in electron transfer. The peptide was isolated from a peptic digest of a derivative in which the free sulfhydryls of the enzyme had been reacted with the colored maleimide, N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide. The sequence of this peptide as determined by subtractive Edman degradation was: [see PDF for sequence] The minimum molecular weight based on amino acid analysis and flavin content has been redetermined on highly purified enzyme to be 36,500 per FAD or 73,000 per mole of enzyme. The total half-cystine content was found to be five per FAD, indicating three cysteines and one cystine per FAD."

https://openalex.org/W1499004469,"The techniques of gel filtration and light scattering were used to evaluate a report that the molecular weight of the TPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase of pig heart can be influenced by its substrates. The results here presented indicate that the elution position of the enzyme from a column of Sephadex G-150 is not appreciably altered by the addition of isocitrate, manganous ion, TPN, α-ketoglutarate, or TPNH. The Stokes radius is estimated as 39.3 A. Similarly the weight average molecular weight of the enzyme, as measured by light scattering, does not vary significantly from 58,000 when isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, metal ion, and the coenzymes are added. It is concluded that the pig heart TPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase exists as a single molecular weight species independent of the presence of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1534026010,"Abstract Nucleotide pyrophosphatase was solubilized from the microsomal fraction of rat liver with Triton X-100 and was purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration through Sepharose 4B and preparative disc electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. This procedure resulted in a final purification of 176-fold. Maintenance of enzymatic activity through the various stages of purification depended on the presence of detergent. When detergent was removed, enzymatic activity was lost and aggregation of protein was observed. The Triton X-100 solubilized enzyme appeared to reside in relatively large membrane fragments. These were reduced in size by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate resolved these fragments into a number of components but enzymatic activity was decreased. When Triton X-100 was included, less resolution was achieved but enzyme activity was preserved. The hydrolysis of NADH catalyzed by the enzyme was competitively inhibited by UDP-glucose and ADP-ribose and the values of Ki for these materials as inhibitors agreed with their apparent Km values as substrates. In addition, the ratio of NADH pyrophosphatase activity to that using other substrates remained constant over several stages of purification. Segments of analytical disc gels which had been run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate were incubated with various substrates and the locations of pyrophosphatase activity using NAD, NADPH, ADP-ribose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-glucose were each compared to that using NADH as a reference substrate. All activities tested were coincident with that employing NADH. It is concluded on the basis of the experiments described that a single enzyme with broad specificity for nucleotide pyrophosphates is responsible for hydrolysis of all the nucleotide pyrophosphates tested."
https://openalex.org/W1504110753,"Abstract Pepsin-solubilized collagen was prepared from the body-wall connective tissue of the sea anemone Metridium dienthus. It was judged to be collagen on the basis of its precipitability with 10% NaCl solution, its segment long spacing pattern in the electron microscope, its amino acid analysis, its melting behavior, its optical rotation, and its behavior on gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and disc electrophoresis. Pepsin-solubilized Metridium collagen contained two components, an α chain and a β component, when examined by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. These components were separated by agarose 1.5 m gel filtration and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. The highly purified α and β chains each contained almost 1% by weight of the sugars fucose, mannose, and glucosamine, in the form of heteropolysaccharide. These sugars have not been previously reported to be present in highly purified, soluble collagen chains."
https://openalex.org/W1549323292,"Abstract DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from bovine heart binds 1 molecule of DPNH per molecule of enzyme of 320,000 daltons with a concomitant 20-fold increase in nucleotide fluorescence. The fluorescence properties of this tightly bound DPNH (Kd = 1.4 µm) are not affected by DPN+, isocitrate, MgSO4, or ADP, either alone or in combinations. However, ATP, an inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase, competitively displaces bound DPNH. Ultrafiltration or gel chromatography of the enzyme in the presence of DPNH reveals a total binding of 3.5 to 4.5 eq of nucleotide with a limiting dissociation constant of 14 µm obtained at near saturating ligand concentrations. Fluorescence titration indicates that isocitrate dehydrogenase also binds 1 eq of TPNH with a Kd of 0.9 µm. In contrast to the enzyme-DPNH complex, bound TPNH is not displaced by ATP and shows no evidence of energy transfer in its fluorescence excitation spectrum. Ultrafiltration experiments reveal at least two additional binding sites for TPNH. The presence of DPNH does not affect the binding of TPNH, and DPNH binding is not altered by TPNH, indicating separate sites on the enzyme for the two types of pyridine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1567372250,"Abstract d-Amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) catalyzes the oxidation of nitromethane by O2 in the presence or absence of light to give formaldehyde, nitrite, and H2O2 as final products. The anaerobic reduction of the enzyme by nitromethane yields a species (E'r) the spectrum of which resembles, but is not identical with, that of free reduced enzyme. E'r reacts rapidly with O2 to form fully oxidized enzyme. The enzyme remains in the oxidized state during turnover at pH 8.3 because the rate of oxidation of E'r by O2 is 6 x 104 times faster than the rate of formation of E'r. The following scheme accommodates the observed kinetics of turnover and of the half-reactions. Eo (k1[CH3NO2])/→ E'r (k2[O2])/→ Eo + H2O2 Whether nitrite and formaldehyde (or a precursor such as HO—CH2—NO2) are released in the first or second step has not been established. In addition to undergoing oxidative turnover, nitromethane slowly produces an irreversibly inactivated species of the enzyme with none of the spectral characteristics of oxidized enzyme. Nitromethane interacts with free FAD, but only in the presence of light, to give an oxidizable species having a spectrum resembling that of FADH2."

Many workers1–5 have reported considerable protection against challenging homologous sporozoites of Plasmodium gallinaceum. Richards4, using three injections of sporozoites exposed to ultraviolet, dried or treated with formalin, found at least eighteen birds out of twenty were protected, but with freeze-thawed sporozoite material he found only fifteen out of twenty protected. By using six to seven injections of X-irradiated sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei, Nussenzweig et al.6,7 obtained 90–100% protection when the animals were challenged with 2,000 sporozoites two weeks after the last injection."
https://openalex.org/W1519562440,"Abstract A soluble aldose dehydrogenase has been purified 284-fold from a pseudomonad capable of using d-fucose as a sole carbon source. Only sugars that possessed the l-arabino configuration at C-2 through C-4, namely d-fucose, d-galactose, 6-iodo-6-deoxy-d-galactose, l-arabinose, and certain 2- and 3-deoxy derivatives (abequose and 2-deoxy-d-galactose), served as substrates. Forty-nine other carbohydrates and related compounds tested neither served as substrates nor inhibited the enzyme. The apparent Km values for d-fucose, d-galactose, and l-arabinose were 0.50, 0.17, and 0.14 mm, respectively, at pH 8.1, and were 4- to 13-fold higher at the apparent pH optimum of 9.4. Both NAD+ and NADP+ served as coenzymes. The enzyme was insensitive to thiols and thiol group reagents, and was not activated by divalent cations. The product of d-fucose oxidation was identified as d-fucono-γ-lactone. The enzyme is induced by growth of the organism on either d-fucose, d-galactose, or l-arabinose. A lactonase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of d-fucono-γ-lactone to d-fuconate was also demonstrated in extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1483222399,"Abstract The rate of oxygen uptake of spinach ferredoxin-NADP reductase-ferredoxin complex is increased up to 20-fold by the addition of cytochrome c. Initiation of epinephrine and sulfite oxidation indicated an involvement of the superoxide anion radical in the stimulated oxidase reaction. The final product of the reaction was shown to be H2O instead of H2O2, which is the product of the flavoprotein-catalyzed oxidase reaction in the absence of ferredoxin. In the stimulated oxidase reaction, the electron-donating site to molecular oxygen, accordingly the site for the superoxide anion radical generation, has been ascribed to the iron-sulfur moiety of the reductase-ferredoxin complex rather than to the flavoprotein or cytochrome c. Ferredoxin-NADP reductase was found to possess a cytochrome c reductase activity in the absence of ferredoxin, and this activity was increased under anaerobic conditions. Cytochrome c reduction mediated by the superoxide anion radical was negligible both in the absence and presence of ferredoxin. The stimulation was independent of the oxidation-reduction state of cytochrome c, and has been concluded to be a result of an interaction of cytochrome c with the ferredoxin component of the complex with a Michaelis constant of approximately 0.8 µm. These results suggest that the binding of cytochrome c molecule to the reductase-ferredoxin complex dramatically alters its catalytic activity toward molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1487271158,"Abstract We have studied the effect of Fe2+ on a partially purified tyrosine hydroxylase, prepared after solubilizing with trypsin the crude enzyme sedimented from bovine adrenal medulla homogenate. An approximately 2-fold activation was consistently observed following preincubation of the enzyme with Fe2+ and mercaptoethanol in pH 8.6 Tris buffer. In addition to activating freshly prepared enzyme, the preliminary incubation step restored almost fully the activity of purified tyrosine hydroxylase preparations that had lost 80 to 90% of their activity upon standing overnight at room temperature in pH 6.0 buffer. Catalase or peroxidase could replace Fe2+ in the enzyme assay per se, indicating that the effect of Fe2+ in this step was probably due to its ability to remove H2O2. However, Fe2+ appeared to be specifically required in the activation step; it could not be replaced by catalase, peroxidase, or cations other than Fe2+, either in the presence or absence of mercaptoethanol. Mercaptoethanol could not be replaced in the activation step by glutathione, cysteine, dithiothreitol, or ascorbic acid. These studies indicate that Fe2+, under appropriate conditions, affects tyrosine hydroxylase in a unique manner."

This organism has two major characteristics responsible for its cariogenicity: first, in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates it is capable of rapidly producing acid to below the pH required for dissolving enamel, and second, the organism produces glucosyltransferase which is a constitutive enzyme responsible for the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides4. These polysaccharides are glucans which are commonly referred to in the literature as dextran; they form a major component of the bacterial plaque matrix and may be responsible for adhesion of the bacterial plaque to tooth enamel5."

https://openalex.org/W1594792156,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetase requires high ionic strength for optimal γ-glutamyltransferase activity; 0.4 m K2SO4 added directly to the assay enhances catalytic activity more than 12-fold. Specific monovalent cations modify this enhanced activity, with potassium salts favoring activation more than sodium salts, and rubidium salts intermediate between the two. Lithium antagonizes the stimulatory effects of high ionic strength. In contrast, the biosynthetic activity of glutamine synthetase is inhibited by salts added directly to the assay, the relative inhibition being greatest with potassium salts, least with lithium, and intermediate with sodium. Incubation of glutamine synthetase in buffer with high salt concentrations prior to assay stimulates the transferase activity also, but has no effect on the biosynthetic activity. This latter stimulation of activity is independent of the monovalent cation in the preliminary incubation, but is blocked by Mn2+, and to a lesser extent by Mg2+, when these divalent cations are included in the preliminary incubation buffer. When the enzyme is studied under optimal conditions of preliminary incubation and assay, the Mn2+ and ADP substrate saturation curves are sigmoid, but those of arsenate, glutamine, and hydroxylamine are hyperbolic. The transferase activity is subject to feedback inhibition by tryptophan, AMP, glycine, and alanine. The enzyme in the high salt buffer has altered sulfhydryl reactivity and increased fluorescence with the hydrophobic probe, N-phenyl-N-methyl-2-aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonate, in comparison to enzyme in the low salt buffer. No differences, however, between the high and low salt preparations could be detected in sedimentation velocity and light-scattering experiments. After 17 hours, some dissociation of the enzyme centrifuged in the high salt buffer is demonstrated in sedimentation equilibrium studies; this dissociation was not seen in comparable studies without added salt. Assay in high salt concentrations raises the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrates of the transferase assay; such changes may explain partially the marked increase in the transferase activity associated with the high salt environment."
https://openalex.org/W1565628893,"Abstract The regulatory enzyme ATP:glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.-) catalyzes the transfer of AMP groups to glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) from Escherichia coli, thereby diminishing the latter's ability to synthesize glutamine. The course of the transfer reaction has been investigated with particular reference to the possible existence of an AMP-adenylyltransferase intermediate. Direct attempts to isolate such a species were unsuccessful. Measurements of [32P]pyrophosphate-ATP exchange failed to support the existence of the reaction ATP + adenylyltransferase ⇌ AMP-adenylyltransferase + PPi A kinetic analysis showed initial velocities of the transfer conformed to the rate equation of an ordered mechanism. It was concluded therefore that the reaction occurs in a ternary complex of glutamine synthetase, MgATP, and adenylyltransferase, and that a stable AMP-adenylyltransferase does not exist. Values for the Michaelis constants with respect to glutamine synthetase and MgATP were found to be 1.1 and 3.9 mm, respectively. For purposes of correcting the kinetic data for MgATP bound to cosubstrate glutamine synthetase, the association constant between these two substances was measured."

Positive effectors of the adenylyl transfer reaction, magnesium ion and glutamine, increase the number of —SH groups in adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.-) titratable by 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); inhibitors of the transfer reaction, α-ketoglutarate and 3-phosphoglycerate, decrease the number of titratable —SH groups. It is concluded that effector control of the adenylylation reaction is exerted at the level of adenylyltransferase. The substrates of the adenylyltransfer reaction, MgATP and nonadenylylated glutamine synthetase also expose additional —SH groups of adenylyltransferase to titration. A substrate of the reverse reaction (pyrophosphorolysis of AMP-glutamine synthetase) MgPPi2- buries —SH groups. The relationship between the number of —SH groups modified and residual enzyme activity is established."
