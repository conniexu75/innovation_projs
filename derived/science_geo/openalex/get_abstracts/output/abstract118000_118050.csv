https://openalex.org/W2118600791,"Uracil uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by the FUR4-encoded uracil permease. This permease undergoes endocytosis and subsequent degradation in cells subjected to adverse conditions. The data presented here show that uracil permease also undergoes basal turnover under normal growth conditions. Both basal and induced turnover depend on the essential Npi1p/Rsp5p ubiquitin-protein ligase. Epitope-tagged ubiquitin variants have been used to show that uracil permease is ubiquitinated in vivo. The ubiquitin-permease conjugates that are readily demonstrated in wild type cells were barely detectable in npi1 mutant cells, indicating that uracil permease may be a physiological substrate of the Npi1p ubiquitin ligase. The lack of ubiquitination of the permease in npi1 cells resulted in an increase in active, i.e. plasma membrane-located, permease, suggesting that there is a direct relationship between ubiquitination and removal of the permease from the plasma membrane. The accumulation of ubiquitin-permease conjugates in thermosensitive act1 mutant cells, deficient in the internalization step of endocytosis is consistent with this idea. On the other hand, the degradation of uracil permease does not require a functional proteasome since the permease was not stabilized in either pre1 pre2 or cim3 and cim5 mutant cells that have impaired catalytic (pre) or regulatory (cim) proteasome subunits. In contrast, both basal and stress-stimulated turnover rates were greatly reduced in pep4 mutant cells having defective vacuolar protease activities. We therefore propose that ubiquitination of uracil permease acts as a signal for endocytosis of the protein that is subsequently degraded in the vacuole.

We therefore propose that ubiquitination of uracil permease acts as a signal for endocytosis of the protein that is subsequently degraded in the vacuole. Yeast cells have developed many regulated transport systems that respond sensitively to changes in the extracellular environment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several amino acid and sugar permeases that undergo down-regulation at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels when a preferred nutrient becomes available (1.Grenson M. Pont D. Molecular Aspects of Transport Proteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 219-245Google Scholar, 2.Bisson L.F. Coons D.M. Kruckeberg A.L. Lewis D.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 259-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Providing cells grown on a poor nitrogen source with NH+4 ions blocks expression of the general amino acid Gap1 permease and any existing Gap1 is rapidly inactivated(3.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This latter phenomenon, called nitrogen catabolite inactivation, has recently been shown to be accompanied by the proteolytic breakdown of the Gap1 permease(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The maltose transporter undergoes similar dual regulation, including proteolysis triggered by glucose under nitrogen starvation conditions(5.Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of ITR1 encoded transporter is triggered by adding its own substrate, inositol(6.Lai K. Bolognese C.P. Swift S. McGraw P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2525-2534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Control of permease stability therefore appears to be a general process, which provides a rapid way of turning off the uptake of unneeded nutrients. The molecular mechanism responsible for switching between the stability and degradation of these plasma membrane proteins remains poorly understood. We have used uracil permease to examine the degradative pathway of yeast permeases. This permease, encoded by the FUR4 gene, is delivered to the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway (7.Jund R. Weber E. Chevallier M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated on serine residues in a post-Golgi compartment, probably at the plasma membrane(8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Permease is rapidly degraded under several adverse conditions, such as the approach of the stationary growth phase or the inhibition of protein synthesis. Its degradation follows its endocytosis, as it is dependent on the products of the END3 and END4 genes(9.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), required for endocytosis of pheromone receptors(10.Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The permease accumulates in the vacuole of growing pep4 mutant cells, deficient in the activities of the main vacuolar proteases(9.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there is a constitutive turnover in addition to that triggered by stressful conditions. Uracil permease contains a 9-residue sequence similar to the “destruction box” of mitotic cyclins. This box appears to be essential for the conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinHAhemagglutininTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycineβ-galβ-galactosidasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. to cyclins and subsequent proteolysis (11.Glotzer M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A permease having a point mutation (R294A) within this region is resistant to stress-induced degradation(13.Galan J.M. Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have therefore suggested that ubiquitination is a signal for permease degradation, as it is for the breakdown of the mitotic cyclins. Ub-conjugates formation requires the combined action of three classes of enzymes: the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (UBC, or E2), and at least in some cases Ub-protein ligases (E3), which play a role in substrate recognition(14.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 15.Finley D. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 539-581Google Scholar). The hypothesis that Ub is conjugated to the uracil permease is supported by the finding that the permease degradation triggered by stressful conditions requires the NPI1 gene product(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), which is structurally and functionally related to E6-AP, a human Ub-protein ligase(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C.

The data presented here demonstrate that uracil permease indeed undergoes Npi1p-dependent ubiquitination. We show that permease ubiquitination is a cell surface event, followed by endocytosis and vacuolar proteolytic breakdown. We therefore propose that ubiquitination of uracil permease signals its endocytosis. The S. cerevisiae strains used were 23344C (MATα ura3), 27061b (MATaura3 trp1), 27038a (MATanpi1 ura3), and 27064b (MATanpi1 ura3 trp1), which are all derived from the wild type strain S1278b(17.Béchet J.

As the chromosome-encoded uracil permease is produced in very low concentrations, cells that expressed permease from 2 μ-based multicopy plasmids were used for the immunodetection of the permease. The plasmid pfF (2μ LEU2 FUR4) (8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carries the FUR4 gene under the control of its endogenous promoter, as does plasmid YEp352fF (2μ URA3 FUR4), which was constructed by inserting into the vector YEp352 (23.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) a 2.6-kilobase pair HindIII-BamHI fragment, carrying the FUR4 gene, derived from the plasmid pfF. In plasmids 195gF (2μ URA3 GalFUR4) and pgF (2μ LEU2 GalFUR4) (8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the FUR4 gene is under the control of the GAL10 promoter. The plasmid YEp96 (2μ TRP1 Ub) contains a synthetic yeast Ub gene under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter, YEp112 (2μ TRP1 HA-Ub) and YEp105 (2μ TRP1 Myc-Ub) are identical to YEp96, except that they encode hemagglutinin (HA) or c-Myc-tagged versions of Ub(24.Hochstrasser M.

The derivative of pUb23 (2μ URA3 GalUb-lacZ) encoding a chimeric protein, in which the yeast Ub gene is fused with a modified β-galactosidase carrying a proline residue instead of the initiator methionine(25.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), will be referred to as p(Ub-Pro-β-gal). Yeast strains were transformed according to (26.Gietz D. Jean A. St. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30°C (or 24°C for thermosensitive strains) in minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) supplemented with appropriate nutrients. Carbon sources were 2% glucose, or 4% galactose plus 0.02% glucose (or 0.05% glucose in case of weakly gal+ strains). Media contained 0.1 mM CuSO4 for experiments involving overexpression of Ub. Uracil uptake was measured in exponentially growing cells as described previously(8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed with multicopy plasmids encoding the FUR4 gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter were grown in YNB medium with galactose as a carbon source to an A600 of 0.7 (1.4 × 107 cells/ml). For pulse-chase labeling in growing cells, cells were labeled for 10 min by adding 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml of culture and chased in 10 mM methionine. For pulse-chase labeling in stress conditions, cells were labeled with Tran35S-label for 10 min and chased in 10 mM methionine plus 10 mM cysteine. We have observed that the turnover rate of uracil permease is accelerated in the presence of cysteine, as it is after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Aliquots of the culture (0.5 ml) were removed at various times during the chase, and proteins were processed for immunoprecipitation as described previously (8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to uracil permease residues 15-30 (N-terminal antipeptide antibody). For immunoprecipitation of control Ub-Pro-β-gal using anti-β-galactosidase antiserum (Sigma), heating steps were performed for 4 min at 95°C, instead of 10 min at 37°C for uracil permease. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in a Tricine system and fluorography as described previously(8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software package. Cell extracts were prepared and proteins were analyzed by immunoblots as described previously (9.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an antiserum to the last 10 residues of the permease (C-terminal antipeptide antiserum), or, when indicated, with N-terminal antipeptide antibody, both affinity-purified(9.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some immunoblots were also probed with an antiserum to the plasma membrane (H+)-ATPase, used without further purification. Primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG second antibody followed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp). Yeast cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested by centrifugation in the presence of 10 mM sodium azide, washed once in distilled water plus 10 mM sodium azide, and suspended in lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors: 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and chymostatin) at a concentration of 50 A600/0.2 ml in a 1.5-ml conical tube. All subsequent steps were carried at 4°C. Chilled glass beads (0.45 μm diameter) were added to the meniscus, and the cells were lysed by vigorous vortex mixing for 3 min. The resulting homogenate was diluted 3-fold with the same buffer and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min to remove unbroken cells and large debris. The plasma membrane-enriched fraction was collected by centrifugation for 45 min at 12,000 rpm. This membrane pellet containing uracil permease was suspended in lysis buffer plus 5 M urea, kept at 0°C for 30 min, and sedimented as above. The resulting pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer, and trichloroacetic acid was added to 10% to precipitate proteins. This step was needed to prevent hydrolysis by residual endogenous proteases. The precipitates were neutralized and dissolved in 20 μl of 1 M Tris base plus 80 μl of 2 × sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 mM EDTA, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 37°C for 15 min. Membrane-bound proteins were either analyzed by Western blot as described above for total cell extracts, or immunoprecipitated with antibodies to uracil permease. The 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted from samples for immunoprecipitation; the samples were diluted with 0.6 ml of TNET buffer (TNET = 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) plus the mixture of proteinase inhibitors used above for membrane preparation. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western immunoblot with monoclonal antibodies, either anti-HA (ascitic fluid containing the 12CA5 antibody) or anti-c-Myc (purified 9E10 antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG second antibody, followed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham). The npi1 mutation was originally isolated because of its ability to prevent the nitrogen catabolite inactivation of several nitrogen permeases, including the general amino acid permease Gap1p(27.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NPI1, also known as RSP5(16.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) or MDP1, 2T. Zoladek, personal communication. is an essential gene. In a viable npi1 mutant carrying reduced amounts of NPI1 transcripts, the ammonium-induced degradation of Gap1p is strongly impaired(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The stress-induced degradation of uracil permease was also impaired in this mutant(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In order to find out whether Npi1p is also involved in the fate of uracil permease in actively growing cells, the half-life of uracil permease was determined by pulse-chase experiment in wild type and isogenic npi1 cells transformed with multicopy plasmids carrying the FUR4 gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter. Cells grown to mid-exponential growth phase were labeled with [35S]methionine and chased with an excess of cold methionine. Uracil permease was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the signals were quantified (Fig. 1). Uracil permease was synthesized at the same rate in wild type and npi1 mutant strains and a decrease in electrophoretic mobility appeared after a 30-min chase in both strains. This mobility shift resulted from the phosphorylation of the permease that occurred at the plasma membrane(8.Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a lag (30-60 min), permease was degraded with first order kinetics. The half-life of permease from this point was about 40 min in wild type cells, versus 80 min in npi1 mutant cells. As described previously, adding glucose to the medium of galactose-grown cells slowed down permease turnover. In this case, too, the npi1 mutation resulted in a 2-fold decrease in permease turnover rate. Hence, uracil permease appeared to be a moderately short-lived protein in growing cells, and Npi1p is involved in this basal turnover. The reduced rate of permease degradation in npi1 cells resulted in a striking difference in the steady-state abundance of uracil permease in cells collected during growth. The amounts of immunodetectable permease in glucose-grown cells expressing permease under the control of its endogenous promoter were markedly greater in npi1 mutant cells than in parental cells (Fig. 2A). The concentration of permease in npi1 cells was 2 to 3-fold higher, as estimated by Western blot analysis of serial dilutions of npi1 extracts (not shown). In contrast, the amounts of a major plasma membrane protein, (H+)-ATPase, reported to be a long-lived protein (half-life over 10 h) (28.Benito B. Moreno E. Lagunas R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were similar in parental and npi1 cells. There was also a two-fold higher uracil uptake throughout the growth for npi1 cells than for wild type cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the protection against degradation of the uracil permease in npi1 growing cells seemed to be mainly due to its stabilization at the plasma membrane. A similar stabilization of active uracil permease was observed when npi1 cells overexpressing uracil permease were submitted to inhibition of protein synthesis(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The loss of uracil uptake triggered by inhibition of protein synthesis was also largely prevented at the restrictive temperature in a mdp1 (npi1) thermosensitive strain (29.Zoladek T. Vaduva G. Hunter L.A. Boguta M. Dennis Go B. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6884-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) expressing only chromosomal encoded uracil permease (data not shown). Therefore, whatever the level of expression of uracil permease, an Npi1p-dependent step seems to be required to remove the permease from the plasma membrane, or at least in an early step of the endocytic pathway. Molecular cloning of the NPI1 gene showed that it encodes Rsp5p, a protein structurally related to the human E6-AP Ub-protein ligase(4.Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The involvement of Npi1p in destabilizing the uracil permease strongly suggested that ubiquitination of the permease could be required for its degradation. Overexposed immunoblots often showed a pattern of low mobility species reminiscent of a ladder of Ub-conjugate bands. Epitope-tagged variants of Ub, overexpressed from the copper inducible CUP1 promoter(24.Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), were used to test whether these bands were indeed ubiquitinated forms of uracil permease. These tagged versions of Ub, larger than normal Ub, lead to a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of ubiquitinated proteins. As the concentration of putative ubiquitinated permease species were low, we made use of plasma membrane-enriched fractions from cells that overexpressed uracil permease with or without tagged or untagged Ub. Fig. 3A shows an immunoblot probed with anti-uracil permease antibodies. All the detected bands corresponded to permease species, as no signal was seen in samples from control cells that did not overexpress uracil permease (lanes 6 and 7). Membranes from cells that overexpressed normal Ub (lane 3) showed, in addition to the main permease band, two minor bands, which appeared to be up-shifted upon overexpression of HA- or Myc-Ub, gaving rise to species with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 68 kDa (lanes 2 and 4). The nature of these slow-migrating species, which most probably represent gradually ubiquitinated forms of uracil permease, was further examined by immunoprecipitation of these enriched-plasma membrane fractions with antibodies to uracil permease. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to HA or to Myc epitopes (Fig. 3B). No specific signal was seen in samples from cells that overexpressed only tagged Ub (lanes 2 and 5) or uracil permease and normal Ub (lanes 1 and 4). A species migrating just below the 84-kDa marker was clearly recognized by both HA and Myc antibodies in samples from cells overexpressing both permease and tagged Ub (lanes 3 and 6). This “80-kDa” species thus represents a Ub-conjugate that is presumed, owing to its size, to be a doubly ubiquitinated uracil permease. The “68-kDa” species, which seemed to be shifted into a slower-migrating form in the presence of tagged-Ub (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lane 3), did not yield detectable HA or Myc immunoreactivity. However, it might be a mono-ubiquitinated species that was below the limit of detection by our monoclonal antibodies. We conclude from these experiments that uracil permease is a target for ubiquitination in normal growing cells. In addition, we observed that the steady-state abundance of Ub-permease conjugates, and most notably that of the “80-kDa” species, increased upon overexpression of Ub. This increase was quite clear when comparing the amount of MycUb-permease conjugates observed with or without copper induction of MycUb. Similar observations were already reported in a few cases(24.Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30.Ellison M. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might indicate that the pool of Ub is rate-limiting for the formation of Ub-conjugates in some experimental conditions. The Ub-permease conjugates in npi1 mutant cells and wild type cells were compared by Western blot analysis of plasma membrane-enriched fractions (Fig. 4). The high molecular mass species visible in parental cells (lane 1), identified as Ub-conjugates, were essentially absent from membrane-extracts from npi1 cells (lane 2). Even membranes derived from npi1 cells overexpressing HA-tagged Ub, which led to an enrichment of ubiquitinated species in parental cells (lane 3), showed no high molecular mass species (lane 4). Glucose-grown npi1 cells, which overexpressed uracil permease from its endogenous promoter, also lacked Ub-permease conjugates (not shown). It is therefore very probable that Npi1p is directly involved in the normal ubiquitination of the permease and thus contributes to its instability. Npi1 mutant cells have reduced amounts of Ub-permease conjugates and accumulate cell-surface permease. This is consistent with the idea that ubiquitination takes place at the plasma membrane and might be required for, or even trigger, permease internalization. Ubiquitination might also occur on permease once it is internalized, and be involved in the sorting between degradative and recycling pathways. In order to choose between these two possibilities, we investigated the fate of uracil permease in mutant cells impaired in the internalization step of endocytosis. A functional cytoskeleton is essential for the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis(31.Bénédetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

A strain carrying a conditional thermosensitive mutation in actin, act1-1, was shown to have an especially rapid and complete defect in the internalization of α-factor linked to its receptor, as soon as the temperature was raised to 37°C(32.Kübler E. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The act1 and parental cells were transformed with multicopy plasmid encoding galactose-inducible permease. Permease activity, corresponding to plasma membrane-arrived protein, was induced at the same rate in wild type and mutant cells grown at the permissive temperature (data not shown). The turnover of uracil permease was analyzed in act1 and parental cells at both permissive and restrictive temperatures after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Uracil uptake was measured at various time intervals, and protein extracts were prepared and analyzed for uracil permease by immunoblots. As expected, inhibition of protein synthesis triggered the loss of uracil uptake and parallel permease degradation in wild type cells, and both events were accelerated when the temperature was raised from 24°C to 37°C (Fig. 5). At the restrictive temperature, and to a lesser extent at the permissive temperature, the act1 mutation provided strong protection against stress-induced loss of uracil uptake, and permease degradation. Permease, which was rapidly de"

We have previously shown that the dephosphorylation of NFAT1, accompanied by its nuclear translocation and increased DNA binding activity, is regulated by calcium- and calcineurin-dependent mechanisms, as each of these hallmarks of NFAT1 activation is elicited by ionomycin and blocked by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 (Shaw, K. T.-Y., Ho, A. M., Raghavan, A., Kim, J., Jain, J., Park, J., Sharma, S., Rao, A., and Hogan, P. G.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 11205-11209). Here we show that the activation state of NFAT1 in T cells is remarkably sensitive to the level of calcineurin activity. Addition of cyclosporin A, even in the presence of ongoing ionomycin stimulation, results in rephosphorylation of NFAT1, its reappearance in the cytoplasm, and a return of its DNA binding activity to low levels. Similar effects are observed upon removal of ionomycin or addition of EGTA. We also demonstrate a direct interaction between calcineurin and NFAT1 that is consistent with a direct enzyme-substrate relation between these two proteins and that may underlie the sensitivity of NFAT1 activation to the level of calcineurin activity. The NFAT1-calcineurin interaction, which involves an N-terminal region of NFAT1 conserved in other NFAT family proteins, may provide a target for the design of novel immunosuppressive drugs.

These results prompted the suggestion that calcineurin plays a major role in inducible gene transcription during the immune response, in part by preventing the nuclear translocation of NFAT family proteins(28.Schreiber S.L.

Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J.

NFAT1 is present in the cytoplasm of resting T cells and translocates into the nucleus in response to stimulation with ionomycin, antigen, or anti-CD3. The nuclear translocation is preceded by a rapid dephosphorylation that correlates with a significant increase in the DNA binding affinity of NFAT1. Each of these three hallmarks of activation (dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and increase in affinity for DNA) is elicited by calcineurin-dependent mechanisms since each is blocked by CsA and FK506(30.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).3 NFAT1 is also effectively activated by stimulation through the T cell receptor in that it is rapidly dephosphorylated, it translocates to the nucleus, and it shows an increased ability to bind DNA. However, this phase of activation is followed by a return of the bulk of the NFAT1 to its resting state, a process that correlates with the decline in intracellular free calcium levels due to feedback mechanisms triggered by the T cell receptor.3 Furthermore, treatment of stimulated T cells with CsA results in a loss of occupancy of the NFAT sites within the murine interleukin-2 promoter, as assessed by in vivo footprinting studies(33.Garrity P.A. Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. Wold B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2159-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate whether the activation of NFAT1 is dependent on the sustained activity of calcineurin.Here we demonstrate that the activation state of NFAT1 is indeed critically dependent on calcineurin activity. We further show a direct interaction between calcineurin and NFAT1 that may underlie the responsiveness of NFAT1 to the level of calcineurin activity in T cells. The interaction is not influenced by the activation state of NFAT1 and is not inhibited by immunosuppressive concentrations of CsA and FK506. The specificity of signaling pathways is often conferred by direct interactions of signaling enzymes with their substrates or with specific targeting proteins within the cell(34.Derijard B. Hibi M.

Romeo C. Seed B. Bruder J. Rapp U. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8817-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COS cell lysates were incubated with CaM-Sepharose beads as described above. In the experiments of Fig. 5(B and C), GST-NFAT1-(1-415) (the N-terminal 1-415 amino acids of human NFAT1 1 fused to GST in a pGEX2T vector) derived from 100 ml of bacterial culture was bound to 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Bound protein was eluted from the beads by addition of 1.5-3 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 30 mM glutathione. Eluted GST-NFAT1-(1-415) was incubated with CaM-Sepharose beads in the presence or absence of purified calcineurin in 1% Triton X-100 buffer supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EGTA. In the experiment of Fig. 5C, purified calcineurin was incubated for 1 h on ice with a 10-fold molar excess of CsA, cyclophilin A, FK506, FKBP12, or combinations of the immunophilin/immunosuppressants that had been formed by preincubation for 1 h on ice; the mixture was then added to eluted GST-NFAT1-(1-415) and CaM-Sepharose beads. The CaM-Sepharose beads were then washed and treated as described above.RESULTSSensitivity of NFAT1 to Calcineurin in VivoWhen immunosuppressive concentrations of CsA were added to previously activated T cells, interleukin-2 gene transcription was shut off within 30 min(45.Umlauf S.W. Beverly B. Lantz O. Schwartz R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine if this effect reflected the deactivation of NFAT family proteins, we asked whether addition of CsA to previously activated T cells would alter the subcellular localization and function of NFAT1. As shown previously(30.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), stimulation of the murine T cell clone Ar-5 with 1 μM ionomycin for 15 min resulted in quantitative translocation of NFAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with an NFAT1-specific antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). Preincubation of the cells with cyclosporin A inhibited this nuclear translocation (Fig. 1D). Addition of CsA to the ionomycin-stimulated cells resulted in the reappearance of NFAT1 in the cytoplasm within 30 min (Fig. 1C). It is well documented that CsA is a potent inhibitor of calcineurin activity when added to cells or when added as CsA-cyclophilin complexes to purified calcineurin in vitro(25.Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 46.Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3686-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus, the reappearance of NFAT1 in the cytoplasm of cells treated with CsA, even in the presence of ongoing ionomycin stimulation, suggests that the subcellular location of NFAT1 is continuously responsive to the level of calcineurin activity. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that CsA might be acting to down-regulate NFAT1 activity by inhibiting other signaling pathways not involving calcium or calcineurin.The activation of NFAT1 is also reflected by an increase in its ability to bind to DNA(30.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).3 We investigated the calcineurin sensitivity of this effect by testing the DNA binding activity of whole cell extracts from Ar-5 T cells treated with ionomycin and/or CsA (Fig. 2). Western analysis indicated that each of the extracts contained NFAT1 (Fig. 2A). The DNA binding activity of NFAT1 from ionomycin-stimulated cells showed a significant increase over the DNA binding activity of NFAT1 from unstimulated or CsA-treated cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 7-9 with lanes 1-3 and 4-6). Prior treatment with CsA prevented the ionomycin-induced increase in the DNA binding activity of NFAT1 (data not shown). Likewise, treatment with CsA after ionomycin stimulation returned the DNA binding activity of NFAT1 to a resting level (compare lanes 10-12 with lanes 1-3), again suggesting that the DNA binding activity of NFAT1 is continuously regulated by the level of calcineurin activity.Figure 2:The ionomycin-induced increase in NFAT1 DNA binding activity is reversed by cyclosporin A. A, Ar-5 T cells were left unstimulated (lanes 1 and 2) or were treated for 15 min with 1 μM CsA (lanes 3 and 4); stimulated with 1 μM ionomycin (IONO) for 15 min (lanes 5 and 6); or stimulated with 1 μM ionomycin for 15 min, followed by addition of 1 μM CsA and a further 30-min incubation at 37°C (lanes 7 and 8). Whole cell extracts were analyzed for NFAT1 content by 6% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-NFAT1 antibody. The total protein loaded in each lane is indicated at the top. NFAT1 present in extracts from cells treated with CsA following ionomycin stimulation (lanes 7 and 8) was rephosphorylated and comigrated with the bands present in unstimulated and CsA-treated cells (lanes 1-4). B, the whole cell extracts were analyzed for NFAT1 DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The arrow indicates the specific NFAT1-DNA complex, so defined as addition of an antibody specific for NFAT1 in the binding reactions completely supershifted the complex (data not shown).

CsA reversed the mobility shift within 15 min when added to ionomycin-stimulated cells (lanes 8-10). This effect was observed even in cells pretreated with protein synthesis inhibitors (data not shown), indicating that the reversal was not due to degradation of the modified NFAT1 and its replacement by newly synthesized protein, but rather reflected the rephosphorylation of previously dephosphorylated NFAT1.Figure 3:The activation-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT1 is reversed by removal of ionomycin, addition of EGTA, or treatment with CsA.

In response to platelet stimulation by agonists such as thrombin, αIIbβ3 becomes a receptor for the adhesive proteins fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and fibronectin. Binding of extracellular matrix ligands allows the integrin to transmit a signal to the inside of the cell, but the exact mechanisms whereby integrins transduce these signals remain unclear. In this paper we demonstrate that the β3 subunit of αIIbβ3 was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. However, tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed when platelets were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of an inhibitor of aggregation. Phosphotyrosine was only detected when platelets were solubilized under protein-denaturing conditions. A peptide corresponding to residues 740-762 of the β3 cytoplasmic domain was capable of binding the signaling proteins SHC and GRB2. GRB2 binding occurred only when both tyrosine residues (Tyr-747 and Tyr-759) were phosphorylated. SHC binding also occurred to a peptide monophosphorylated at Tyr-759. The data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of an integrin β subunit may be important in initiating outside-in signaling cascades by inducing association of signaling components directly with the integrin. αIIbβ3-(GPIIb-IIIa) is the most abundant integrin expressed on platelets and plays a critical role in platelet aggregation and normal hemostasis.

The data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of an integrin β subunit may be important in initiating outside-in signaling cascades by inducing association of signaling components directly with the integrin. Integrins form a widely distributed family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors that play critical roles in cell adhesion events(1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Integrins function not only to recognize macromolecular ligands but also to transmit signals, a process known as outside-in integrin signaling. These signals can induce a spectrum of cellular responses such as cytoskeleton assembly, gene expression, cell division, and cell motility(2.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). How ligand binding to integrins initiates signaling events is an unsolved problem in integrin biology. However, it is clear that the cytoplasmic domains of the integrin subunits play a critical role in the signaling process(3.O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X.P. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 1: 883-893Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4.Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Previous studies have established that the outside-in integrin signaling through αIIbβ3 is critical for platelet function. The αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation of platelets causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins (e.g. Syk and FAK(6.Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J.

Acta. 1990; 1054: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and increased cytoskeletal organization accompanying changes in cell shape(9.Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Many of these activities also occur when αIIbβ3 is expressed and activated in nucleated cells, and mutations of this receptor have shown that the cytoplasmic domains are critical for function. Such experiments suggest a regulatory role for the αIIb cytoplasmic domain in ligand binding, while the cytoplasmic domain of β3 is involved not only in ligand binding to αIIbβ3 but also in its signaling response(4.Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5.Ylanne J. Huuskonen J. O'Toole T.E.

Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). One of the principal processes by which αIIbβ3 appears to mediate the transfer of information from the extracellular to intracellular milieu is by tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, e.g. FAK, Syk, and cortactin(2.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Ligand occupancy of αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for the full range of tyrosine phosphorylation events to occur(11.Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), implying an important role for outside-in integrin signaling in this process. A primary mechanism by which cell surface receptors transduce signals is through direct phosphorylation of receptor subunits. Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain of β3 contains two tyrosine residues. Although previous studies have determined that the β3 cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated on threonine and serine residues in response to thrombin stimulation(12.Parise L.V. Criss A.B. Nannizzi L. Wardell M.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in response to platelet aggregation has not been documented. Three observations suggest this possibility. First, tyrosine 747 exists within a motif similar to tyrosines known to be phosphorylated in the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors(13.Fitzgerald L.A. Steiner B. Rall Jr., S.C. Lo S. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3936-3939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, tyrosine 747 of β3 exists in an NPXpY motif (where pY is phosphotyrosine), known to bind the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) 1The abbreviations used are: PTBphosphotyrosine bindingPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisITAMimmune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif. domain of signaling proteins(14.van der Geer P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Finally, there is striking conservation of the tyrosine residues not only within the β1, β3, β5, and β6 integrin members but also between species(16.Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional role for these residues. phosphotyrosine binding polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif. The experiments described here have attempted to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of β3 plays a role in signal transduction through αIIbβ3. In this study we have addressed the issue of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of β3 after platelet aggregation using an aggressive protein solubilization protocol. The data show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the integrin β3 subunit occurs during αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling and suggests a possible mechanism for integrin signal transduction. Blood was collected and resting platelets prepared as described(17.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except 0.6 unit/ml apyrase and 50 ng/ml prostaglandin I2 (final concentrations) were present in collecting solution. Washed platelets at ∼8 × 108/ml were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then stimulated by addition of 0.1 unit/ml thrombin with stirring until aggregates were visible (40 s to 2 min). The peptide antagonist Mpr-RGDWP-Pen-NH2 (where Mpr is p-methylbenzyl-3-thio-propionic acid and Pen is L-penicillamine) (18.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsen A. Campbell A.M. Charro I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (1 μM) was added just prior to thrombin addition, whereas 20 μg/ml LM609 blocking antibody was added 90 s prior to the addition of thrombin. For platelet lysates, resting or activated platelets were lysed at ∼2-4 × 108 platelets/ml (final lysis buffer either 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Brij 96, 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μM leupeptin, and 0.15 unit ml−1 aprotinin). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY-20 and 4G10 were from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. Murine anti-human β3 monoclonal antibodies were raised against either a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of β3 (C3a.19.5) or to αIIbβ3 (E8). The αvβ3 antibody LM609 (19.Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) was generously provided by David Cheresh. Anti-GRB2 antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-SHC antiserum was from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Corp.) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Control mouse IgGs were from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized by SynPep Corporation using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The following enzymes were used: p60c-src, (Oncogene Science), partially purified p59fyn, partially purified p56lyn, purified p93c-fes (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and baculovirus-expressed murine Syk (the kind gift of S. Harmer and A. L. DeFranco, UCSF, San Francisco). Platelets were stimulated as described above and the reactions immediately terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing sodium vanadate. For each reaction, 600 μl of platelets at ∼8 × 108/ml were treated and lysed immediately by the addition of 200 μl of 4 × sample buffer (to give a final concentration of 37 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 11.8% glycerol, 2.36% SDS, 2 mM sodium vanadate, and 0.002% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 400 μl (i.e. the equivalent of ∼2.5 × 108 platelets) of each sample were loaded per well on the first dimension (7% non-reducing SDS-PAGE) followed by 5% reducing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (as detailed in (20.Phillips D.R. Agin P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)). This allowed for duplicate gels to be run for each experiment. In each case one gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and for the other the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile prior to each experiment and then diluted as needed. Peptides (at final concentrations of 1 and 10 μM) were incubated with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates from resting platelets for 90 min at 4°C. The peptides and any associated proteins were then isolated using avidin-agarose beads (as described in (21.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)), and the complexes were separated on gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for analysis by immunoblotting. Purified tyrosine kinases or immunoprecipitates were mixed with the relevant substrate for 10 min in a final volume of 20 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2) with 5 μCi of γ-[33P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). The substrates used were affinity-purified αIIbβ3 (5 μM, prepared as described in (22.Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1415-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of β3 (10 μM), and enolase (1.5 μM, Sigma). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 × Laemmli reducing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and the radioactive bands visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film. The cytoplasmic domains of αIIbβ3 contain two tyrosines, both on β3 (Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 (13.Fitzgerald L.A. Steiner B. Rall Jr., S.C. Lo S. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3936-3939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In preliminary experiments we failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in either activated, non-aggregated platelets, in agreement with a previous report(12.Parise L.V. Criss A.B. Nannizzi L. Wardell M.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or activated, aggregated platelets. In these experiments, αIIbβ3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation following lysis of platelets in mild detergents containing vanadate. Reasoning that dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine may have occurred during detergent solubilization (particularly as tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP1B, are abundant in platelets(23.Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)), we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation state of β3 from control and thrombin-aggregated platelets using an aggressive strategy for protein solubilization. Using the experimental design detailed in procedures an 8-fold increase (n = 6) in tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 was observed in aggregated as compared with control platelets (see Fig. 1B). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins was also observed, most notably FAK and Syk as previously documented(6.Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These increases were either abrogated (e.g. β3 and FAK) or blunted (e.g. Syk) by the addition of integrin antagonist peptide (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that phosphorylation occurred primarily in response to aggregation and was not due to thrombin-induced platelet stimulation. Platelets also express the αvβ3 integrin but at very low levels, approximately 0.1-0.2% of the amount of αIIbβ3(24.Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this integrin contributed to the observed phosphorylation of β3, the experiments were also performed in the presence of LM609, an antibody that blocks the ligand binding activity of αvβ3. However, even at 20 μg/ml LM609, where binding to platelets could be observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, the same enhancement in the level of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed as occurred in its absence (data not shown). Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues has been shown to be important in recruiting signaling molecules to a number of cell surface receptors. Because β3 was dephosphorylated in non-reducing detergent, synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 740-762 of β3 were utilized to identify signaling proteins that can become associated with the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of β3. The peptide containing two phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Tyr(P)-747 and Tyr(P)-759) was found to bind both GRB2 and SHC from platelet lysates (Fig. 2). GRB2 was not bound by peptides in which the two tyrosines were either not phosphorylated or in which only one was phosphorylated. Thus, GRB2 binding required phosphorylation of both tyrosines. Our data also showed that SHC was not bound by peptides in which tyrosines were not phosphorylated or when only Tyr-747 was phosphorylated. However, SHC was bound by the Tyr(P)-759 peptide (Fig. 2B), indicating that phosphorylation of only the more carboxyl tyrosine of β3 was sufficient for interacting with this signaling protein. We failed to detect the association of other signaling molecules such as FAK, Syk, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with any of the β3 peptides (data not shown). As a test of the physiological importance of GRB2 or SHC binding to phosphorylated β3, a peptide containing a naturally occurring mutation of β3 (S752P) was used. This single point mutation was identified in a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia(25.Chen Y.-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This autosomal dominant bleeding disorder is caused by platelets that fail to aggregate (26.Caen J.P. Castaldi P.A. Leclerc J.C. Inceman S. Larrieu M.-J. Probst M. Bernard J. Am. J. Med. 1966; 41: 4-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and has been shown to prevent outside-in signaling through β3(27.Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated mutant peptide was unable to precipitate GRB2 and showed a marked decrease in its ability to precipitate SHC (Fig. 2), suggesting that the Ser to Pro mutation in these patients alters protein structure such that interactions with signaling proteins cannot occur. It was not possible to determine whether SHC or GRB2 bound to phosphorylated β3 during platelet aggregation, due to the rapid dephosphorylation of β3 in detergent lysis conditions required for immunoprecipitation experiments. However, as shown in Fig. 3, both proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to platelet aggregation and furthermore appeared to associate with several unidentified phosphoproteins (e.g. p120 and p170) in an aggregation-dependent manner. The experiments above indicated that β3 was a substrate for a tyrosine kinase(s). A number of tyrosine kinases are present in platelets and indeed several have been implicated in integrin signaling, including Src, Fyn, and Syk(6.Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these kinases could be involved in αIIbβ3 tyrosine phosphorylation, Src family tyrosine kinases p60src, p59fyn, and p56lyn as well as Syk were tested for their activities in phosphorylating full-length β3 and a peptide consisting of the cytoplasmic domain. Of these kinases p60src and Syk showed the greatest ability to phosphorylate β3 (Fig. 4A). p59fyn showed modest activity, whereas the partially purified p56lyn showed less activity. However, the p56lyn also showed a decreased ability to phosphorylate the control substrate enolase (Fig. 4A). That p59fyn and p56lyn could phosphorylate β3 was confirmed in experiments using kinases immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates (data not shown). In contrast, the SH2-containing tyrosine kinase p93fes, which has been implicated in signaling via cytokine receptors(28.Izuhara K. Feldman R.A. Greer P. Harada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18623-18629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed little ability to phosphorylate β3. Although increased kinase activity was observed with the β3 immune complex from thrombin-aggregated as compared with resting platelets (Fig. 4B), we were unable to detect direct association of Src, Fyn, Lyn, or Syk with αIIbβ3 using co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques (data not shown). Platelet aggregation, a process mediated by αIIbβ3, is known to initiate an outside-in signal through αIIbβ3, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of proteins such as Syk and FAK (Refs. 6 and 7 and Fig. 1). The present data demonstrate for the first time that the β3 integrin subunit of αIIbβ3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to aggregation. We also found that SHC and GRB2, two proteins known to participate in the Ras signaling pathway(29.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), which is active in platelets(30.Shock D.D. He K. Wencel-Drake J.D. Parise L.V. Blood. 1995; 86 (Abstr. 1792): 451aPubMed Google Scholar), could associate with phosphorylated β3 cytoplasmic domain peptides. SHC and GRB2 were also phosphorylated during platelet aggregation. These data suggest that the initial event triggered by outside-in signaling via the αIIbβ3 integrin on platelets may in fact be the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 and that the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain has the capability of assembling signaling complexes, which also become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Platelets express two integrins containing the β3 subunit: αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. αIIbβ3 is abundant on platelets (50,000 molecules/platelet; 1% of total protein mass(31.Isenberg W.M. McEver R.P. Phillips D.R. Shuman M.A. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) and has been shown to mediate platelet aggregation(32.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In contrast, αvβ3 is expressed at very low levels (50-100 molecules/platelet, 0.1-0.2% of the levels of αIIbβ3(24.Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and it is unclear what role, if any, this integrin plays in platelet function. The presence of LM609, an antibody that blocks the ligand binding activity of αvβ3(19.Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), had no effect on the amount of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation observed, indicating that the β3 was phosphorylated as the αIIbβ3 integrin. αIIbβ3 participates in both outside-in and inside-out signal transduction(32.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Inside-out signaling results in αIIbβ3 having enhanced affinity for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor following platelet stimulation by agonists such as thrombin and ADP. Although the mechanism of inside-out signaling is not known, it most likely is mediated by membrane perturbation that affects a large number of receptors or is induced by a direct modification of all receptors, as the affinity state of all receptors is capable of being up-regulated. Outside-in signaling results when platelet stimulation occurs upon integrin ligation to a substrate that allows αIIbβ3 clustering, e.g. during platelet aggregation. Given the abundance of αIIbβ3 on platelets and the known transient nature of tyrosine phosphorylation of other cell surface signaling receptors (e.g. Ig-α and Ig-β of the B cell receptor complex(33.Campbell M.-H. Sefton B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 34.DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar)), it is not unexpected that β3 tyrosine phosphorylation would occur on a small number of receptors and be transient and that dephosphorylation mechanisms would be essential and robust. This perhaps explains why tyrosine phosphorylation has not been observed previously for this integrin. In other cell systems, such as B lymphocytes, it has been possible to increase the amount of detectable B cell receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by performing stimulations at 0-4°C(33.Campbell M.-H. Sefton B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Since this temperature does not allow for platelet aggregation, these conditions cannot be utilized to characterize β3 tyrosine phosphorylations during aggregation-induced αIIbβ3 signaling. The αIIbβ3 integrin is not expected to have any intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and, so far, we have been unable to detect the direct association of a tyrosine kinase(s) with this integrin. However, our in vitro data suggest that possible candidates include members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases or possibly Syk. Support for the role of these kinases in the phosphorylation of αIIbβ3in vivo has been provided by Dorahy et al.(35.Dorahy D.J. Berndt M.C. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated that Src and Lyn can be cross-linked to β3 in intact platelets by chemical cross-linking agents. Although this is the first report of outside-in signaling inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3, it should be noted that tyrosine phosphorylation of the β4 integrin subunit has been observed in response to integrin ligation(36.Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). β4 is novel among integrin subunits. Its cytoplasmic domain is 1,018 amino acids in length, bears no sequence homology to β3 or other integrin β subunits, and contains an immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)(37.Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). ITAMs are defined amino acid motifs containing two tyrosine residues as well as other critical amino acids. It is well documented that phosphorylated ITAMs play essential roles in signaling via T cell, B cell, and Fc receptor complexes (reviewed in (38.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar)). The two tyrosines in β3 are separated by an 11-amino acid peptide sequence. This spacing is similar to that of the two tyrosines found in the ITAM domains of immune receptor complexes. Although the tyrosines of the β3 integrin subunit do not fulfil the ITAM sequence requirement of obligatory leucine or isoleucine residues +3 from the tyrosine residues, it becomes of interest to compare the interactions of the two phosphorylated receptor types. The tyrosine residues of ITAM domains are phosphorylated upon receptor ligation, which allows for the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins. In particular, the direct binding to the tandem SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and Syk has been documented(21.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 39.Rowley R.B. Burkhardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11590-11595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). While we failed to detect the association of Syk with doubly phosphorylated β3 peptides, we did detect the association of two intracellular signaling proteins, GRB2 and SHC. SHC has been shown to associate with phosphorylated ITAMs from both the T cell and B cell receptor complexes(40.Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 41.Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither tyrosine in β3 exists in a GRB2 SH2 binding motif(42.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Also, GRB2 only contains a single SH2 domain while phosphorylations of both tyrosines were required for binding. Thus, it seems probable that binding of GRB2 is bridged by another protein, possibly one containing tandem phosphotyrosine binding domains. SHC can bind to phosphotyrosines through SH2 domain interactions as well as to NPXpY (where pY is phosphotyrosine) motifs via a PTB domain (14.van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15.Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our data showed that SHC did not bind to monophosphorylated Tyr-747 peptide, which contains an NPXY motif. However, it did bind to the monophosphorylated Tyr-759 peptide (Fig. 2). The sequence surrounding Tyr-759 does not appear to be in a motif recognized by either the SH2 (42.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) or PTB domain (14.van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15.Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) of SHC. Although this may indicate that binding of SHC, too, is bridged by another protein, perhaps in a signaling complex distinct from that involving GRB2, we cannot rule out a direct association between SHC and β3. This suggestion derives from recent data showing that the proline may not be required in the motif recognized by proteins containing PTB domains (43.Evan G.A. Goldsmith M.A. Johnston J.A. Xu W. Weiler S.R. Erwin R. Howard O.M.Z. Abraham R.T. O'Shea J.J. Greene W.C. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28858-28863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and that a hydrophobic residue in the −5 position promotes PTB(44.van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K.-M. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This position on β3, residue 754, is a phenylalanine. Interestingly, we found that GRB2, as well as SHC, was tyrosine-phosphorylated in thrombin-aggregated platelets. To our knowledge, this is the first example of tyrosine phosphorylation of GRB2 during a signaling response. Since tyrosine phosphorylation does not appear to be necessary for GRB2 association with the Ras exchange factor SOS(45.Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of GRB2 may be involved in an as yet undescribed function of this adaptor protein. The doubly phosphorylated β3 peptide containing the S752P point mutation failed to bind to GRB2 and showed markedly reduced binding with SHC. αIIbβ3 bearing the S752P mutation is known to be defective in outside-in signaling as Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing this receptor show reduced ability to spread on immobilized fibrinogen, form focal adhesions, and retract fibrin clots, compared with cells expressing wild type αIIbβ3(27.Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this defect may be due to the inability, or reduced ability, of the S752P β3 cytoplasmic domain to recruit signaling proteins even if the tyrosines are phosphorylated. β3 endonexin, a protein of unknown function that was identified by its binding to the β3 cytoplasmic region in the yeast two-hybrid system, also has reduced ability to bind the β3 S752P cytoplasmic domain(46.Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These data provide a mechanism by which αIIbβ3 can mediate outside-in signaling. This mechanism surprisingly shares many of the overall features of growth factor and immune receptor-mediated signaling; receptor cross-linking leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic domains, followed by the induced binding of signaling complexes to the phosphorylated receptor. The tyrosines in β3 do exist in sequences bearing striking homology to several other integrin β subunits (e.g. 740-762, the carboxyl terminus, is 50% identical to β1, 36% to β5, and 54% to β6(14.van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)). This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may also be of importance in outside-in signaling via these integrins. As yet, these homologous β subunits have not been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to integrin signaling, but β1 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells(47.Hirst R. Horwitz A. Buck C. Rohrschneider L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of β1 prevents the incorporation of α5β1 in focal adhesion sites(48.Johansson M.W. Larsson E. Luning B. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether phosphorylated α5β1 contributes to cellular signaling processes. Taken together our data make it attractive to hypothesize that the tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β subunits is a general method for initiating outside-in signaling, allowing the phosphorylated β subunits to recruit phosphotyrosine-binding cytoplasmic signaling molecules to the membrane, thereby activating intracellular signaling pathways. We thank David Cheresh for the LM609 antibody, Anthony DeFranco and Stacey Harmer for the baculovirus-expressed Syk, Willy Teng, Mary Ann Naughton, and Bob Scarborough for providing the RGD inhibitor peptide and immunizing peptides, the COR antibody facility for making the anti-β3 monoclonal antibodies, and Leslie Parise for useful comments regarding the manuscript."

Blocking phospholipid synthesis at the first acyltransferase step by shifting either glycerol-P acyltransferase (plsB) or glycerol-P synthase (gpsA) mutants to the nonpermissive condition results in the concomitant inhibition of fatty acid synthesis (3.Jiang P.

Furthermore, the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis at the acyltransferase step following the induction of ppGpp synthesis leads to the accumulation of acyl-ACP and the concomitant cessation of fatty acid synthesis.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). β-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase III catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP to initiate new rounds of chain elongation and is therefore ideally positioned in the pathway to regulate the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis(11.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthase III is distinct from the other two condensing enzymes in that it is not inhibited by the antibiotic cerulenin and specifically uses acetyl-CoA, rather than acyl-ACP as a primer(11.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Synthase III (FabH) 2Lowercase italic type (fabH) denotes a discrete gene, and uppercase Roman type (FabH) signifies the protein product of the gene. is the product of the fabH gene, which is localized within a cluster of fatty acid biosynthetic genes at minute 24.5 on the E. coli chromosome (13.Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 33.5 kDa, containing an active site cysteine embedded within a sequence characteristic of other condensing enzyme active sites(13.Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second region of the protein has a high degree of similarity to a motif found in proteins that bind CoA thioesters. Overproduction of FabH protein leads to a decrease in the overall chain-length of fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids consistent with its proposed role in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis(13.Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, basically nothing is known about the substrate specificity or regulatory properties of FabH. The focus of this study is to biochemically characterize FabH and define the kinetic mechanism that underlies the negative regulation of synthase III activity by long-chain acyl-ACP. Sources of supplies were: Moravek Biochemicals Inc., [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol); Sigma, fatty acids, ACP, cerulenin, and acyl-CoAs; Promega, molecular biology reagents; Novagen, pET vectors and expression strains; Qiagen, Ni2+-agarose column; and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Acyl-ACPs were synthesized using the acyl-ACP synthetase purified from an overproducing strain (14.Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously(15.Rock C.O. Garwin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7123-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acyl-ACPs were concentrated, and the buffer exchanged, by centrifugal filtration in a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon). Yields were judged by Bradford protein determination (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) and conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in a 2.5 M urea, 13% acrylamide gel(17.Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better. The synthase III (FabH) assay contained 22 μM ACP, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 65 μM malonyl-CoA, 45 μM [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity 56 μCi/μmol), FabD (0.2 μg of protein), 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 0.02-0.2 μg of protein in a final volume of 40 μl. A mixture of ACP, β-mercaptoethanol, and buffer was preincubated at 37°C for 30 min prior to the assay to ensure complete reduction of the ACP, and then the remaining components (except FabH) were added. The mixture was then aliquoted into the assay tubes and the reaction initiated by the addition of FabH. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 12 min, and then 35 μl was removed and deposited on a Whatman No. 3MM filter disc. The disc was washed with three changes (20 min each) of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The concentration of the trichloroacetic acid was reduced from 10 to 5 to 1% in each successive wash. The filters were dried and counted in 3 ml of scintillation fluor. The malonyl transacylase (FabD) assay contained 100 μM ACP, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 45 μM [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 57 mCi/mmol). The ACP was reduced by incubation in the buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 37°C prior to addition to the assay tube, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA. The amount of [2-14C]malonyl-ACP formed was quantitated using the same filter disc assay described above for FabH. The genes were amplified from genomic DNA obtained from strain UB1005. Primers created novel restriction sites for NdeI at the N-terminal methionine and BamHI downstream of the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with Taq DNA polymerase, and the fragments ligated into the TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli OneShot cells. Following overnight growth, plasmid was isolated and digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the appropriate fragments isolated and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET-15b. These mixtures were used to transform strain BL21(DE3) to ampicillin resistance, and resultant colonies were screened for their ability to overexpress proteins of the correct size following isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction. One such clone was chosen for each gene and grown in 100 ml of M9 medium (18.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% casein amino acids, 0.4% glucose, and 1 mM MgCl2 to a density of approximately 5 × 108 cells/ml. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and incubation continued for an additional 3 h at 37°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 4°C, 10 min), and stored at −20°C overnight. Lysis was effected according to (19.Petty K.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strugh K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 1994: 10.11.8-10.11.22Google Scholar), with the addition of lysozyme to 0.1 mg/ml after resuspension. Soluble protein was applied to a Ni2+-agarose column and washed with 40 mM imidazole-containing metal-chelation affinity chromatography buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 200 mM imidazole in the same buffer and the purified proteins stored at −20°C. Malonyl-ACP was prepared using purified histidine-tagged malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (His-tag-FabD) in a reaction containing 100 μM ACP, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 μM malonyl-CoA, and 250 μg of enzyme in a total volume of 10 ml. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, then applied to a 3-ml anion-exchange (DE-52) column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Reaction components were removed by washing the column with 15 ml of 0.25 M LiCl in the equilibration buffer. Malonyl-ACP was then eluted with 0.45 M LiCl in the equilibration buffer. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and exchanged into the equilibration buffer without LiCl with a Centricon-3 microconcentrator. Conversion of ACP to malonyl-ACP was determined by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in a 0.5 M urea, 13% acrylamide gel. Synthase III activity of the purified His-tagged FabH was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 30 μM malonyl-ACP, 200 μM [14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 27 mCi/mmol), 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and acyl-ACP as indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.04 μg of purified protein, and incubated at 37°C for 12 min. Incorporation of label was stopped by transferring 35 μl of the reaction onto a Whatman No. 3MM filter paper disc, followed by washing in trichloroacetic acid and scintillation counting as described above. Kinetics were established by varying the concentration of malonyl-ACP or acetyl-CoA at different fixed concentrations of acyl-ACP. The transacylase activity of FabH was measured in assays containing 200 μM [14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 27 mCi/mmol), 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 μM ACP, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2-2.4 μg of enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 12 min, and the amount of [14C]acetyl-ACP formed was determined using the filter disc assay described above. Reactions were linear with time and protein. The chain-length specificity of FabH for acyl-CoA primers was determined in a coupled system containing FabH, FabD, and β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) using the reaction conditions described previously(20.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes (0.07 μg/reaction) were incubated in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10-160 μM of acyl-CoA (chain lengths 2-8), 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μM ACP, 100 μM NADPH, and the reactions initiated by the addition of 25 μM [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 57 mCi/mmol) in a final volume of 40 μl. The reactions were incubated for 12 min at 37°C and stopped by placing in an ice slurry. The products of the reactions were analyzed by separation on 13% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 M urea, followed by autoradiography. Our previous work indicating FabH as a target for acyl-ACP regulation was based on a decrease in acetoacetyl-ACP formation and the accumulation of malonyl-ACP using an in vitro assay that relied on conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis to analyze the products(10.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The drawback to the conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis assay is that the recovery of less stable ACP thioesters, such as malonyl-ACP and acetoacetyl-ACP, is reduced by the high pH and urea concentrations required to achieve the separations. Thus, we tested the ability of long-chain acyl-ACP to inhibit the activity of synthase III in a coupled assay system. The malonyl-ACP substrate was generated by the inclusion of malonyl-CoA, ACP, and malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) in the assay. [1-14C]Acetyl-CoA was the other substrate. Long-chain acyl-ACPs (16:0- or 18:1Δ11-ACP) were potent inhibitors of FabH activity (data not shown). To verify that the inhibition was not due to the inactivation of malonyl transacylase, a specific assay for FabD activity was performed using [2-14C]malonyl-CoA as the substrate. Long-chain acyl-ACPs did not inhibit the formation of malonyl-ACP (data not shown). In fact, the addition of acyl-ACPs resulted in a modest stimulation of FabD activity. The acyl-ACP preparations used in these experiments were approximately >95% pure, and the slight elevation of FabD activity by acyl-ACP was attributed to the presence of small amounts of contaminating ACP in the acyl-ACP preparations since the stimulatory effect was mimicked by adding ACP to the assay at 5% of the concentration of acyl-ACP (not shown). These data corroborated our previous conclusion that FabH was a target for acyl-ACP inhibition and encouraged us to synthesize malonyl-ACP and a spectrum of acyl-ACPs to determine the biochemical mechanism for FabH regulation using defined assay components. To directly investigate the regulation of FabH activity by acyl-ACP, a collection of purified proteins and ACP thioesters was required (Fig. 1). First, a His-tag-FabH fusion protein expression vector was constructed and the FabH enzyme was purified to homogeneity by metal chelate column chromatography (Fig. 1C). Second, a His-tag-FabD fusion protein expression vector for malonyl transacylase (FabD) was constructed and this enzyme was also purified to homogeneity by metal chelate column chromatography (Fig. 1C). The FabD enzyme was used to synthesize malonyl-ACP from malonyl-CoA. Conditions were established that gave nearly complete conversion of ACP to malonyl-ACP, which was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography and desalted for use in the FabH assay (Fig. 1A). The long-chain acyl-ACPs were >95% pure as judged by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis, with the exception of 20:0-ACP, which was only 50% pure (Fig. 1B). The acetoacetyl-ACP synthase specific activity of the purified His-tag-FabH protein was 3.57 nmol/min/μg. Acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity was also present in this preparation at a specific activity of 13 pmol/min/μg. This ratio of activity is the same as we reported previously for purified, recombinant FabH when assayed using a coupled enzyme system (13.Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicated that the histidine tag did not alter the biochemical properties of the enzyme. The apparent Km values for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP were determined to be 40 and 5 μM, respectively (Fig. 2). The size of the intracellular CoA thioester pool varies with the carbon source used for growth, and higher concentrations generally correlate with increased growth rate(21.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetyl-CoA concentration is 325 μM in cells growing in glucose minimal medium, whereas malonyl-CoA (≈2 μM) comprises a small fraction of the total CoA thioester pool(21.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total ACP pool is maintained at approximately 15% of the CoA pool (21.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and malonyl-ACP is estimated to be between 10 and 30% of the total ACP pool comparing measurements made in several different papers (11.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the affinity of FabH for its two substrates reflects the differences in the relative abundance of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP in vivo. Our previous work with FabH indicated that this enzyme utilized acetyl-CoA, but not acetyl-ACP, as the primer for the condensation reaction(12.Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result was verified using the purified His-tagged FabH protein (data not shown). We determined the acyl chain specificity for CoA thioesters as primers in the FabH reaction (Fig. 3). We did not have ready access to 14C-labeled acyl-CoAs for each chain length; therefore, the FabH assay was modified to label the products with [2-14C]malonyl-CoA and quantitate product formation by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis. Because β-ketoacyl-ACP thioesters are not stable to the electrophoretic conditions employed, we also included β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) and NADPH to the reactions to convert the unstable β-ketoacyl-ACPs to their corresponding stable β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs for analysis. As anticipated, this system efficiently converted acetyl-CoA to β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP. FabH was also able to use propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA as primers, although the efficiency of condensing butyryl-CoA with malonyl-ACP was significantly lower than acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. FabH was unable to utilize either hexanoyl-CoA or octanoyl-CoA as primers (data not shown). A minor band that co-migrated with acetyl-ACP was also observed, and the amount of this product was inversely proportional to the amount of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP formed, and most prevalent in assays that lacked an acyl-CoA primer (data not shown). Acetyl-ACP formation is most notable at 10 and 20 μM primer concentration when butyryl-CoA was used as substrate (Fig. 3). Acetyl-ACP is formed either by the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP or acetyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to ACP(1.Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 612-636Google Scholar). This latter reaction, however, would not lead to labeled acetyl-ACP, since [14C]malonyl-ACP was used as the substrate in these assays. Similar experiments performed with [14C]acetyl-CoA in the absence of added malonyl-CoA did not lead to the appearance of the band corresponding to acetyl-ACP. The only requirements for the formation of acetyl-ACP were FabD, FabH, and [14C]malonyl-CoA; therefore, we assigned the production of acetyl-ACP to the FabH-catalyzed decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP in the absence of a suitable acyl-CoA primer. However, the intracellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA are large compared to malonyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP; therefore, it is unlikely that the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP by FabH is a significant reaction during logarithmic growth. These data are consistent with the proposed role of FabH in the initiation of fatty acid synthesis. E. coli efficiently employs exogenous propionate as a primer to form fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms(25.Ingram L.O. Chevalier L.S. Gabbay E.J. Ley K.D. Winters K. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 1023-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our results indicate that FabH represents an efficient pathway for the incorporation of propionate into fatty acids. Treatment of E. coli with the antibiotic cerulenin, which inactivates synthases I and II(1.Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leads to the accumulation of butyryl-ACP and other short-chain acyl-ACPs(11.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 24.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this result is that FabH is capable of using short-chain acyl-ACPs; however, we have never been able to demonstrate that FabH is capable of even a small rate of utilization of acetyl-ACP (12.Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or that it is able to elongate butyryl-ACP(20.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that there is another cerulenin-resistant condensing enzyme. Siggaard-Anderson and co-workers (26.Siggaard-Andersen M. Wissenbach M. Chuck J.-A. Svendsen I. Olsen J.G. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) conclude that they have detected and cloned a fourth condensing enzyme. However, these conclusions appear to be in error, since it is clear that their clone actually encodes condensing enzyme II (fabF) (27.Magnuson K. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3593-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the distribution of products in their assays can be explained by the presence of a mixture of incompletely separated condensing enzymes in the column fractions. Our data suggest an additional interpretation. Short-chain acyl-ACPs that accumulate in cerulenin-treated cells may arise from FabH utilizing butyryl-CoA to prime fatty acid biosynthesis. There are no data available on the cellular concentration of butyryl-CoA or the potential significance of this thioester as a primer for fatty acid synthesis in E. coli. Long-chain acyl-ACP inhibited FabH enzyme in vitro, whereas similar concentrations of ACP were without effect (Fig. 4). The potency of the acyl-ACPs increased with increasing chain length between 12 and 20 carbon atoms, and the unsaturated 18:1Δ11-ACP was consistently more effective than the corresponding saturated acyl-ACP (18:0-ACP). The kinetic mechanism for the acyl-ACP inhibition was examined with respect to both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP (Fig. 5). The mode of inhibition with respect to acetyl-CoA was mixed, i.e. a combination of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 5A). The pattern of inhibition with respect to malonyl-ACP was competitive. Condensing enzymes proceed by an ordered reaction mechanism with the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate from the primer preceding the binding of malonyl-ACP and the subsequent condensation reaction(28.Alberts A.W. Bell R.M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3190-3198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5283-5288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixed type of inhibition with respect to acetyl-CoA was consistent with the acyl-ACP inhibitor binding to both the free enzyme and to the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 6). Thus, inhibition was competitive with respect to malonyl-ACP, which only bound to the acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, inhibition was competitive with respect to acetyl-CoA when acyl-ACP bound to the free enzyme and noncompetitive with repect to acetyl-CoA when acyl-ACP bound to the acyl-enzyme intermediate.Figure 5:Kinetics for acyl-ACP inhibition of FabH activity. Panel A, mixed inhibition of FabH activity by 16:0-ACP with respect to acetyl-CoA. Panel B, competitive inhibition of FabH activity by 16:0-ACP with respect to malonyl-ACP. Details of the assay conditions used for the kinetic analysis are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6:Proposed mechanism for the inhibition of FabH by acyl-ACP. The FabH catalytic cycle begins by the transfer of the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA to the active site sulfhydryl (Cys-112) to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The acyl-enzyme intermediate then reacts with malonyl-ACP to release acetoacetyl-ACP and CO2. Acyl-ACP inhibits the reaction by binding to either the free enzyme or the acyl-enzyme intermediate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The intracellular CoA and ACP concentrations vary depending on the stage of growth and the carbon source(21.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J.

Estimated concentrations of CoA range from 0.11 to 1 mM, and ACP varies between 17 and 130 μM. The important issue is not the absolute concentration of acyl-ACP attainable in the cell, but how the ratio of malonyl-ACP to long-chain acyl-ACP changes during regulatory responses since acyl-ACP inhibition of FabH is competitive with respect to malonyl-CoA. We examined these parameters in strain SJ22 (panD2 plsB26) before and after starvation for glycerol-P to block phospholipid synthesis, accumulate acyl-ACP, and inhibit fatty acid synthesis(24.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As observed previously(4.Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the removal of glycerol-P triggered the accumulation of long-chain acyl-ACP (Fig. 7). The cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase on 0.5 μM β-[3-3H]alanine, and the levels of CoA (900 μM) and ACP (114 μM) were estimated from the recovery of label in the two fractions, the cell number, and an estimate of the cell volume of 0.437 μl/5 × 108 cells (21.Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of the individual components of the ACP pool was determined by densitometry of the gels shown in Fig. 7. Malonyl-ACP was approximately 19% of the total (21 μM) and decreased to 8% of the pool (9 μM) following glycerol-P starvation (Fig. 7A). Long-chain acyl-ACPs were essentially not detected prior to glycerol-P starvation but rose to 53.5% of the total (61 μM) after removal of glycerol-P (Fig. 7B). The acyl-ACP:malonyl-ACP ratio was 6.3 in the starved cells compared to 3.3 in the experiments depicted in Fig. 4. These calculations indicate that acyl-ACP regulation is a plausible mechanism for controlling FabH activity in vivo. The inhibition of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III activity by acyl-ACP reveals a role for FabH in the feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Since FabH catalyzes the first condensation step in fatty acid biosynthesis, it is ideally positioned in the pathway to control the rate of fatty acid initiation and hence the total amount of fatty acids produced. The increasing potency of acyl-ACP inhibition of FabH activity with increasing acyl chain length is consistent with the in vivo observations. Fatty acid biosynthesis is most stringently regulated when phospholipid synthesis is curtailed at the glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase step(3.Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that the long-chain acyl-ACPs are the most potent physiological regulators of fatty acid synthesis. Jiang and Cronan (3.Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that starvation of a glycerol-P auxotroph triggers the accumulation of a predominant acyl-ACP species possessing the electrophoretic properties expected for 20:1Δ13-ACP. Although our findings point to a role for FabH in this regulatory scheme, it seems clear that the control of other pathway enzymes also contributes to the physiological regulation of fatty acid production by acyl-ACP. Regulation at the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and/or acyl-ACP-dependent malonyl-ACP decarboxylation are two steps that are also likely to contribute to the attenuation of fatty acid synthesis by acyl-ACP(24.Heath R.J.

Here, we have utilized recombinant Ca2+-dependent luminescent photoprotein aequorin specifically targeted to the mitochondria (mtAEQ) (2.Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T.

Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to monitor [Ca2+]m during agonist activation. In particular we are interested in the changes in [Ca2+]m evoked by stimulation of an endothelial cell line with the physiological agonist ATP. For this purpose we have chosen a cell line, designated ECV304, that was spontaneously immortalized from a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells(13.Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J.-I. Mukia K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ATP is known to be a physiologically important stimulator of endothelial cells. Its activation of the cells results chiefly in the production of the vasodilators prostacyclin and endothelial-derived relaxing factor, now known to be nitric oxide(14.Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar), along with other factors important in the control of vascular tone(15.Newby A.C. Henderson A.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ATP binds plasma membrane receptors of the purinergic P2Y classification. Previous studies, including those on HeLa cells, have shown that the pattern of mitochondrial response to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-coupled agonists in nonexcitable cells is one of a rapid, large, and transient elevation in [Ca2+]m. This kinetic behavior was proposed to be due to the exposure of mitochondria to microdomains of high [Ca2+]c in the regions surrounding the InsP3-sensitive calcium release sites on the ER(3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This model was recently supported by data obtained in freshly isolated hepatocytes using dihydro-Rhod 2 to monitor [Ca2+]m(16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). We provide further evidence to support this hypothesis but demonstrate that this proposal does not hold true for ECV304 cells. In particular, we show that the [Ca2+]m increases seen in response to ATP in ECV304 cells are slow-onset sustained signals that are quite insensitive to Ca2+ mobilization by InsP3. This differing pattern of [Ca2+]m may be due to the localization of the mitochondria, which is quite different from other cells, e.g. HeLa cells. The ECV304 cell mitochondria are not closely associated with any specific subcellular structure or organelle, whereas in the case of MH75 cells over 50% of the mitochondria lie within 700 nm of the ER. Thus in the ECV304 cells, the increases in [Ca2+]m seem to depend on global [Ca2+]c changes and thus appear to be mainly affected by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. During all experiments cells were constantly bathed with physiological saline, at 37°C and pH 7.4, of the following composition: 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mMD-glucose, plus either 1 mM CaCl2 or 0.5 mM EGTA (Ca2+-free). All reagents were added to this buffer as indicated in the text and by the bars on the figures. All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Merck Ltd. (Lutterworth, Leics., U.K.) or Sigma (Poole, Dorset, U.K.) unless otherwise stated. Both cytoplasmic (untargeted, cytAEQ) and mitochondrially targeted aequorin (mtAEQ) containing plasmids were obtained by the method described previously(2.Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 12.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Extraction and purification from bacterial suspensions were achieved using a Wizard Maxiprep plasmid preparation kit (Promega Ltd., U.K.). The human umbilical vein endothelial cell derived line, ECV304, was maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humid incubator, in 80-cm2 flasks containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic, antimycotic solution (Sigma, Poole). A clone of the HeLa cell line, stably transfected with mtAEQ and designated MH75(3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), was maintained in the same way. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies (Renfrewshire, U.K.). One to two days prior to experimentation, ECV304 cells were seeded onto 16-mm glass coverslips (Merck Ltd., Lutterworth), using trypsin/EDTA in 12-well culture plates (Costar). On reaching 50-70% confluence, transient transfection was carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, 4-6 μg of plasmid per coverslip was further purified in ethanol with 23% TE (10 mM Tris-HCl + 1 mM EDTA) buffer, and 2% sodium acetate (3 M, pH 8.0), in an ethanol dry ice bath held at −80°C. After 30-40 min this mixture was spun at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 15 min. The supernatant was carefully removed in a sterile laminar flow cabinet, and the plasmid pellet was resuspended in TE buffer and 10% CaCl2. This was then transferred dropwise, while vortexing, to a tube contained double-concentrated Hepes-buffered saline (2 × HBS, 280 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4) at precisely pH 7.12. After exactly 30 min the precipitate was visible, and 100 μl of this was then transferred dropwise to each coverslip. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was renewed the following morning, and cells were at maximal expression state the subsequent day (36-48 h after transfection). Cells transfected with mtAEQ and grown on 16-mm glass coverslips were incubated with 5 μM coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37°C for 1 h and then in a high oxygen atmosphere at 37°C for a further 1-2 h to favor the regeneration reaction(17.Shimomura O. Musicki B. Kishi Y. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following this incubation period, coverslips were transferred to a superfusion chamber held in close proximity to a photomultiplier tube, as described previously(18.Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 55-82Google Scholar). The output from the photomultiplier tube was then fed directly into a microcomputer and analyzed using OSCAR software (Photon Technologies Inc. (PTI)). Calibration was then performed using AEQASC software kindly provided by Javier Alvarez(19.Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The perfusion chamber was warmed to 37°C using a circulating water bath, and solutions were superfused over the coverslip at a rate of 1 ml min−1. Cells transfected with cytAEQ were reconstituted with coelenterazine and monitored in the same way as described above. Alternatively, [Ca2+]c was also monitored by loading cells, grown on 22-mm diameter coverslips, with Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes). This was achieved by replacing the growth medium with physiological saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 μM Fura-2AM, and 0.0125% Pluronic F127 detergent (Molecular Probes) and incubating coverslips at 37°C for 45 min. Coverslips were placed in a purpose-built perfusion chamber where they were constantly superfused, again at a rate of 1 ml min−1. Changes in fluorescence were then monitored using an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Photonic Science Ltd.). The data were analyzed using a PTI digital imaging system equipped with Image Master for Windows software (PTI). This method has the advantage that single cells within a population can be monitored, whereas data from whole coverslip populations are obtained when using cytAEQ transfection. Cells were prepared for fixation in one of two formats as follows. Cells from an 80-cm2 flask were dislodged using trypsin/EDTA and placed in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. The suspension was spun at 1000 rpm (80 × g) for 2 min, after which they were fixed and stained as indicated below. Cells were grown on small squares (2 × 2 cm) of Mellinex 228 sheeting, this is softer than glass coverslips and facilitates sectioning. Once 90-100% confluent the sheets were fixed and stained as indicated below. Cells were primarily fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.0% formaldehyde in 0.1 N sodium cacodylate (NaCac) buffer at pH 7.3 and 3°C, after which they were washed twice in NaCac buffer at pH 7.3 and 3°C. A postfixation was then performed in 2.0% osmium tetroxide in NaCac buffer at pH 7.3 and 3°C and then washed twice in 0.15 N sodium acetate (NaAc) buffer at pH 7.3 and 3°C. The preparation was then stained in 1.0% uranyl acetate in NaAc buffer at pH 7.3, 25°C to highlight membranes. Dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%) was then performed, including a final second step in 100% ethanol. Samples were infiltrated with increasing concentrations of LR White™ resin (London Resin Co., U.K.) (50, 75 and 100%) finishing with three applications of 100% LR White™ for a total of 4 h. Samples were finally embedded in LR White™ resin for 48 h at 60°C. Secondary staining was performed on the grid to highlight membranes further when necessary. This was performed using 2% uranyl acetate in 30% methanol for 1 min, followed by a wash in distilled water, then a 1-min incubation in 10% lead citrate, and a final wash and dry. When the transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived line ECV304 was stimulated with ATP (1-10 μM), a slow and sustained rise in [Ca2+]m was observed (Fig. 1a). The time to half-maximal (t½) for the rise was 18.6 ± 1.3 s (x ± S.E.) (n = 11), and [Ca2+]m rose to between 700 nM and 1 μM, rarely exceeding 1 μM. [Ca2+]m remained elevated for the duration of agonist presence, i.e. for up to 10 min in some cases (Fig. 1a). The increase in [Ca2+]m was comparable with the [Ca2+]c response in these cells (Fig. 1, b and c) and contrasts dramatically with the rapid and large increase in [Ca2+]m seen in hepatocytes and several other cell lines(12.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with the mitochondrial uncoupling agent FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, 1 μM), the response was significantly attenuated. Δ[Ca2+]m for ATP alone was 1070 ± 136 nM as compared with a Δ[Ca2+]m for ATP and FCCP of only 185 ± 61 nM (p < 0.001, n = 6). In two of the six experiments, there was no detectable ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+]m in the presence of FCCP. The effects seen with FCCP were reversible following a short period of wash and readdition of ATP (n = 6). While FCCP had this dramatic effect on [Ca2+]m, it was found to have no effect of the ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+]c (n = 21). Examination of transfected cells by immunofluorescent localization of the mitochondrially targeted aequorin revealed a similar reticular pattern of fluorescence to that previously seen for MH75 cells(19.Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These observations confirm that the detected rise in response to ATP is a true reflection of the rise in [Ca2+]m. Following an initial stimulation of ECV304 cells with ATP, a brief wash followed by subsequent applications of agonist resulted in comparable rises in [Ca2+]m with only a modest reduction in magnitude (n = 11, not shown). The unusual kinetics of [Ca2+]m in ECV304 cells in response to ATP prompted us to investigate whether this behavior was due to some peculiarities of the [Ca2+]c response in this cell type. This was monitored using either untargeted aequorin (Fig. 1b, n = 9) or Fura-2 (Fig. 1c, n = 20). In fact, stimulation of ECV304 cells, with ATP (1-10 μM), evoked a rise in [Ca2+]c (n = 40), which was quite typical both in terms of kinetics, with a t½ of 2.12 ± 0.62 s for 1 μM (n = 20) and 1.97 ± 0.58 s for 10 μM (n = 20) (t½ for 1 μM is not significantly different to that for 10 μM (p > 0.05)), and of amplitude (mean [Ca2+]c for 1 μM ATP = 906.3 ± 27.2 nM (n = 20) and for 10 μM = 933.6 ± 53.2 nM (n = 20) which are not significantly different from one another (p > 0.05)). The typical biphasic nature is revealed by stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium (following a 2-4-min prewash in 0.5 mM EGTA), which led to a transient response (n = 11) (Fig. 2b, inset) with an equivalent t½ (1.61 ± 0.11 s) and maximal [Ca2+]c (955.9 ± 36.7 nM). In the presence of Ca2+o the response is sustained for as long as the agonist is present (Fig. 1, b and c). Repetitive applications of ATP each evoke a comparable response with only a small degree of reduction, presumably due to receptor down-regulation, provided calcium is present in the extracellular medium (not shown). Because of the sustained nature of the rise in [Ca2+]m in response to ATP, the dependence on Ca2+o was investigated. Washing the cells in buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM EGTA (calcium-free) and subsequent stimulation with ATP result in a significantly lower rise in [Ca2+]m. Δ[Ca2+]m for ATP + EGTA = 280 ± 43.3 nM (Fig. 2, a and b), whereas control ATP responses are nearly three times as large with a Δ[Ca2+]m of 763 ± 63.6 nM (p < 0.001, n = 14). Two of the fourteen experiments in 0.5 mM EGTA resulted in no rise above basal [Ca2+]m. These small responses were extremely transient with a duration of only 62.2 ± 6 s (n = 12). Replacement of Ca2+o during ATP stimulation, while monitoring [Ca2+]m, in ECV304 cells (n = 11), led to a second rapid rise in [Ca2+]m (Fig. 2a), which was significantly higher magnitude than the increase elicited by agonist addition in Ca2+-free medium (315.8 ± 89% of initial increase n = 8, p < 0.001). In contrast Fig. 2a, inset, shows results of the same protocol while monitoring [Ca2+]c. In 8 of the 11 experiments, the restoration of the response was of a magnitude comparable with the plateau phase of a normal biphasic sustained rise in [Ca2+]c (Fig. 2a, inset). In less than 30% (3 experiments) of cells the rise in [Ca2+]c obtained upon Ca2+ readdition was equal to, or very slightly higher than, the initial rise in response to ATP in EGTA-containing medium. An even more dramatic dissociation between [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]c was observed using the protocol employed in Fig. 2b. In this latter case, the cells were first stimulated with ATP, in Ca2+-free, EGTA-containing medium. The agonist was then washed away and the Ca2+o added back a few minutes later. Ca2+ readdition led to a large, transient rise in [Ca2+]m (Fig. 2b; n = 6), whereas a rise was not evident upon Ca2+o replacement when monitoring [Ca2+]c (n = 5, Fig. 2b, inset) or [Ca2+]m in the presence of 1 μM FCCP (n = 5, not shown). Following the restoration of Ca2+o, and a brief wash period, subsequent addition of ATP produced the typical sustained rise in [Ca2+]m, indicating that during the experiment there had been no marked desensitization of the ATP response (n = 14). In addition, application of the receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry blocker SKF96365 (50 μM) (20.Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) completely abolished the rise in [Ca2+]m in all cases (n = 6). Under identical experimental conditions, MH75 cells stimulated with ATP show an increase in [Ca2+]m in the order of 2-3 μM as opposed to ⩽1 μM in ECV304 cells. However, the rise in [Ca2+]c seen in these cells was comparable with that seen in ECV304 cells (i.e. submicromolar). The t½ for [Ca2+]m in MH75 cells in response to ATP was 4.0 ± 0.5 s, and the duration was only 71.7 ± 10 s even though the agonist remained present in the perfusion medium for several minutes. Such a short rise time is significantly different from that seen in response to ATP in ECV304 cells (p < 0.005). These responses are similar to those previously reported for histamine-stimulated MH75 cells(3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and there is no significant difference between either duration (p = 0.5) or t½ (p = 0.5) for ATP or histamine-evoked changes in [Ca2+]m in MH75 cells. Stimulation of these cells in the absence of Ca2+o evokes a similar response but, in contrast to the ECV304 cells, replacing Ca2+o results in a secondary rise very much smaller than in the first (Fig. 3a, n = 6). The same protocol was applied while monitoring [Ca2+]c (Fig. 3b, n = 12) and revealed comparable results to the ECV304 cell [Ca2+]c response in Fig. 2b. Electron micrographs were prepared of both MH75 and ECV304 cells from pellets of cells harvested from tissue culture flasks (Fig. 4a and c), and also from monolayers grown on Mellinex 228 sheeting (Fig. 4, b and d). Since there was no difference in the observed distribution of structures using either preparation method, the data from both sets of micrographs were pooled. The micrographs in Fig. 4, a and b, show the distribution of mitochondria in ECV304 cells, at 90,000 and 60,000 ×, respectively. It is evident that while mitochondria are abundant, there is little ER in these cells. Fig. 4, c and d, shows the distribution of mitochondria in MH75 cells, at 90,000 and 40,000 ×, respectively. Abundant ER is visible, which appears to be in close association with the mitochondria even when near to the plasma membrane. Compare Fig. 4b for ECV304 with Fig. 4d for MH75 cells. To establish the localization of subcellular structures in respect to mitochondria, the number of “hits” with each structure of interest (plasma membrane, ER, or nuclear envelope) met along rings at set distances (100 nm to 1 μm, step 100 nm) from the center of a given mitochondrion was counted. The number of mitochondria included for MH75 cells was 84 and 107 for ECV304 cells. The resulting probability of meeting either endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 5a) or plasma membrane (Fig. 5b) at each distance has been plotted for both cell types in Fig. 5. The size of mitochondria varied but was never less than 300 nm (i.e. <300 nm from center was still mitochondria). In ECV304 cells, there was a much lower probability of meeting ER within a short distance (<1 μm) from the mitochondria than in the MH75 cells (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows that mitochondria in the ECV304 cells were more likely to be close to the plasma membrane than in the MH75 cells, but these probabilities are still less than those for the MH75 mitochondrial relationship with ER (e.g. the probability of MH75 mitochondria being within 700 nm of ER is >0.5, whereas the probability of ECV304 cell mitochondria being within the same distance of the plasma membrane is <0.15). Counting the total number of mitochondria situated with their centers close to ER or plasma membrane reveals that only 3.8% of the ECV304 cell mitochondria were within 700 nm of the ER, compared with 75% of MH75 cell mitochondria. In contrast, 14% of the ECV304 cell mitochondria lie within the same distance of the plasma membrane whereas only 5.6% were similarly located in MH75 cells. In Fig. 5, c and d, the probability of meeting ER was compared with the probability of meeting plasma membrane for ECV304 cells (Fig. 5c) and MH75 cells (Fig. 5d). It can be seen from this that within 900 nm of the mitochondrial center, in ECV304 cells, there is a much higher chance of meeting the plasma membrane than any ER membrane (Fig. 5c), which is in contrast to the case in the MH75 cells (Fig. 5d). At 900 nm to 1 μm the likelihood of meeting either organelle becomes equal (Fig. 5c). The probability of meeting the nuclear envelope was also measured and was found to be the same for both cell types, i.e. very low at short distances (<600 nm) and increasing to only 0.15 at 1 μm (not shown). From these data, it would appear that although the mitochondria are distributed throughout the cytosol in both cell types, the probability of their being close to the ER is considerably lower in the ECV304 cells than in the MH75 cells. In addition, in the ECV304 cells there is a higher chance of the mitochondria being situated close to the plasma membrane than to the ER. The large, rapid increase in [Ca2+]m evoked by InsP3-generating agonists was one of the most surprising new pieces of information provided by the technique of recombinant, organelle-targeted, aequorins(2.Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For over a decade the general consensus was that, under physiological conditions, mitochondria should play a minor role in the control of Ca2+ homeostasis(7.Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), given the low affinity of the uniporter and the relatively small increases in [Ca2+]c elicited by receptor stimulation. This apparent paradox has been explained by the hypothesis that microdomains of [Ca2+]c are sensed by mitochondria localized in the vicinity of the Ca2+ release sites(3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been further supported by recent data obtained in freshly isolated hepatocytes using dihydro-Rhod 2 or the intrinsic fluorescence of NAD(P)H(16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Thus, in all cell types analyzed so far, the kinetics of [Ca2+]m changes in response to agonist stimulation appear to be rapid and large increases that decline to prestimulatory levels faster than [Ca2+]c. The data presented here for the endothelial cell line ECV304 are, at a first sight, in contradiction with the microdomain hypothesis. In this cell type addition of extracellular ATP in the presence of Ca2+o evokes a slow-onset but sustained rise in [Ca2+]m that can be reversibly inhibited by treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupling agent FCCP. Furthermore, in contrast to MH75 and other cell types, stimulation in the absence of Ca2+o results in a drastic reduction, and in some cases even abolition, of the [Ca2+]m increases, suggesting that the measured rise in [Ca2+]m may be critically dependent upon Ca2+ influx rather than the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Because [Ca2+]c responses are comparable between ECV304 cells and MH75 cells, why does agonist stimulation not evoke the large, rapid rise in [Ca2+]m characterized in other cell types? This question may, in part, be answered by the electron microscopic data. Here we show that a very high degree of association exists between the mitochondria and the ER in the MH75 cells. However, there is no such close association between these two organelles in the ECV304 cells; indeed, <4% of the mitochondria in these cells are within 700 nm of the ER. In ECV304 cells, therefore, the mitochondria are not, as in the HeLa cells, located in sufficiently close proximity to the ER to detect any [Ca2+]c microdomains which would occur at the time of agonist-stimulated Ca2+ release. The ATP-stimulated slow-onset sustained rise in [Ca2+]m is 2-3-fold smaller in magnitude than the [Ca2+]m responses seen in other nonexcitable cells (⩽1 μM as opposed to 2-3 μM in the MH75 cells)(3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A similar type of small, slow-onset response can be obtained in MH75 cells and hepatocytes when the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors t-butyl-benzohydroquinone (21.Kass G.E.N. Duddy S.K. Moore G.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15192-15198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or thapsigargin are used to promote a sustained rise in [Ca2+]c(4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) via an InsP3-independent process involving Ca2+ influx rather than the rapid release from intracellular stores. Such responses lend support to the suggestion that the slow, sustained [Ca2+]m response in ECV304 cells is maintained by Ca2+ influx. It remains to be established why in ECV304 cells a sustained increase in bulk [Ca2+]c elicited by receptor stimulation is more effective at maintaining a sustained increase in [Ca2+]m than in HeLa or hepatocytes. Several not mutually exclusive alternatives can be suggested. (i) The large, rapid rise in [Ca2+]m triggered by receptor stimulation in HeLa and other cells (3.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 4.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) could, itself, be responsible for the transient nature of their responses. The high [Ca2+]m may induce run-down of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter by a process analogous to the Ca2+-dependent run-down seen in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels(22.Giannattasio B. Jones S.W. Scarpa A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 987-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23.Köhr G. Mody I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 941-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24.Yue D.T. Backx P.H. Imredy J.P. Science. 1990; 250: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). (ii) The H+:Ca2+ and Na+:Ca2+ antiporters (in highly responding cells) could undergo a prolonged activation by the large increase in [Ca2+]m, in a manner similar to the Ca2+ activation of the plasma membrane Na+:Ca2+ exchanger(25.Blaustein M.P. Santiago E.M. Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 79-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26.Rasgado-Flores H. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C499-C504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of a large initial [Ca2+]m spike in the ECV304 cell mitochondria, and in the t-butyl-benzohydroquinone- or thapsigargin-stimulated cells, would therefore favor the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]m that is observed. The electron microscopy studies point out another difference between ECV304 cells and the HeLa MH75 clone (previously characterized in detail for their [Ca2+]m responses) as far as mitochondria localization is concerned. A small proportion of the mitochondria in ECV304 cells is localized within a relatively small distance (<800 nm) of the plasma membrane. Although the response to the release of stored Ca2+ is quite small, readdition of Ca2+ in ECV304 cells, either in the presence or absence of ATP, causes a rapid and transient elevation of [Ca2+]m that is not reflected in the [Ca2+]c. It is tempting to speculate that this association between mitochondria and plasma membrane is at the basis of the fast and relatively large response of these cells under conditions where the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium is maximized, i.e. by first depleting the cells in EGTA medium followed by Ca2+ readdition. A similar effect is not observed in [Ca2+]m or [Ca2+]c in MH75 cells. This suggests that an influx of Ca2+o may generate a microdomain of high [Ca2+]c close to the plasma membrane causing a rapid uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondria located in this region. Taken together the results described in this study lead to a few general considerations as shown. (i) The kinetics and amplitude of the [Ca2+]m increases depend on the cell type and are due to the structural relationships between mitochondria and the source of [Ca2+]c increases. (ii) Fast increases in [Ca2+]m are always dependent on [Ca2+]c microdomains; whether these rapid increases are triggered by Ca2+ release from stores or by Ca2+ influx depends on the preferential vicinity of the mitochondria to the ER or to the plasma membrane, respectively. Thus, in any cell type, different modes of communication between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ can exist. For example, in cell types where there is a close association between mitochondria and ER, a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]m, and thus a prolonged activation of the dehydrogenases, can be elicited by high frequency [Ca2+]c oscillations, as shown by Hajnóczky et al.(16.Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) in hepatocytes; alternatively, as in the case of ECV304 cells, the same result can be obtained by a prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]c. (iii) Last, but not least, the present data predict that in cell types where a major source of [Ca2+]c elevation is via a large Ca2+ influx current through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, there may be a selective activation of subpopulations of mitochondria in the proximity of the channels themselves. Preliminary data from our laboratory 2R. Rizzuto and T. Pozzan, unpublished data. indicate that this is indeed the case. The possibility of different ways of controlling mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis offers a unique flexibility to those signaling mechanisms that may have important physiological consequences. For example, as far as endothelial cells are concerned, since the regulation of blood vessel tone is a long term physiological effect, the cells will be required to release vasodilators such as nitric oxide for a prolonged period. This, along with the maintenance of the [Ca2+]c signal, will require a sustained supply of energy in the form of ATP and a large production of L-arginine for NO synthesis. Depending on the agonist and the individual cell type this might be achieved by either high frequency oscillations or long lasting increases of [Ca2+]m, which we observed here.

We would also like to thank Tracie Walker and Alan Conant for their help in preparing the manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONGonadotropes within the anterior pituitary are defined, in part, by their unique ability to synthesize and secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) 1The abbreviations used are: LHluteinizing hormoneFSHfollicle-stimulating hormoneGnRHgonadotropin-releasing hormoneGSEgonadotrope-specific elementbpbase pair(s)CMVcytomegalovirusEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These glycoprotein hormones contain an identical α subunit that heterodimerizes with unique β subunits(1.Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1984; 40: 43-74PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of gonadotropin α and β subunit genes depends on secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus(2.Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocrin. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). GnRH responsiveness, in turn, requires that gonadotropes also express GnRH receptors(3.Conn P.M. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1815-1832Google Scholar). Thus, functional integrity and physiological control of mature gonadotropes relies on regulated expression of at least four genes: α, LHβ, FSHβ, and GnRH receptor.While a complex array of regulatory elements controls transcription of the α subunit gene in gonadotropes(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the elements regulating the genes encoding LHβ, FSHβ, or GnRH receptor remain undefined. This lag is due partly to weak activity of LHβ and FSHβ promoters when examined in cell culture models(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kumar T.R. Fairchild-Huntress V. Low M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the promoter of the GnRH receptor gene has only recently been cloned(7.Albarracin C.T. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is a possibility that a single transcription factor may contribute to regulated expression of all four genes.One such candidate was revealed by gene-targeting studies directed at the Fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) gene that encodes steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and embryonal long terminal repeat-binding protein (ELP)(8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L.

Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). SF-1 is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily initially identified as a transcription factor that controls expression of the cytochrome P-450 steroid hydroxylase genes in gonads and adrenal cortex(8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of FTZ-F1 results in an absence of the adrenal cortex(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), ovary(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), testes(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and gonadotropes (10.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This result was later attributed solely to the loss of the SF-1 encoding portion of the FTZ-F1 gene(12.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Schlosser D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1233-1239PubMed Google Scholar).Although all members of the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis are influenced by removal of the SF-1 gene, the mechanism responsible for gonadotrope deficiency remains unclear. This could be explained by a direct effect of SF-1 on gonadotrope development. Alternatively, if absence of the VMH attenuates secretion of GnRH, then gonadotropes would fail to develop(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A direct gonadotrope site of action of SF-1 is suggested by studies with the α subunit gene. All mammalian α subunit promoter regions examined to date contain a gonadotrope-specific element (GSE) (13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that has strong homology to SF-1 binding sites in steroid hydroxylase genes. This element in the human α promoter binds to SF-1 (14.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and accounts for approximately 50% of its activity when analyzed after transfection in the gonadotrope-lineage cell line, αT3-1(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to evidence suggesting a direct pituitary effect of SF-1, an indirect hypothalamic site of action is supported by the recovery of detectable gonadotropin gene expression in GnRH-treated, SF-1 “knock-out” mice(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter finding implies that restoration of GnRH secretion may compensate for loss of SF-1 in gonadotropes. Thus, the exact role SF-1 plays in regulating expression of the genes that define the functional properties of gonadotropes remains to be determined.Herein, we address the functional significance of the SF-1 binding site found within the proximal 776-bp promoter-regulatory region of the bovine LHβ gene. This promoter directs high level expression of reporter genes specifically to gonadotropes in transgenic mice, is fully penetrant, and is appropriately regulated by GnRH and gonadal steroids(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol.

Radionucleotides were obtained from DuPont NEN. DNA-modifying enzymes were from either Boehringer Mannheim or Life Technologies, Inc., and Sequenase version 2.0 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Antiserum directed against mouse SF-1 (8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the generous gift of Keith L. Parker.PlasmidsThe vectors CMVSF-1(8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BSK−(−776/+10)bLHβCAT(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pGL2 Control (Stratagene) have been described previously. CMVGH contains the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of the bovine growth hormone gene linked to the CMV promoter. Generation of BSK−(−776/+10)μGSEbLHβCAT was accomplished by using the polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase and the following primers: 5′-−605AAAGAGCCTAAATCATGCTCTTTGCTGGGT−576-3′ and 5′-−91CTCCCCGGGGGCGAGAGGCAGAACCATGGCGGGAGAGGCAAGAGT−135-3′, with the mutation highlighted. The resulting 514-bp product was cleaved with SmaI and subcloned into BSK−(−776/+10)bLHβCAT replacing the analogous wild type sequence. Sequencing confirmed polymerase chain reaction fidelity. Plasmids (−776/+10)bLHβluc and (−776/+10)μGSEbLHβluc were made by subcloning the HindIII promoter fragments from the CAT vectors into that site of pBasic (Stratagene).Cell CultureTransient transfection assays of αT3-1 cells were performed essentially as described(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except activation vectors (CMVGH or CMVSF-1) were also included at a concentration of 60 ng/35-mm well. All wells included an RSVβ-gal vector (0.42 μg/well) to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as reported with 15 μl of extract(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysNuclear extracts from αT3-1 cells were prepared as described(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with the following double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides: wild type GSE, 5′-CCTCTCCCTGACCTTGTCTGCCTCT-3′; μGSE, 5′-CCTCTCCCGCCATGGTTCTGCCTCT-3′, with the mutation highlighted. Nuclear extract (8.3 mg) was incubated with unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide competitors in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 25 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.2 μg of single-stranded DNA, and 0.2 μg of Escherichia coli DNA). Following 5 min at 4°C, 25 fmol of end-labeled probe was added for an additional 15 min at room temperature; 2 μl of rabbit anti-mouse SF-1 or nonimmune serum were then added. After 15 min, the samples were placed on ice and run on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 4°C.Transgenic MiceMice containing the wild type bLHβ promoter linked to CAT have been characterized previously(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liberation of the (−776/+10)μGSEbLHβCAT transgene fragment was accomplished with SalI/BamHI. Transgenic mouse production, identification, and characterization of tissue-specific expression was done as reported(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described with 10 μg of protein for 1 h(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay included control tissues from mice containing the wild type promoter.The intact/castrate/antide treatment paradigm was accomplished as follows. Male and female mice (6-11 weeks old) were divided into three groups for each sex. One group remained intact, received injections of antide vehicle (20% propylene glycol in normal saline) every 48 h, and animals were housed individually. The other two groups were gonadectomized under avertin anesthesia and treated with vehicle or 60 μg of antide every 48 h for 10 days(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On day 10, mice were killed and pituitaries and ventricular blood collected. CAT assays of 17.5 h duration were performed as above. All animal studies were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA Consensus SF-1 Binding Site Resides within the 5′ Flanking Regions of the Genes Encoding α, LHβ, and GnRH ReceptorSequence analysis of LHβ promoters from multiple species including teleosts and humans revealed conservation of a core sequence highly related to a canonical SF-1 binding site (Fig. 1). In some species, including bovine, the SF-1 homolog was identical to the GSE found in the human α subunit gene(13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This homolog was also present in the GnRH receptor gene, suggesting that the element may be functionally significant for genes uniquely expressed in gonadotropes. Although the GSE in the human α subunit gene binds SF-1 and thus is not gonadotrope-specific, the identity between this sequence and that in the LHβ promoter led us to retain the GSE nomenclature.The Bovine LHβ GSE Binds SF-1EMSA were performed with nuclear extracts from SF-1-containing αT3-1 cells (14.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to determine whether SF-1 binds the bovine LHβ GSE. Three complexes were detected with the wild type probe (Fig. 2). Each was eliminated by inclusion of 100-fold molar excess of homologous competitor, but not with 500-fold molar excess of a competitor containing an 8-bp mutation disrupting the SF-1 consensus (μGSE). Incubation with SF-1 antisera resulted in loss of the highest mobility band (indicated by the arrow), suggesting the presence of SF-1. Nonimmune serum had no effect, indicating that disruption of the complex was specific to the SF-1 antisera. A radiolabeled μGSE probe failed to detect the highest mobility band. Together, these data establish that the bovine GSE selectively binds SF-1.Figure 2:The bovine LHβ GSE binds SF-1. EMSA with αT3-1 nuclear extracts were performed with wild type (wt) or mutant (μ) GSE probes. Competitions were performed with either wild type or mutant GSE oligodeoxynucleotides at 50-, 100-, and 500-fold molar excess. Anti-SF-1 antisera or nonimmune serum (NS) were added to some reactions. The arrow denotes the presence of an SF-1-containing complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Overexpression of SF-1 Activates the LHβ Promoter in αT3-1 CellsThe endogenous LHβ gene is silent in αT3-1 cells, even though they have GnRH receptors and express the endogenous α subunit gene(21.Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The LHβ promoter is also inactive in transfection assays with this cell line(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is possibly due to a lack, or diminished concentration, of critical transcription factors. If SF-1 actually regulates the LHβ promoter, its overexpression might lead to activation of the promoter in these cells. Therefore, to assess functional significance of SF-1 binding to the putative LHβ GSE, cotransfection assays were performed in αT3-1 cells with the 776-bp bLHβ promoter linked to luciferase and a vector containing the CMV promoter directing expression of SF-1. Duplicate cotransfections with a CMV-growth hormone expression vector were used to establish specificity of an SF-1 response.As expected, activities of the wild type LHβ promoter (bLHβ) and a promoterless control were indistinguishable (data not shown). In contrast, overexpression of SF-1 resulted in ∼5-fold induction of bLHβ promoter activity relative to that obtained in the presence of the GH control (Fig. 3). Greater induction (∼8-fold; data not shown) was observed following addition of a constitutively active form of SF-1(22.Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Although the bLHβ promoter containing an 8-bp GSE mutation was 2-fold more active than the wild type promoter in the presence of GH, its response to SF-1 was negligible and equivalent to that observed with the heterologous SV40 promoter. Thus, much of the stimulatory effect of SF-1 is mediated through the GSE.Figure 3:Overexpression of SF-1 activates the LHβ promoter in αT3-1 cells. αT3-1 cells were cotransfected with various promoter/luciferase chimeric constructs and CMV expression vectors encoding either growth hormone (CMVGH) or SF-1 (CMVSF-1). The following reporter constructs were used: (−776/+10)bLHβluc, (−776/+10)μGSEbLHβluc, and pGL2Control, which contains the SV40 promoter linked to luciferase. Values are means ± S.E. for four transfections, each containing three plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)While SF-1 stimulated LHβ promoter activity only 5-fold, this was sufficient to establish a functional and statistically significant correlation between binding of SF-1 and transcriptional activation. A site-dependent effect of full-length SF-1 on other promoters has been difficult to establish. For example, Shen et al.(22.Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) only observed activation of the Müllerian inhibiting substance promoter with a truncated form of SF-1 devoid of the putative ligand binding domain. Similarly, the human α subunit promoter with an intact SF-1 binding site is refractory to overexpression of both full-length and truncated SF-1 (data not shown), and ablation of the SF-1 binding site in the human α subunit promoter reduces basal activity by only 50%(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that transcription effects of SF-1 may be dependent on promoter context. The level of SF-1-dependent activation observed with the LHβ promoter is also significant because overexpression of other proteins potentially involved in the GnRH signal transduction pathway, including constitutively active forms of Ras (23.Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Gαq (24.Hsieh K.-P. Martin T.F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect (data not shown). Thus, these transfection assays are the first to identify both a discrete promoter element and a transcription factor that regulate activity of the LHβ promoter.The GSE Is Essential for LHβ Promoter Activity in Transgenic MiceWe previously reported that the 776-bp bovine LHβ promoter conferred pituitary-specific expression to a CAT reporter gene in transgenic mice(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of this promoter in mice was much stronger than that observed in transfection assays, being approximately 160-fold more active than that of the 1500-bp human α subunit promoter(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, activity was completely penetrant (observed in all mice), occurred solely in gonadotropes, and was appropriately regulated by hormones, including GnRH, 17β-estradiol, and testosterone, which effect expression of the endogenous LHβ gene.Transgenic mice were made with the 776-bp LHβ promoter, containing the same GSE mutation used in the EMSA and transfection assays, linked to CAT. Integrity of the transgene in seven founders was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown), and lines were derived from five to obviate integration site effects. Activity of the μGSE-LHβ promoter in pituitary was reduced at least 10-fold when compared to activity in two lines of mice containing the wild type promoter (Fig. 4). No ectopic expression was observed in nine other tissues (data not shown).Figure 4:The GSE is essential for LHβ promoter activity in transgenic mice. Males (closed circles) and females (open circles) from two lines of mice containing the wild type bLHβCAT transgene (wt), or six lines of mice containing the bLHβμGSECAT transgene (denoted 1-6), were assessed for CAT activity in pituitary. Each circle represents an individual mouse. All mice were at least one generation from the founder animals except the mouse from line 6, which was the founder. All assays were performed with 10 μg of pituitary lysate for 1 h with CAT activity expressed as percent conversion/μg of protein/h. Mouse pituitaries containing the wild type or μGSE transgenes were assayed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activity of the wild type promoter tended to be higher in females than in males (Fig. 4). This trend continued with the mutant promoter, such that the occasional mouse having detectable CAT was always female. Thus, while mutation of the GSE has a substantial effect on activity of the LHβ promoter in both sexes, it may be even greater in male mice. From these results, we conclude that the SF-1 binding site (GSE) is required for full bLHβ promoter activity in pituitaries of transgenic mice.GnRH Cannot Compensate for Loss of the GSEQualitative rescue of LHβ mRNA results from GnRH treatment of SF-1-deficient mice maintained with exogenous adrenal steroids(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the loss of LHβ gene expression in those mice is due to an effect on GnRH secretion rather than a direct effect of SF-1 in gonadotropes. To determine if an increase in GnRH could rescue activity of the mutant bLHβ promoter, male and female transgenic mice were gonadectomized to promote a post-castration rise in GnRH that lies within a physiological range(2.Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocrin. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). An additional group were treated with the GnRH antagonist antide to confirm the efficacy of gonadectomy. To enhance detection of CAT, duration of the enzymatic assay was extended significantly from 1 to 17.5 h. This extended assay allowed detection of CAT activity in intact females containing the μGSE-LHβ promoter, although it was still 10-fold less than that observed with the wild type promoter (Fig. 5A). Activity of the mutant promoter in ovariectomized females was reduced to undetectable levels, suggesting that transgene was unresponsive to the expected post-gonadectomy rise in GnRH. In contrast, serum LH levels did respond to gonadectomy and antide treatments, confirming their effect on GnRH secretion. Interestingly, CAT activity in ovariectomized μGSE mice was reduced compared to the intact control. If the mutant promoter were simply unable to respond to GnRH, one would expect no change in expression. Thus, in the absence of a GnRH response, there may be an ovarian factor(s) that normally stimulates LHβ promoter activity. This factor may have previously escaped detection due to the usually large positive impact of GnRH.Figure 5:GnRH cannot compensate for loss of the GSE. Female (A) and male (B) mice from line 1 containing the bLHβμGSECAT transgene remained intact or were gonadectomized. The intact animals and a subset of gonadectomized mice were treated with vehicle, while another subset received antide. At the conclusion of the experiment, blood and pituitaries were collected for LH and CAT assays, respectively. All CAT assays were performed with 10 μg of protein for 17.5 h. CAT activity is expressed as percent conversion/100 μg of protein/h. Values are means ± S.E. for 5-6 animals/group. The shaded region in the lower portion of the figure represents the mean activity of multiple liver samples included in this assay (1.14 ± 0.14). Any values that approach this level are considered non-expressing. The activity of wild type mouse pituitaries was 49.8 ± 3.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to females, intact male mice containing the mutant promoter lacked any detectable CAT activity (Fig. 5B). Castration also failed to induce expression, whereas an antide-reversible increase in serum LH was observed. Thus, changes in GnRH were unable to compensate for loss of the GSE in the LHβ promoter in either sex. This result contrasts with those reported by Ikeda et al.(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where GnRH treatment of SF-1-deficient mice resulted in an unquantified activation of the endogenous LHβ gene. Several differences between the two studies render valid comparison difficult. Pharmacological doses of GnRH were used to treat the knock-out mice (11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the increase in GnRH observed in our mice should more accurately approximate physiological levels. In addition, the extent of disruption of the reproductive axis in mice lacking SF-1 is unclear, as is its possible impact on gonadotropin gene responsiveness to GnRH. Finally, it is possible that additional transcription factors could compensate for SF-1 at the level of the GSE. Removal of the GSE itself, which occurred with the mutant LHβCAT mice, would negate any potential compensatory mechanism. Precedence for such redundancy has been observed with transcription factors that are members of larger families, including MyoD (25.Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Stead R.H. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and cAMP response element-binding protein (26.Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Insertion of the mutant transgene into the background of the SF-1-deficient mouse may resolve these differences.In summary, the GSE within the bovine LHβ subunit promoter binds SF-1 with high affinity, mediates activation of transcription by SF-1 in vitro and is considerably important for full activity in gonadotropes of transgenic mice. This is the first complete characterization of an element important for expression of the LHβ subunit gene in gonadotropes and the first physiological demonstration of a functional requirement for an SF-1 binding site within any gene. Conservation of the SF-1 binding site in three of the genes that define a mature gonadotrope (α, LHβ, and GnRH receptor) may provide a unifying mechanism for their coordinated onset and maintenance of expression. INTRODUCTIONGonadotropes within the anterior pituitary are defined, in part, by their unique ability to synthesize and secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) 1The abbreviations used are: LHluteinizing hormoneFSHfollicle-stimulating hormoneGnRHgonadotropin-releasing hormoneGSEgonadotrope-specific elementbpbase pair(s)CMVcytomegalovirusEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These glycoprotein hormones contain an identical α subunit that heterodimerizes with unique β subunits(1.Fiddes J.C. Talmadge K. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1984; 40: 43-74PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of gonadotropin α and β subunit genes depends on secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus(2.Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocrin. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). GnRH responsiveness, in turn, requires that gonadotropes also express GnRH receptors(3.Conn P.M. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1815-1832Google Scholar). Thus, functional integrity and physiological control of mature gonadotropes relies on regulated expression of at least four genes: α, LHβ, FSHβ, and GnRH receptor.While a complex array of regulatory elements controls transcription of the α subunit gene in gonadotropes(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the elements regulating the genes encoding LHβ, FSHβ, or GnRH receptor remain undefined. This lag is due partly to weak activity of LHβ and FSHβ promoters when examined in cell culture models(5.Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kumar T.R. Fairchild-Huntress V. Low M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the promoter of the GnRH receptor gene has only recently been cloned(7.Albarracin C.T. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is a possibility that a single transcription factor may contribute to regulated expression of all four genes.One such candidate was revealed by gene-targeting studies directed at the Fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) gene that encodes steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and embryonal long terminal repeat-binding protein (ELP)(8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 10.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). SF-1 is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily initially identified as a transcription factor that controls expression of the cytochrome P-450 steroid hydroxylase genes in gonads and adrenal cortex(8.Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of FTZ-F1 results in an absence of the adrenal cortex(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), ovary(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), testes(9.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and gonadotropes (10.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This result was later attributed solely to the loss of the SF-1 encoding portion of the FTZ-F1 gene(12.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Schlosser D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1233-1239PubMed Google Scholar).Although all members of the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis are influenced by removal of the SF-1 gene, the mechanism responsible for gonadotrope deficiency remains unclear. This could be explained by a direct effect of SF-1 on gonadotrope development. Alternatively, if absence of the VMH attenuates secretion of GnRH, then gonadotropes would fail to develop(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A direct gonadotrope site of action of SF-1 is suggested by studies with the α subunit gene. All mammalian α subunit promoter regions examined to date contain a gonadotrope-specific element (GSE) (13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that has strong homology to SF-1 binding sites in steroid hydroxylase genes. This element in the human α promoter binds to SF-1 (14.Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and accounts for approximately 50% of its activity when analyzed after transfection in the gonadotrope-lineage cell line, αT3-1(4.Heckert L.L. Schultz K. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13.Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to evidence suggesting a direct pituitary effect of SF-1, an indirect hypothalamic site of action is supported by the recovery of detectable gonadotropin gene expression in GnRH-treated, SF-1 “knock-out” mice(11.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter finding implies that restoration of GnRH secretion may compensate for loss of SF-1 in gonadotropes. Thus, the exact role SF-1 plays in regulating expression of the genes that define the functional properties of gonadotropes remains to be determined.Herein, we address the functional significance of the SF-1 binding site found within the proximal 776-bp promoter-regulatory region of the bovine LHβ gene. This promoter directs high level expression of reporter genes specifically to gonadotropes in transgenic mice, is fully penetrant, and is appropriately regulated by GnRH and gonadal steroids(5.Keri R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2023179030,"Acid phosphatases (Acp) of intracellular pathogens have recently been implicated as virulence factors that enhance intracellular survival through suppression of the respiratory burst. We describe here the identification, purification, characterization, and sequencing of a novel burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase from the facultative intracellular bacterium, Francisella tularensis. Similar to other the burst-inhibiting Acps, F. tularensis Acp (AcpA) is tartrate-resistant and has broad substrate specificity. The AcpA enzyme is unique, however, in that it is easily released from the bacterial cell in soluble form, is a basic enzyme, suppresses the respiratory burst of not only fMet-Leu-Phe but also phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophils and does not fit into any of the three currently recognized classes of acid phosphatase. We also report the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene acpA, encoding AcpA, and the deduced primary structure of its encoded polypeptide. Comparative sequence analyses of AcpA is discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the cloning and sequencing of a burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the cloning and sequencing of a burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.2) are a ubiquitous class of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters at an acidic pH. In addition to mobilization of phosphate, some members of this class of enzymes perform many essential biological functions including regulation of metabolism, energy conversion, and signal transduction. These enzymes have been identified and characterized from many eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources and comprise several distinct subgroups based on substrate specificity, molecular weight, and sensitivity to known inhibitors. In the past decade, a new emphasis has been placed on understanding the role acid phosphatases may play in microbial pathogenesis. Comprehensive studies of acid phosphatases purified from Leishmania donovani(1.Remaley A.T. Das S. Campbell P.I. LaRocca G.M. Pope M.T. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 880-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Legionella micdadei(2.Saha A.K. Dowling J.N. LaMarco K.L. Das S. Remaley A.T. Olomu N. Pope M.T. Glew R.H. Arch. Biochem.

An exciting discovery in these studies was that TRAPs purified from these organisms suppressed the respiratory burst of activated human neutrophils(3.Glew R.H. Czuczman M.S. Diven W.F. Berens R.L.

Parasitol. 1986; 20: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although information is now becoming available about some of the enzymatic, biochemical, and biophysical properties of the burst-inhibiting TRAPs, unequivocal proof of the role of these enzymes as virulence factors in vivo has yet to be obtained. Progress toward this goal is currently limited by the lack of protein or gene sequence information and the absence of isogenic TRAP mutants.

Francisella tularensis is the etiologic agent of the potentially fatal human disease tularemia and is capable of survival and multiplication within a host's professional phagocytes as well as nonphagocytic cells(5.Anthony L.S.D. Burke R.D. Nano F.E. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3291-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Conlan J.W. North R.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many studies have been conducted into the host's immune response to Francisella infection, until recently relatively little attention has been focused on biochemical characterization of purified macromolecules which may function as virulence factors in these organisms(7.Nano F.E. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In initial studies, we found a particular strain of F. tularensis (ATCC 6223, B38) to be enriched in acid phosphatase activity. The Acp specific activity in this strain was greater than previously reported for any other bacterial or protozoan organism. It was also easily solubilized in the absence of detergents allowing relatively large amounts of enzyme to be purified to apparent homogeneity. We describe here the identification, purification, and characterization of some of the unique properties of this burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase (AcpA) as well as its complete primary structure derived from cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the AcpA gene (acpA). F. tularensis strains (ATCC 6223 and 29684) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and strain NDBR 101 LVS was obtained from The National Drug Company (Philadelphia, PA). Francisella novicida was purchased from the ATCC(15482). Strains of Mycobacteria were provided by Dr. John Urbance (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). Bacteriological media including Bacto Cystine Heart agar (CHA) and IsoVitalex were obtained from Baxter (McGraw Park, IL). All other chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Chromatography resins were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein electrophoresis reagents and ampholytes were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards were obtained from Integrated Separation Systems (Hyde Park, MA) or NOVEX (San Francisco, CA). Heteropolymolybdate complexes were gifts from Dr. Robert Glew (University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM). F. tularensis strains 6223, 29684, NDBR 101 LVS, and F. novicida were cultured on hemoglobin-enriched Bacto Cystine Heart agar for 1-5 days at 37°C. The organisms were passaged once after being received from ATCC; aliquots were then frozen at −80°C and used for inoculation of CHA for purification of the enzyme. Bacteria were harvested by scraping the cultures from the agar. Harvested material was suspended in 100 ml of buffer A (50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). Bacterial cultures from CHA were resuspended to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, 200-μl aliquots were added to api-ZYM® strips (bioMerieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, MO), the strips were incubated for 12 h at 37°C and then analyzed for semiquantitation of F. tularensis hydrolase activities according to the manufacturer's instructions. Acp activity was measured fluorometrically using an Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer. The 0.3-ml standard assay mixture contained 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 1.0 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP), and varying amounts of enzyme. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 15 min and 1.2 ml of 0.5 M glycine, pH 10, was added to stop the reaction. Under these conditions, enzyme activity was linear with the amount of enzyme added. During kinetic experiments, enzyme activity was linear with time for at least 60 min. Only initial rates (slopes within the first 15 min) were used for calculation of enzyme activity and associated kinetic parameters. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 nmol of substrate to product per h. Assays to determine the pH optimum were performed using either 0.2 M MES or 0.2 M HEPES as the buffer, and the final substrate concentration was 1.0 mM. Determination of the Michaelis-Menten constant for MUP and tyrosine phosphate was performed using 0.06 unit of AcpA and a wide range (Km/10 to 5 Km) of each substrate. Replicates of five were tested at each substrate concentration. Data were analyzed using a nonlinear, least squares regression computer program (8.Brooks S.P.J. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) graciously supplied by Dr Stephen P. J. Brooks, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine as described previously (9.Kurioka S. Matsuda M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity was determined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from phosphomonoester substrates (including MUP) using the method of Lanzetta et al.(10.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). This assay was also used for the determination of the pH optimum of AcpA for phosphomonoesters other than MUP. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates were assayed in the presence of 1.0% Triton X-100. A synthetic peptide p60src (TEPQpYQPGE) containing a single phosphorylated tyrosine was synthesized by the University of Illinois Genetic Engineering facility according to a previously described method(11.Tian H. Roeske R.W. Zhou M.-M. Van Etten R.L. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1993; 42: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purity of the peptide was assessed by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac 218TP54 analytical column, and the product was found to be 98% pure. Mass spectrometry analysis of the peptide gave the expected molecular ion, and the amino acid analysis was within 5% of the expected values in all cases. AcpA catalyzed dephosphorylation of the monophosphorylpeptide and determination of kinetic parameters were performed as described above. All procedures were conducted at 4°C unless otherwise noted. The bacterial culture (16 g obtained by scraping bacteria growth from 100 CHA plates (150 mm)) was suspended in buffer A and homogenized using a motor driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. An equal volume of an extraction buffer consisting of buffer A containing 2 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium cholate, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml Pepstatin A was added to the homogenate, the mixture was stirred for 12 h and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1.5 h. The supernatant, at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml, was dialyzed for 12 h at 4-6°C against three changes (6 liters each) of buffer A. This dialyzed supernatant, designated supernatant I, was again centrifuged at 200,000 × g to remove a precipitate which had formed during dialysis. This second supernatant, containing 97% of the starting activity, was designated supernatant II. Supernatant II (210 ml) was applied to a S-Sepharose cation exchange column (3 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 500 ml of buffer A and a 0-0.5 M linear NaCl gradient (600 ml) in buffer A was applied to the column at 0.5 ml/min. A single peak of phosphatase activity was eluted between 0.17 and 0.26 M NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrated sample was then applied and eluted (0.2 ml/min) from a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (1.5 × 95 cm) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.3 M NaCl. The sample eluted as a single peak, and fractions containing Acp activity were pooled and concentrated as described above. The sample (1.2 ml) was then applied in four separate 0.3-ml aliquots to a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 FPLC column and eluted with buffer A containing 0.3 M NaCl at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected, analyzed for Acp activity, and monitored for protein purity by SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity in fractions other than those two containing the highest activities were contaminated and thus not pooled. The purification results are summarized in Table 2. Iodination of AcpA was performed using IODOGEN (Pierce). Ten μg of pooled Acp from the Superdex 75 column was added to an IODOGEN-coated tube containing 10 μl of 0.5 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mCi of 125I. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 3 min, after which 200 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of KI was added to stop the reaction. Labeled enzyme was separated from unincorporated 125I by desalting on a GF-5 Excellulose column (Pierce Chemical Co.) pretreated with 1.0 ml of a 10 mg/ml suspension of BSA and equilibrated in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5. Void volume fractions containing radioactivity were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purified AcpA (719 μg) was dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, filter-sterilized, and emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. The immunogen was then injected subcutaneously at multiple sites into a New Zealand White rabbit. Twenty six days after primary immunization, the immune response was boosted by a single subcutaneous injection with 200 μg of purified AcpA emulsified in Ribi Adjuvant (Ribi Biologicals). Serum was collected by ear vein puncture 7 days following the second injection. Monospecific anti-AcpA antibodies (IgG) were purified from anti-AcpA antisera by repeated absorption and centrifugation with nonrelevant antigen as described previously(12.Shapiro S.Z. Black S.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3921-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonrelevant antigen used was either pellet I obtained following removal of supernatant I during purification of AcpA as described above or an E. coli Y1090 freeze-thaw extract. Anti-AcpA IgG was then purified from the adsorbed antiserum by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli(13.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204908) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were 3% T stacking and 7.5% T resolving. Molecular weight of acid phosphatase was estimated using NOVEX Mark 12 molecular weight standards and GelReader for Macintosh Version 2.0 software (University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications). Western blot detection of AcpA was performed as described previously(14.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44570) Google Scholar). Purified rabbit anti-F. tularensis AcpA antibody was used as the primary antibody (1:12,000 dilution), and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) was conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). Purified acid phosphatase (7.5 × 104 units) was applied to an LKB 8100 Ampholine apparatus in a 5-25% (w/w) linear sucrose gradient containing 4% (w/v) ampholytes (pH 3-10). Cathode and anode buffer were 1.0 M NaOH and 1.0 M H3PO4, respectively. Focusing was performed at 3 watts for 72 h at 15°C. The purified acid phosphatase was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry using a VG TofSpec mass spectrometer. Approximately 5 pmol of AcpA was embedded in a matrix of sinapinic acid and irradiated at 337 nm. The instrument is equipped with a 33 nm nitrogen laser with a 5-ns maximum pulse width, a 50-μJ minimum output, and a 150 × 250 micron spot size. Data acquisition and processing were performed by a VG OPUS data system and a VAXstation 4000 computer. Neutrophil-enriched cell fractions were isolated from freshly collected normal porcine blood (50 ml) as described previously(15.Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 7.23.1-7.23.3Google Scholar). The neutrophil fraction was resuspended in HEPES/NaCl buffer (200 mM HEPES, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.3) to 1 × 107 cells/ml and stored on ice until use (within 2 h of isolation) in respiratory burst assays. Respiratory burst activity of isolated porcine neutrophils was measured in the presence and absence of AcpA by following the production of superoxide using modifications of a previously described method(16.Newburger P.E. Chovaniec M.E. Cohen H.J. Blood. 1980; 55: 85-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm was continuously measured at 37°C using either a Beckman DU-50 spectrophotometer or an Aminco dual-beam recording spectrophotometer (DW 2000). The standard assay (0.4 ml) was performed in HEPES/NaCl buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.90 mM CaCl2, and 0.50 mM MgCl2, pH 6.8 instead of the modified Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline medium. O-2 production was initiated by either the addition of 1 μl of PMA (1 μg/μl in dimethyl sulfoxide) or 5 μl of fMLP (100 μM in dimethyl sulfoxide). The purified acid phosphatase sample used in these studies was also analyzed for superoxide dismutase activity(17.McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), catalase activity(18.Docampo R. de Boiso J.F. Boveris A. Stoppani A.O.M. Experientia. 1976; 32: 972-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and as a direct scavenger of superoxide using a xanthine oxidase assay(19.Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of AcpA was done as described previously(20.Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 45-73Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of AcpA was digested in the dark at 20°C for 20 h. The resultant peptide sample was analyzed by gel electrophoresis using 10-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Separated peptides were electroblotted to PVDF using standard conditions. The membrane was then partially destained, air-dried and submitted to the University of Illinois Molecular Genetics Facility for sequence analyses. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of AcpA was performed using automated Edman degradation and a model 470A Applied Biosystems gas phase Sequencer equipped with a 120A phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid analyzer by the Genetic Engineering Facility of the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. A nondegenerate oligonucleotide (5′-ACI GAT GTI AAT AAT III AAA CCI AAT GAT TAT GG-3′) was prepared (Applied Biosystems 319 DNA Synthesizer) by reverse translation of the N-terminal peptide sequence. The codon usage in the valAB locus of F. novicida(21.Mdluli K.E. Anthony L.S.D. Baron G.S. McDonald M.K. Myltseva S.V. Nano F.E. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used as a guide in designing the oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide was 3′-end-labeled (ECL 3′-oligolabeling system, Amersham) as per manufacturer's instructions and used to screen a F. tularensis ATCC 29684 genomic library of partial Sau3AI fragments cloned into the BamHI site of the phagemid vector pTZ18U (Bio-Rad). One of the hybridizing clones contained a 1.3-kilobase DNA insert. Partial sequencing of this insert revealed one open reading frame (ORF) with a deduced amino acid sequence identical with the N-terminal amino acid sequence and to the sequence of an internal CNBr-generated peptide. This insert was used as a probe to identify a 3.1-kilobase HindIII fragment of F. novicida DNA that was cloned into pUC18(22.Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (3769) Google Scholar). BLASTP and BLASTX (23.Altschul T.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (67184) Google Scholar) were used to search for amino acid sequence similarities among the data bases available on-line throughout the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Pairwise alignments were done using FASTA (24.Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar) and modified by inspection. A 1798-base pair region was sequenced on both strands using a commercial T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or Taq DNA polymerase (TaqTrack, Promega) using both universal and custom-designed primers. The gene encoding AcpA was designated acpA and was assigned the GenBank accession number L39831. We chose to sequence the F. novicida acpA gene to facilitate future genetic experiments which can most easily be done in F. novicida. Although 16 S RNA and DNA relatedness (25.Hollis D. Weaver R.E. Steigerwalt A.G. Wenger J.D. Moss C.W. Brenner D.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies clearly identify F. novicida as a F. tularensis strain(26.Forsman M. Sandström G. Sjöstedt A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), biohazard rules place strictures on the transfer of genes between F. novicida and F. tularensis. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent, Pierce) as described previously(27.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18216) Google Scholar). Human albumin/γ-globulin protein standard (Sigma) was used as a standard. Acid phosphatase specific activities varied markedly between species of Francisella and among strains of F. tularensis. F. tularensis strain 6223 displayed the highest specific activity. It was generally in excess of 18,000 units/mg (13,000 to 30,000) and represents, to our knowledge, the highest specific activity ever reported for a bacterial or protozoan acid phosphatase. In comparison to other Acp-enriched intracellular pathogens (Table 1), F. tularensis strain 6223 Acp specific activity is greater than 10 times that of L. micdadei(28.Saha A.K. Das S. Glew R.H. Gottlieb M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 329-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more than 4 times that of Coxiella burnetii strain PRS Q177 strain(29.Baca O.G. Roman M.J. Glew R.H. Christner R.F. Buhler J.E. Aragon A.S. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and about twice that of the protozoan parasite, L. donovani(3.Glew R.H. Czuczman M.S. Diven W.F. Berens R.L. Pope M.T. Katzsoulis D.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 72B: 581-590Google Scholar). Acp specific activity in strain NDBR 101 was 550 to 3089 units/mg, whereas strain 29684 Acp specific activity was only 100 units/mg. The Acp specific activity of F. novicida was approximately 1700 units/mg. The rather wide variation in acid phosphatase specific activity among members of the Francisella genus may correlate with the passage history of individual strains. During experiments aimed at optimizing expression of Acp, we observed a large decrease in Acp specific activity upon repeated passage of strain 6223 on CHA (data not shown). A loss of almost 90% (8-10-fold reduction) of the starting Acp specific activity was seen following 9 passages. The reduction was most likely not due to the accumulation of reversible inhibitors since washing the cells in physiological saline followed by extraction of Acp failed to increase Acp specific activity, and mixing of extracts from passaged cultures with purified AcpA did not result in the inhibition of the activity of the purified enzyme. Furthermore, detection of AcpA by Western blot analysis indicated a marked reduction in anti-AcpA reactive material following 9 passages as compared to that found in initial cultures (data not shown). Therefore, single passage F. tularensis(6223) was selected as the source for enzyme purification. In initial attempts to solubilize the enzyme, we found at least 70% of the phosphatase activity could be extracted with 1 M NaCl alone; including sodium cholate in the extraction buffer resulted in complete solubilization of the enzyme. Furthermore, essentially no difference in total AcpA activity was observed in the extracted material compared to the activity exhibited by intact bacteria (Table 2). All of the enzymatic activity detected in intact bacteria was solubilized by the cholate NaCl extraction buffer and remained in the supernatant following extensive dialysis and two centrifugations (200,000 × g, 1.5 h). The soluble AcpA was completely retained during loading at pH 6 on cation exchange resins S-Sepharose and Mono S and eluted as a single peak of activity between 0.17 M and 0.26 M NaCl (Fig. 14A). AcpA eluted in the breakthrough volume, however, during attempted anion exchange chromatography on either Q-Sepharose or Mono Q at pH 7.3. The material recovered from cation exchange chromatography was enriched 32-fold in acid phosphatase activity and contained 94% of the starting activity. Gel filtration chromatography through Sephadex G-100 superfine (Fig. 1B) resulted in an additional 13-fold increase in specific activity with 83% recovery of the applied activity. Final purification of the enzyme was achieved by gel filtration FPLC (Fig. 1 C). This step resulted in a further 1.7-fold increase in specific activity with 26% of the sample recovered in a single protein peak coincident with AcpA activity. The apparently low recovery from the FPLC column is explained by the conservative pooling of AcpA active fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The actual recovery was approximately 75%, but only the two fractions containing the highest AcpA activity were pooled for further analyses. Overall, AcpA was purified 713-fold over that in intact bacteria (Table 2). The purification behavior of AcpA from strains 6223, NDBR 101, and 29684 and the results of comparative molecular weight (Fig. 2A) and immunoreactivity with rabbit anti-Ft(6223) AcpA IgG (Fig. 2B) suggested the enzyme is very similar in all strains of F. tularensis. Also, the enzyme activity chromatographed as a single entity throughout all purification steps suggesting that multiple acid phosphatases may not exist in F. tularensis in contrast to the results reported for some other facultative intracellular organisms(1.Remaley A.T.

The purity of AcpA was assessed in several experiments. 1) SDS-PAGE of samples obtained throughout the purification procedure demonstrate the presence of an ~57-kDa protein which was continuously enriched as the purification proceeded and electrophoresed as a single Coomassie Blue or silver (data not shown)-stained band following recovery from the final FPLC gel filtration step (Fig. 1D). 2) In an effort to visualize minor protein contaminants or those which may be refractory to staining, the purified AcpA fraction (Superdex 75 fraction) was radioiodinated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the 125I-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. A single major band was seen on autoradiographs as increasing amounts of the radiolabeled AcpA fraction were applied to the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3). This band, comprising 98% of the total signal as measured by quantitative densitometry, had a molecular weight of approximately 57,000. 3) N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis through the first 20 amino acids revealed the presence of a single threonine residue at the N terminus of the sequence (TDVNNSKPNDYGTLVKIEQK). The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by gel filtration chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight MS. Superdex 75 FPLC gel filtration chromatography gave a partition coefficient for AcpA of 0.09 (Fig. 4A). This value was compared to the regression line generated from the four molecular weight standards, and the Kav corresponded to an apparent molecular weight of 56,000. A similar value, 57,000, was obtained with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B) using both reducing and nonreducing conditions (data not s"

In this study, we show that TGF-β transcriptionally represses both basal and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced collagenase (matrix metalloprotease-1) gene expression in dermal fibroblasts in culture, whereas it activates its expression in epidermal keratinocytes. We demonstrate that this differential effect of TGF-β on collagenase gene expression is due to a cell type-specific induction of distinct oncogenes of the Jun family, which participate in the formation of AP-1 complexes with different trans-activating properties. Specifically, our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of TGF-β in fibroblasts is likely to be mediated by jun-B, based on the following observations: (a) TGF-β induces high levels of jun-B expression and (b) over-expression of jun-B mimics TGF-β effect in inhibiting basal collagenase promoter activity and preventing tumor necrosis factor-α-induced trans-activation of the collagenase promoter. In contrast, TGF-β induction of collagenase gene expression in keratinocytes is preceded by transient elevation of c-jun proto-oncogene expression. Over-expression of c-jun leads to trans-activation of the collagenase promoter in both cell types, suggesting that c-jun is a ubiquitous inducer of collagenase gene expression. Transfection of keratinocytes with an antisense c-jun construct together with a collagenase promoter/reporter gene construct inhibits basal and TGF-β-induced up-regulation of the collagenase promoter activity, implying that c-jun mediates TGF-β effect in this cell type. Collectively, our data suggest differential signaling pathways for TGF-β in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes, leading to cell type-specific induction of two AP-1 components with opposite transcriptional activities.

Matrix metalloproteases comprise a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue (for reviews see (1.Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar) and (2.Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)). These enzymes play a critical role in a number of physiological and pathological processes involving connective tissue remodeling and/or destruction, as exemplified by embryonic development, wound repair, tumor metastasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Breakdown of the fibrillar collagen network is initiated by interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloprotease-1), whereas the other components of the matrix are degraded primarily by stromelysins and gelatinases. The expression of matrix metalloproteases by connective tissue cells is modulated by a variety of cytokines and growth factors(2.Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).

In contrast, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to inhibit fibroblast collagenase gene expression through Jun-B-dependent mechanisms(3.Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas it inhibits the expression of transin, the rat homologue of stromelysin, through Fos-mediated mechanisms(4.Kerr L.D.

Recent in vivo observations have revealed that during cutaneous wound healing, the expression of collagenase is very low in the dermis, whereas it is markedly elevated in basal keratinocytes at the wound edges(5.Saarialho-Kere U. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this context, the close topographic proximity of fibroblasts and keratinocytes led us to investigate in vitro the signals that would be responsible for the differential, cell type-specific expression of collagenase during wound healing. We report that TGF-β, a growth factor with essential wound healing promoting activities(6.Barnard J.A. Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar, 8.Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

Immun. 1992; 12: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), is a potent inhibitor of collagenase gene expression in fibroblasts, whereas it strongly up-regulates collagenase expression in keratinocytes. We demonstrate that cell-specific induction of different oncogenes of the Jun family, with opposite trans-activating properties, is responsible for the differential regulation of collagenase gene expression by TGF-β in fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Human dermal fibroblast cultures, established by explanting tissue specimens obtained from neonatal foreskins, were utilized in passages 3-8. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and antibiotics (50 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 units/ml penicillin-G, 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone). One hour prior to the addition of growth factors, the confluent fibroblast cultures were rinsed with DMEM and placed in DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum. Human epidermal keratinocytes obtained by explanting foreskin specimens, were grown in serum-free, low calcium (0.15 mM), keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin, and bovine pituitary extract (KGM, Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA), and utilized in passage 1 to avoid differentiation inherent to subculturing of these cells. One hour prior to the experiments, the confluent keratinocyte cultures were placed in fresh KGM. Human recombinant TGF-β2 was a generous gift from Dr. David R. Olsen (Celtrix Laboratories, Santa Clara, CA). Human recombinant TNF-α was purchased from Boehinger Mannheim. At the end of incubation with growth factors, cell cultures were subjected to isolation of total RNA as described previously(10.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62682) Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated in 0.8% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and analyzed by Northern hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA probes(11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The [32P]cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography, and the steady-state levels of mRNA were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a He-Ne laser scanner at 633 nm (LKB Produkter, Bromma, Sweden). The following cDNAs were used for Northern hybridizations to detect specific mRNA transcripts: a 2.0-kilobase pair human collagenase cDNA(12.Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Gregory I. Goldberg (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was used in control hybridizations to normalize for differences in the loading and transfer of RNA(13.Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Danz C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). For c-jun, we used a full-length human cDNA in pRSVe expression vector(14.Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar); and for jun-B, a full-length cDNA in pRSVe expression vector(14.Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), both kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin (UCSD, La Jolla, CA). To study the transcriptional regulation of collagenase gene expression, the following plasmid construct was used in transient transfection experiments: pCLCAT3, which contains ~3.8 kilobase pairs of 5‘-flanking DNA of human collagenase gene linked to the CAT reporter gene(15.Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Steven M. Frisch (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). The oncogene expression vectors described above were used in co-transfection experiments. Empty pRSVe was used as filling plasmid in order to transfect the same amount of DNA in every cell plate. To prepare an antisense c-jun construct, a fragment spanning the region +451 to +617 of the c-jun gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR amplimers were cloned into a PCRII plasmid vector (InVitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), and the clones containing the insert were sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the PCR amplification. The PCR products were then inserted in an antisense orientation as XhoI-HindIII fragments into the pRSVe expression vector in order to generate the construct pRSV-ASc-jun. Human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts in late logarithmic growth phase were transfected with 1-20 μg of plasmid constructs co-transfected with a RSV-promoter/β-galactosidase construct to allow determination of the transfection efficiency(11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The transfections were performed with the calcium-phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method (16.Graham F. Van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6441) Google Scholar) followed by a 1.5-min glycerol (15%) shock. Following the glycerol shock, the cells were placed in medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum prior to the addition of growth factors. Basal keratinocytes grown in KGM were transfected with a liposome-based method (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Five hours after transfections, the medium was replaced with fresh KGM, and growth factors were added 2 h later for a 40-h incubation. At the end of incubation, the cells were harvested and lysed by thee cycles of freeze-thawing in 100 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Aliquots corresponding to identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each CAT assay with [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate(17.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5280) Google Scholar). To generate stably transfected cultures of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, pRSV-ASc-jun was co-transfected with pRc/CMV (InVitrogen), which expresses the neomycin resistance gene, in a 10:1 ratio. Four days after transfections, G418 (800 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the culture medium for selection of transfected cells. Fifteen days later, stably transfected cultures of pRSV-ASc-jun NIH3T3 were established by pooling the G418-resistant clones. Control cultures were transfected with pRc/CMV and empty pRSVe to generate pRSVeNIH3T3 cultures. In the first set of experiments, human adult skin fibroblasts were incubated for 24 h without or with TGF-β or TNF-α, both at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. At the end of incubation, RNA was extracted and analyzed for collagenase gene expression by Northern hybridization. Visual observation of the autoradiograms indicated that TGF-β markedly down-regulated both basal and TNF-α-induced elevation of collagenase mRNA steady-state levels in parallel fibroblast cultures (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of the autoradiograms by scanning densitometry and correction against GAPDH mRNA levels in the corresponding RNA preparations indicated that the expression of collagenase in TGF-β-treated cultures was reduced by ~80% in comparison with control fibroblast cultures. TNF-α enhanced collagenase mRNA levels by ~6-fold, but in cultures treated concomitantly with TNF-α and TGF-β, the levels were reduced by ~75% in comparison with cultures treated with TNF-α alone (Fig. 1B). In the second set of experiments, confluent keratinocyte cultures were incubated for 24 h without or with TGF-β and/or TNF-α at concentrations of either 1 or 10 ng/ml. Contrasting with its inhibitory effect observed in dermal fibroblasts, TGF-β was found to be a potent enhancer of keratinocyte collagenase gene expression (Fig. 2, second and third lanes). On the other hand, TNF-α, which is a potent enhancer of collagenase gene expression in fibroblasts (see Fig. 1), had little effect on the basal expression of collagenase in keratinocytes (Fig. 2, fifth and sixth lanes) and a minimal effect on the induction exerted by TGF-β (Fig. 2, fourth lane). Quantitation of the autoradiograms after normalization of collagenase mRNA levels against those of GAPDH showed a 4.5-5-fold elevation of collagenase mRNA steady-state levels upon TGF-β stimulation, whereas TNF-α did not stimulate collagenase expression (Fig. 2B). Additional experiments with various concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) of TGF-β indicated a stimulatory effect with as little as 0.1 ng/ml (~2.8-fold); whereas maximal elevation of collagenase mRNA levels (~6-fold) was observed with 1 ng/ml of TGF-β, no further enhancement was noted with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β (not shown). Transient cell transfections with a collagenase promoter/CAT reporter gene construct were performed to examine whether TGF-β regulates collagenase mRNA steady-state levels through modulation of transcription at the promoter level. Human neonatal fibroblasts were transfected with the collagenase promoter/CAT construct pCLCAT3 and treated with TGF-β or TNF-α both at 10 ng/ml concentration. Assay of CAT activity after 40 h of incubation indicated that TGF-β reduced the promoter activity by 40-60%, as compared with that of control cultures (Fig. 3). Also TGF-β counteracted TNF-α-induced elevation of the collagenase promoter activity. In another set of experiments, confluent keratinocyte cultures were transfected with the same collagenase promoter/CAT reporter gene construct and treated with various doses of TGF-β (0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) for 40 h. Assay of CAT activity revealed a dose-dependent elevation of the promoter activity (Fig. 4) with a maximal stimulation (~4-fold) observed with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β. Thus, the enhancement of collagenase gene expression in keratinocytes by TGF-β and its inhibition in fibroblasts, as detected at the mRNA level, was mediated, at least in part, by cell was type-specific modulation of the promoter activity. It has been previously reported that the expression of c-jun is induced by cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1 (18.Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 19.Conca W. Kaplan P.B. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and represents a fundamental intermediate step in cytokine induction of other cellular genes, including those encoding collagenase or stromelysin (reviewed in (1.Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar) and (2.Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 5, TNF-α rapidly (within 1 h of incubation) enhanced the expression of c-jun in dermal fibroblasts (lane 4), and the induction persisted even after 6 h of incubation (lane 5). Also, the steady-state levels of jun-B mRNAs were elevated but to a lesser extent than those for c-jun (lane 4). TGF-β alone did not affect either the basal expression of c-jun (lane 7) or the induction of c-jun by TNF-α (lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, TGF-β, either alone or in combination with TNF-α, strongly elevated the expression of jun-B (lanes 7 and 9), which persisted for at least up to 6 h following the initiation of stimulation (lanes 8 and 10). It appears, therefore, that in fibroblasts, TGF-β counteracts TNF-α-induced collagenase gene expression, but this effect is not due to repression of c-jun transcription. At the same time, TNF-α did not alter the expression of jun-B induced by TGF-β. Accordingly, TGF-β stimulation led to a dramatic reduction of the c-jun/jun-B mRNA ratio in fibroblasts, from 1.7 to 0.1 and 0.2 after 1 and 6 h of stimulation, respectively (Fig. 6). In contrast, TNF-α elevated the c-jun/jun-B mRNA ratio due to a substantially higher stimulation of c-jun versus jun-B. When TGF-β was added simultaneously with TNF-α, the c-jun/jun-B mRNA ratio remained at levels that were ~60-70% lower than observed with TNF-α alone (Fig. 6). Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the c-jun/jun-B mRNA ratio and the level of collagenase expression, suggesting that the modification of the ratio of c-jun/jun-B mRNA is likely to reflect a reduction of the relative amounts of c-Jun versus those of Jun-B when TGF-β is present, leading to reduced collagenase gene transcription. Subsequently, we tested the pattern of expression of oncogenes of the Jun family in the presence of TGF-β in epidermal keratinocytes. Contrasting with its lack of effect in fibroblasts, TGF-β induced high levels of c-jun expression in keratinocytes, with a maximum enhancement at 1 h following growth factor stimulation (Fig. 7). The high levels of c-jun mRNAs persisted at least 6 h post-stimulation and preceded the induction of collagenase expression. In contrast, the basal expression of jun-B was very low and, although expression was enhanced after 1 h of incubation with TGF-β, it remained well below the level of expression of c-jun. In fact, using 32P-labeled cDNA probes with similar specific activities (~2 × 107 cpm/μg), a 48-h exposure of the autoradiogram was necessary to detect the low jun-B expression, whereas a 14-h exposure was sufficient to easily detect c-jun expression (Fig. 7). Therefore, in keratinocytes, after TGF-β stimulation, the ratio c-jun/jun-B is largely in favor of c-jun, ~25-fold more c-jun mRNA than jun-B at 1 h after addition of TGF-β, as estimated by scanning densitometry of the autoradiograms, correction for GAPDH mRNA levels in the RNA preparations, and differences in the exposure times of the autoradiograms. These data contrast the reverse situation observed in dermal fibroblasts in which jun-B expression is boosted by TGF-β treatment (see above, Figure 5:, Figure 6:). It should be noted that the extent of stimulation of collagenase gene expression as detected at the mRNA level (~15-fold after 6 h) was more pronounced than the induction of promoter activity observed in transient cell transfection experiments (see Fig. 4). It is conceivable that TGF-β, in addition to activating the collagenase promoter, may also increase collagenase gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as stabilization of the corresponding mRNA, as described previously for phorbol esters or epidermal growth factor(20.Brinckerhoff C.E. Plucinska I.M. Sheldon L.A. O'Connor G.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6378-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Delany A.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In view of the data described above, it appears that in both cell types studied, enhanced collagenase gene expression correlates with a preceding elevation of c-jun mRNA levels due to TNF-α stimulation in fibroblasts and to TGF-β stimulation in keratinocytes, respectively. We therefore tested whether over-expression of c-jun could trans-activate the collagenase promoter in both cell types. For this purpose, pCLCAT3 was co-transfected with either an RSV/c-jun expression vector or an empty RSVe vector as a control. Over-expression of c-jun in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes led to trans-activation of the collagenase promoter, as reflected by measurement of CAT activity in the different cell extracts. The extent of stimulation of the collagenase promoter was similar in both cell types: 5.3 ± 0.7-fold (n = 8) in fibroblasts versus 4.9 ± 0.9-fold (n = 6) in keratinocytes. In contrast, over-expression of jun-B resulted in reduced collagenase promoter activity in both cell types (not shown), attesting to the specificity of the expression vectors, as expected from previous observations by us and others(3.Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Control (pRSVeNIH3T3) and pRSV-ASc-junNIH3T3 fibroblast cultures (see “Materials and Methods”) were grown to confluency. Three hours prior to the addition of growth factors, the confluent fibroblast cultures were rinsed with DMEM and placed in DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum. The cultures were then treated for 6 h with either TNF-α or TGF-β, both at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, prior to Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, significant expression of both c-jun and jun-B was noted in unstimulated pRSVeNIH3T3 cultures (lane 1). TNF-α strongly elevated c-jun expression, and jun-B to a lesser extent (lane 2). TGF-β slightly elevated jun-B expression but had no effect on c-jun mRNA levels (lane 3). pRSV-ASc-junNIH3T3 cultures showed very little basal expression of c-jun (lanes 4), about 7% of that observed in control cultures, as measured by scanning densitometry and after correction for GAPDH mRNA levels in the same RNA preparations, whereas the basal levels of jun-B mRNA were similar to those of control cultures. TNF-α did not elevate c-jun mRNAs in pRSV-ASc-jun-transfected cultures, but the induction of jun-B by both TNF-α and TGF-β was similar to that observed in control cultures (Fig. 8, fifth and sixth lanes versus first and second lanes), indicating that the cells are still responsive to growth factors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that pRSV-ASc-jun prevents both basal and TNF-α-induced c-jun expression, whereas the construct has no effect on the expression and regulation of jun-B expression. Interestingly, no expression of collagenase was detected in pRSV-ASc-junNIH3T3 cultures, even after TNF-α stimulation, indicating that c-jun is fundamental for both basal and cytokine-induced collagenase gene expression. Also, these data demonstrate that the c-jun antisense construct can block c-Jun-mediated transcription. We have shown that TGF-β stimulates c-jun expression prior to inducing collagenase gene expression in keratinocytes and that over-expression of c-jun by the mean of transfected expression vectors leads to trans-activation of the collagenase promoter in keratinocytes (see above). We therefore wished to examine whether the stimulatory effect of TGF-β was directly mediated by c-jun. For this purpose, pRSV-ASc-jun was co-transfected with pCLCAT3 into basal keratinocytes, prior to stimulation with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 9, the basal activity of the collagenase promoter was markedly reduced by the antisense c-jun (by about 70%), which implies a role for c-jun in the basal expression of collagenase in keratinocytes. Furthermore, antisense c-jun prevented stimulation of collagenase promoter activity by TGF-β (Fig. 9), suggesting that c-jun induction is an essential step for collagenase gene activation by TGF-β in keratinocytes. Several studies have shown differences in the pattern of expression and response to extracellular stimuli between c-jun and jun-B in a variety of experimental systems(3.Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W.

Furthermore, considerable differences in their trans-activation and transforming activities have been reported(3.Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr.

For example, whereas c-Jun is an efficient activator of the c-jun and collagenase promoters that contain a single TRE, Jun-B is not. In addition, Jun-B counteracts activation of these promoters by c-Jun. However, like c-Jun, Jun-B is a potent activator of constructs containing multimeric TREs. These differences in the biological actions of the two Jun proteins are due to intrinsic differences in their activation and DNA-binding domains (14.Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 27.Deng T. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), allowing fine tuning of the regulation of TRE-driven genes. The regulatory role of the different Jun proteins is further emphasized by the fact that the corresponding genes are not coordinately expressed in different tissues, as shown in adult mice and during embryogenesis (24.Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Development. 1989; 106: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hirai S.I. Ryseck R.P. Mechta F. Bravo R. Yaniv M.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1959-1964PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of TRE-driven target genes. In this context, it has been recently shown that jun-B and c-jun are selectively up-regulated and functionally implicated in the development of fibrosarcoma(30.Bossy-Wetzel E. Bravo R. Hanahan D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2340-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that in different inducible systems, increased specificity and precise regulation of TRE-driven transcriptional activation is achieved by interactions between positive and negative transcription factors that belong to the same gene family. In this study, we have provided the following evidence for a mediation of the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on fibroblast collagenase gene expression by Jun-B: (a) TGF-β induces high levels of jun-B expression; (b) jun-B expression vectors mimic TGF-β action in our experimental system by inhibiting basal collagenase promoter activity and by exerting an antagonistic effect on TNF-α-induced collagenase gene expression. On the other hand, we have demonstrated that TGF-β stimulates collagenase gene expression in keratinocytes and that this effect is mediated by c-jun, as follows: (a) TGF-β induces high levels of c-jun expression; (b) c-jun expression vectors trans-activate the collagenase promoter; (c) antisense c-jun expression vectors prevent TGF-β activation of collagenase gene expression. A schematic diagram depicting the differential effects of TGF-β on collagenase gene expression in fibroblasts and keratinocytes is shown in Fig. 10. These results are the first evidence of differential induction of two oncogenes with opposite trans-activation properties upon stimulation by a single growth factor, TGF-β, in two different cell types within the same tissue, the skin. TGF-β has been shown to reduce collagenase gene expression and activity in cultured fibroblasts. This inhibition results from two distinct mechanisms: (a) TGF-β reduces the expression of the collagenase gene and (b) the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases is elevated by TGF-β(31.Edwards D.R. Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Whitham S.E. Docherty A.J.P. Angel P. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the concept of TGF-β as a potent inhibitor of matrix remodeling is cell type-specific because this growth factor is a potent activator of collagenase gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes in culture. In that respect, TGF-β has been shown previously to up-regulate both 92- and 72-kDa gelatinase activity and gene expression in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes(32.Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Salo T. Lyons J.G. Rahemtulla F. Birkedal-Hansen H. Larjava H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11436-11441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated using in situ hybridization in ulcerative skin lesions such as pyogenic granulomas that collagenase is expressed near the advancing edge of the ulceration, within the disrupted epidermis adjacent to an ulcer(5.Saarialho-Kere U. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). By contrast, no hybridization signal was detected within the dermis or normal, intact epidermis. Therefore, basal keratinocytes seem to be the primary source of collagenase during wound healing, suggesting that keratinocytes play an essential role in tissue remodeling. It has been suggested that the signals that activate collagenase in keratinocytes are provided by the dermal extracellular matrix. In agreement with this hypothesis is the fact that keratinocytes grown on type I collagen exhibit enhanced collagenase production(34.Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 97: 341-346Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of fibroblast collagenase expression may be mediated by soluble factors such as interleukin-1 or TNF-α, rather than by the extracellular matrix. Skin injury is accompanied by release of interleukin-1, which in turn may activate fibroblasts but not keratinocytes to produce collagenase(34.Petersen M.J. Woodley D.T. Stricklin G.P. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 97: 341-346Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our data provide an alternative model for the cell-specific activation of collagenase gene expression during wound healing in which TGF-β, which is present in abundant amounts in the healing wound bed, could simultaneously turn off the expression of collagenase in fibroblasts while activating that of keratinocytes directly in contact with the dermis. We hypothesize that collagenase-secreting keratinocytes, possibly in response to TGF-β, may be able to migrate to close the wound. This hypothesis is supported indirectly by a previous study indicating that TGF-β stimulates the outgrowth of epidermal cells from skin explant cultures(35.Hebda P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 440-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study has provided the first evidence for cell type-specific, differential induction of two transcription factors of the same family with antagonistic trans-activation properties, leading to opposite regulation of collagenase gene expression in fibroblasts and keratinocytes by TGF-β. We express our gratitude to Drs. Michael Karin, David R. Olsen, Gregory I. Goldberg, and Steven M. Frisch, who provided constructs and reagents essential for completion of this study, to Drs. John Moore, Jr., and James Fox IV, who kindly provided tissue for cell cultures, and to Lin Lin for expert technical assistance."

We previously demonstrated that parathyroid hormone induces expression by osteoblasts of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor without affecting the 16 other cytokines that were examined. We also showed that stimulation of osteoclast activity by parathyroid hormone is dependent on activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway and secretion of interleukin-6 by osteoblasts. In the current study, we demonstrate that the rapid and transient stimulation of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor is inhibited by actinomycin D and superinduced by protein synthesis inhibitors, the classical characteristics of an immediate-early gene response. Moreover, activation of cAMP signal transduction by parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein is necessary and sufficient to induce both interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. In addition, cAMP analogues as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide and isoproterenol, two neuropeptides that stimulate bone resorption by activating cAMP signal transduction in osteoblasts, also induce interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor in these cells. Taken together with our previous results, this study suggests that interleukin-6 is crucial for stimulation of bone resorption not only by parathyroid hormone, but also by parathyroid hormone-related protein, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and β-adrenergic agonists, like isoproterenol.

INTRODUCTIONExcessive skeletal loss is caused by a disturbance in the normal balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts, and bone formation by osteoblasts. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate these processes is fundamental to the understanding of the pathogenesis of bone loss that occurs in conditions such as osteoporosis. In addition to forming bone, osteoblasts appear to mediate the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1The abbreviations used are: PTHparathyroid hormoneILinterleukinLIFleukemia inhibitory factorPTHrPPTH-related proteinVIPvasoactive intestinal peptideVIP-A[4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP8-Br-cAMP8-bromo-cAMPRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionEuendotoxin unit(s). and other resorptive agents(1.Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 2.Horowitz M.C. Science. 1993; 260: 626-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This concept is best supported by evidence that many agents, including PTH, stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts that are cultured in the presence of osteoblasts but not by osteoclasts that are cultured alone. In most cases, resorption is also stimulated if the osteoblasts are replaced by conditioned media from osteoblasts activated by the resorptive agents. It is therefore thought that the primary effect of the resorptive agents is to stimulate osteoblasts to produce soluble cytokines that activate the osteoclasts.We previously examined the effect of PTH on expression by osteoblasts of mRNAs encoding 18 cytokines, and found that of these only interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were stimulated by the hormone(3.Greenfield E.M.

Soc. 1996; 21: 337Google Scholar). Maximal stimulation was approximately 50-fold for IL-6 and approximately 10-fold for LIF. PTH also stimulates secretion by osteoblasts of both IL-6(3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner.

Lack of stimulation of IL-6 and LIF by PTH in particular cell preparations is therefore likely due to investigation of osteoblasts at different developmental stages or lack of sensitivity of the methods used. Thus, such results should not be interpreted to mean that PTH does not in general stimulate IL-6 or LIF in osteoblasts (reviewed in (3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)).Our previous detailed time course studies showed that stimulation by PTH of IL-6 and LIF mRNA expression was both rapid and transient in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, primary rat osteoblasts, and in vivo osteoblasts(3.Greenfield E.M.

J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 and LIF mRNA levels were maximal 30-60 min after stimulation and returned to baseline within 4-6 h; a pattern that is typical for immediate-early gene responses (12.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

In the current study, we show that the stimulation of IL-6 and LIF by PTH is inhibited by actinomycin D and superinduced by protein synthesis inhibitors, the distinguishing characteristics of an immediate-early gene response(12.Herschman H.R.

Cell Physiol. 1992; 152: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the realization that PTH stimulates IL-6 and LIF expression led to the suggestion that production of these cytokines might be involved in stimulation of resorption by a variety of agents, including PTH(3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In confirmation of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that an antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor can block osteoclast activation induced by PTH(17.Greenfield E.M. Shaw S.M. Gornik S.A. Banks M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The importance of IL-6 is underscored by recent findings that implicate the cytokine in the increased bone resorption that occurs during estrogen withdrawal, Paget's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, hypercalcemia of malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, and Gorham-Stout disease (reviewed in (18.Greenfield E.M. Davidovitch Z. Norton L.A. Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Movement and Craniofacial Adaptation. EBSCO Media, Birmingham1996Google Scholar)).PTH-related protein (PTHrP), which is responsible for most cases of hypercalcemia of malignancy(19.Martin T.J. Mundy G.R. Martin T.J. Physiology and Pharmacology of Bone. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 617-639Google Scholar), also induces IL-6 secretion by osteoblasts(6.Lowik C. van der Pluijm G. Bloys H. Hoekman K. Bijvoet O.

Oppenheim J.J. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cytokines. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 471-476Google Scholar). PTHrP and PTH utilize the same receptor to activate both the classical adenyl cyclase pathway as well as the phospholipase C pathway(20.Dunlay R. Hruska K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F223-F231PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Abou-Samra A.-B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong Z.-F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Adenyl cyclase produces cAMP to activate protein kinase A, while phospholipase C produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol to activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase and protein kinase C, respectively. In order to fully understand the mechanism of action of PTH and PTHrP, it is important to clarify which signal transduction pathways are involved in the response of interest. PTH-(3-34), a truncated form of PTH, activates phospholipase C without stimulating cAMP production and can, therefore, be employed to determine whether cAMP signal transduction is involved in a particular response(22.Herrmann-Erlee M.P.M. Nijweide P.J. van der Meer J.M. Ooms M.A.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23.Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We (17.Greenfield E.M. Shaw S.M. Gornik S.A. Banks M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and others (22.Herrmann-Erlee M.P.M. Nijweide P.J. van der Meer J.M. Ooms M.A.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have utilized this partial agonist to show that activation of the cAMP pathway in osteoblasts is required for stimulation of resorption by PTH. Other workers have reached the same conclusion using inhibitors of the cAMP pathway(24.Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Fukase M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25.Ljunggren O. Ljunghall S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Because stimulation of resorption by PTH depends on activation of the cAMP pathway and on IL-6 production, it is important to determine whether IL-6 production depends on cAMP signaling. Activation of either the protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or intracellular calcium pathways can stimulate IL-6 and LIF expression by osteoblasts (26.Girasole G. Jilka R.L. Passeri G. Boswell S.

Nonetheless, it is unknown which pathways are required for stimulation of IL-6 by PTH and PTHrP. In this study, we employed PTH-(3-34) to distinguish between these pathways. We show here that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway in osteoblasts is required for stimulation of IL-6 and LIF gene expression by PTH and PTHrP. Moreover, osteoblastic cAMP signaling is also required for stimulation of IL-6 and LIF by two other bone resorptive agents, namely vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and isoproterenol.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll reported data are representative of multiple experiments. PTH, PTHrP, VIP, and their analogues were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA); RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, cAMP analogues, and β-adrenergic reagents were from Sigma. All of these agents were screened for endotoxin contamination using the colorimetric Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). Endotoxin levels were <0.0008 Eu/ml for the highest concentration of each hormone used in the experiments, <0.015 Eu/ml for the highest concentration of 8-Br-cAMP used, <0.0075 Eu/ml for cycloheximide, and <0.034 Eu/ml for puromycin. Moreover, none of the stimulatory agents contained endotoxin contamination detectable by our previously described (3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner.

UMR106-01 cells between passage 18 and 24 were harvested using 0.02% EDTA (Sigma) and cultured in phenol red-free (32.Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

All media, serum, and additives were from lots which contained the lowest concentration of endotoxin available. For studies of immediate-early gene responses, confluent UMR106-01 cultures were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free media containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (A8412, Sigma) for 48 h prior to addition of inhibitors, stimulators, and vehicles. For signal transduction studies, stimulators and vehicles were added 2 h after plating (25,000 cells/cm2) UMR106-01 cells in order to mimic the conditions used in our previous studies of signal transduction during PTH-induced osteoclast activation(17.Greenfield E.M. Shaw S.M. Gornik S.A. Banks M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells (33.Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S.

Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In experiments using RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), or puromycin (100 μg/ml) were added immediately prior to addition of PTH. Spent media from both cell lines were consistently negative when assayed for mycoplasma contamination by solution hybridization to a probe complementary to mycoplasma rRNA (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA).IL-6 and LIF mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR as described previously(3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Murine IL-6 primers were previously described (3.Greenfield E.M.

Actin mRNA levels were employed in all experiments as a constitutive control using the PCR primers described in (37.Makino R. Sekiya T. Hayashi K. Technique. 1990; 2: 295-301Google Scholar). All of the PCR primer pairs flanked at least one intron to avoid false positives due to amplification of genomic DNA. Controls without cDNA and with known positive cDNAs were used in all PCR reactions. To confirm the identity of the PCR products, we showed that fragments of appropriate sizes were produced by diagnostic restriction enzymes (HpaII, MboI, and HpaII for IL-6, LIF, and actin, respectively) as described previously(3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).IL-6 protein was determined in supernatants harvested 24 h after addition of stimulators or vehicles. In these studies, cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before adding stimulators and vehicles dissolved in the media described above except containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. IL-6 bioactivity was assessed by measuring proliferation of the B cell hybridoma B13.29 (also known as B9) as described previously(3.Greenfield E.M. Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M.

Purified recombinant murine IL-6 (R& Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used in each bioassay to establish a standard curve and serve as a positive control. The presence of IL-6 was confirmed by preincubation of the culture supernatants for 30-40 min prior to addition of the B9 cells with MP5-17D2, a neutralizing rat monoclonal anti-murine/rat IL-6 antibody obtained from Dr. J. Abrams (DNAX Research Institute)(38.Merrill J.E. Dev.

Gornik S.A. Horowitz M.C. Donahue H.J. Shaw S.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and (11.Pollock J.H. Blaha M.J. Gornik S.A. Stevenson S. Greenfield E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), also see Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Levels of both IL-6 and LIF mRNAs peak 30-60 min after addition of PTH and return to baseline by 4-6 h. Since such kinetics are reminiscent of immediate-early responses(12.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13.Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. The Hormonal Control of Gene Transcription. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar), we examined whether induction of IL-6 and LIF by PTH exhibits other characteristics of classical immediate-early responses. Immediate-early responses depend on increased transcription rather than mRNA stability and are, therefore, inhibited by transcription blockers, such as actinomycin D (12.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13.Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. The Hormonal Control of Gene Transcription. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that stimulation of IL-6 and LIF mRNA expression by PTH is inhibited by actinomycin D and that PTH has no detectable effect on stability of either cytokine mRNA. Although these results are consistent with an immediate-early response, conclusive evidence requires examination of protein synthesis inhibitors. Because immediate-early responses are primary effects that do not require synthesis of intermediate proteins, they are not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis(12.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13.Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. The Hormonal Control of Gene Transcription. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Instead, immediate-early responses are superinduced; that is, they are increased in both duration and magnitude(12.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13.Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. The Hormonal Control of Gene Transcription. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Although cycloheximide is the classical protein synthesis inhibitor used in studies of immediate-early responses, it has recently been shown to activate the stress-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway(39.Mahadevan L.C. Edwards D.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 40.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). Puromycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor with a distinct mode of action (41.Vazquez D. Inhibitors of Protein Biosynthesis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979Crossref Google Scholar) that does not activate stress-activated protein kinase signal transduction(40.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of both cycloheximide and puromycin. The two protein synthesis inhibitors gave indistinguishable results in both MC3T3-E1 and UMR106-01 cells. For example, Fig. 2 shows the effect of cycloheximide on MC3T3-E1 cells and Fig. 3 shows the effect of puromycin on UMR106-01 cells. In all cases, inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces the PTH-dependent stimulation of IL-6 and LIF mRNAs. In comparison, the inhibitors have only modest effects in the absence of PTH (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Taken together with the rapid and transient kinetics and the inhibition caused by actinomycin D, these results demonstrate that stimulation of IL-6 and LIF by PTH is a classical immediate-early gene response.Figure 2:Cycloheximide superinduces stimulation by PTH of IL-6 and LIF expression. Confluent MC3T3-E1 cultures were incubated with or without 100 nM PTH and/or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 1, 2, or 4 h prior to extraction of RNA and RT-PCR analysis.

PTHrP also stimulates IL-6 and LIF mRNAs (Fig. 4) with a similar dose dependence (data not shown). To assess if cAMP-mediated signal transduction is required for stimulation of IL-6 and LIF mRNA levels by PTH and PTHrP, we examined whether the effects of these agents are mimicked by PTH-(3-34). This partial agonist has no detectable effect on expression of IL-6 and LIF mRNAs even at 100 nM (Fig. 4). Since PTH-(3-34) activates phospholipase C but not adenyl cyclase(23.Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 42.Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 29-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that cAMP signal transduction is required for stimulation of IL-6 and LIF mRNA expression by PTH and PTHrP.Figure 4:PTH-(3-34) is unable to mimic the ability of PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP to stimulate expression of IL-6 or LIF mRNAs.

Control cells (indicated by 0 nM) were incubated with vehicle (acetic acid, final concentration = 1 μM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further study the role of cAMP, we examined whether membrane-permeant analogues of cAMP effect IL-6 and LIF mRNA levels. Fig. 5 shows that 30-300 μM 8-Br-cAMP dose dependently stimulates expression of IL-6 and LIF. In contrast, 300 μM 8-Br-cGMP, which was used as a negative control, has no detectable effect (Fig. 5). Expression of IL-6 and LIF is also stimulated by both mono- and dibutyrl-cAMP but not by the inactive analogue, monobutyryl cyclic deoxyadenosine monophosphate (data not shown).Figure 5:8-Br-cAMP, but not 8-Br-cGMP, dose dependently stimulates expression of IL-6 and LIF mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W1732973792,"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinases are a family of lipid kinases implicated in the regulation of cell growth by oncogene products and tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors. The catalytic subunit of the p85/p110 PI 3′-kinase is homologous to VPS-34, a phosphatidylinositol-specific lipid kinase involved in the sorting of newly synthesized hydrolases to the yeast vacuole. This suggests that PI 3′-kinases may play analogous roles in mammalian cells. We have measured a number of secretory and endocytic trafficking events in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI 3′-kinase. Wortmannin caused a 40-50% down-regulation of surface transferrin receptors, with a dose dependence identical to that required for maximal inhibition of the p85/p110 PI 3′-kinase in intact cells. The redistribution of transferrin receptors reflected a 60% increase in the internalization rate and a 35% decrease in the recycling rate. Experiments with fluorescent transferrin showed that entry of transferrin receptors into the recycling compartment and efflux of receptors out of the compartment were slowed by wortmannin. Wortmannin altered the morphology of the recycling compartment, which was more vesiculated than in untreated cells. Using Semliki Forest virus as a probe, we also found that delivery of the endocytosed virus to its lysosomal site of degradation was slowed by wortmannin, whereas endosomal acidification was unaffected. In contrast to these effects on endocytosis and recycling, wortmannin did not affect intracellular processing of newly synthesized viral spike proteins. Wortmannin did induce missorting of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D to the secretory pathway, but only at a dose 20-fold greater than that required to inhibit p85/p110 PI 3′-kinase activity or to redistribute transferrin receptors. Our data demonstrate the presence of wortmannin-sensitive enzymes at three distinct steps of the endocytic cycle in Chinese hamster ovary cells: internalization, transit from early endosomes to the recycling and degradative compartments, and transit from the recycling compartment back to the cell surface. The wortmannin-sensitive enzymes critical for endocytosis and recycling are distinct from those involved in sorting newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1482267503,"We have reported that a mouse monoclonal antibody, 703D4, detects lung cancer 2 years earlier than routine chest x-ray or cytomorphology. We purified the 703D4 antigen to elucidate its role in early lung cancer biology, using Western blot detection after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purification steps included anion exchange chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, polymer-based C18-like, and analytical C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. After 25-50,000-fold purification, the principal immunostaining protein was >95% pure by Coomassie staining. The NH2 terminus was blocked, so CNBr digestion was used to generate internal peptides. Three sequences, including one across a site of alternate exon splicing, all identified a single protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-A2 (hnRNP-A2). A minor co-purifying immunoreactive protein resolved at the final C4 high performance liquid chromatography step is the splice variant hnRNP-B1. Northern analysis of RNA from primary normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated a low level of hnRNP-A2/B1 expression, consistent with immunohistochemical staining of clinical samples, and increased hnRNP-A2/B1 expression was found in lung cancer cells. hnRNP-A2/B1 expression is under proliferation-dependent control in normal bronchial epithelial cell primary cultures, but not in SV40-transformed bronchial epithelial cells or tumor cell lines. With our clinical data, this information suggests that hnRNP-A2/B1 is an early marker of lung epithelial transformation and carcinogenesis.

With our clinical data, this information suggests that hnRNP-A2/B1 is an early marker of lung epithelial transformation and carcinogenesis. Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death of both men and women in the United States, accounting for one in three cancer deaths(1.Boring C.C. Squires T.S. Tong T. Montgomery S. Ca-Cancer J. Clin. 1994; 44: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). In the last 30 years, cancer-related survival of this disease has improved minimally. Successful treatment of this disease by surgical resection and drug chemotherapy is strongly dependent on identification of early-stage tumors. A conceptually attractive early detection approach is to establish the presence of a cancer by evaluation of shed bronchial epithelial cells recovered in the sputum. Cytological approaches to evaluate precancerous cytomorphologic changes in the exfoliated bronchial epithelium have been reported(2.Saccomanno G. Saunders R.P. Klein M.G. Acta Cytol. 1970; 14: 377-381PubMed Google Scholar). However, early diagnosis clinical trials using combination chest x-ray and conventional sputum cytology have not shown any decrease in cancer-related mortality(3.Frost J.K. Fontana R.S. Melamed M.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1984; 130: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar). In 1988, Tockman et al.(4.Tockman M.S. Gupta P.K. Myers J.D. Frost J.K. Baylin S.B. Gold E.B. Chase A.M. Wilkinson P.H. Mulshine J.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 6: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) reported a sensitive method for early lung cancer detection by immunostaining exfoliated cells in sputum samples with two lung cancer-associated monoclonal antibodies. The mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies used in that study were designated 624H12 and 703D4. 624H12 has been shown to detect an onco-fetal antigen that is the difucosylated Lewisx structure(5.Kyogashima M. Mulshine J. Linnoila R.I. Jensen S. Magnani J. Nudelman E. Hakomori S. Ginsburg V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The antigen for 703D4 was unknown. In an analysis of the contribution of the individual monoclonal antibodies to early detection of lung cancer, 703D4 alone identified 20 of the 21 detected true positive cases(4.Tockman M.S.

Immunoprecipitation defined a protein of molecular mass of approximately 31 kDa. Since 703D4 antibody demonstrated the ability to selectively detect changes related to the development of cancer in shed bronchial epithelium from the proximal airways, we have used a biochemical approach to purify 703D4 antigen to determine its identity and explore its relationship to early lung cancer detection. non-small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein isoelectric focusing high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis trifluoroacetic acid heptafluorobutyric acid polymerase chain reaction 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine polyvinylidene difluoride. To analyze the antigen-purification steps, an aliquot of the starting material and of each of the fractionations described below (ion exchange, IEF, and HPLC) was assayed by either Tris-Tricine or Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Aliquots were freeze-dried and reconstituted or diluted directly in either Tris-glycine sample buffer containing 5% mercaptoethanol or Tricine sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4-20% Tris-glycine or 10-20% Tricine gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Gels were fixed, stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250(7.Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar), and photographed. Proteins on duplicate gels were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane at 30 V for 1.5-2.0 h, blocked overnight at 4°C with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and immunoblotted using antibody 703D4. 703D4 is an IgG2bk monoclonal antibody(6.Mulshine J.L. Cuttitta F. Bibro M. Fedorko J. Fargion S. Little C. Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity purified from mouse ascites using a Protein A Sepharose column and a glycine NaCl/citrate gradient. The bound antibody on the Western transfer PVDF membranes was detected using direct binding of radioiodinated staphylococcal Protein A. Blots were imaged on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and on Kodak XAR and XRP films. Human tumor cell lines, including the NSCLC cell lines NCI-H720 (carcinoid) and NCI-H157 (squamous) used for antigen purification, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), resuspended in MES buffer (17 mM MES (pH 7.0), 20 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, with 50 μg/mL leupeptin, 300 μg/mL aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer. Trypan blue exclusion was employed to ensure greater than 90% cell lysis following homogenization. The lysates were transferred to Beckman polyallomer centrifuge tubes and subjected to centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min using a Beckman XL90 ultracentrifuge and SW41 rotor. The pellet containing the membrane and nuclear fractions was retained, and the cytosolic supernatant was discarded(8.Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA) containing 1% Tween 20 and the anti-protease mixture described above. The samples were incubated on ice for 1 h, with frequent vortexing, and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then diluted 3-fold with deionized water and adjusted to pH 6.5 for ion-exchange chromatography. A Dupont Bio Series WAX (weak anion exchange) column (MacMod, Chads Ford, PA), equilibrated with Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, was used. Detergent-solubilized proteins were pumped through the column at 2.0 ml/min. 703D4 immunoreactive material was eluted in the unbound material from this column in the presence of 50 mM NaCl, and the anti-protease mixture described above was added. The unbound fractions positive for 703D4 antigen were pooled and freeze-dried, resuspended to a final volume of 45 ml with 4 M urea containing 3% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, and 0.8% Ampholine, pH range 3-10 (Bio-Rad). This protein-ampholyte mixture was loaded into a chilled Rotofor preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) apparatus (Bio-Rad) which was operated at a constant 12 watts. One hour after the maximum voltage was reached, usually 1200 V, fractions were harvested by vacuum collection. Run time was approximately 4 h. pH values were determined for the 20 fractions which were harvested. 703D4 antigen was concentrated in fractions with pH 8-9.5. The three most positive fractions from each IEF run were pooled for HPLC purification. All organic solvents used were HPLC grade (Burdick & Jackson, Muskegon, WI). The preparative IEF fractions positive for 703D4 antigen were diluted 2-fold with 18 megaohm water, acidified with a final concentration of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Pierce), and applied to a 10 mm × 10 cm Poros® perfusion polymeric analytical C18-like R2 column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) which was equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. The protein was eluted using a 15-min linear gradient proceeding from 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Fractions of 2.5 or 5 ml (15-30 s) were collected after a 2.0-min wash. Next, the positive fractions (2.5-5.0 ml, ∼40% acetonitrile) were diluted 5-fold with water, 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) (Pierce) and applied to another Poros polymeric R2 column equilibrated with 5% methanol, 0.1% HFBA. The protein was eluted with a 15-min linear gradient from 5% methanol, 0.1% HFBA to 100% methanol, 0.1% HFBA at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The 703D4 antigen eluted at approximately 80% methanol. As the last stage in the purification, the positive fractions were applied to a 2.1 mm × 25 cm Vydac analytical C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), which was equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, and the protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a triphasic linear gradient from 20% acetonitrile to 30% acetonitrile over 20 min, to 45% acetonitrile over 75 min (0.2%/min), then to 90% acetonitrile over 20 min. Fractions of 0.4 ml (2 min) were collected. Several failed attempts at obtaining NH2-terminal amino acid sequence information, both from SDS-PAGE blotted material and directly from freeze-dried fractions at the last C4 HPLC step, indicated that the NH2 terminus of the purified protein was blocked. Therefore a CNBr digestion was employed to obtain the internal sequence. The purified protein, freeze-dried after the C4 HPLC fractionation, was cleaved under nitrogen with 0.15 M CNBr (Fluka) in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 24 h(9.Gross E. Morell J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by 16% Tricine SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane. The peptides were visualized using Ponceau S, and bands were excised for Edman degradation sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems model 477A (Foster City, CA). Some proteins were also sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 494A. The amino acid sequence obtained was compared to known sequences in the SwissProt data base using PepScan (PE/SCIEX, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Primary cultures (first or second passage) of human bronchial epithelium cells were grown in BEGM (Clonetics, San Diego, California) or Keratinocyte-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To obtain stationary phase cells, confluent cells were maintained in BEGM for 4 days. We obtained the human adeno-12-SV40-transformed bronchial epithelium cell line (IB3-1)(10.Zeitlin P. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K. Craig R. Guggino W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It was grown in BEBM with 5% fetal calf serum. Stationary phase cells were obtained by maintenance in BEBM with 5% fetal calf serum for 4 days after the cells reached confluence. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H157, HTB58 (squamous) and NCI-H23 (adenocarcinoma) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. To obtain stationary phase cells, confluent cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum for 4 days. For all cell lines, log phase cells were harvested at 70-80% confluence. Medium was removed from the cells, and they were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonadherent cell lines were harvested and washed by centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min). RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate/2-mercaptoethanol and purified by ultracentrifugation as described previously(11.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 129-156Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation, the RNA pellet was resuspended in water, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate, and pelleted by centrifugation. The dried pellets were redissolved in water, and 10 μg of total cellular RNA from each of the tumor cell lines, normal lung, and normal bronchial epithelium primary cultures were used for Northern blot analysis. The RNA was resolved using a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel with 0.2 M MOPS, 0.05 M sodium acetate, 0.01 M EDTA as the running buffer. The RNA was transferred passively to nitrocellulose membrane, hybridized, and washed. Autoradiography was performed according to standard techniques. Northern analysis was carried out using probes prepared by random priming of inserts gel-purified from restriction endonuclease digests of plasmids containing full-length cDNAs for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A2. Approximately 1 × 106 cpm/ml of probe was used for each Northern analysis. Reverse transcription was performed with 0.2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA using the Superscript amplification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting cDNA was subjected to 30 or 35 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR system 9600. The primers designed for the amplification were: 5′-GAGTCCGGTTCGTGTTCGTC-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGCATCAACCTCAGC-3′. These primers were selected using Lasergene software by DNA-Star (Madison, WI), and were chosen to span a site of alternate exon utilization (36 nucleotides) which generates the hnRNP splice forms A2 and B1. The resulting amplified DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.0% NuSieve agarose gel. DNA was then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, hybridized, washed, and exposed to film as described previously(10.Zeitlin P. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K. Craig R. Guggino W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was carried out with a 32P-end-labeled 20-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide, which hybridizes with a sequence common to both hnRNP-A2 and -B1. Preliminary data showed a wide range of expression of the 703D4 antigen in many NSCLC cell lines as judged by a solid phase radiobinding assay. All results shown are for purification steps using cell line NCI-H720, which grows rapidly as floating clumps of cells in culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, allowing high cell density. After the methods were developed, an identical protocol was followed to purify the antigen from the original immunogen cell line, NCI-H157. 703D4 immunoreactivity at all stages of the purification was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis, as attempts to scale up our previously reported immunoprecipitation technique (6.Mulshine J.L. Cuttitta F. Bibro M. Fedorko J. Fargion S. Little C. Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar) were not successful. Western blot analysis of crude extract under both reducing and nonreducing conditions revealed a major band with a molecular mass of approximately 31.5 kDa on NOVEX 10-20% Tricine gels or 34 kDa reduced on NOVEX 8-16% Tris-glycine gels (determined by comparison with Bio-Rad SDS-PAGE prestained standards). Only a single major immunoreactive protein was identified, although in the later stages of purification an apparent disulfide-linked homodimer appeared which could be removed by reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and at the final HPLC steps a minor band of slightly higher Mr was identifiable (Mr = 33,000 on Tricine gels, 35,000 on Tris-glycine gels) (Fig. 2C). Our original immunoprecipitation analysis identified similar molecular mass proteins (major band approximately 32.5 kDa, minor band approximately 34 kDa) using linear 10% acrylamide gels(6.Mulshine J.L. Cuttitta F. Bibro M. Fedorko J. Fargion S. Little C. Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar). Simple subcellular fractionation analysis of 703D4 antigen distribution according to the method of Krajewski et al.(8.Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar) showed that, except for a cytosolic supernatant, all membrane-bound fractions including the crude nuclear pellet had immunoreactive protein (data not shown). These data parallel our immunohistochemical characterization of 703D4 antigen expression in fixed cells, which showed binding to perinuclear and membrane-bound cytosolic sites(16.Zhou, J., Jensen, S. M., Steinberg, S. M., Mulshine, J. L., Linnoila, R. I. (1996) Lung Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar). The antigen in a NCI-H720 subcellular fraction containing nuclei and membrane-bound proteins could be solubilized by gentle extraction with either nonionic detergents such as Tween 20, Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100 or ionic detergent such as 1% SDS. Weak anion exchange chromatography of crude detergent-solubilized proteins at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 indicated all the immunoreactivity of the crude tumor cell extract was eluted in the unbound fraction in the presence of low (50 mM) salt. When the crude antigen was subjected to preparative IEF under denaturing conditions (4.0 M urea) the immunoreactivity appeared in fractions with pH 8-9.5. The protein identified by 703D4 was isolated from NCI-H720 and -H157 cells by a six-step procedure. The first steps were carried out rapidly to prevent degradation of the target molecule. Using a variety of protease inhibitors or reducing agents, we were able to reduce but not eliminate antigen degradation. To prevent degradation during the SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of each fractionation step, the bulk of the material was stored frozen at −30°C during the analysis. A typical purification commenced with 5-10 ml of packed cells, washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum proteins present in the cell culture medium. The initial step was subcellular fractionation to remove cytosolic proteins, followed by gentle nonionic detergent solubilization of the membrane-containing fraction. The detergent-solubilized fraction was then diluted to lower the salt concentration to 50 mM and injected onto the weak anion-exchange column. Studies with weak and strong anion and cation exchange resins demonstrated tight binding to cation and strong anion exchange matrices but poor recovery of immunoreactive material (results not shown). We therefore used the weak anion exchange resin to remove a significant portion (approximately 75%) of protein to prevent loss of 703D4-immunoreactive protein through co-precipitation at the IEF step. In the presence of 50 mM salt, 703D4 antigen eluted with the unbound fraction which was freeze-dried and redissolved in a denaturing buffer for preparative IEF. IEF concentrated the immunoreactive protein into a basic region of the pH gradient. Protein from several batches of IEF was pooled at this point for HPLC purification. The HPLC chromatograms from the next stages of this procedure are shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2:. Attempts to remove the ampholytes and urea after preparative IEF by molecular sieve chromatography or direct injection onto silica-based reversed phase HPLC matrices resulted in precipitation of the target protein and loss within the column matrix. The Poros® macroporous polymeric analytical R2 column rapidly and efficiently desalted the antigen from the urea/ampholyte mixture and simultaneously separated 703D4 immunoreactivity from the bulk of the other proteins in the mixture (Fig. 1). Our HPLC procedures utilize mobile phases usually applied for peptide analysis and/or purification, but these conditions proved very effective for this protein purification. The chromatographically “weaker” organic modifier (methanol) used with the more lipophilic ion-pairing agent (HFBA) resulted in a distinctly different mobility of the 703D4 antigen compared with that in the acetonitrile/TFA mobile phase. These conditions also provided selectivity for removal of other proteins present in the sample. The two solvent systems resulted in significantly greater purification of the target molecule than either solvent system alone.Figure 2:C4-reversed phase HPLC purification of 703D4 antigen. 703D4 immunoreactive fractions from methanol/HFBA were injected onto a 2.1 mm × 25-cm Vydac C4 column, which was eluted with a triphasic gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The central region of the chromatogram, from 33-48% acetonitrile is shown (A). Gradient and UV absorbance are denoted as in Fig. 1. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described for Fig. 1, except Tris-Tricine gels were used. B, the colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained gel; C, the Western blot. Migration of prestained protein standards (sizes in kDa) are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analytical C4 reversed-phase HPLC with an acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the final purification step. 2.5-5.0 ml of 703D4-immunoreactive fractions from the methanol/HFBA polymeric R2 column was diluted 5-fold with water, 0.1% TFA, injected onto a Vydac C4 column, and eluted with a slow gradient of acetonitrile (0.2%/min). Immunoblotting analysis of the C4 fractions revealed two immunoreactive proteins with distinct sizes as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). The lower and later eluting protein is the principal 703D4 immunoreactive antigen and was greater than 95% pure as determined by Coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. The immunoreactivity paralleled the Coomassie staining intensity for both the major and minor bands, demonstrating homogeneity of the purified proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). Determination of recoveries of immunoreactivity at each step could not be made using a Western blot analysis method; however, we estimate an overall yield of 5-10% for the six-step procedure. Final yield of the principal immunoreactive protein from a typical purification, determined from NH2-terminal Edman sequence yield, was 200 pmol. We estimated overall purification from the total protein in the starting material and the final yield of purified antigen. This yield implies an approximately 25,000-50,000-fold overall purification, although as stated the Western blot detection method did not allow for an accurate quantitation of any loss of immunoreactive material during the purification. Table 1 shows the approximate fold purification for each step of the procedure, averaged from several typical purifications.TABLE 1 Several attempts to obtain amino-terminal sequence of purified 703D4 antigen were not successful, including direct sequencing from the C4 HPLC fractions. The major immunoreactive protein, that is, the later eluting, lower Mr band on SDS-PAGE of the analytical C4 purification step, was therefore concentrated by freeze-drying the peak fractions and cleaved using 0.15 M CNBr in 175 μl of 70% formic acid (9.Gross E. Morell J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After a 24-h reaction in the dark at 25°C, the CNBr digest was diluted with 1.0 ml of water and freeze-dried. The peptides were solubilized directly in Tricine loading buffer. Four bands were separated and visible after Tricine SDS-PAGE on a linear 16% gel, electroblotting onto PVDF membrane, and staining with Ponceau S or Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3). All four bands were subject to 12 cycles of Edman degradation on an ABI 477A using the standard ABI protocol for blotted proteins. The sequences revealed were: AARPHSIDGRVV (27- and 13-kDa bands), QEVQSSRSGRGG (15-kDa band), and EREKEQFRKLFI (4-kDa band). Each amino acid was the major or only amino acid called by the automated sequencer at each cycle. A search in the SwissProt sequence data base of each of these sequences identified a single gene product. The sequences, and the size of the cyanogen bromide digestion products, are consistent with the major 703D4 antigen being hnRNP-A2. Fig. 4 shows these sequences aligned with the translated cDNA sequence of hnRNP-A2/B1, which includes a previously reported 36-nucleotide (12-amino acid) exon close to the protein amino terminus that is specific for hnRNP-B1. The 4-kDa CNBr fragment sequence crossed this site of alternate exon splicing, demonstrating that the major antigen is hnRNP-A2. As expected for CNBr-generated fragments, each sequence is immediately COOH-terminal to a methionine residue in the predicted sequence. The two identical sequences obtained for the 27- and 13-kDa bands and the presence of faint bands not readily visible in Fig. 3 implies incomplete CNBr digestion, possibly due to oxidized methionines in the freeze-dried protein. For a parallel purification of 703D4-immunoreactive protein from the original immunogen cell line NCI-H157, an identical sequence was obtained from the CNBr-generated 13-kDa band (AARPHSIdgRVV) and some confirmatory sequence was obtained from the 15-kDa band (amino acids in upper case represent the primary amino acid in each cycle, and lower case letters denote amino acids identified as the secondary calls). CNBr digestion resulted in loss of immunoreactivity with 703D4, indicating that the antibody probably recognizes a conformational epitope. Several recent reports demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies raised to intact proteins commonly recognize conformational epitopes(12.Broder C.C. Earl P.L. Long D. Abedon S.T. Moss B. Doms R.W. Proc.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The last step in the purification of the 703D4 antigen resolved a second immunoreactive band of slightly higher molecular size, and parallel immunoreactivity (judged by a comparison of the Coomassie and immunostaining intensities). A CNBr digestion was carried out on C4 HPLC fractions (pooled from three separate purifications) containing the minor immunoreactive band which eluted slightly before the hnRNP-A2. The CNBr digest yielded two principal Coomassie-stained bands after Tricine SDS-PAGE. The approx"

At these sites it binds to the cytoplasmic domains of cadherin cell-cell adhesion proteins and regulates their adhesive and cytoskeletal binding functions. Plakoglobin also forms distinct cytosolic protein complexes that function in pathways of tumor suppression and cell fate determination. Recent studies in Xenopus suggest that cadherins inhibit the signaling functions of plakoglobin presumably by sequestering this protein at the membrane and depleting its cytosolic pool. To understand the reciprocal regulation between desmosomal cadherins (desmoglein and desmocollin) and plakoglobin, we have sought to identify the binding domains involved in the formation of these protein complexes. Plakoglobin comprises 13 central repeats flanked by amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains. Our results show that repeats 1-4 are involved in binding desmoglein-1. In contrast, the interaction of plakoglobin with desmocollin-1a is sensitive to deletion of either end of the central repeat domain. The binding sites for two adherens junction components, α-catenin and classical cadherins, overlap these sites. Competition among these proteins for binding sites on plakoglobin may therefore account for the distinct composition of adherens junctions and desmosomes.

Their genes display a highly conserved and unusual genomic structure, suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor(1.Puttagunta S. Mathur M. Cowin P. J. Biol.

Recent crystal structure analyses of the amino-terminal extracellular repeat of N-cadherin have shown that the sequences that are highly conserved bind calcium ions and mediate cadherin dimerization in the plane of the membrane(6.Shapiro L.

The role of plakoglobin at desmosomes is less clear; however, it is essential for desmosome formation and may promote intermediate filament association with the membrane(19.Troyanovsky S.M.

Recent studies have revealed a wide range of cellular functions for plakoglobin in addition to its role in adhesive cell-cell junctions. For example, both plakoglobin and its close relative β-catenin are implicated in pathways controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility by their association in the cytosol with APC, the product of a tumor suppressor gene linked to colon cancer(15.Hulsken J.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest their involvement in developmental pathways. Armadillo, the Drosophila homologue of plakoglobin and β-catenin, participates in a signaling pathway that determines segment polarity via post-transcriptional up-regulation in response to wingless expression(26.Peifer M. Weischaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27.Riggleman R. Schedl P. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A similar up-regulation of plakoglobin and β-catenin can be produced in vertebrate cells by expression of Wnt-1, a homologue of wingless(28.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29.Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of plakoglobin, β-catenin, or Wnt-1 in Xenopus embryos each produce duplication of the embryonic axis, suggesting that they operate in a common conserved signaling pathway(30.McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 31.McCrea P.D. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. J.

A. 1995; 92: 4522-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in the case of plakoglobin, this phenotype is suppressed by co-expression of the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain, indicating that desmosomal cadherins play a significant role in modulating plakoglobin's signaling functions(33.Karnovsky A. Klymkowsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4522-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As a step toward understanding the reciprocal regulation between these proteins, we have sought to define the regions of plakoglobin involved in their associations. Our results show that the site of Dsg1 interaction is relatively discrete, involving the first three to four repeats of the central domain of plakoglobin. In contrast, the association of Dsc1a with plakoglobin is sensitive to even small deletions at either end of the central repeat domain. The complete bovine Dsg1 cDNA was constructed in the Bluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from three overlapping partial cDNAs(9.Mathur M. Goodwin L. Cowin P. J. Biol.

All plakoglobin mutants were constructed by PCR using 5′ primers consisting of a three-base spacer followed by an EcoR1 restriction site and six bases conforming to Kozak's rules for the optimal sequence of an initiating methionine (CCGGAATTCGCCGCCATG), followed by 15 nucleotides encoding plakoglobin sequence beginning with the amino acid indicated (Fig. 1). For some mutants, the sequence GAGCAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACCTG, encoding the epitope EQKLISEEDL derived from c-myc was introduced between the initiating ATG codon and the plakoglobin sequence. 3′ primers comprised a three-base spacer, an EcoR1 restriction site, a stop codon, and 15 nucleotides encoding the plakoglobin sequence ending with the amino acids indicated (Fig. 1). The deleted forms of human plakoglobin described above (Fig. 1) were subcloned into the EcoR1 site of p163/7 and pGBT9 vectors. All clones generated by PCR were fully sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. All constructs were found to have sequences identical to the parent cDNA clones with the exception of the plakoglobin mutant ΔC, which contained a single mutation resulting in an alteration in residue 580 from isoleucine to serine. The product of this construct showed no significant difference from that of the original full length cDNA in its ability to associate with Dsg1 or Dsc1a. Xenopus α-catenin (GB accession number U47624) was cloned by screening a Xenopus stage 17 λgt11 library with mouse α-E-catenin cDNA. A full-length clone containing the complete open reading frame was subcloned into the pCS2 vector containing a CMV promoter, which was a kind gift of the Hal Weintraub laboratory. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 93% identity to murine α-catenin. Yeast strains SFY526 and HF7c (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA) were rendered competent by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol procedure, cotransformed with 1 μg of each of a pair of DNA constructs and selected by growth on SD plates lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD-trp-leu-) (38.Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G. Methods in yeast genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). HF7c colonies were picked and streaked onto (SD-trp-leu-) plates and replica plated onto plates also deficient in histidine (SD-trp-leu-His-) with or without 20 mM 3-aminotriazole and tested for growth. Transformants of both strains were grown in liquid culture (SD-trp-leu-) at 30°C to an A600 of 1.0. The cells were pelleted, lysed, normalized for protein concentration, and assayed using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside as a substrate to quantitate β-galactosidase activity(38.Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G. Methods in yeast genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Human kidney cells transformed with SV40 T-antigen (293T) were maintained in a 10% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine. Cells grown to 25% confluence in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of each DNA construct by the standard calcium phosphate method. 24-48 h later cells were rinsed and cultured for 60 min in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cells were then incubated in the same medium with EXPRE35S35S-methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (DuPont NEN): 75-125 μCi/ml for 3 h to overnight or 1 mCi/ml for 15 min for pulse-chase. Cells were rinsed and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mM unlabeled methionine. The cells were lysed and proteins were extracted in 1 ml 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mM EDTA, 0.2% Aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100 (TX-100) for 30 min at 4°C. Insoluble debris was pelleted for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared for 1 h with 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. After removal of these beads, the extract was rotated for 2 h at 4°C with 5 μl of specific antibody, 20 μl of beads, and, where necessary, 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The beads were pelleted and washed six times in wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 M NaCl, 15 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% aprotinin, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol), then boiled in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to 8-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and processed for autoradiography. Polyclonal antibodies to Dsg1 and plakoglobin were raised and characterized as described(39.Cowin P. Garrod D.R. Nature. 1983; 302: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-myc epitope-tag specific antibodies were a gift of Dr. Harold Varmus (UCSF, San Francisco, CA); PECAM cDNA and Hec7 antibodies were a gift of Dr. Bill Mueller (Rockefeller, New York, NY). The ability of full-length and deleted forms of plakoglobin to interact with the complete Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain (DSG1-pGAD424) was tested by measuring β-galactosidase activity (Table 1, second and fourth columns). Controls consisted of yeast expressing these mutants together with the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain lacking the sequence necessary for plakogobin association (DSG1ΔC-pGAD424) (Table 1, third and fifth columns)(9.Mathur M. Goodwin L. Cowin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14075-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Troyanovsky S.M. Troyanovsky R.B. Eshkind L.G. Krutovskikh V.A. Leube R.E. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Yeast expressing full-length plakoglobin and the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain produced 10-fold higher β-galactosidase activity than controls. Deletion of the amino-terminal (head) and/or carboxyl-terminal (tail) domains of plakoglobin minimally affected association of these proteins. Yeast expressing mutant plakoglobin lacking the head and first two repeats (ΔN-2) showed reduced β-galactosidase activity; no activity was found in those mutants further deleted toward the carboxyl terminus (ΔN-6, ΔN-9, ΔN-13). Similarly, mutants progressively deleted from the carboxyl terminus gave approximately equal levels of β-galactosidase activity until repeats 1-3 were removed (compare Δ4-C with Δ1-C).TABLE 1 The ability of these fusion proteins to interact, thereby activating transcription of a HIS3 reporter gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter, was also tested in the HF7c strain by growth on his- plates (SD-trp-leu-his-). All cotransformants, including controls, grew on these plates due to basal levels of HIS3 expression (data not shown). Incorporation of 20 mM 3-aminotriazole, however, reduced this background significantly in all controls except those expressing full-length plakoglobin. Growth in the presence of 20 mM 3-aminotriazole was observed in cells expressing the full-length plakoglobin construct as well as with mutants (Δ4-C, Δ8-C, Δ11-C, ΔC, ΔN/ΔC, ΔN, ΔN-2) but not with (Δ1-C, ΔN-6, ΔN-9, ΔN-13) (Fig. 2). The interaction of desmosomal cadherins with plakoglobin mutants was also assessed by cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation. The specificity of the antibodies was first tested by immunoprecipitating Dsg1, Dsc1a, and plakoglobin from 0.5% TX-100 soluble extracts of 293T cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding each protein (Fig. 3). All antibodies recognized their cognate antigens and showed no cross-reaction with other overexpressed components (Fig. 3). We next tested that overexpression of two proteins does not, of itself, give rise to spurious complexes by showing that PECAM, a cell adhesion molecule that colocalizes with plakoglobin in the endothelial junction, does not co-immunoprecipitate with plakoglobin (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, a complex of Dsg1 and plakoglobin could be coimmunoprecipitated from TX-100 soluble extracts of 293T cells co-expressing both proteins by antibodies specific for either component (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 9). When such cells were pulse-chased, anti-plakoglobin antibody co-immunoprecipitated Dsg1 precursor and mature Dsg1 (Fig. 4, lanes 6-9). When cells transfected with 5 μg of plakoglobin together with 5 μg of Dsg1 or Dsc1a were immunoprecipitated with the same anti-desmosomal cadherin antibody, a 2-fold difference in expression of the transmembrane components was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 10 and 11). After correction for this fact, 7-fold less plakoglobin was found associated with Dsc1a than with Dsg1, even though equal amounts of plakoglobin were expressed. When the amount of Dsc1a cDNA added to the transfection was titrated (Fig. 4, lanes 11-13) with all other parameters constant, the amount of plakoglobin in the complex increased in proportion to the amount of Dsc1a immunoprecipitated, demonstrating that the relative stiochiometry of the complex remained constant.Figure 4:Immunoprecipitation of PECAM, Dsg1, Dsc1a, and Plakoglobin Complexes. Autoradiograms of immunoprecipitations of TX-100 soluble extracts of metabolically labeled 293T cells transfected with: PECAM (lanes 1 and 2) and cotransfected with PECAM and plakoglobin (lanes 3 and 4); Dsg1 and plakoglobin (lanes 5-10); and Dsc1a and plakoglobin (lanes 11-13) precipitated with monoclonal antibody: HEC7-specific for PECAM (lanes 1 and 3); and polyclonal antibodies: anti-plakoglobin (αPg, lanes 2, 4, and 6-9); anti-Dsg1 (αDsg, lane 5) and anti-desmosomal cadherin antibody (anti-Dsg/Dsc, lanes 10-13). Note the lack of interaction between PECAM and plakoglobin (lanes 3 and 4) but complex formation between Dsg 1 and plakoglobin (lane 5). Lanes 6-9 show cells metabolically labeled for 15 min followed by chase periods indicated above the lanes. Anti-plakoglobin antibodies coimmunoprecipitate plakoglobin complexed to the desmoglein precursor (lane 6) and mature Dsg1 (lane 9). Lanes 10-13 show immunoprecipitates with a constant amount of anti-Dsg1/Dsc1a from 293T cells transiently cotransfected with 5 μg of plakoglobin (lanes 10-13) together with 5 μg of Dsg1 (lane 10) or 5, 2.5, and 10 μg, respectively, of Dsc1a indicated above the lanes. Note that equivalent amounts of desmoglein and desmocollin coprecipitate different amounts of plakoglobin and that the stoichiometry of the desmocollin complex remains constant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The plakoglobin deletion mutants previously used in the yeast two-hybrid experiments were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, co-transfected into 293T cells with the full-length Dsg1 construct, and tested for the ability of their products to co-immunoprecipitate. Association of Dsg1 was observed with full-length (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 1′) and headless plakoglobin (ΔN) (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 2′). Further deletion of repeats 1 and 2 (ΔN-2), however, led to a significant drop in interaction (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 3′), and mutants lacking the first six repeats or more showed no detectable association (Fig. 5, lanes 4′, 4, 5′, and 5). Additional deletion mutants were created to further delineate the binding site. Deletion of the first four repeats (ΔN-4) resulted in loss of association (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 8′). Sequential deletion of the head (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1′ and 2′), head and first repeat (ΔN-1), and head and first two repeats (ΔN-2) (Fig. 5, compare lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 6′ and 7′) progressively impairs Dsg1 binding. All mutants sequentially deleted from the carboxyl terminus showed significant association with Dsg1 (Fig. 6, lanes 1-5, 9, and 9′) up to the point of removal of the third repeat (Fig. 6, lanes 6-8 and 6′-8′). In summary, these data show that the head and first three repeats are sufficient for desmoglein association, that the third repeat is essential, and that the head and repeats 1 and 2 enhance this interaction. In the absence of the head and first four repeats the rest of the protein is unable to bind Dsg 1.Figure 6:Co-immunoprecipitation of Dsg1 with full-length and mutant forms of plakoglobin sequentially deleted from the carboxyl terminus. Autoradiogram of immunoprecipitates with anti-Dsg1 antibody (lanes 1-5 and 6′-9′) and anti-myc antibody (lanes 6-9 and 12-14) of TX-100 soluble fractions of metabolically labeled 293T cells transiently cotransfected with the plakoglobin constructs indicated above the lanes and either Dsg1 (lanes 1-9 and 6′-9′) or α-catenin (lanes 10-14).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the proximity of this site to those variously reported for α-catenin, we show that plakoglobin mutants lacking the head or first repeat (ΔN, Δ1-C) do not bind α-catenin (Fig. 6, lanes 11 and 12) confirming the work of others(15.Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 40.Sacco P.A. McGranahan M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20201-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We extend these results to show that the head and first repeat together are sufficient for association with α-catenin (compare Δ1-C with Δ2-C, Fig. 6, lanes 12 and 13). Thus, the sites for desmoglein and α-catenin lie in close proximity and head and repeat 1 contribute toward two distinct interactions of plakoglobin, providing the binding site for α-catenin and enhancing the interaction of Dsg1. The plakoglobin mutants were co-transfected together with Dsc1a and immunoprecipitated with the anti-desmosomal cadherin antibody (Fig. 7). Deletion of the head (ΔN) and/or tail (ΔN/ΔC, ΔC) or head and first repeat (ΔN-1) produced little effect on Dsc1a interaction (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). However, further amino-terminal and all carboxyl-terminal deletions of the repeat region led to loss of interaction, implicating both ends of the repeats in Dsc1a association (Fig. 7, lanes 4-6 and 9-12). Plakoglobin belongs to a family of functionally diverse proteins (41.Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 42.Kussell P. Frasch M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1491-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that contain varying numbers of 42-amino acid sequences termed “arm” repeats after Armadillo, the protein in which they were first observed(26.Peifer M. Weischaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 43.Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Five of these proteins (plakoglobin, β-catenin, Armadillo, desmosomal band six protein and p120) associate with cadherins, but plakoglobin is the only one known to associate with both classical cadherins at adherens junctions and desmosomal cadherins at desmosomes(9.Mathur M.

Definition of its interactions are therefore crucial to our understanding of the structure and function of the two major vertebrate cell-cell adhesive junctions. Plakoglobin is also found in the cytoplasm, where it forms a homodimer of unknown function (14.Cowin P. Kapprell H.-P. Franke W.W. Tamkun J. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1986; 46: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 49.Kapprell H.-P. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Eur. J.

Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 22.Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S.

Studies in Xenopus suggest that cytosolic pools of plakoglobin participate in the transmission of developmental patterning signals that, intriguingly, are suppressed by Dsg1 expression(33.Karnovsky A. Klymkowsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4522-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). From this it has been inferred that desmosomal cadherins influence signaling pathways governing patterning by sequestering plakoglobin at the membrane, and it is reasonable to surmise that they may also affect plakoglobin's cytosolic role in growth control. Thus, definition of cadherin-plakoglobin interactions is important for our understanding of the connections between these processes and cell adhesion. Our results show that plakoglobin binds to the precursor and mature forms of Dsg1, analogous to the early association reported to occur between β-catenin and E-cadherin(50.Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plakoglobin binding site for Dsg1 involves a relatively discrete region of amino-terminal repeats. Specifically, our results indicate that the head and first three repeats are sufficient for Dsg1 interaction. Amino-terminally deleted mutants show that although removal of the head domain lessens binding slightly, progressive removal of the first and second repeats severely compromises Dsg1 association, and further deletion of the third and fourth repeats eliminates interaction. Taken together, these data suggest that the head and repeats 1 and 2 cooperate to enhance Dsg1 association with the third and possibly fourth repeats. The first and third repeats of plakoglobin are very similar to those of β-catenin and Armadillo, so it is rather surprising to find them engaged in an association considered unique to plakoglobin. The second repeat, however, is less conserved and may therefore impart specificity to the complex. In contrast to the localized region of plakoglobin sufficient to bind Dsg1, Dsc1a association is impaired by deletions of either the carboxyl-terminal repeats or repeat 2. These results are compatible with two possibilities. In the first model, Dsc1a association would require simultaneous binding to both ends of the repeat domain. Alternatively, the interaction may occur over a region between repeats 2-13 in a manner that is conformationally sensitive to deletions at either end. Interestingly, this region overlaps binding sites for E- and N-cadherin(15.Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 40.Sacco P.A. McGranahan M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20201-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Dsg1 binding site lies next to and may involve that for α catenin(15.Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 40.Sacco P.A. McGranahan M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20201-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that binding of desmosomal cadherins will sterically hinder the association of other partners, accounting for the distinct complexes formed by plakoglobin with α-catenin and classical cadherins at adherens junctions and with Dsg1 and Dsc-1a at desmosomes. Considerably more plakoglobin binds to Dsg1 than to Dsc1a. Furthermore, overexpression of the Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain produces a dominant negative effect on desmosome formation, whereas expression of the analogous region of Dsc1a does not(21.Troyanovsky S.M. Troyanovsky R.B. Eshkind L.G. Krutovskikh V.A. Leube R.E. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given the capacity of Dsg1 for binding plakoglobin and the significance of this association for both the formation of desmosomes and suppression of cytosolic roles of plakoglobin, naturally occurring mutations in the interactive domains of Dsg1 and plakoglobin are likely to have marked consequences not only for cell adhesion but also for proliferation and differentiation. The interactions of plakoglobin with its partners are similar in several respects to those described for another arm protein, the regulatory A subunit of phosphatase 2A (PP2A-A)(51.Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the catalytic C subunit binds to a discrete site at one end of PP2A-A, as do Dsg1 and α-catenin on plakoglobin. There is clear evidence for competition and cooperation among some of the binding partners of PP2A, whereas others bind independently(51.Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that Dsg1 and Dsc1a can interact with plakoglobin separately. Whether they can bind simultaneously to a single plakoglobin molecule awaits the development of Dsc-1-specific antibodies. This question relates to an important potential role for plakoglobin in organizing cadherins into an adhesive zipper. A model has been proposed for PP2A-A in which each repeat forms two amphipathic helices that interact along their hydrophobic faces(51.Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consecutive helix pairs stack to form a concertina-like rod with interrepeat and intrarepeat loops projecting from opposite surfaces of the rod. A similar arrangement of secondary structures may exist for plakoglobin, because residues required to form the putative amphipathic helices are conserved in all arm proteins(42.Kussell P. Frasch M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1491-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the potential similarities between PP2A-A and plakoglobin in their secondary structures and topology of their intermolecular associations, biochemical analyses suggest that they differ in their tertiary structure; PP2A-A is a rod-like molecule, whereas plakoglobin behaves as a globular protein(49.Kapprell H.-P. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 51.Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As Dsc1a association requires both ends of the repeat domain of plakoglobin, one can envisage a horseshoe, rather than a rod-like shape for plakoglobin. Dsc1a would bind directly to both ends or to a central conformationally dependent binding pocket created by intramolecular association of the ends. Clearly these models are highly speculative, and crystal structure analyses to resolve the structure of plakoglobin are currently underway. The emerging model of arm proteins is one in which individual repeats provide the principal binding sites for particular partners and neighboring repeats contribute to the specificity and stability of these associations. Partners recognize partially overlapping regions and may compete or cooperate for binding. Thus distinct tripartite complexes with different functions are formed, integrating cellular processes as diverse as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Definition of the binding sites on plakoglobin now permits the development of minimally altered mutants deficient in cadherin binding functions to test the outcome of uncoupling membrane and cytosolic functions of this protein.

O., and Burns, G. F.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2517-2521). In the present study, we establish that the adhesion of M-CSF-treated macrophages to vitronectin is mediated by the integrin αvβ5, and show by indirect immunofluorescence analysis that αvβ5 and the cytoskeletal protein paxillin localize to focal contacts upon adhesion to vitronectin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed that M-CSF-treated macrophages do not express focal adhesion kinase (FAK), thereby providing direct evidence for integrin-dependent localization of paxillin to focal contacts in the absence of FAK expression. Investigation of paxillin phosphorylation by two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that paxillin is 99% phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in response to vitronectin adhesion, and only 1% phosphorylated on tyrosine. Stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhances paxillin phosphorylation, while two selective inhibitors of PKC, GF109203X and chelerythrine chloride, effectively block the phosphorylation of paxillin induced in response to vitronectin adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in M-CSF-treated macrophages adherent to vitronectin, paxillin localizes to focal contacts in the absence of FAK expression and is predominantly phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in a PKC-dependent manner. The macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is able to induce the expression of the αvβ5 integrin receptor on the surface of cultured human macrophages (De Nichilo, M. O., and Burns, G.

Investigation of paxillin phosphorylation by two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that paxillin is 99% phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in response to vitronectin adhesion, and only 1% phosphorylated on tyrosine. Stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhances paxillin phosphorylation, while two selective inhibitors of PKC, GF109203X and chelerythrine chloride, effectively block the phosphorylation of paxillin induced in response to vitronectin adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in M-CSF-treated macrophages adherent to vitronectin, paxillin localizes to focal contacts in the absence of FAK expression and is predominantly phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in a PKC-dependent manner."

Alone, each had no adenylyl cyclase activity; however, mixing of the two domains in vitro resulted in GSα- and forskolin-activated enzyme activity. The turnover number for GSα- and forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity of the complex between IC1 and IIC2-Δ3 was 8.2 s-1. The concentration of IIC2-Δ3 to achieve half-maximal activation of IC1 was 0.8 and 1.3 μM when stimulated by forskolin and GSα, respectively. The concentration of IIC2-Δ3 needed to complex with IC1 was reduced 10-fold (0.08 μM) when the enzyme was activated by both forskolin and GSα, suggesting that GSα and forskolin increased the affinity of the two cytoplasmic domains for each other.

Further analysis of the platelet activation by FcγRIIA demonstrated that FcγRIIA is also inducibly coupled to the serine/threonine and lipid kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K).

Clustering of ITAM-containing receptors by cognate ligand or specific antibodies has been shown to result in phosphorylation of two critical tyrosine residues in the ITAM which converts the ITAM into a high affinity binding site for members of the Syk/ZAP-70 family of tyrosine kinases that interact with this motif through tandem src homology region 2 (SH2) domains. Phosphorylation of ITAMs appears to be mediated by members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, and the importance of Src kinases in ITAM phosphorylation and Syk/ZAP-70 recruitment has been well documented(15.Iwashima M.

Thus, ITAM phosphorylation initiated by receptor clustering and the subsequent recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins provides one inducible mechanism by which receptors lacking endogenous catalytic activity can be coupled to effector molecules that are catalytically active. The ITAM integral to FcγRIIA is unusual in that it contains an extended spacer of 12 amino acids (18.Brooks D.G. Qiu W.Q. Luster A.D. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1369-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) between the two YXXL pairs, while other members of the ITAM family contain spacer regions of 6-8 amino acids. Additionally, while ITAM-containing receptors exist as multisubunit complexes comprising an extracellular ligand binding unit that is noncovalently associated with intracellular ITAM-containing signaling subunits(10.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar), FcγRIIA is a single-chain transmembrane polypeptide with an ITAM integral to its primary structure. Mutational analysis of the tyrosine residues of the FcγRIIA-ITAM has shown that they are required for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and for phagocytosis mediated by FcγRIIA(19.Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Budde P. Bewarder N. Weinrich V. Frey J. Eur. J.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the FcγRIIA-ITAM remains functional despite its divergence from the consensus sequence. Results from another study suggest that the ITAM of FcγRIIA transduces a qualitatively different signal from the ITAM of the γ-chain subunit of the high affinity FcγR, implying that there are unique aspects to the FcγRIIA-ITAM despite the common functional features it shares with other members of the group(22.Van den Herik-Oudjik I.E.

Analysis of the mechanism by which FcγRIIA in platelets transduces signal therefore provides insight into the understanding of ITAM signaling from the perspective of this simple yet unique model. Previous work from our laboratory, and from others, has revealed that clustering of FcγRIIA on platelets induces receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and noncovalent association of the tyrosine kinase p72syk with tyrosine-phosphorylated FcγRIIA(2.Chacko G.W.

Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). Activation of p72syk in platelets is induced by several platelet agonists including thrombin, collagen, and platelet activation factor(24.Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M.

Engagement of the fibrinogen receptor (the integrin αIIbβ3) by fibrinogen in thrombin-activated platelets further up-regulates p72syk activity(8.Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem.

These observations suggest that p72syk plays a central role in platelet activation and that regulation of its activity is complex. Additionally, targeted gene disruption of the p72syk gene in the mouse has been shown to result in perinatal death due to massive hemorrhages(28.Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O.

Nature. 1995; 378: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), further suggesting a critical role for p72syk in platelet function. Experiments with ITAM-containing receptors have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) is often activated in response to receptor clustering(30.Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 31.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PI 3-K is a serine/threonine and lipid kinase that exists as a heterodimer comprising an 85-kDa regulatory subunit containing two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit(32.Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 33.Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The presence of the SH2 and SH3 domains in PI 3-K implies that noncovalent interactions with target proteins take place, and considerable experimental evidence exists to support this contention(31.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 32.Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). PI 3-K is also rapidly activated and translocated to the cytoskeleton when platelets are stimulated with the potent agonist thrombin(34.Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.

More recently, it has been shown that the translocation of PI 3-K to the cytoskeleton is integrin-dependent and that platelet aggregation induced by thrombin through its G-protein-coupled receptor can be reversed by inhibitors of PI 3-K activity (36.Kovacsovics T.J.

PI 3-K has been implicated in FcγR function in neutrophils, the monocytic cell line U937, and natural killer (NK) cells suggesting a conserved role in FcγR-mediated signaling(38.Ninomiya N. Hazeki K.

Fc receptor ligation results in an increase in the specific activity of PI 3-K as well as an increase in phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-K activity in response to FcγR stimulation, although the specific mechanism of activation was not determined. The understanding of how PI 3-K is activated on phagocytes and NK cells is further complicated by the different isoforms of FcγR expressed on these cell types. Analysis of FcγRIIA activation in platelets which express only a single FcγR, provides specific information on the mechanism by which the low affinity FcγRIIA transduces signal and contributes to the general paradigm describing how FcγR activates PI 3-K. In this study we demonstrate that, upon platelet activation by FcγRIIA clustering, PI 3-K is coupled-associated with FcγRIIA. We show that noncovalent association of p72syk and PI 3-K can be reconstituted using synthetic phosphopeptides that correspond to the sequence of the FcγRIIA-ITAM. Interestingly, while p72sykassociation with the phosphorylated FcγRIIA-ITAM appears independent of the activation status of platelets, the binding of PI 3-K to FcγRIIA requires platelet activation. These data showing that the presence of a phosphorylated ITAM is sufficient to induce the binding of p72syk but not PI 3-K to FcγRIIA suggest that additional modifications are required to promote association of the activated FcγRIIA complex with molecules that are downstream of the receptor complex in the signaling cascade. We propose that PI 3-K binding to FcγRIIA may require an adapter molecule(s) that binds both FcγRIIA and PI 3-K and speculate that p72syk is an attractive candidate for this function.

Human platelets were obtained by venipuncture from healthy humans with informed consent, activated by FcγRIIA cross-linking using anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 and GAM as a secondary clustering reagent, and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 145 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA) as described(2.Chacko G.W.

Immunoadsorptions, SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting, and detection by chemiluminescent procedures were also performed as described(2.Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human platelets were isolated as described above. Platelets were maintained at room temperature throughout isolation procedures. For aggregation studies, platelets were washed in platelet wash buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM KCl, 5.5 mMD-glucose, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 15 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4), and incubated at room temperature with concentrations of wortmannin ranging from 1 to 100 nM for 5 min or incubated with platelet wash buffer alone. Platelets were stimulated by first equilibrating them at 37°C for 3 min in aggregation buffer (platelet wash buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2) with stirring and then adding agonists. Aggregation responses were recorded on a Chronolog Dual Channel LumiAggregometer (Model 560). Platelet responses to thrombin, monoclonal antibody IV.3 in combination with GAM, anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody CIKM5 (IgG1), and GAM alone were tested in three independent experiments with platelets from different donors. Doses of agonists used were as follows: thrombin, 2 units/ml; IV.3, 2.8 μg/ml; CIKM5, 1:25 dilution of ascites, and GAM, 100 μg/ml. Phosphatidylinositol liposomes were prepared by resuspending vacuum-dried phosphatidylinositol in assay buffer (30 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) at 10 mg/ml and sonicating on ice for 10 min at 50 MHz. Immunoadsorbates were washed four times in Triton X-100 lysis buffer and three times in 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Washed immunoadsorbates were then resuspended in 40 μl of PI 3-K assay buffer to which 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP, of specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol, in assay buffer was then added to the immune complexes at a final concentration of 1 μCi/μl followed by the addition of 20 μl of liposomes. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature or 15 min at 30°C and were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 N HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 300 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1), removing the organic phase which was then dried under vacuum, redissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1), and spotted on Silica G-60, HP-TLC plates. Lipid products were developed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a chloroform:pyridine:boric acid:formic acid:water solvent system as described (44.Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. Rf values were estimated for putative PI 3-P and PI 4-P products. PI 3-K products were identified by their sensitivity to 100 nM wortmannin (45.Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

Peptides corresponding to the ITAM sequence of FcγRIIA plus flanking residues (Fig. 4) were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility, Ohio State University, and Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase and size exclusion chromatography to greater than 95% purity. Peptides were evaluated by mass spectrometry and 31P NMR for correct molecular weight and incorporation of phosphotyrosine residues, respectively. Peptides were biotinylated at the N-terminal glutamic acid residue to allow coupling to an avidin-coated solid phase (Neutravidin). Peptides were diluted in 100 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin to which was added 100 μl of Neutravidin bead slurry. The suspension was placed on a rocking platform for 1 h, washed five times in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then incubated for 1 h or overnight with platelet lysates. Peptide adsorbates were washed extensively in lysis buffer, separated by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted to detect phosphotyrosine or candidate molecules. Previous work has demonstrated that clustering of FcγRIIA on platelets and other cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIA, noncovalent association, and activation of the tyrosine kinase p72syk with FcγRIIA(2.Chacko G.W.

Since several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including p72syk co-immunoadsorb with activated FcγRIIA, we sought to determine whether other catalytically active molecules were also noncovalently complexed with activated FcγRIIA. Of special interest was the lipid and serine/threonine kinase, PI 3-K, since it has been reported to play a role in platelet activation by thrombin (2.Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.M. Coggeshall K.M.

Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Consequently, PI 3-K activity co-immunoadsorbing with FcγRIIA was detected by assaying for the ability of FcγRIIA immunoadsorbates to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol at the D-3 position of the inositol ring (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since commonly used solvent systems do not resolve PI 3-K products from those of other phosphoinositide kinases such as PI 4-K, phospholipids were separated by TLC using a solvent system containing boric acid. The ability of boric acid to bind cis-diols and thereby to allow distinction between phosphatidylinositol phosphorylated at the D-3 or D-4 positions of the inositol ring has been documented(44.Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Rf value of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was in good correspondence with published values(44.Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and addition of the PI 3-K inhibitors wortmannin and Triton X-100 to PI 3-K immunoadsorbates (39.Kanakaraj P. Duckworth B. Azzoni L. Kamoun M. Cantley L.C. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 46.Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) abolished any detectable PI 3-K activity (Fig. 1, top panel, lanes 2 and 3) showing that PI 3-K activity was specifically detected and resolved in this assay. Within 30 s of clustering FcγRIIA on platelets, there is a rapid and transient increase in FcγRIIA-associated PI 3-K activity (Fig. 1, bottom panel) that returns to near resting levels by 1 min. A secondary peak of PI 3-K activity was also observed 3-5 min after FcγRIIA clustering (data not shown) consistent with reports of two waves of PI 3-K activity in thrombin-stimulated platelets(37.Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, FcγRIIA-mediated platelet activation results in transiently elevated levels of FcγRIIA-associated PI 3-K activity. To determine whether the PI 3-K activity co-immunoadsorbing with activated FcγRIIA was due to the binding of PI 3-K to the activated receptor complex, FcγRIIA was immunoadsorbed from detergent lysates of resting and activated platelets with monoclonal antibody IV.3, and associated PI 3-K was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against the p85 subunit of PI 3-K. Noncovalent association of PI 3-K with FcγRIIA was detected approximately 30 s after clustering (Fig. 2, lane 4) consistent with our observations on FcγRIIA-associated PI 3-K activity (Fig. 1). Although the amount of PI 3-K that coimmunoadsorbs with FcγRIIA appears to decrease to near resting levels (Fig. 2, lane 4) by a 1-min or greater interval after clustering (Fig. 2, lane 3), it is still readily detected in detergent-soluble fractions of activated platelets by immunoadsorption and immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibodies (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) suggesting that depletion of PI 3-K from supernatants of detergent lysates of activated platelets is unlikely to be the cause of reduced association with FcγRIIA. Therefore, activation of platelets by anti-FcγRIIA antibodies along with secondary cross-linking antibodies results in the phosphorylation of FcγRIIA on tyrosine residues and a rapid and apparently transient association of PI 3-K with the activated (tyrosine-phosphorylated) FcγRIIA. Clustering of FcγRIIA on platelets induces platelet activation resulting in platelet aggregation which is conveniently measured in vitro. To determine whether the coupling of PI 3-K to FcγRIIA was required for platelet aggregation, wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-K, was used in platelet aggregation assays. Addition of wortmannin at nanomolar concentrations inhibited FcγRIIA-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Wortmannin pretreated platelets were still able to respond to thrombin at the maximal aggregating dose of 2 units/ml (Fig. 3, solid triangles) indicating that at the nanomolar concentrations used in this assay, wortmannin did not totally inhibit the ability of platelets to be activated and to aggregate. At doses of thrombin lower than 2 units/ml (data not shown), platelet aggregation was similarly inhibited by wortmannin implying a similar requirement for PI 3-K activation in both FcγRIIA and thrombin signaling pathways. Therefore, inhibition of PI 3-K activity in platelets by wortmannin results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation mediated by FcγRIIA. The observations documenting noncovalent association of p72syk and PI 3-K with activated FcγRIIA are consistent with the presence of an ITAM in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIA. To determine whether this noncovalent association of p72syk and PI 3-K with activated FcγRIIA could be reconstituted with the FcγRIIA-ITAM alone, synthetic peptides were generated that corresponded to the se"

We have previously demonstrated increased expression of mRNA encoding the Galβ1, 3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase in mature medullary human thymocytes, compared with immature cortical thymocytes. For this enzyme, increased expression of transferase mRNA correlated with increased sialylation of O-glycans. We have now examined the pattern of expression in the human thymus of two additional sialyltransferases, the Galβ1,4GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6N) and the Galβ1,3/4GlcNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3N). The patterns of mRNA expression were compared with the pattern of binding of two sialic acid-specific plant lectins, Sambucus nigra agglutinin and Maackia amurensis agglutinin, which preferentially recognize α2,6- and α2,3-linked sialic acids, respectively, on N-glycans. By in situ hybridization, mRNA encoding ST3N was detected uniformly throughout the thymus. All thymocytes bound M. amurensis agglutinin, demonstrating a direct correlation between the level of ST3N mRNA expression and cell-surface glycosylation. In contrast, mRNA encoding ST6N was also expressed uniformly throughout the thymus; however, only mature (CD3hi) medullary thymocytes bound S. nigra agglutinin. On mature thymocytes, S. nigra agglutinin appeared to bind primarily to the cell-surface glycoprotein CD45; since only the mature thymocytes expressed the CD45RA isoform, while both mature and immature populations expressed the CD45R0 isoform, CD45RA may be a preferred substrate for ST6N. These results demonstrate that glycoprotein sialylation is tightly regulated during T cell development and that the developmentally regulated expression of specific oligosaccharide structures on the cell surface may be influenced by expression of both the relevant glycosyltransferase and specific acceptor substrates.

More than 20% of the population suffers from type I allergic reactions (allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and bronchial asthma). The symptoms of type I allergy are due to release of mediators (e.g. histamine) resulting from the cross-linking of specific IgE antibodies, which are bound to allergic effector cells (mast cells and basophils). Studies on the primary structure of immunoglobulin E were initially hampered by the extremely low concentration of IgE (10-400 ng/ml) in the serum. Due to the availability of IgE-secreting myeloma cells, it was, however, possible to characterize IgE antibodies by immunochemical, protein chemical, and finally molecular biological techniques (Bennich et al., 3.Bennich H.H.

To investigate the molecular interaction of IgE antibodies and allergens, studies on the V regions of specific IgE antibodies would be needed. Because of the low number of IgE-secreting B-cells in the peripheral blood of allergic patients (McKenzie and Dosch, 1989), a detailed study of allergen-specific IgE antibodies and in particular of their V regions has proven to be extremely difficult. In addition, it has been so far impossible to immortalize B-lymphocytes that were switched to specific IgE production in vivo.

Recombinant human IgE Fabs with specificity for Phl p 5, a major timothy grass pollen allergen (Vrtala et al., 1993a), were isolated by panning and analyzed. The present approach may contribute to the molecular analysis of allergen-IgE interactions and may perhaps be useful to define recombinant Fabs, which, due to the lack of the Fc∊ receptor binding site, may be envisaged as potential therapeutic tools that can compete with natural IgE antibodies for the allergen binding. For the construction of the IgE combinatorial library, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained during the grass pollen season from a grass pollen allergic patient after informed consent was given. The patient suffered from allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis during the grass pollen season, was skin test-positive for timothy grass, and had received no hyposensitization treatment. Total serum IgE was determined by radioimmunoassay with a RIACT kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to be 500,000 units/liter and a RAST class of >4 for timothy grass pollen was measured. The patient was further tested for IgE reactivity to purified recombinant birch (Betv 1 (Breiteneder et al., 5.Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A. Valenta R. Kraft D. Rumpold H. Scheiner O. Breitenbach M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and Bet v 2 (Valenta et al., 31.Valenta R. Duchêne M. Pettenburger K. Sillaber C. Valent P. Bettelheim P. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Science. 1991; 253: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar)) and timothy grass pollen allergens (Phl p 1, Phl p 2, and Phl p 5) to determine his allergogram (Laffer et al., 32.Valenta R. Vrtala S. Ball T. Laffer S. Steinberger P. Kraft D. ACI News. 1994; 6: 165-169Google Scholar; Dolecek et al., 1993; Vrtala et al., 1993a). 150 ml of heparinized blood were obtained from the allergic donor during the grass pollen season (with informed consent). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Pharmacia) (Steinberger et al., 28.Steinberger P. Bohle B. di Padova F. Wrann M. Liehl E. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Valenta R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared by a guanidinium isothiocyanate method (Davis et al., 7.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier, New York1986Google Scholar). Several independent cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification reactions were carried out using a RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). In brief, total RNA (20-60 μg) was mixed with 10-20 pmol of oligonucleotide primers specific for the constant region of the epsilon chains (C∊1, 5′-GCT ACT AGT TTT GTT GTC GAC CCA GTC; C∊2, 5′-CGA CTG TAA ACT AGT CAC GGT GGG CGG GGT G) and for the light chains (Cκ1a, 5′-GCG CCG TCT AGA ACT AAC ACT CTC CCC TGT TGA AGC TCT TTG TGA CGG GCA AG; Cκ1d, 5′-GCG CCG TCT AGA ATT AAC ACT CTC CCC TGT TGA AGC TCT TTG TGA CGG GCG AAC TCA G; Cλ2, 5′-CGC CGT CTA GAA TTA TGA ACA TTC TGT AGG), heated at 65°C for 5 min and then used in a 2-h reverse transcription reaction according to the suppliers protocol. The reverse transcription reactions and oligonucleotide primer specific for variable regions of the heavy chains: VH1, 5′-CAC TCC CAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCT GG; VH2, 5′-GTC CTG TCC CAG GTC AAC TTA CTC GAG TCT GG; VH3, 5′-GTC CAG GTG GAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCT GG; VH4, 5′-GTC CTG TCC CAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCG GG; VH5, 5′-GTC TGT GCC GAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCT GG; VH6, 5′-GTC CTG TCA CAG GTA CAG CTG CTC GAG TCA GG; VH135, 5′-AG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCT GG; V4F, 5′-CAG GTG CAG CTG CTC GAG TCG GG; and the κ- or λ-chains (Vκ1, 5′-GAG CCG CAC GAG CCC GAG CTC CAG ATG ACC CAG TCT CC; Vκ1a, 5′-GAC ATC GAG CTC ACC CAG TCT CCA; Vκ2a, 5′-GAG CCG CAC GAG CCC GAG CTC GTG ATG AC(C/T) CAG TCT CC; Vκ3a, 5′-GAA ATT GAG CTC ACG CAG TCT CCA; Vκ3, 5′-GAG CCG CAC GAG CCC GAG CTC GTG (A/T)TG AC(A/G) CAG TCT CC; Vλ1, 5′-AAT TTT GAG CTC ACT CAG CCC CAC; Vλ3, 5′-TCT GTG GAG CTC CAG CCG CCC TCA GTG) were then used in a 100-μl hot start PCR amplification at the following conditions: 1 cycle of 5 min at 95°C for denaturation, 50 s annealing at 54°C, and 50 s elongation at 72°C followed by 40 cycles: 1 min denaturation at 92°C, 50 s annealing at 54°C, and 50 s elongation at 72°C. PCR reactions were done using a combination of each constant region and variable region primer and pooled for the construction of the library. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers of the epsilon chains and light chains were synthesized according to (Kabat et al., 13.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 4th Ed. U. S. Government Printing Office, Bethesda, MD1987: 674Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers specific for the variable region of the heavy chains and variable and constant regions of the κ- and λ-chains were synthesized according to Persson et al.(22.Persson M.A.A. Caothien R.H. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and Kang et al. (15.Kang A.S. Burton D.R. Lerner R.A. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 111-118Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The PCR products coding for IgE Fds and light chains were ethanol-precipitated, gel-purified, and cut with SpeI/XhoI and SacI/XbaI, respectively (Boehringer Mannheim). The digested PCR products were again ethanol-precipitated and gel-purified. For the construction of the IgE combinatorial library, the light chains were first ligated into the SacI/XbaI site of pComb3H and transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1Blue to yield a light chain library of 3 × 107 independent clones. The plasmid DNA containing the light chain library was then isolated, cut with SpeI/XhoI to release the heavy chain stuffer, and gel-purified. The ligation of the cDNAs coding for the IgE Fds into the light chain plasmid yielded a library of 5 × 107 independent primary clones. All molecular biological manipulations used for the construction of the IgE combinatorial library followed the protocols of the Cold Spring Harbor Course on Monoclonal Antibodies from Combinatorial Libraries by Carlos F. Barbas and Dennis R. Burton. ELISA plates (Costar 3690, Cambridge, MA) were coated with purified recombinant timothy grass pollen allergens rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, and rPhl p 5, respectively (0.2 μg/well). The wells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Freshly prepared phage suspension (approximately 1012 plaque-forming units) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The phage were then removed, and the wells were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 once. Phage were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the eluent was neutralized with 2 M Tris. Freshly grown E. coli XL-1Blue were then infected with the eluted phage. An aliquot was used to determine the titer of infected E. coli. The culture was grown in SB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracyclin. By infection with helper phage VCS M13, filamentous phage were produced for the next round of panning as described (Barbas et al., 1991). The panning was repeated four times. During the subsequent pannings, additional washing of the wells was done and individual clones were then analyzed for the production of Phl p 5-specific Fabs by ELISA. Clones 5, 14, 28, and 31 were checked for the production of Phl p 5-specific Fabs by ELISA and for the correct insertion of cDNAs coding for heavy chain fragments and light chains by restriction analysis before sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared from recombinantE. coli XL-1 Blue using Qiagen tips (Hilden, Germany). Both DNA strands were sequenced using 35S-dCTP (DuPont NEN) and a T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia) by primer walking (Sanger et al., 24.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Sequencing primers were obtained from Pharmacia. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains were compared with the GenBank and Swissprot library. For the production of soluble Fab fragments, DNA was isolated from several independent clones after the fifth round of panning. The plasmid DNA was digested with SpeI and NheI, recovered from a 1% agarose gel, self-ligated, and retransformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue. E. coli containing the correctly religated plasmid were then used to produce soluble Fab fragments. In brief, single colonies were inoculated into SB medium containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cultures were grown at 37°C for 6 h and then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 4 mM. Induced E. coli were then grown at 30°C overnight, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The E. coli supernatants were used for ELISA assays, immunoblotting, and for the affinity purification of Phl p 5-specific Fabs. 2.5 mg of purified recombinant Phl p 5 was coupled to an AminoLink(™) column (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's advice. Approximately 200 ml of E. coli supernant containing Phl p 5-specific Fabs were centrifuged at 20,000 × g and subsequently filtered through folded filters (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) to remove debris from the solution. The supernatants were applied to the column at 4°C, and the column was then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline until no protein could be detected by photometry at 280 nm in the wash fractions. Bound Phl p 5-specific Fabs were eluted with 100 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, and neutralized in 3 M Tris, pH 9. Natural grass pollen extracts were prepared from rye grass (Lolium perenne), rye (Secale cereale), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), timothy grass (Phleum pratense), and birch (Betula verrucos) pollen purchased from Allergon, Välinge, Sweden (Vrtala et al., 36.Vrtala S. Grote M. Duchêne M. vanRee R. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Valenta R. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 102: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recombinant timothy grass pollen allergens were purified as described (Vrtala et al., 1996). Approximately 100 μg of natural pollen extract/cm of preparative 12% SDS-PAGE (Fling and Gregerson, 10.Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) were applied, whereas 1 μg/cm gel of the purified recombinant allergens was separated. Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Towbin et al., 30.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and nitrocellulose strips were incubated with 1:10 diluted sera from allergic patients followed by 125I-labeled anti-human IgE antibodies (Pharmacia). For IgE inhibition studies, nitrocellulose-blotted recombinant Phl p 5 was preincubated with the Phl p 5-specific Fabs. Fab preparations with specificity for a different allergen (Bet v 1) were included as negative controls. IgE binding was performed as described above and visualized by autoradiography. The detection of nitrocellulose-blotted or ELISA plate-coupled allergens with the IgE Fabs was done using an alkaline phosphatase coupled goat anti-human Fab antiserum (Pierce). Serum from the donor who was used for the construction of the IgE combinatorial library was tested for the presence of grass pollen-specific IgE. Fig. 1 shows that the patient displayed IgE cross-reactivity to natural grass pollen extracts from rye grass, Kentucky Bluegrass, rye, and timothy grass. Most of the grass pollen-specific IgE bound to proteins of approximately 30 kDa, which represent group 1 and group 5 allergens (Laffer et al., 1994; Vrtala et al., 1993a). The testing with recombinant Phl p 1 (lane 5) and Phl p 5 (lane 7) indicated that most of this binding was due to the reactivity to group 5 allergens. Starting from RNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the grass pollen allergic donor, cDNAs coding for IgE Fds could be amplified. Fig. 2 shows the successful PCR amplification of IgE Fds using primers specific for different VH families (VH1-VH6) and a primer located in the first constant region of human IgE. RNA was isolated at different times of the year during 2 years, and it is noteworthy that the efficacy of the PCR amplification was best during the grass pollen season. Since the patient did not receive hyposensitization therapy, it was assumed that the increased IgE production during the grass pollen season was mostly due to stimulation by allergen contact. The obtained PCR product therefore may contain a high proportion of allergen-specific IgE Fds. The PCR products were confirmed to represent IgE-Fd encoding fragments by differential hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotides specific for IgE and IgG as described (Steinberger et al., 1995). Subcloning of light chain cDNAs into plasmid pComb3H yielded a plasmid library consisting of 3 × 107 primary clones. The subsequent ligation of the IgE-Fd cDNAs led to the construction of a combinatorial library of approximately 5 × 107 primary clones which had contained heavy and light chain cDNAs. Fig. 3 shows the restriction analysis of 20 randomly isolated clones of the IgE combinatorial library. Only seven clones did not contain both cDNAs coding for the heavy chain fragment and light chain, indicating that 65% of the clones had combined correctly both cDNAs. Filamentous phage expressing IgE Fabs on their surface were panned five times using ELISA plate-immobilized recombinant Phl p 5, Phl p 1, Phl p 2, and bovine serum albumin as a control. After the last round of panning, clones were converted by restriction with SpeI and NheI to produce soluble Fabs. Supernatants from 20 clones were then tested by ELISA for the presence of Phl p 5-specific Fabs, among which four Phl p 5-specific clones designated clone 5, 14, 28, and 31 were characterized in detail. The specificity of the supernatants for Phl p 5 was confirmed by testing them for binding to recombinant Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, timothy grass pollen extract, and birch pollen extract. Supernatants from these clones bound to recombinant Phl p 5 and timothy grass pollen extract but not to any of the other proteins tested. No differences in the binding to native ELISA plate-immobilized, nitrocellulose-blotted Phl p 5 were observed. Both strands of the DNA sequences coding for the Fd fragments and light chains of the clones were determined according to Sanger by primer walking, and the amino acid sequence was deduced. Fig. 4 shows the DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the IgE heavy chain fragment, which was utilized by all four clones. It is noteworthy that identical heavy chain fragments were obtained by using two different PCR primers for the c∊ constant region, indicating a positive selection for these particular IgE Fds during the panning process. The parts of the C∊ domain were completely identical with known human IgE sequences (Flanagan and Rabbitts, 1982; Kurokawa et al., 1983). A molecular mass of 24.2 kDa could be predicted for the Fd-fragments of clones 5 and 28, whereas a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa could be deduced for clones 14 and 31, which were generated by a constant region primer located closer to the variable region (Fig. 4). As can be seen in Fig. 5(A and B), different κ light chains were used by the four clones. Most of the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the framework regions were silent. Regarding the CDRs of the four light chains, most differences were found in the CDR3 and CDR1. In conclusion, the panning procedure with recombinant Phl p 5 had enriched different IgE Fabs, which used identical heavy chain fragments that had combined with different light chains. More than 80% of grass pollen allergic patients display IgE cross-reactivity to group 5 allergens (Vrtala et al., 1993a). cDNAs coding for functional recombinant group 5 allergens were isolated from these species (Singh et al., 1991; Silvanovic et al., 1991; Vrtala et al., 1993a) and shown to be highly homologous. In order to investigate whether the recombinant human IgE Fabs that were isolated by panning to recombinant Phl p 5 cross-react with natural group 5 allergens from different grass species, grass pollen extracts from rye grass, Kentucky Bluegrass, rye, and timothy grass were probed. Fig. 6 shows that supernatants containing soluble Fabs from clones 5 and 28 reacted with nitrocellulose blotted rye grass (L. perenne), Kentucky Bluegrass (P. pratensis), rye (S. cereale), and timothy grass (P. pratense) pollen extract at approximately 30 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of group 5 allergens. Additional weak binding to a 17-20 kDa component was observed in Kentucky Bluegrass and rye. Group 6 allergens, which share a high degree of sequence homology with group 5 allergens, were described to migrate at that molecular mass; however, the question whether group 6 allergens represent cleavage products of group 5 allergens or cross-reactive allergens is not yet clear (Matthiesen et al., 20.Matthiesen F. Friberg L. Olsen M. Loewenstein H. Sehon A.H. Kraft D. Molecular Biology and Immunology of Allergens. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 189-191Google Scholar). No reactivity of the Phl p 5-specific IgE Fabs was observed with birch pollen extract, which does not contain group 5 allergens. A recombinant IgG Fab (Co) with specificity for the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 was included as control and showed no reactivity with grass pollen extracts, whereas it bound to Bet v 1 at 17 kDa in birch pollen extract. Recombinant human IgE Fabs, which were isolated by panning to purified recombinant Phl p 5, cross-reacted with natural group 5 allergens from different grass species as is known for natural IgE antibodies from grass pollen allergic patients. For the purification of soluble IgE Fabs with specificity for Phl p 5, we used a single-step affinity purification procedure starting from E. coli supernatants that contained soluble Fabs. Purified recombinant Phl p 5 was coupled to an AminoLink(™) column (Pierce), and E. coli supernatants containing soluble Phl p 5-specific Fabs were applied to the column. Fig. 7A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of purified Fab preparations from clone 5 and 31 under reducing conditions. Heavy and light chains comigrated at approximately 25 kDa, and two weak bands were observed at approximately 15 and 16 kDa. The slight difference in the molecular masses of clones 5 and 31 is due to the fact that the cDNAs coding for the Fds were generated with different PCR primers. The Western blot in Fig. 7B containing the purified recombinant Fabs was probed with a goat anti-human Fab antiserum. The supernatant fraction contained low amounts of Fab, and no Fab was detected in the column wash fraction. In the elution fractions, a prominent 25-kDa band and bands at 15 and 16 kDa were bound by the anti-Fab antiserum, indicating that the lower molecular mass components observed in the Coomassie gel in Fig. 7A represented cleavage products of the Fab. The purified IgE Fab preparation contained approximately 0.1 mg/ml purified Fab and could be used to detect nitrocellulose blotted recombinant Phl p 5 up to dilutions of 1:50000 (data not shown). A single purification procedure starting from about 200 ml E. coli supernatant yielded approximately 0.5 mg of pure and soluble recombinant Fab. Using competition experiments, it was investigated whether recombinant Phl p 5-specific IgE Fabs might be able to compete with grass pollen allergic patient IgE antibodies. Pairs of nitrocellulose strips containing equal amounts of blotted recombinant Phl p 5 were preincubated with supernatants from two Phl p 5-specific Fab clones (Fig. 8, 5 and 31) or with supernatants from E. coli expressing Bet v 1-specific Fabs (Fig. 8, Co). The nitrocellulose strips were then incubated with serum IgE from two patients (A and B), and bound IgE was detected. Preincubation of Phl p 5 with the Phl p 5-specific IgE Fabs led to a weak but clearly visible reduction of IgE binding compared to the control. The weak competition was not unexpected in view of the fact that Phl p 5 harbors multiple IgE epitopes (Bufe et al., 6.Bufe A. Becker W.-M. Schramm G. Petersen A. Mamat U. Schlaak M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-linking of effector cell-bound IgE antibodies by allergens has been recognized as the key event leading to Type I allergic reactions. Although IgE antibodies are present at extremely low levels in serum (10-400 ng/ml), the release of mediators triggered by the cross-linking event causes severe allergic reactions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis). For this reason immunoglobulin E has been characterized extensively by protein chemical and molecular biological techniques (Terry et al., 1970; Kochwa et al., 1971; Bennich et al., 1973; Flanagan and Rabbitts, 1982; Kurokawa et al., 1983; Seno et al., 1983). Whereas considerable progress was achieved regarding the characterization of the constant regions of IgE, in particular the binding site for the high affinity receptor (Helm et al., 1988; Nissim and Eshhar, 1992; Presta et al., 1994), nothing was known about the V regions of IgE antibodies with specifities for allergens. In the present study we have used the filamentous phage display system to isolate human allergen-specific recombinant IgE Fab fragments. To achieve this goal, a highly sensitive PCR technique was established to allow the amplification of IgE Fd from the peripheral blood of allergic patients (Steinberger et al., 1995). An IgE combinatorial library was constructed in the pComb3H plasmid, starting from peripheral blood lymphocytes from a grass pollen allergic patient. Using purified recombinant timothy grass pollen allergens for the panning procedure, human IgE Fabs with specificity for the major timothy grass pollen allergen, Phl p 5 (Vrtala et al., 1993a), could be isolated. Phl p 5 was used as a model allergen, because it represents a major allergen for more than 80% of grass pollen allergic individuals and cross-reacts with group 5 allergens from most grass species (van Ree et al., 34.van Ree R. Driessen M.N. van Leeuwen W.A. Stapel S.O. Aalberse R.C. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1992; 22: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another reason for selecting Phl p 5 was the fact that a high percentage of grass pollen-specific IgE antibodies are directed against this allergen in most patients (Vrtala et al., 37.Vrtala, S., Susani, M., Sperr, W. R., Valent, P., Laffer, S., Dolecek, C., Kraft, D., Valenta, R. (1996) in pressGoogle Scholar, 38.Waldmann T.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Serum from the patient who was used for the construction of the combinatorial library contained high levels of Phl p 5-specific IgE compared to Phl p 1-specific IgE (Fig. 1). In fact, many more phage clones with specificity for Phl p 5 could be recovered from the combinatorial library after five rounds of panning than clones that reacted with Phl p 1. 2P. Steinberger, D. Kraft, and R. Valenta, unpublished data. It appeared hence that the repertoire represented in the IgE combinatorial library closely reflected the natural IgE antibody response of the patient. The sequence analysis of four independent Phl p 5-specific IgE Fabs revealed that all four clones used the same type of heavy chain fragment originating from different PCR reactions, which had recombined with different kappa light chains. The finding that different PCR products of the same IgE Fd and similar light chains had combined to form the Fabs that were selected by the panning procedure indicated that the recombinant Fabs might closely reflect the structure of Phl p 5-specific natural IgE antibodies. The fact that, during 2 years of continuous blood sampling and PCR amplifications of IgE Fds, PCR products were most efficiently obtained during the grass pollen season indicated that the IgE Fabs represented in the combinatorial library most likely were produced in response to repeated allergen stimulation. Like the natural IgE antibodies, the Phl p 5-specific IgE Fabs cross-reacted with group 5 allergens from rye grass, Kentucky Bluegrass, and rye. Using immobilized recombinant Phl p 5, soluble human IgE Fabs could be purified to homogeneity up to milligram amounts. Due to a lack of the c∊2-c∊4 domain, the recombinant IgE Fabs were ineffective to trigger basophil degranulation in combination with purified Phl p 5 (data not shown). In addition it could be shown that the IgE Fabs were able to compete with the IgE binding to Phl p 5 using sera from grass pollen allergic individuals. The inhibitory effect was, however, very weak, which was not surprising in view of the fact that Phl p 5 bears a number of different IgE epitopes (Bufe et al., 1994) and on the basis that the Phl p 5-specific IgE-response in patients is polyclonal. Despite this, we believe that the use of the combinatorial approach to define recombinant Fabs with specificity for major allergens may have possible therapeutic implications, as were discussed for antibodies directed against tumor or viral antigens (Waldmann, 1991). In the case of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, human and mouse monoclonal antibodies could be defined that strongly inhibited the binding of patients IgE to the allergen 3S. Lebeque, V. Visco, S. Denepoux, C. Dolecek, J. J. Pin, D. Kraft, R. Valenta, and J. Banchereau, submitted for publication. 4S. Lebeque, C. Dolecek, V. Visco, S. Denepoux, J. J. Pin, C. Guret, A. Weyer, and R. Valenta, manuscript in preparation. so that a local application of such blocking antibodies for a passive therapy in the allergic effector organs (nose, eyes, and lung) might be envisaged (Valenta et al., 1994). Using the cDNAs coding for allergen-specific Fabs, procedures such as in vitro affinity maturation might be used to “improve” the antibodies for such therapeutic applications (Barbas et al., 1994). Apart from the possible therapeutic implications, we believe that the combinatorial approach will allow the study of the interaction of human IgE antibodies and allergens at the molecular level by using purified recombinant allergens and human IgE Fabs for structural analysis (x-ray crystallography and NMR).

https://openalex.org/W1995508818,"A recent study detected genes encoding type B botulinum neurotoxin in some type A strains of Clostridium botulinum that exhibit no type B toxin activity. In this study, we investigated the presence, structure, linkage, and organization of genes encoding botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and other components of the progenitor complex. Sequence analysis showed that the silent BoNT/B gene is highly related to that from authentic proteolytic type B C. botulinum. However, a stop signal and deletions were found within the sequence. A non-toxin nonhemagglutinin gene (NTNH) was mapped immediately upstream of both the BoNT/A and silent BoNT/B genes. Significantly the NTNH gene adjacent to the defective BoNT/B gene was “chimeric,” the 5‘- and 3‘-regions of the gene had high homology with corresponding regions of the type B NTNH gene, while the 471-amino acid sequence in the central region was identical to NTNH of type A. Hemagglutinin genes HA-33 and HA-II were not found adjacent to the NTNH/A gene, but instead there was an unidentified open reading frame previously reported in strains of C. botulinum types E and F. By contrast HA-II, HA-33, and NTNH genes were located immediately upstream of the silent BoNT/B gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of chromosomal DNA digests indicated the distance between type A and B gene clusters to be less than 40 kilobases.

Significantly the NTNH gene adjacent to the defective BoNT/B gene was “chimeric,” the 5‘- and 3‘-regions of the gene had high homology with corresponding regions of the type B NTNH gene, while the 471-amino acid sequence in the central region was identical to NTNH of type A. Hemagglutinin genes HA-33 and HA-II were not found adjacent to the NTNH/A gene, but instead there was an unidentified open reading frame previously reported in strains of C. botulinum types E and F. By contrast HA-II, HA-33, and NTNH genes were located immediately upstream of the silent BoNT/B gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of chromosomal DNA digests indicated the distance between type A and B gene clusters to be less than 40 kilobases."

https://openalex.org/W1984241186,"The signal transduction cascade which initiates transmembraneous influx of Ca2+ into endothelial cells in response to the discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores is thought to involve a step sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibition. We investigated the interrelationship between Ca2+ signaling and protein tyrosine phosphorylation following cell stimulation with either the receptor-dependent agonist, bradykinin, or the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide. In cultured human endothelial cells phenylarsine oxide instigated a concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). This increase in [Ca2+]i was not associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, enhanced formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or the rapid depletion of intracellularly stored Ca2+ but was coincident with the enhanced and prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cytoskeletal proteins. In bradykinin-stimulated cells the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same cytoskeletal proteins (most notably 85- and 100-kDa proteins) was transient when cells were stimulated in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, was maintained under Ca2+-free conditions, and was reversed following readdition of extracellular Ca2+. These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 cytoskeletal proteins is determined by the level of Ca2+ present in intracellular stores thus indicating a critical role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of capacitative Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells.

These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 cytoskeletal proteins is determined by the level of Ca2+ present in intracellular stores thus indicating a critical role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of capacitative Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells. There is a certain amount of evidence to suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of, as yet unidentified, cellular proteins may be involved in the control of store-regulated or “capacitative” Ca2+ entry following the agonist-induced depletion of intracellular stores in non-excitable cells. The first evidence for such a role of tyrosine kinases in intracellular Ca2+ signaling was obtained in platelets, in which the tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of proteins was found to be transiently elevated following stimulation with thrombin(1.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Asahi M. Yanagi S. Ohta S. Sakai K. Takeuchi F. Taniguchi T. Yamamura H.

This thrombin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation could be mimicked by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores following inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase and was sensitive to the chelation of intracellular Ca2+. Repletion of Ca2+ stores was, on the other hand, associated with a return to basal phosphorylation levels(1.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations inferred that the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores favors tyrosine phosphorylation whereas store refilling and the restoration of homeostatic levels of [Ca2+]i favors tyrosine dephosphorylation of specific proteins(1.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of these findings, protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein were reported to inhibit both the thrombin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i as well as the subsequent aggregation (2.Asahi M. Yanagi S. Ohta S. Sakai K. Takeuchi F. Taniguchi T. Yamamura H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since genistein has been found to attenuate Ca2+ influx following cell stimulation with both receptor-dependent and -independent agonists it would appear that the tyrosine kinase substrate protein is likely to be intimately involved in the regulation of Ca2+ entry processes rather than being linked to specific cell receptors. Recently we have demonstrated that the bradykinin as well as the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx in endothelial cells is also mediated by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive mechanism(4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the chain of events which result in the enhanced membrane permeability to Ca2+ remain largely unexplained, these observations suggest that a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein might be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ influx. Therefore the aim of the present study was to address the hypothesis that protein tyrosine phosphorylation controls capacitative Ca2+ influx in human endothelial cells. To this end we investigated the effects of agonist stimulation on tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the effects on [Ca2+]i of altering the balance between tyrosine kinase/phosphatase activity. Genistein, ionomycin, and fura-2/AM were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH, thapsigargin was obtained from Research Biochemicals International, and BAPTA/AM 1The abbreviations used are: BAPTA1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateMAPmitogen-activated proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. and Pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, isolated from umbilical cords as described(5.Busse R. Lamontagne D. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1991; 344: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), were seeded either on quartz coverslips or in culture dishes (35 mm, Falcon) containing medium M-119 and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Vitromex) supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), L-glutamine (1 mM), glutathione (5 mg/ml), and L-(+)-ascorbic acid (5 mg/ml). [Ca2+]i was estimated in cells grown on coverslips for 24 h. For the measurement of [Ca2+]i, endothelial cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 by incubation with 3 μM fura-2/AM and 0.025% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 at 37°C for 90 min. Thereafter the coverslips were washed in HEPES-modified Tyrode solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl, 132; KCl, 4; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 0.5; HEPES, 9.5; glucose, 5. [Ca2+]i was determined fluorometrically in a thermostatically controlled cuvette as described previously(6.Fleming I. Hecker M. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and calculated as recommended by Grynkiewicz et al.(7.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 60: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that incubation of endothelial cells with the membrane permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μM, 30 min) was sufficient to abrogate the bradykinin (100 nM)-induced Ca2+ response (data not shown). Confluent primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were washed twice in HEPES-Tyrode solution and incubated at 37°C with or without various receptor-dependent and -independent stimuli as described under “Results.” Thereafter, cells were washed with ice-cold HEPES buffer containing sodium fluoride (100 mM), Na4P2O7 (15 mM), Na3VO4 (2 mM), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (44 μg/ml) and harvested by scraping. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 60 s, cells contained in the pellet were then lysed in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, left on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Approximately 30 μg of protein from the resulting supernatant or from the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction was separated by 10 or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, as described(4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham). Prestained molecular weight marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were used as standards for the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Triton X-100-soluble 10,000 × g supernatant from control and stimulated endothelial cells was prepared as described and 100 μg of protein was diluted in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (50 mM), NaCl (150 mM), EGTA (1 mM), sodium desoxycholate (0.25%), Nonidet P-40 (1%), Na3VO4 (1 mM), sodium fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (44 μg/ml). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were precipitated by shaking gently overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody covalently linked to agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The agarose was recovered by centrifugation, washed 5 times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ) present in the resulting supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting and detected with an anti-bovine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Confluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were washed twice with HEPES-Tyrode solution and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with either bradykinin (100 nM) or phenylarsine oxide (10 μM) for the times indicated under “Results.” The incubation was stopped by the aspiration of the HEPES-Tyrode and addition of 400 μl of ice-cold 6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then left on ice for 30 min, cells and supernatant were then harvested by scraping and the precipitates centrifuged at 2000 × g (15 min, 4°C). The supernatants were then extracted 4 times with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether and were neutralized by titration with NaHCO3. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) contained in the samples was then assessed using a commercially available kit (Biotrak, Amersham). Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity was assayed in whole cells lysates from cells stimulated as described under “Results.” Activity was determined by monitoring the dephosphorylation of the phosphopeptide RRLIEDAEpYAARG using a commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Unless otherwise indicated data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni t test, or ANOVA for repeated measures where appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In fura-2-loaded human endothelial cells the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide induced a slightly delayed and concentration-dependent (1-10 μM) increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A). Concentrations of phenylarsine oxide lower that 1 μM failed to have any effect on [Ca2+]i, while the addition of 3 μM phenylarsine oxide resulted in a gradual increase in [Ca2+]i and consistently produced low frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations which were synchronized throughout the entire cell population. Preliminary evidence indicates that this phenomenon is associated with a concomitant oscillation in membrane potential attributed to the activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (not shown). The highest concentration of phenylarsine oxide used (10 μM) produced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i which in 40% of the cells tested were biphasic in nature, consisting of an initial Ca2+ peak followed by a second more delayed Ca2+ increase. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i were rarely observed in the presence of the highest concentration of phenylarsine oxide (10 μM). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (100 μM), which has previously been shown to attenuate bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+-influx in endothelial cells(4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), markedly reduced the Ca2+ response to phenylarsine oxide. [Ca2+]i, as measured 10 min after the addition of phenylarsine oxide (10 μM), was 522 ± 30 nM in solvent-treated cells compared with 197 ± 14 nM in cells pretreated with genistein (n = 4, p < 0.01, Fig. 1B). The phenylarsine oxide-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was completely reversed by the dithiol reagent 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (50 μM) which binds to vicinal sulfhydryl groups (Fig. 2). In these experiments, the subsequent addition of bradykinin (100 nM) resulted in a normal Ca2+ response suggesting that the effects of phenylarsine oxide were completely reversible and that the inhibitor did not lead to the permanent uncoupling of the agonist-induced signal transduction pathway. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, phenylarsine oxide (10 μM) induced a small, slowly developing, increase in [Ca2+]i (after 10 min [Ca2+]i had increased from 69.7 ± 12 nM to 106.5 ± 23 nM, n = 8, p < 0.001; Fig. 3). Subsequent addition of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (0.3 μM), resulted in an immediate further increase in [Ca2+]i ([Ca2+]i increased from 104 ± 24 to 218 ± 15 nM; n = 4, p < 0.01) demonstrating that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor did not deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. In cells stimulated with phenylarsine oxide in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the readdition of Ca2+ was associated with an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3). In order to establish that the effects of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor on [Ca2+]i were not related to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores the effects of phenylarsine oxide on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and production of IP3 were compared with those of the receptor-dependent agonist bradykinin. When tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from endothelial cells treated with phenylarsine oxide (10 μM) and blotted with anti-PLCγ1, a clear signal was apparent in control cells but could not be detected in cells incubated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor for up to 5 min (Fig. 4A). Stimulation of endothelial cells with bradykinin (100 nM), on the other hand, resulted in a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 with a 3.5-fold increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated protein being detected within 30 s (Fig. 4B). The bradykinin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was relatively transient and tyrosine phosphorylation of the PLCγ1 returned to near basal levels within 2 min. In accordance with its effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1, phenylarsine oxide (10 μM) failed to precipitate an increase in intracellular levels of IP3 at any of the time points measured. In bradykinin-treated endothelial cells IP3 levels increased 7-fold within 10 s and had returned to baseline values within 1 min (Fig. 4C). These observations demonstrate that the phenylarsine oxide-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is not due to the rapid depletion of intracellular stores and that activation of a transmembraneous influx accounts for most of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. As a consequence of its effects on fura-2 fluorescence it was not possible to repeat these experiments using a second widely used tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Since the overall cellular level of tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by the delicate balance between the activity of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases, inhibition of dephosphorylation would be expected to result in a net increase in detectable phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. In cultured human endothelial cells, phenylarsine oxide (10 μM) induced a clear time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a triplet of bands centered at ~80 kDa as well as a 42/44-kDa doublet (Fig. 5A). The latter proteins were identified in immunoprecipitation experiments as the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase: not shown). The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase was evident 2 min after addition of the inhibitor and was maximal after 5-10 min. These effects of phenylarsine oxide were not observed in endothelial cells pretreated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (100 μM, 10 min: not shown). In order to evaluate the role of [Ca2+]i in phenylarsine oxide-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were either incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer or pretreated with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 μM, 30 min). Phenylarsine oxide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42/44-kDa doublet was largely Ca2+-dependent since a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in cells stimulated in the absence of Ca2+ but no increase was observed in BAPTA-treated cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the ~80-kDa triplet was, on the other hand, largely Ca2+-independent (Fig. 5B). A second protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (0.3 mM), also resulted in a genistein-sensitive, time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAP kinase as well as the ~80-kDa triplet (Fig. 6). Protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibition had much more rapid and pronounced effects on levels of phosphotyrosine containing proteins in the Triton X-100-insoluble (cytoskeletal) fraction. Within 30 s phenylarsine oxide induced phosphorylation of 5 distinct bands, corresponding to estimated molecular masses of ~70, 75, 77, and a doublet of ~220 kDa, while a series of bands of approximately 100, 130, and ~265 kDa were apparent after 1 to 2 min (Fig. 7A). Pretreatment of endothelial cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein tended to attenuate the phenylarsine oxide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation although the effects were by no means prevented by the inhibitor (Fig. 7B). Almost complete reversal of the phenylarsine oxide-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was achieved by subsequent addition of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (50 μM; Fig. 7C). The removal of extracellular Ca2+ or the chelation of intracellular Ca2+ failed to alter the phenylarsine oxide induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins (Fig. 8). In order to investigate the putative link between Ca2+ signaling and the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins, we studied the effect of extracellular Ca2+ removal and readdition on bradykinin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, bradykinin (100 nM) induced an immediate increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of 3 Triton-soluble proteins (60, 77, and 86 kDa). Phosphorylation of these proteins was maximal after 30 s and returned to control levels over 5 min (Fig. 9A). In the same cells bradykinin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42/44-kDa MAP kinase doublet which was detectable 2 min after agonist stimulation and was maximal after 5 min, as described previously(4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Stimulation of endothelial cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ failed to alter phosphorylation of the 60-, 77-, or 86-kDa proteins but resulted in only a transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the MAP kinases which was no longer apparent after 5 min (Fig. 9B). Phosphorylation of the 42/44-kDa doublet reappeared 1 to 2 min after the readdition of extracellular Ca2+ to these cells (Fig. 9C). Pretreatment of endothelial cells with BAPTA abrogated the bradykinin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p42 and p44 (data not shown). Bradykinin stimulation resulted in an immediate but transient increase in the phosphorylation of 4 cytoskeletal proteins with estimated molecular masses of 85, 100, 110, and 125 kDa which returned to baseline levels after 5-10 min (Fig. 10A). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, bradykinin induced a distinct increase in the phosphorylation of the 85- and 100-kDa proteins which was immediately reversed upon readdition of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 10B). Thapsigargin (100 nM) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of the MAP kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42/44-kDa doublet was not evident in cells stimulated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ but a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation of both bands was detected 5 min after the readdition of Ca2+ to the incubation medium (not shown). These findings are in line with previously published results (4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin (100 nM) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of 4 proteins in the Triton-insoluble fraction corresponding to molecular masses of 85, 100, 110, and 125 kDa. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of these bands was not transient, as was observed following cell stimulation with bradykinin, but was maintained for up to 10 min. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not influence the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation which emerged following stimulation with thapsigargin, and the readdition of extracellular Ca2+ to depleted cells was not associated with a visible change in the phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 11). Human endothelial cells were found to express a basal tyrosine phosphatase activity which was attenuated in the presence of both phenylarsine oxide and orthovanadate. Bradykinin induced a 2-fold increase in phosphatase activity which was inhibited in cells pretreated with either phenylarsine oxide or sodium orthovanadate (Table 1).TABLE 1 Over the last few years there have been several reports that the transmembraneous influx of Ca2+ is selectively attenuated in a number of cell types following inhibition of tyrosine kinases(1.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kim E.T. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that cellular levels of tyrosine phosphorylation play a determinant role in regulating Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells. In the present study the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide, induced a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i and elicited the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of endothelial proteins with the most marked effects being apparent in the Triton X-100-insoluble, or cytoskeletal, fraction. Both the increase in [Ca2+]i and the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation were attenuated in cells pretreated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, supporting the hypothesis that a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein may be involved in the regulation of [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells. In principle there are two ways by which an agonist can induce capacitative Ca2+ entry. The activation of the transmembraneous Ca2+ influx pathway could be attributed to an indirect, i.e. instigation of capacitative Ca2+ entry following the mobilization of intracellularly stored Ca2+, or a direct effect, i.e. activation of a Ca2+ influx regulatory protein. In contrast to the receptor-dependent agonist, bradykinin, phenylarsine oxide failed to tyrosine phosphorylate PLCγ or increase cellular levels of IP3. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor therefore appeared unable to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ via the classical signaling pathway associated with agonist-induced activation of endothelial cells. Inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase is also unable to account for the phenylarsine oxide-induced Ca2+ response. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ phenylarsine oxide had no immediate effect on [Ca2+]i but when incubated with cells for longer periods did induce a slight elevation. Subsequent addition of thapsigargin to these cells resulted in an immediate further increase in [Ca2+]i suggesting that the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor did not mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores. However, since the readdition of Ca2+ to cells stimulated with phenylarsine oxide in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a marked and instantaneous increase in [Ca2+]i, it would appear that the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor directly activates a Ca2+ influx pathway which does not appear to be regulated by the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Our observation that tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors appear to be able to activate Ca2+ influx pathways without first mobilizing intracellular stores is supported by similar findings in T lymphocytes following the administration of phenylarsine oxide and pervanadate(11.Fletcher M.C.

These data, together with the results obtained in the present study, suggest that the effects of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors on [Ca2+]i may instead be a direct consequence of the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of a Ca2+ influx regulatory protein. This hypothesis is supported by the report that transfection of T cells with the constitutively active tyrosine kinase v-Src results in elevated basal levels of [Ca2+]i as well as in the exaggeration of agonist-stimulated Ca2+ responses(13.Niklinska B.B. Yamada H. O'Shea J.J. June C.H. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i, it would appear likely that phosphatase activity plays a crucial role in damping Ca2+ influx both in unstimulated cells and following agonist stimulation. Indeed, the observation that protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors can themselves induce cellular responses implies that there is a significant basal activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in cultured human endothelial cells. This was confirmed by determination of tyrosine phosphatase activity in whole cell lysates. Moreover, the observation that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein attenuated both the increase in [Ca2+]i and tyrosine phosphorylation initiated by phenylarsine oxide suggests that a certain basal phosphatase activity is required to counteract phosphorylation by constitutively active protein-tyrosine kinases. Thus the dynamic balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity may play a central role in the maintenance of homeostatic levels of [Ca2+]i in unstimulated cells. Based on current knowledge, the hypothetically ideal Ca2+ influx-regulatory protein in non-excitable cells should be “activated” immediately after agonist-induced emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores, even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and to remain so until store filling is accomplished. Ideally this protein should be membrane-associated, either permanently or temporarily, and preferably linked by some manner or means to the cation channel by which Ca2+ enters the cell. To identify proteins which conform with these criteria the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins from cells stimulated with bradykinin, thapsigargin, and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors was monitored in Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. In the soluble fraction, bradykinin induced the rapid and transient phosphorylation of 3 proteins which contrasted with the relatively slow tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAP kinase, as described previously(4.Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was without effect on the phosphorylation of the ~60-, 77-, and 86-kDa proteins whereas agonist-induced phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of the MAP kinase was critically dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, elicited essentially the same effects on Triton-soluble proteins. Sodium orthovanadate and phenylarsine oxide, however, induced the maintained, Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of a protein triplet of ~80 kDa. In the cytoskeletal fraction bradykinin also evoked a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 4 proteins (85, 100, 110, and 125 kDa) which appeared identical to proteins permanently tyrosine phosphorylated following application of phenylarsine oxide. In contrast to the effects seen in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, a maintained tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was observed in cells stimulated following the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Readdition of extracellular Ca2+ to these Ca2+-depleted cells was associated with the transient dephosphorylation and maintained rephosphorylation of the 110- and 125-kDa proteins and the sustained dephosphorylation of the 85- and 100-kDa proteins. In similar experiments using thapsigargin, the reapplication of extracellular Ca2+ to depleted cells did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein or result in the dephosphorylation of the 85- and 100-kDa proteins. This observation was, however, not unexpected since, in the continued presence of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores is antagonized, thus the store remains empty although the signal for refilling, is sustained. In bradykinin-stimulated cells, however, store refilling could be accomplished following Ca2+ readdition and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85- and 100-kDa proteins was transient. It would therefore appear that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85- and 100-kDa proteins mirrors the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores, thus these two cytoskeletal proteins fit the requirements of the hypothetical Ca2+ influx regulatory protein. Although similar experiments involving intracellular Ca2+ depletion and repletion in platelets have also demonstrated the existence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins apparently sensitive to the filling state of the Ca2+ store (1.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Jenner S. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the reported apparent molecular weights of these proteins differs from that of proteins displaying similar characteristics in the present study. In addition to the putative tyrosine-phosphorylated Ca2+ influx regulatory protein, a number of other mechanisms have been proposed to regulate capacitative Ca2+ entry. Nonhydrolyzable analogues of GTP, such as GTPγS, have been shown to interfere with Ca2+ signaling in a number of cell types. The inhibitory effect of these analogues occurs at some point after the release of intracellular Ca2+ and prior to the activation of Ca2+ influx. These effects can be prevented by GTP thus implying that a small G protein is involved in communicating the empty state of intracellular Ca2+ stores to the plasma membrane (15.Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol.

The role of the “calcium influx factor,” a small, phosphate-containing, non-protein factor termed originally isolated from Jurkat T lymphocytes(19.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), as an exclusive messenger for capacitative Ca2+ entry has recently been questioned since the lymphocyte-derived factor has also been demonstrated to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores(20.Bird G.S.J. Bian X. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 481-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Involvement of the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase in the regulation of Ca2+ influx has also been proposed on the basis of observations that a number of chemically distinct P-450 inhibitors, such as the imidazole anti-fungal agents, potently inhibited Ca2+ influx in endothelial cells and platelets(21.Sargeant P. Clarkson W.D. Sage S.O. Heemskerk J.W.M. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22.Alvarez J. Montero M. García-Sancho J. Biochem.

This hypothesis is supported by the findings that the induction of P-450 by β-naphtoflavone, potentiated agonist-induced Ca2+ influx and that the P-450 product, 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, activated Ca2+ entry into endothelial cells without prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+(24.Graier W.F. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Such observations suggest that the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry into endothelial cells is a complex process likely to involve the activation of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, small G proteins, serine/threonine phosphatases, and probably also the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. In summary, in the present study we observed that treatment of endothelial cells with protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors resulted in the prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 cytoskeletal proteins and an increased Ca2+ influx via a mechanism independent of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion. Our findings strongly suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of both cytoskeletal proteins mirrors the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ store and that they play a central role in the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry.

In NER, the direct requirement for Rad3 and Rad25 in an early step of the repair process is indicated by the extreme sensitivity of various rad3 and rad25 mutants to UV light and to other DNA-damaging agents by the existence of mutants that are only inactivated in the repair function and by the fact that these mutations confer a total defect in the incision of damaged DNA(1.Prakash S.

On the other hand, whether the other subunits of TFIIH, TFB1, SSL1, p55, and p38, are also directly required for the incision of UV-damaged DNA has not yet been established. Although UV-sensitive mutations of SSL1 and of TFB1 have been identified, these ssl1 and tfb1 mutations cause conditional lethality, indicating a defect in Pol II transcription, but confer only a low level of UV sensitivity, making it possible that the moderate UV sensitivity represents a side effect engendered by the primary defect in transcription(11.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 2A. McCullough, T. Bessho, H. Qiu, L. Prakash, and S. Prakash, unpublished observations. No UV-sensitive mutations of p55 and p38 have yet been reported. Thus, it is unclear whether only the Rad3 and Rad25 proteins participate in the incision of damaged DNA or whether the entire TFIIH is in fact required in this process. In this work, we purify a subassembly of TFIIH that contains the TFB1, SSL1, p55, and p38 subunits but lacks the Rad3 and Rad25 proteins, which we refer to as TFIIH-incomplete or TFIIHi.

Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and TFIIHi (this work) has now enabled us to address whether Rad3 and Rad25 together are sufficient for damage-specific incision to occur or whether the incision reaction in fact also requires the other TFIIH subunits. Here, we show that in addition to Rad3 and Rad25, the incision of UV-damaged DNA is absolutely dependent upon the presence of TFIIHi. These reconstitution studies provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of Rad3, Rad25, and of one or more of the TFIIHi subunits in the incision of damaged DNA. In addition, we determine whether the DNA helicase activities of Rad3 and Rad25 are essential for the incision step of NER and examine the role of TFIIK in this process. Interestingly, our studies indicate that in contrast to Pol II transcription, where only the Rad25 DNA helicase activity is required(4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S.

TFIIK is dispensable for the incision of UV-damaged DNA in vitro, suggesting that association of TFIIK with TFIIH has functional relevance only for Pol II transcription. Buffers A, B, C, and D were as described(13.Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23376-23382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer E was 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.2, containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (w/v), and 250 mM potassium acetate. Buffer F was 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.7, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The concentration of potassium acetate (KOAc) added to the various buffers is indicated as a numerical value following the buffer designation; thus A + 100 is buffer A with 100 mM KOAc.

The supernatant obtained (fraction I, 900 ml) was dialyzed overnight against 10 liters of A, diluted with A to give ionic strength equivalent to 100 mM KOAc, and applied onto Bio-Rex 70 (5 × 15 cm; 300 ml total) equilibrated with A + 200. The column was washed with 500 ml of A + 200 and treated with A + 600 mM KOAc to elute bound proteins (fraction II, 150 ml). After being dialyzed against 2 liters of B + 100 overnight, the Bio-Rex 70 protein pool was applied onto DEAE-Sephacel (2.6 × 14 cm; 75 ml total) equilibrated in B + 100. After washing with 150 ml of B + 200, proteins were eluted with B + 500 to give fraction III (40 ml). The DEAE pool was dialyzed against 1 liter of B + 70 for 12 h and applied onto Bio-Rad HTP hydroxyapatite (1.6 × 6 cm; 12 ml total) equilibrated in C without EDTA and developed with a 160-ml gradient from C to D, collecting 3.2-ml fractions. The HTP column fractions that contained TFIIH were identified by immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies specific for the Rad3, Rad25, TFB1, and SSL1 subunits of TFIIH, pooled (fraction IV, 22.4 ml), and dialyzed against 1 liter of E overnight. The dialysate was mixed with 1.2 ml of nickel-nitriloacetate-agarose (Qiagen) on a rocking platform for 3 h and then centrifuged to collect the matrix. The nickel matrix was resuspended in 6 ml of E + 10 mM imidazole and transferred into a glass chromatography column with internal diameter of 0.6 cm. The nickel matrix was washed sequentially with 5 ml each of E + 20 mM imidazole, E + 30 mM imidazole, E + 40 mM imidazole, and E + 100 mM imidazole. The majority of the TFIIH (≈75%) was present in the E + 100 mM imidazole wash (fraction V), which was dialyzed against F for 2 h to lower the ionic strength to 100 mM KOAc and chromatographed on Mono S (HR5/5) with a 20-ml gradient from F + 100 to F + 550, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The Mono S fractions that contained the various TFIIH subunits, eluting at ≈300 mM KOAc, were identified by immunoblotting and pooled (fraction VI, 2.5 ml). The Mono S pool was fractionated on Mono Q (HR5/5) with a 12-ml gradient of 300-1500 mM KOAc in F, collecting 0.3-ml fractions; TFIIHi eluted at ≈600 mM KOAc, while TFIIH eluted at ≈1000 mM KOAc. For the purification of RNA polymerase II, hydroxyapatite fractions 9-12 from TFIIH purification (see above) containing core RNA polymerase II were applied directly onto a Mono Q column (HR5/5), which was developed with a 40-ml gradient of 100-1500 mM KOAc in buffer F. Fractions containing RNA polymerase II, which elutes at ≈1,100 mM KOAc, were pooled and concentrated to 2 mg/ml. Purified RNA polymerase II, 130 ng, was incubated with 125 fmol of TFIIH, TFIIH-TFIIK, or TFIIHi-TFIIK in a final volume of 10 μl of buffer CK (20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.3, 8 mM MgSO4, and 2 mM DTT) containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) for 1 h at 25°C. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and run in an 8% polyacrylamide gel, which was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The NER reaction was carried out in buffer R (40 mM potassium HEPES, pH 7.9, 120 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 30 mM creatine phosphate, 200 ng of creatine kinase, and 60 mM KOAc and 20 mM KCl due to the addition of the various NER factors) in a final volume of 10 μl, and it contained 100 ng of M13 mp 18 DNA (>90% supercoiled form) that had or had not been irradiated with 400 J/m2 UV light, 80 ng of RPA, 20 ng of the Rad1-Rad10 complex, 20 ng of Rad2 protein, 30 ng of Rad4-Rad23 complex, 15 ng of Rad14 protein, and 100 ng of TFIIH. In some cases, instead of TFIIH, 60 ng of TFIIHi, 20 ng of Rad3, and 20 ng of Rad25 were used in various combinations, as indicated. All the protein components were purified to near homogeneity as described previously ((7.Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and references therein). The protein components were preincubated for 10 min at 25°C before the DNA substrate was added. After incubation at 30°C for 12 min, reaction mixtures were deproteinized by treatment with 0.4% SDS and proteinase K at 250 μg/ml for 10 min at 37°C and then subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA). Gels were treated with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 60 min to stain DNA, soaked in a large volume of H2O for 4 h to reduce background staining, and then photographed through a red filter using Polaroid type 55 films. For detecting the excision fragments, reaction mixtures were assembled exactly the same way as in the incision assay, except that they had a final volume of 50 μl, contained 1 μg of DNA substrate and five times the amounts of NER factors used in the incision assay, and were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were extracted once with 50 μl of buffered phenol, and the DNA was precipitated at −20°C for >2 h after adding 150 μl of ethanol. The DNA precipitate was dissolved in 10 μl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA), and 3 μl of the DNA solution was treated with 5 μCi of [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) and 3 units of calf thymus terminal transferase at 37°C for 30 min in a final volume of 20 μl of the buffer supplied by the vendor (Boehringer Mannheim). After labeling, the DNA was bound to 5 μl of glass matrix in the Mermaid kit according to the instructions supplied by the vendor (Bio-101). The DNA was eluted from the matrix into 10 μl of H2O, and 6 μl of the final DNA solution was dried down in vacuum, dissolved in 3 μl of loading buffer, and run in a 15% sequencing gel with size markers. The excision fragments were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax films. The rad3 Arg-48 mutant protein was purified as described previously(14.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To purify rad25 Arg-392 protein, extract was prepared from 210 g of strain EPY52.01 harboring plasmids pR25.21 and pR25.22, as described(12.Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min), the extract (fraction I) was treated with ammonium sulfate (0.21 g/ml). The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min), dissolved in 100 ml of buffer K (20 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT), and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer K + 50 mM KCl for 12 h on ice. The dialysate (fraction II) was fractionated in a column of Q-Sepharose (1.6 × 10 cm; 20-ml matrix) using a 200-ml gradient of 100-500 mM KCl in buffer K. Fractions containing the peak of 6-histidine-tagged rad25 Arg-392 protein, eluting at ≈300 mM KCl, were identified by immunoblotting and pooled to give fraction III (30 ml total), which was treated with ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml). The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 10 ml of buffer K, dialyzed against buffer K for 3 h to lower the ionic strength to 40 mM KCl, and then fractionated in SP-Sepharose (1 × 3.8 cm; 3-ml matrix) with a 42-ml gradient of 50-400 mM KCl in buffer. The rad25 mutant protein eluted between 100 and 220 mM KCl from SP-Sepharose, and the peak fractions were pooled to yield fraction IV (15 ml total), applied directly onto Mono Q (HR5/5), which was developed with a 25-ml gradient of 100-500 mM KCl in buffer K that contained 0.01% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol instead of DTT. The pool of rad25 protein (fraction V; 5 ml total), eluting at ≈320 mM KCl, was mixed with 0.3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetate agarose (Qiagen) at 4°C for 2 h. The nickel matrix was washed in an Eppendorf tube with 0.6 ml each of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100 mM imidazole in buffer H containing 300 mM KCl. The 40 and 100 mM imidazole eluates were combined (fraction VI; 1.2 ml total), concentrated to 0.2 ml, and diluted with 3 ml of buffer K that contained 0.01% Nonidet P-40 before being fractionated in Mono S (HR5/5) using a 9-ml, 30-600 mM KCl gradient. The pool of rad25 mutant protein, eluting at ≈200 mM KCl, was concentrated and used in the NER studies. In the last step of purification in a Mono Q column, TFIIH containing the six core subunits was found in fractions 21-26. Fractions 21-23 also contained three additional polypeptides with molecular sizes of 47, 45, and 33 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2); the level of these three proteins in fractions 24-26 was much lower (Fig. 1A, lane 3). These three additional protein species are constituents of the RNA polymerase II CTD kinase, TFIIK, because: (i) they had the same molecular sizes described for the three subunits of TFIIK(8.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), (ii) they eluted in the same position in the Mono Q gradient relative to TFIIH as reported for TFIIK(8.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and (iii) the ability to specifically phosphorylate the RPB1 subunit of purified RNA polymerase II (Fig. 1C) coincided with the abundance of the three polypeptides (compare Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3 with Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 4, respectively). For use in NER studies, fractions 21-23 containing the combination of TFIIH and TFIIK (Fig. 1A, lane 2) were pooled and concentrated, and fractions 24-26, which contained TFIIH and a much smaller amount of TFIIK (Fig. 1A, lane 3), were pooled and concentrated separately. Interestingly, in Mono Q fractions 7-15, polypeptides with sizes identical to the TFB1, SSL1, p55, and p38 subunits of TFIIH were present, but no polypeptide with the size of Rad3 or Rad25 was evident in these fractions (Fig. 1A, lane 1). By immunoblotting, we established that TFB1 and SSL1 were indeed present in these fractions but that there was neither Rad3 nor Rad25 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). We refer to this TFIIH subassembly as TFIIHi. It should be emphasized that TFIIHi was not an anomaly of this particular protein preparation, as we obtained the same results in three other independent preparations (data not shown). Interestingly, TFIIK also associates with TFIIHi (Fig. 1A, lane 1), and TFIIHi-TFIIK is as active in RPB1 phosphorylation as TFIIH-TFIIK (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 6). We have previously purified Rad3 and Rad25 proteins to near homogeneity from yeast strains genetically tailored to overproduce these proteins(4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12.Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The availability of TFIIHi has made it possible to define the role of Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi in NER. Whereas the incision of DNA damaged by ultraviolet light occurred efficiently when TFIIH was combined with the remainder of the NER factors (viz. Rad1-Rad10, Rad2, Rad4-Rad23, Rad14, and RPA; Fig. 2A, lane 5), neither TFIIHi nor the mixture of Rad3 and Rad25 proteins, when combined with the same set of NER factors, was active in the NER reaction (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Likewise, Rad3 alone, Rad25 alone, the combination of Rad3-TFIIHi, or the combination of Rad25-TFIIHi, when used together with the remainder of the NER factors, also did not promote incision of the UV-damaged DNA (data not shown). Strikingly, when Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi were preincubated and then added to the NER reaction, incision of the UV-damaged DNA substrate occurred just as efficiently as when TFIIH was used (Fig. 2A, lane 9). There was a strict dependence of the incision reaction on ATP, regardless of whether TFIIH (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) or the combination of TFIIHi, Rad3, and Rad25 was used (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). We also purified the excision DNA fragments from the NER reactions and then subjected them to labeling with [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP and calf thymus terminal transferase. Excision DNA fragments were seen when the UV-damaged DNA was incubated with the combination of TFIIH and the remainder of the NER factors (Fig. 2B, lane 4), and generation of these excision DNA fragments was absolutely dependent on ATP (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). In agreement with the results obtained using the agarose gel assay (Fig. 2A), ATP-dependent dual incision of the UV-damaged DNA was observed when TFIIHi was combined with Rad3-Rad25 (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8) but not when TFIIHi or when the mixture of Rad3-Rad25 was used alone (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, our results indicate that in addition to Rad3 and Rad25, TFIIHi is absolutely required during the ATP-dependent incision phase of NER. Both Rad3 and Rad25 proteins possess a DNA helicase activity that is fueled by ATP hydrolysis(4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5.Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8951-8955Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have previously generated mutations in the highly conserved Walker type A motif required for ATP binding and hydrolysis in Rad3 and Rad25 proteins. Genetic studies on these mutations (rad3 Arg-48 and rad25 Arg-392) have indicated that the Rad3 helicase is required in NER but is dispensable for RNA polymerase II transcription(14.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas the Rad25 helicase activity is required in both NER and transcription(2.Qiu H. Park E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, in these genetic studies, it was not possible to address whether Rad3 and Rad25 helicase activities are required for the incision of damaged DNA or for a later stage of repair, such as for the postincision turnover of the NER protein complex and repair synthesis. Also, because both the Rad3 and Rad25 proteins are essential for Pol II transcription, the possibility existed that the helicase function of these proteins affects the expression of a factor indispensable for incision of UV-damaged DNA or for another phase of the repair process in vivo. The rad3 Arg-48 mutant allele exhibits negative dominance over the wild type RAD3 gene, as its overexpression renders wild type yeast cells sensitive to UV light (Fig. 3A). Since the rad3 Arg-48 mutation does not affect viability, we could purify the rad3 Arg-48 protein from a rad3Δ yeast strain(14.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein, we attached a 6-histidine tag to the amino terminus of the rad25 Arg-392-encoded protein, whose expression in yeast is driven by the PGK promoter in plasmid pR25.21. When we attempted to introduce plasmid pR25.21 into wild type Rad+ yeast cells, we failed to recover any transformant that overexpresses the rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein. However, transformants that overexpress the rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein were obtained at the expected frequency when plasmid pR25.21 was introduced into yeast cells harboring plasmid pR25.22 that overexpresses the rad25799am-encoded protein from the ADCI promoter. The rad25799am mutant protein that lacks the 45 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Rad25 protein is defective in NER (1.Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10.Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is competent in RNA polymerase II transcription(4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The failure to overexpress the 6-histidine-tagged rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein in Rad+ cells strongly suggests that the rad25 Arg-392 mutant allele also exerts negative dominance over the RAD25 gene. The rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein was purified using a five-step procedure that includes affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose. We determined whether rad3 Arg-48 and rad25 Arg-392 mutant proteins can function in the NER reaction. As shown in Fig. 3B, when Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi were mixed with the remainder of the NER factors, >85% of the supercoiled UV-damaged plasmid DNA was converted to the open circular form (lane 7). By contrast, when purified rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein was used instead of wild type Rad25, no incision of the UV-damaged DNA occurred (lane 9). Consistent with the results from the agarose gel assay, there was no excision DNA fragment formed by the rad25 Arg-392 protein as assayed by the 32P-labeling protocol (Fig. 3C, lane 4). We have also tagged the wild type Rad25 protein with the same 6-histidine sequence and overproduced the tagged protein by use of the PGK promoter. The 6-histidine-tagged Rad25 protein, unlike the 6-histidine-tagged rad25 Arg-392 mutant protein, could be overproduced in Rad+ yeast cells. The purified 6-histidine-tagged Rad25 protein has a level of activity comparable with the untagged form in the in vitro NER system (data not shown). When we substituted wild type Rad3 protein with the rad3 Arg-48 mutant protein in the incision assay, reproducibly a low level of incision activity was observed, as evidenced by the conversion of ≈3% of the supercoiled plasmid to the open circular form (Fig. 3B, lane 8). This incision activity is specific for UV damage, because the undamaged plasmid DNA was not acted on by the rad3 Arg-48 mutant protein (Fig. 3B, lane 3). However, we could not detect any excision DNA fragment using the 32P-labeling protocol (Fig. 3C, lane 3) when rad3 Arg-48 protein was used. Since the excision fragments are formed by a dual incision event (15.Huang J.S. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the failure to detect any excision DNA fragment with rad3 Arg-48 protein raises the possibility that the small amount of open circular form (Fig. 3B, lane 8) arose by the introduction of one of the two incision nicks that are normally made. TFIIH can be purified alone or as a complex with the CTD kinase TFIIK (8.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). To investigate whether TFIIK might be important for promoting damage-specific incision, we used the same molar amount of TFIIH that contains either a stoichiometric amount of TFIIK or only a trace of TFIIK (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3) in the NER reaction and assessed the incision rate afforded by the two different forms of TFIIH. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, there was no detectable difference in the rate of incision of the UV-damaged plasmid with the two different forms of TFIIH. The amount of excision products generated by the TFIIH-TFIIK complex was essentially the same as that obtained with TFIIH containing little TFIIK (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). For both RAD3 and RAD25, mutations conferring extreme UV sensitivity and a total defect in incision as well as mutations that affect only the DNA repair function or the transcription function have been identified(1.Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 3.Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 367: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10.Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1852-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While these and other observations (16.Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested a direct involvement of Rad3 and Rad25 in incision, it has remained unclear whether the other TFIIH subunits also play a direct role in this process. All the existing tfb1 and ssl1 mutants exhibit a much lower level of UV sensitivity than rad3 and rad25 mutants, and all the UV-sensitive tfb1 and ssl1 mutants also exhibit temperature-sensitive lethality(11.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar),2 indicative of a transcriptional defect. A reduction in repair synthesis is seen in nuclear extracts prepared from tfb1 and ssl1 mutants, and this could be augmented by the addition of a chromatographic fraction that contained partially purified TFIIH (11.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since the repair synthesis method does not directly measure the incision of damaged DNA but rather measures the level of DNA synthesis presumably tied to incision, it is not clear whether reduced repair synthesis in the tfb1 and ssl1 mutant extracts was due to reduced incision activity or reduced DNA synthesis activity. In addition, since the chromatographic fraction used for complementing the repair synthesis deficiency in the mutant extracts contained, besides TFIIH, other proteins(11.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is possible that the repair synthesis-stimulating activity observed was due to factors other than TFIIH present in the partially purified fraction. It is also important to consider that because nuclear extracts rather than a purified system were used(11.Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), there might conceivably be inhibitory factors present in the extracts that limit the extent of incision and repair synthesis, and stimulation of repair synthesis by an added protein fraction could be due to the removal of the inhibitory factors and may not necessarily indicate a direct involvement of the added protein fraction in incision or repair synthesis. Finally, it remains possible that the transcriptional defect caused by tfb1 and ssl1 mutations results in a lowering of the levels of protein factors involved in some stage of NER and of protein factors that function in other cellular processes. In fact, it has been reported that ssl1 mutants exhibit various ribosomal abnormalities including a reduction in polysomes and an in vitro deficiency in translation(17.Yoon H. Miller S.P. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2463-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, previous results concerning the NER deficiency in tfb1 and ssl1 mutants could reflect either a side effect engendered by the primary defect in transcription or a direct role of TFB1 and SSL1 protein in incision or repair synthesis or an indirect role of TFB1 and SSL1 in helping overcome the effect of inhibitors that might be present in the nuclear extracts used, but for reasons outlined above, they do not distinguish among these possibilities. Here, using a purified NER system, we show that the combination of Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi promotes the dual incision of UV-damaged DNA just as efficiently as does core TFIIH. Importantly, omission of any of Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi resulted in abolition of damage-specific incision, providing direct biochemical evidence that NER requires all three purified entities, probably as a reflection that TFIIH in its entirety functions in the incision of UV-damaged DNA. While our results clearly indicate a direct involvement of Rad3, Rad25, and TFIIHi in the incision reaction, it remains possible that they also function in postincision reactions such as in the turnover of the incision protein complex and in repair synthesis. Previous work has indicated a requirement of Rad25 helicase activity in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation(4.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but unexpectedly, Rad3 helicase activity is dispensable for transcription(14.Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). By contrast, here we show that both the Rad3 and Rad25 helicase activities are required in the incision phase of NER. Our results are consistent with a model in which DNA unwinding by the combined action of the Rad3 and Rad25 helicase activities creates an unwound “bubble” DNA structure appropriate for dual incision to occur. The observed specificities of the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease (18.Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and of the Rad2 endonuclease (19.Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30194-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) on model DNA substrates are congruent with nicking of the damaged DNA strand by these nucleases at the 5′- and 3′-side of the damage, respectively. Our data, however, do not exclude the possibility that Rad3 and Rad25 helicase functions are also required in postincision reactions. While stoichiometric amounts of TFIIK are essential for Pol II transcription(9.Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our results indicate that TFIIK does not affect the rate of incision of UV-damaged DNA in vitro. From results based on complementation of a rad3 mutant extract using the repair synthesis assay, it has been suggested that TFIIK is dispensable for repair synthesis(20.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether TFIIK, as a transcription factor, influences the in vivo efficiency of NER by affecting the levels of DNA repair factors."

https://openalex.org/W2018874441,"Previous observations suggested a concomitant relationship between the release of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and the activation of adenylate cyclase in the bloodstream form of the parasitic protozoan <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, adenylate cyclase activity was measured in live trypanosomes subjected to different treatments known to induce the shedding of the VSG coat, namely low pH and trypsin digestion. In both cases adenylate cyclase activation occurred in parallel with the release of the VSG. The latter was found to be mediated by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C that cleaves the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the protein (VSG lipase). Furthermore, both adenylate cyclase and VSG release were activated by the incubation of trypanosomes with specific inhibitors of protein kinase C, suggesting a repressive role for protein kinase C on both VSG lipase and adenylate cyclase activities. Significantly, in mutant trypanosomes lacking VSG lipase, adenylate cyclase was activated under conditions where VSG release did not occur. Moreover, VSG release was also found to occur in the absence of activation of the cyclase, as observed in the presence of low concentration of the thiol modifying reagent <i>p</i>-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. These observations provide the first demonstration that release of the VSG in response to cellular stress is mediated by the VSG lipase and that while both release of the VSG and activation of adenylate cyclase occur in response to the same stimuli they are not obligatorily coupled."

A variety of PLA1 activities have been identified. Membrane-bound PLA1s are present in platelets, liver, and heart(1.Inoue M. Okuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5083-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Waite M. Rao R.H. Griffin H. Franson R. Miller C. Sisson P. Frye J.

There also seem to be a number of soluble lysosomal enzymes(4.Hostetler K.Y. Gardner M.F. Giordano J.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), some of which can also catalyze transacylation reactions (5.Huterer S.J. Hostetler K.Y. Gardner M.F. Wherrett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, cytosolic PLA1 activities have been identified in heart, brain, and testis(6.Nalbone G. Hostetler K.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 104-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Pete M.J. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

This diversity of PLA1 activities strongly suggests a diversity of cellular functions. Given the ever expanding roles of phospholipid metabolites in cellular signaling(10.Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), it is likely that one role of PLA1 enzymes is to produce or remove such metabolites. phospholipase A1 phosphatidic acid PA-preferring PLA1 sn-1-alkyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid cytidine 5′-diphospho-sn-glycerol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid diacylglycerol dithiothreitol apparent Km methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate methanol 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid purification buffer phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine polyethylene glycol 3350 phosphatidylinositol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phosphatidylserine size exclusion chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dodecylpoly(ethyleneglycolether)n where the average n is 9. A detailed enzymatic examination of these enzymes would greatly assist the elucidation of their cellular roles. Unfortunately, comparison of the enzymological properties of the PLA1 enzymes has been hampered by the fact that different investigators have used fundamentally different assay systems. Some systems present the substrate as an undefined aggregate of either individual classes of phospholipid (8.Ueda H. Kobayashi T. Kishimoto M. Tsutsumi T. Watanabe S. Okuyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Ueda H. Kobayashi T. Kishimoto M. Tsutsumi T. Okuyama H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or phospholipids in combination with submicellar concentrations of detergent(7.Pete M.J. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19494-19500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Pete M.J. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In either case, the probability of artefactual results is high, due to the drastically different structures formed by single phospholipids of varying headgroup and acyl chain composition(13.Tate M.W. Eikenberry E.F. Turner D.C. Shyamsunder E. Gruner S.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interpretation of results obtained with these systems is also hindered by the inability to alter the surface concentration of phospholipid, making comparisons of accepted kinetic parameters impossible. A number of well-defined systems for the study of other lipolytic enzymes have been developed. One of the most convenient is the mixed micelle system, in which the phospholipid is presented as a low percentage component in detergent micelles(14.Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This system has clear advantages over those mentioned above: (a) micelle structure is primarily determined by the detergent, reducing the variability of surface architecture between different lipids, (b) the surface concentration of substrate can be varied, allowing the determination of Michaelis-Menten parameters, and (c) other lipids can be added to the system in a controlled fashion, aiding in the determination of cofactor requirements. We recently used a Triton X-100 mixed micelle system to study a cytosolic PLA1 (PA-PLA1) that displayed interesting enzymatic properties. First, it preferentially hydrolyzed phosphatidic acid (PA) by 4-fold over phosphatidylinositol (PI), 5-fold over phosphatidylserine (PS), 7.5-fold over phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 10-fold over phosphatidylcholine (PC). Second, it hydrolyzed diunsaturated molecular species of PA, such as diarachidonoyl (478 nmol/min/mg) or dioleoyl PA (208 nmol/min/mg) in preference to molecular species with an sn-1 saturated fatty acyl chain, such as sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl (80 nmol/min/mg) or sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl PA (42 nmol/min/mg). Third, it appeared to be cooperatively activated by PA, as each PA substrate displayed sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 3(9.Higgs H.N. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fourth, the tissue distribution of PA-PLA1 activity was limited. High levels were present in bovine testis and brain, and the specific activity of the enzyme was 10-fold higher in mature testis than in immature testis. However, PA-PLA1 was undetectable in liver, spleen, heart, or blood. Though the enzyme's biological role has yet to be determined, this distribution of enzyme activity suggests that PA-PLA1 may be involved in cell signaling. In the current study, we purified the enzyme to the point where a single major band could be seen by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and then addressed the following questions. By what mechanism does PA activate PA-PLA1, and how does this activation affect the enzyme's preference for PA over other lipids? What is the structural basis for the enzyme's preference for diunsaturated PAs? Does PA-PLA1 behave similarly to a recently purified brain PLA1(7.Pete M.J. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19494-19500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Pete M.J. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) if assayed under the conditions used for this enzyme, and do results in this assay system agree with those obtained in the Triton micelle system? The results of these studies are described below. Mature bovine testes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. All nonradiolabeled lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama) except for methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), which was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq), sn-1,2-[1-14C]dioleoyl-PC, sn-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl PE, and sn-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonsyl PC were from DuPont NEN. sn-1,2-Dioleoyl-3-phosphatidyl[3-14C]serine and sn-1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidyl[2-14C]ethanolamine were from Amersham Corp. [14C]-MAFP was a generous gift from Dr. Zheng Huang of Merck Frosst, Canada. All chromatographic resins, columns, and pumps for protein purification were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All organic solvents were from J. T. Baker and were reagent grade or better. Reagents for the bicinchoninic acid protein assay were from Pierce. Silica 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from E. M. Merck, and C18 reversed phase plates were from Whatman. Dodecylpoly(ethyleneglycolether)n (Thesit), Triton X-100, and Triton X-114 were from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were from Sigma except where indicated. All purification steps were performed at 4°C. Except where specifically noted, buffers used for purification (PB) contained 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml antipain. This purification procedure was conducted on two separate occasions with similar results. Testes were decapsulated, cut into 3-4-cm cubes, and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of removal from bulls. The frozen tissue was kept at −70°C until extraction and then placed in a blender along with 3 ml/g extraction buffer (PB + 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 6.25 μg/ml leupeptin, 6.25 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)). It is important to note that DTT was not added until after the blending step. The mixture was blended until no tissue chunks remained (5 × 1-min bursts) and then 1-liter aliquots were homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer for 15 s × 3. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. After being filtered through cheesecloth, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Then 233 mg/ml ammonium sulfate was added with vigorous stirring, and the solution was mixed for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in PB + 5 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF was added from a 200 mM stock in isopropyl alcohol. The volume of resuspension buffer was 5-fold less than that of the originally precipitated sample. After the pellet was fully resuspended, DTT was added to 1 mM from a 1 M stock. To the resuspended pellet, 125 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) was added with vigorous stirring, and the solution was mixed for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The same resuspension procedure as for the ammonium sulfate precipitate was followed except that the volume of the resuspension buffer was equal to that of the precipitated sample. The resuspended precipitate from the PEG step (600 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of PB + 6 M urea, 40 mM KCl, 4 mM Thesit, and 1 mM DTT. The resulting solution was immediately loaded onto a XK50 column packed with 400 ml of SP-Sepharose Fast Flow and pre-equilibrated with PB + 3 M urea, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM Thesit, and 1 mM DTT. The column was then washed with 1 volume of equilibration buffer followed by 2 volumes of PB + 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM Thesit, and 1 mM DTT. The activity was eluted with PB + 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM Thesit, and 1 mM DTT. The column flow rate was kept constant at 10 ml/min using a P-1 pump, and fractions were collected manually by following the A280 of the eluate. The active pool (300 ml) was supplemented with 1 mM PMSF from a 200 mM stock in isopropyl alcohol and then concentrated using an Amicon RC800 fitted with a low protein binding 300,000 NMWL membrane (Millipore Corp.) until the volume of the concentrated pool was 45 ml. The KCl concentration in the concentrated SP pool was raised to 200 mM by the addition of a 2.5 M KCl stock. The pool was then loaded onto a Mono Q 10/10 column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Pharmacia) and pre-equilibrated in PB + 200 mM KCl, 0.2 mM Thesit, 1 mM DTT. The column was washed with 20 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 20 ml of the same buffer containing 235 mM KCl. The enzyme was eluted with an 80-ml gradient from 235 to 300 mM KCl, followed by a 20-ml gradient to 400 mM KCl and a 30-ml wash with 1 M KCl. The flow rate was 2 ml/min, and 1-min fractions were collected. The active pool (26 ml) was supplemented with 1 mM PMSF from a 200 mM stock in isopropyl alcohol and then concentrated to 4 ml using an Amicon model 52 fitted with a low protein binding 100,000 NMWL membrane (Millipore). The sample was further concentrated to approximately 1 ml in two Centricon 100 concentrators (Amicon). The concentrated Mono Q pool was loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/60 column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus and equilibrated with PB + 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM Thesit, and 1 mM DTT, but with no benzamidine, leupeptin, or antipain. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and 2-min fractions were collected. The concentration of NaCl in the Superdex 200 pool was adjusted to 1.4 M from a 5 M stock. This solution was loaded onto a phenyl-Superose 5/5 column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus and equilibrated with PB + 1.4 M NaCl and 1 mM DTT. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, then PA-PLA1 was eluted by reducing the NaCl concentration to 0.9 M. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and 1-min fractions were collected. The pool from phenyl-Superose chromatography was adjusted to 300 mM NaCl by diluting with PB. This solution was loaded onto 0.5 ml of phenyl-CL-4B packed into a Pierce Econocolumn and equilibrated with PB + 300 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer, and then PA-PLA1 activity was eluted with 2 ml of PB. The column was run under gravity flow. [32P]PA was synthesized as described (9.Higgs H.N. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that an extra purification step was added after the Bond-Elut PRS column (Varian). The anhydrous eluate from this column was resuspended in 250 μl of 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH and spotted onto a C18 reversed phase TLC plate (Whatman). This plate was developed in 98:2 MeOH, 4 M ammonium formate for 30 min. The PA band was visualized by autoradiography and scraped. PA was eluted from the resin by 2 extractions with 6 ml of 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH. The solvent was evaporated, and the PA was resuspended in 2 ml of 9:1 dichloroethane:isopropyl alcohol. This extra purification reduced background lyso-PA in the assay from 1 to 0.05% of the total PA counts. During enzyme purification, enzyme activity was monitored by the following assay. 32P-labeled dioleoyl PA was evaporated under argon and resuspended in 80 mM Triton X-100 (critical micelle concentration = 0.3 mM) in H2O. This solution was added to buffer, and assays were started by the addition of enzyme. Final assay conditions, in a total volume of 100 μl, were 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 8 mM Triton X-100 with 0.5 mol % [32P]PA. Assays were conducted at 25°C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of carrier (1.25 mg/ml of sn-1-18:1-lyso-PA, egg PA and egg PC in 1:1 CHCl3:ethyl acetate) followed by 900 μl of 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH + 1% trifluoroacetic acid. After thorough mixing, two phases were formed by the addition of 650 μl of 9:1 H2O:MeOH. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged briefly, and the upper phase was removed by suction. The lower phase was evaporated under vacuum and resuspended in 50 μl of 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH. From this mixture, 25 μl were spotted onto a C18 reversed phase TLC plate, which was developed in 98:2 MeOH, 4 M ammonium formate for 15 min. Radioactive product lyso-PA bands, which co-migrated with authentic standards, were visualized by autoradiography, scraped, and quantitated by scintillation counting in Ecolume (ICN). Characterization of the enzyme, purified through the Superdex 200 step, was carried out under different assay conditions. The final buffer concentrations in the 100-μl assay were 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 16 mM total micellar lipid, with the bulk detergent being a 1:1 molar mix of Triton X-100 to Triton X-114. Assays included 0.25 mol % of [32P]PA, with the rest of the substrate PA being nonradiolabeled. All subsequent steps in the assay were the same as those outlined above. When PLA activity toward other phospholipid classes was assayed, conditions were the same as those described above. Lyso-PS, lyso-PI, and lyso-PE generation by the enzyme were measured by the same reversed phase TLC technique as described for PA. PC breakdown was measured by the release of 14C-oleic acid, which was separated from PC and lyso-PC by TLC on Silica 60 plates developed in 6:8:2:2 CHCl3:acetone:acetic acid:water. Under all conditions used, assays were linear for time and protein concentration. All assays were carried out in borosilicate glass tubes siliconized with dichlorodimethylsilane. For each lipid class tested, the fraction of lyso-lipid in the upper phase during extraction was measured and was factored into calculations. Calculation of kinetic parameters was carried out following previously established methods for micellar systems(14.Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The program, GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd., London), was used for making graphs of kinetic data. An aliquot of 14C-MAFP was evaporated from its methylethyl ketone stock solution under argon and resuspended in 500 μM Triton X-100 in water to a concentration of 40 μM MAFP. DTT was removed from the enzyme source by loading 10 μg of Superdex 200 pool onto a 0.25-ml column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, and 1 mM EGTA. The column was washed with 2 ml of equilibration buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with 4 × 250 μl of 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM EGTA. The majority of the enzyme was in the second fraction. The inhibition reaction was started by the addition of the MAFP/Triton X-100 mix at a 1:10 dilution to the enzyme. Aliquots were removed at various times and diluted 1:20 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM DTT. The diluted samples were used to start enzyme assays. Separate aliquots were diluted 1:1 with 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 mM DTT, immediately boiled, and then loaded onto a 2.7-14% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. After completion of electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in Enhance (Amersham Corp.) for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film (Amersham) for 1 month. Bands were detected after development of the film. The solvent from CHCl3 stocks of defined molecular species of PC (100 mg) was evaporated under argon. The PC was resuspended in 2 ml of diethyl ether, and 100 units of Streptomyces species phospholipase D was added in 1 ml of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, and 50 mM CaCl2. After 2 h at 25°C with vigorous stirring, the ether phase was evaporated under argon. To the remaining solution, 1 ml of 500 mM sodium-EDTA, pH 7.2, 2 ml CHCl3, and 4 ml MeOH were added so that a single phase was obtained. An additional 2 ml of CHCl3 were added along with 2 ml of water, and the mixture was vortexed and briefly centrifuged. After removal of the upper phase, the lower phase was washed once with 9:1 water:MeOH, and the upper phase was discarded. The lower phase was evaporated under argon, the residue was resuspended in 1 ml CHCl3, and 4 ml of acetone were added to precipitate the PA. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet, containing PA uncontaminated by PC or DAG, was resuspended in 2 ml of CHCl3. Solvent was evaporated from 50 mg of PC, which was then resuspended in 4 ml of diethyl ether. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 units of Streptomyces species phospholipase D in 2 ml of 3.3 ML-serine, 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, and 100 mM CaCl2. After 2 h at 25°C, the diethyl ether was evaporated, and the lipids were extracted by the method of Folch(15.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, as the aqueous phase. The lower phase was evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was resuspended in 2 ml of 98:2 CHCl3:MeOH with 0.1 M HCl. PS was separated from PA and PC on a 1-ml BondElut PRS column (Varian) equilibrated in the same solvent. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 14 ml of solvent followed by 8 ml of 90:10. PS was eluted with 24 ml of 50:50. No trace of PA or PC was observable when 100 μg of PS was run on TLC in 6:8:2:2:1 acetone:CHCl3:MeOH:acetic acid:water and stained with iodine. The solvent from a CHCl3 stock solution of PC (1.4 μmol) was evaporated under argon. The PC was resuspended in 1 ml of diethyl ether, and 1.5 units of Bacillus cereus phospholipase C was added in 250 μl of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, and 10 mM CaCl2. After vigorous stirring for 1 h at 25°C, the ether phase was evaporated under argon, 600 μl MeOH and 250 μl CHCl3 were added, and the mixture was vortexed until a single phase appeared. Then 250 μl of CHCl3 and 250 μl of water were added and, after vortexing and a brief centrifugation, the upper phase was removed. The lower phase was washed 1 time with 1 ml of 9:1 water:MeOH, and the upper phase was discarded. The lower phase was evaporated under argon, and the DAG was resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3. This procedure regularly gave quantitative yields of DAG, as judged by TLC in 60:50:5:2 hexane:diethyl ether:MeOH:acetic acid. First, PA was converted to cytidine 5′-diphospho-sn-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) chemically, and then CDP-DAG was converted to PI. PA conversion to CDP-DAG was accomplished by the method of Carman and Fischl(16.Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. J. Food Biochem. 1980; 4: 53-59Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μM of PA (protonated) were reacted with 30 μM of cytidine 5′-monophospho-morpholidate in 10 ml of pyridine containing 80 μM dimethylaminopyridine for 16 h with stirring at 25°C. The pyridine was removed under vacuum, and the residue was resuspended in 2 ml of 50:30:7 CHCl3:pyridine:acetic acid. This mixture was loaded onto a 2-ml silica column equilibrated in the same solvent. The mixture was washed with 10 ml of the same solvent, followed by 10 ml of 9:1 CHCl3:MeOH, and CDP-DAG was eluted with 8 ml of 50:28:4:8 CHCl3:MeOH:acetic acid:water. For conversion of the CDP-DAG to PI, the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. The CDP-DAG was then resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mM Triton X-100, and 50 mM myo-inositol. When the CDP-DAG was fully resuspended, MgCl2 was added to 16 mM, and solubilized yeast membranes were added to 0.3 mg protein/ml. The yeast membranes were a kind gift of G. M. Carman, supplied as a 3 mg/ml protein stock in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol (w/v), and 16 mM Triton X-100. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 16 h with agitation. Lipids were extracted by the method of Folch(15.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the solvent from the lower phase was evaporated under nitrogen. The residue was resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3 and passed over a BakerBond PRS column equilibrated in the same solvent. After washing with 4 ml of CHCl3, followed by 8 ml 9:1 CHCl3:MeOH, PI was eluted with 8 ml of 75:25:3 CHCl3:MeOH:water. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the pure PI was resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3. Purity was judged by TLC in 6:8:2:2:1 CHCl3:acetone:MeOH:acetic acid:water. When 32P-labeled dioleoyl PI was synthesized, its radiochemical purity was >96%. Phosphatidylmethanol was synthesized by the method of Jain and Gelb(17.Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μM of PA (protonated) were methylated(9.Higgs H.N. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and dimethyl-PA was purified by passing the mixture (in CHCl3) over a 1-ml bed of silica. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was resuspended in 1 ml of acetone containing 7 mg of LiBr. This mixture was left at 25°C for 16 h with stirring. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. PM was purified by passing the residue, resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3, over a 1-ml BakerBond PRS column equilibrated in the same solvent, washing with 6 ml of CHCl3, and eluting with 6 ml of 9:1 CHCl3:MeOH. Purity was assessed by TLC in 6:8:2:2:1 CHCl3:acetone:MeOH:acetic acid:water. When 32P-labeled PM was synthesized, its radiochemical purity was >98%. On the basis of the method of Bordier(18.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PA-PLA1 (6 ng) was added to an iced mixture of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EGTA containing micelles of Triton X-114 with 0.5 mol % dioleoyl PA and 0-15 mol % sn-1-alkyl-2-acyl PA. The total concentration of micellar lipid in the assay was 16 mM (critical micelle concentration of Triton X-114 = 0.3 mM). The solution was immediately transferred to a water bath at 25°C, incubated for 5 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g and 25°C. The supernatant (80 μl) was transferred to another tube, and the pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EGTA. Both supernatant and pellet were assayed for PA-PLA1 activity as described above, in micelles containing 0.5 mol %32P-labeled dioleoyl PA and 10 mol % sn-1-alkyl-2-oleoyl PA. The efficiency of the Triton X-114 phase partitioning was determined by measuring the amount of Triton (18.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 32P-labeled dioleoyl PA remaining in the upper phase after centrifugation. Both values were similar for all conditions tested and never exceeded 4% of the total lipid. Assays were carried out as described in (7.Pete M.J. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, the solvent was evaporated from 14C-labeled sn-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl species of PE or PC (0.5 nmol/assay), and the residue was brought up in 5 μl/assay of either 5 mM or 6.5 mM CHAPS, depending on the individual assay. Assays were started by the addition of 5 μl of this mixture to enzyme/buffer preincubated at 37°C. Final buffer concentrations were: 50 mM or 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 or 9.0, 70% glycerol, 3 or 5 mM MgCl2, 250 or 325 μM CHAPS, and 1 mM EDTA. Assays were terminated after 8 min with 0.5 ml of 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH, followed by 0.15 ml of water. Lysophospholipid and phospholipid standards (5 μg each) were added, the phases were allowed to separate, the lower phase was removed, and the solvent evaporated under vacuum. The residue was redissolved in 50 μl of 75:25:2 CHCl3:MeOH:H2O and spotted on a silica"

Recent studies suggest that granzyme B may exert its effect by cleaving and activating CPP32, a member of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases. We have examined the processing and activation of CMH-1, a close homologue of CPP32, by granzyme B in vitro. We have found that granzyme B specifically cleaves CMH-1 at Asp198-Ser199 between the p20 and p12 and activates the cysteine protease. Cleavage between p20 and the prosequence of CMH-1 at Asp23-Ala24 is autocatalytic and is not required for CMH-1 activity in vitro.

Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells. Birkhaeuser Boston, Cambridge, MA1993Google Scholar)). CTLs destroy target cells in part by secreting perforin along with a family of serine proteases, the granzymes, into the intercellular space between the effector and target cell. Perforin, a pore-forming protein, facilitates the entry of the granzymes into target cells where they trigger apoptosis by an unknown mechanism(2.Berk G. Cell. 1995; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). One of the granzymes, granzyme B, is a serine protease with a substrate specificity for aspartate at P1 and is essential for the rapid induction of DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in target cells(3.Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar).Recently, Darmon et al.(4.Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) reported that granzyme B can cleave and activate CPP32, a member of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases that also has a substrate specificity for Asp-X. CPP32 has been isolated based on its ability to cleave poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)(5.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar), a DNA repair enzyme that is rapidly proteolyzed in apoptotic cells(6.Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). It has become more apparent that the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis (see (7.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) for review). Genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the ced-3 gene is indispensable for cell death during development(8.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of ICE-like proteases can prevent mammalian cell death induced by a variety of factors(5.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Furthermore, thymocytes derived from ICE-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced cell death, suggesting a physiological role for ICE in Fas-mediated apoptosis(11.Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Thus the regulation of these proteases may be critical in executing apoptotic cell death.Each of the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases is synthesized as an inactive precursor polypeptide requiring proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues to produce two subunits of approximately 20 kDa (p20) and 10 kDa (p10), which together form the active protease (see (12.Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)). The precursor proteins contain N-terminal prosequences of various lengths followed by the p20 and p10 subunits. In some members of the protease family, such as ICE, a short linker sequence exists between the p20 and p10 subunits. Processing and activation of these proteases in vivo remain unclear. Some precursors seem to undergo autocatalytic cleavage; others may require distinct aspartate-specific proteases for activation. Therefore, identification of CPP32 as a substrate for granzyme B suggests CTL-mediated cell death may be initiated by a protease cascade involving the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases.Recently, a new member of the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases, CMH-1 (also named MCH-3 and ICE-LAP3), has been identified(13.Lippke J.A.

It has the highest homology to CPP32 and is able to cleave PARP and induce apoptosis in COS cells. In this paper, we examined the processing and activation of CMH-1 by granzyme B in vitro. We report that granzyme B cleaves CMH-1 specifically between p20 and p12 and activates the CMH-1 protease. The removal of the prosequence is an autocatalytic event and is not required for CMH-1 activity in vitro. The cleavage and activation of CMH-1 by granzyme B in vitro suggests that, in addition to CPP32, CMH-1 may also play a role in CTL-mediated cell killing.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Active Murine Granzyme B in COS CellscDNA encoding the murine granzyme B lacking the activation dipeptide was described previously(16.Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was used to add a (His)6 tag to the C terminus. For COS cell expression, amplified cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDLSRα(17.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS cell transfections were performed as described(18.Gu Y. Wu J. Faucheu C. Lalanne J.-L. Diu A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For purification of granzyme B, five 15-cm dishes (3.6 × 106 cells/dish) of COS cells were transfected and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 390 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (8.5 mg of protein) was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column, washed with lysis buffer containing 400 mM NaCl, and then eluted with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 and 700 mM NaCl. Eluted fractions were pooled and incubated with a small amount of nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. After washing the beads with lysis buffer containing 600 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 ml of 200 mM imidazole in the same buffer. SDS-PAGE and silver staining indicated that the eluate contained two major polypeptides of 31 and 34 kDa at approximately 1-2 μg/ml. Using the standard granzyme B substrate Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-thiobenzyl (where Boc is t-butyloxycarbonyl) ester, we determined the activity of the preparation to be 100 units/ml, where 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of substrate/min(19.Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelicj C.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 394-404Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), giving rise to an estimated specific activity of 50,000-100,000 units/mg. Unless otherwise noted, this preparation was used as the purified granzyme B for all experiments described in this report.Expression and Purification of Recombinant (His)6-tagged CMH-1 and CPP32 Proteins in Escherichia colicDNA encoding the full-length CMH-1 was described previously(13.Lippke J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1825-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding mutant CMH-1 proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (20.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids for N-terminally (His)6-tagged wild type or mutant CMH-1 were constructed by introducing XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of CMH-1 cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′CGGCTGCAGCTCGAGGCAGATGATCAGGGCTGTATTGAG and 5′ GGGCTCGAGCTATTGACTGAAGTAGAGTTC and then ligating the resulting XhoI fragments into a XhoI-cut E. coli expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). The resulting plasmids direct the synthesis of polypeptides of 325 amino acids consisting of a 23-residue peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLE, where LVPRGS represents a thrombin cleavage site) fused in frame to the N terminus of CMH-1 at Ala2, as confirmed by DNA sequencing and by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed proteins. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying a particular expression plasmid was induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30°C, harvested, and lysed in a Microfluidizor (Microfluidic, Watertown, MA) in Buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (S100) was loaded onto a nickel-agarose column. After washing with Buffer A containing 25 mM imidazole, CMH-1 protein was eluted with 50-100 mM imidazole in Buffer A. The eluate was desalted and applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose column in 20 mM Tris-HCl (8.0), washed with the same buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, and eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. N-terminally (His)6-tagged full-length CPP32 active site cysteine mutant (C163S) protein was expressed and purified similarly, except that the nickel-agarose chromatography was run at pH 8.0 and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography at pH 8.4.Cleavage of CPP32 and CMH-1 by Granzyme B in Vitro35S-Labeled CPP32 and CMH-1 were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.). Labeled proteins were incubated for 30-60 min at 37°C either with crude lysates of granzyme B-expressing COS cells or with purified granzyme B in a total volume of 30 μl in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 60 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM EDTA. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For cleavage of purified CPP32 or CMH-1 by granzyme B, purified (His)6-CMH-1 or (His)6-CPP32 proteins were used in place of the in vitro translated proteins. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.Other MethodsCleavage of 35S-labeled PARP by CMH-1 in vitro was carried out as described(13.Lippke J.A. Gu Y. Sarnecki C.

Expression plasmids were confirmed by sequencing the entire coding sequence using the ABI 373A DNA sequencer, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using the ABI 477A protein sequencer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCMH-1 Is Cleaved More Efficiently than CPP32 by Granzyme BTo determine if CMH-1 can be cleaved by granzyme B, we incubated CMH-1 produced by in vitro translation with a crude lysate prepared from COS cells expressing the active form of murine granzyme B from an expression vector. We found that CMH-1 is cleaved from a 35-kDa polypeptide into two peptides of 23 and 12 kDa upon incubation with lysates prepared from transfected cells. Incubation of CMH-1 with lysates from mock transfected cells resulted in no cleavage of the 35-kDa peptide (Fig. 1A). This cleavage was not affected by the presence of tetrapeptide aldehydes Ac-DEVD-CHO or Ac-YVAD-CHO (data not shown), potent inhibitors of CPP32, CMH-1, and ICE(5.Nicholson D.W. Ali A.

Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar), indicating that the cleavage of CMH-1 was not mediated by an ICE- or CPP32-like protease(s) and that granzyme B is not sensitive to these two inhibitors.To compare the ability of granzyme B to cleave CPP32, we incubated CPP32 produced by in vitro translation with the COS cell lysates and found that the 33-kDa CPP32 was cleaved into 21- and 12-kDa peptides, as observed by Darmon et al.(4.Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that CMH-1 appeared to be cleaved more efficiently than CPP32 by granzyme B (Fig. 1A). To confirm this result, we purified granzyme B from granzyme B-expressing COS cells and then incubated equal amounts (2 μg) of purified (His)6-tagged CPP32-C163S or CMH-1-C186S proteins (see below and “Materials and Methods”) with various amounts of the purified enzyme. We found that CPP32 cleavage required a 25-50-fold higher concentration of granzyme B than CMH-1 cleavage (Fig. 1B). Therefore, under our experimental conditions, CMH-1 is a superior substrate for granzyme B than CPP32.Cleavage of CMH-1 by Granzyme B Leads to Activation of the Cysteine ProteaseIn order to determine if the cleavage of CMH-1 by granzyme B would lead to its activation, we expressed an N-terminally (His)6-tagged full-length CMH-1 in E. coli and purified the protein by nickel-affinity chromatography followed by DEAE anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). The purified CMH-1 protein contained approximately equal amounts of two major polypeptides of 37 kDa (p37) and 32 kDa (p32). N-terminal amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting with anti-(His)6 antibody (Dianova) indicated that p37 contains the (His)6 tag fused to CMH-1 at position Ala2 as expected for the full-length protein while p32 starts at Ala24, which is preceded by an aspartate (Asp23). The relative amount of p32 tends to increase during purification and storage, suggesting that p32 is derived from p37 by autocleavage at Asp23. A small amount of 20- and 12-kDa peptides was also visible. This is probably due to an autocatalytic cleavage of p32 between p20 and p12 (see below) although it is clearly a slow and inefficient process. Rechromatography of the DEAE fraction on the nickel-agarose column resulted in a co-purification of p32 and p37, indicating that p32 is associated with p37 and that the CMH-1 precursor protein exists as dimers or higher order oligomers (Fig. 2)(18.Gu Y.

To determine if cleavage of CMH-1 by granzyme B would lead to its activation, CMH-1 was treated with purified granzyme B (Fig. 3B) and then incubated with the PARP substrate. We found that PARP cleavage was readily detected at nanomolar CMH-1 concentrations and was inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 3C). Since granzyme B itself had no detectable activity against PARP (Fig. 3C), these results indicate that cleavage of CMH-1 by granzyme B leads to the activation of the CMH-1 protease.Figure 3:Processing and activation of CMH-1 by granzyme B.

Incubation of CMH-1 with granzyme B resulted in the disappearance of the p37 and p32 peptides with the concomitant appearance of three peptides of approximately 20 (p20), 12 (p12), and 5 kDa (p5) (Fig. 3, B and D; see also Figure 4:, Figure 5:). N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that p20 has the same N terminus as p32 (Ala24) while the p12 starts at Ser199, which is also preceded by an aspartate residue (Asp198). These results indicate that CMH-1 is cleaved at both Asp23-Ala24 and Asp198-Ser199. We propose that the p20 and p12 polypeptides represent the two subunits of the mature protease and that the p5 peptide represents the (His)6-tagged CMH-1 prosequence ending at Asp23.Figure 4:Cleavage of C186S CMH-1 protein by granzyme B.

In the presence of the inhibitor, the 5-kDa peptide no longer appeared (Fig. 3B and 4). Instead, a peptide of 25 kDa (p25) became visible and accumulated over time (Fig. 3, B and D). Immunoblotting indicated that this peptide contained the (His)6 tag (Fig. 3B) suggesting that it is the unprocessed p5-p20 peptide (Fig. 3A). When we examined the cleavage products at various time points following granzyme B addition, we found that in the absence of the inhibitor, p25 initially appeared and then disappeared (Fig. 3D). The simplest interpretation of these results is that granzyme B cleaves the full-length CMH-1 p37 (and p32) between Asp198 and Ser199 to form p25 and p12 (p20 and p12), which leads to an increased autocleavage at Asp23-Ala24 of p25 to form p20 and p5.To further confirm that cleavage between p20 and p5 is mediated solely by autocatalytic activity of CMH-1, we expressed a mutant CMH-1 in which the putative active site cysteine in the conserved QACRG motif was changed to serine (C186S) and examined its cleavage by granzyme B (Fig. 4). First, we found that the purified C186S CMH-1 protein contained a single major polypeptide of 37 kDa, consistent with p32 in the wild type CMH-1 preparation being an autocatalytic product. Upon incubation of C186S CMH-1 with purified granzyme B, the 37-kDa peptide was cleaved into p25 and p12 with little p20 and p5. These results establish that p20 and p5 are derived from p25 and that this cleavage is mediated solely by autocatalysis. A small amount of an approximately 31-kDa peptide was also present in the C186S CMH-1 preparation and was apparently cleaved into a 19-kDa peptide upon incubation with granzyme B. The nature of this peptide was not further examined.CMH-1 Activation Only Requires Cleavage between p20 and p12To establish the proteolytic maturation sites in CMH-1 and more importantly to investigate the role of CMH-1 processing in its activation, we prepared mutant CMH-1 proteins with either Asp23 or Asp198 mutated to glutamate (D23E or D198E). Purified D198E protein contained two polypeptides (p37 and p32) similar to the wild type CMH-1 preparation, although there appeared to be slightly more p37 than p32 in the mutant protein. Incubation of D198E CMH-1 with granzyme B did not affect the mobility of the polypeptides indicating that Asp198 is the only site in CMH-1 that is recognized by granzyme B (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, granzyme B-treated D198E protein at nanomolar concentrations did not show any detectable PARP cleavage activity (Fig. 5B), indicating that the proteolytic processing between p20 and p12 at position Asp198 is essential for PARP cleavage activity of CMH-1.In contrast, purified D23E protein contained mainly the 37-kDa peptide with a small amount of p25 and p12, consistent with the notion that the p32 in the wild type CMH-1 preparation is derived from p37 by autocleavage at Asp23. As expected, incubation of D23E CMH-1 with granzyme B resulted in the cleavage of p37 into p25 and p12 (Fig. 5A). A small amount of p20 also appeared after incubation whether granzyme B was present or not, and its appearance was blocked by Ac-DEVD-CHO, indicating that it is a product of an autocatalytic event. This may be due to the presence of an alternative processing site near Asp23, or the autocatalytic activity of CMH-1 may be capable of cleaving Glu23 at the P1 position albeit with lower efficiency.Finally, we investigated if cleavage at Asp23 is required for CMH-1 activity. Purified wild type or D23E CMH-1 proteins were treated with granzyme B and then incubated with PARP produced by in vitro translation. As shown in Fig. 5B, at equal concentrations both the wild type and D23E CMH-1 cleaved PARP to a similar extent. In addition, an untreated D23E preparation (Fig. 5A, lane 2) showed some activity against PARP while the untreated wild type CMH-1 did not. This was consistent with the presence of a small amount of p25 and p12 in the D23E but not in the wild type CMH-1 preparation. Furthermore, unincubated D23E CMH-1 containing p25 but little p20 cleaved PARP in a similar manner as the preincubated sample, which contained p25 and p20, suggesting that p25/p12 is as active as the fully processed p20/p12 protease (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5A). These results indicate that activation of CMH-1 requires cleavage between p20 and p12 at position Asp198, whereas the cleavage between p20 and p5 is not required.CMH-1 was recently identified based on its sequence homology to the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases(13.Lippke J.A.

It has been shown that CMH-1 is processed during Fas- and tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis (15.Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of CMH-1 remains unclear, its ability to cleave PARP and induce apoptosis suggests that it may play a role in cell death. In this report, we demonstrate that CMH-1 can be cleaved and activated by granzyme B in vitro, suggesting that CMH-1, a protease localized in the cytoplasm(15.Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), may be involved in a protease cascade that mediates CTL-induced cell killing in vivo. Our findings that CMH-1 is cleaved 25-50 times more efficiently than CPP32 by granzyme B implies that CMH-1 may be a primary target for granzyme B. Furthermore, the close homology between CMH-1 and CPP32 suggests that the mechanism of granzyme B-mediated CMH-1 activation may be applicable to CPP32. Our finding that the removal of the prosequence is not required for CMH-1 activation in vitro points to the possibility that the prosequence may be involved in other aspects of CMH-1 regulation in vivo.

Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells. Birkhaeuser Boston, Cambridge, MA1993Google Scholar)). CTLs destroy target cells in part by secreting perforin along with a family of serine proteases, the granzymes, into the intercellular space between the effector and target cell. Perforin, a pore-forming protein, facilitates the entry of the granzymes into target cells where they trigger apoptosis by an unknown mechanism(2.Berk G. Cell. 1995; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). One of the granzymes, granzyme B, is a serine protease with a substrate specificity for aspartate at P1 and is essential for the rapid induction of DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in target cells(3.Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar).Recently, Darmon et al.(4.Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) reported that granzyme B can cleave and activate CPP32, a member of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases that also has a substrate specificity for Asp-X. CPP32 has been isolated based on its ability to cleave poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)(5.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). It has become more apparent that the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis (see (7.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) for review). Genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the ced-3 gene is indispensable for cell death during development(8.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of ICE-like proteases can prevent mammalian cell death induced by a variety of factors(5.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Furthermore, thymocytes derived from ICE-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced cell death, suggesting a physiological role for ICE in Fas-mediated apoptosis(11.Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Thus the regulation of these proteases may be critical in executing apoptotic cell death.Each of the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases is synthesized as an inactive precursor polypeptide requiring proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues to produce two subunits of approximately 20 kDa (p20) and 10 kDa (p10), which together form the active protease (see (12.Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)). The precursor proteins contain N-terminal prosequences of various lengths followed by the p20 and p10 subunits. In some members of the protease family, such as ICE, a short linker sequence exists between the p20 and p10 subunits. Processing and activation of these proteases in vivo remain unclear. Some precursors seem to undergo autocatalytic cleavage; others may require distinct aspartate-specific proteases for activation. Therefore, identification of CPP32 as a substrate for granzyme B suggests CTL-mediated cell death may be initiated by a protease cascade involving the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases.Recently, a new member of the ICE/Ced-3 family of proteases, CMH-1 (also named MCH-3 and ICE-LAP3), has been identified(13.Lippke J.A.

It has the highest homology to CPP32 and is able to cleave PARP and induce apoptosis in COS cells. In this paper, we examined the processing and activation of CMH-1 by granzyme B in vitro. We report that granzyme B cleaves CMH-1 specifically between p20 and p12 and activates the CMH-1 protease. The removal of the prosequence is an autocatalytic event and is not required for CMH-1 activity in vitro. The cleavage and activation of CMH-1 by granzyme B in vitro suggests that, in addition to CPP32, CMH-1 may also play a role in CTL-mediated cell killing."

Following the addition of a core N-linked carbohydrate in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins move to the Golgi complex where the elongation of O-linked sugar chains and processing of complex N-linked oligosaccharide structures take place. In order to better define how such post-translational modifications occur, we have been studying a yeast gene family in which at least one member, KRE2/MNT1, is involved in protein glycosylation. The family currently contains five other members: YUR1, KTR1, KTR2, KTR3 and KTR4 (Mallet, L., Bussereau, F., and Jacquet, M.(1994) Yeast 10, 819-831). All encode putative type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic N terminus, a membrane-spanning region, and a highly conserved catalytic lumenal domain.Kre2p/Mnt1p is a α1,2-mannosyltransferase involved in O- and N-linked glycosylation (Häusler, A., Ballou, L., Ballou, C. E., and Robbins, P. W.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 6846-6850); however, the role of the other proteins has not yet been established. We have carried out a functional analysis of Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p. By in vitro assays, Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p have been shown to be mannosyltransferases but, in vivo, do not appear to be involved in O-glycosylation. Examination of the electrophoretic mobility of the N-linked modified protein invertase in null mutant strains indicates that Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p are involved in N-linked glycosylation, possibly as redundant enzymes. As found with Kre2p (Hill, K., Boone, C., Goebl, M., Puccia, R., Sdicu, A.-M., and Bussey, H.(1992) Genetics 130, 273-283), Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p also seem to be implicated in the glycosylation of cell wall mannoproteins, since yeast cells containing different gene disruptions become K1 killer toxin-resistant.

The covalent addition of glycans to secretory and membrane proteins constitutes one of the major post-translational modifications known to occur in eukaryotes. The biosynthetic pathway leading to N-glycosylation has been studied in considerable detail and involves the ordered assembly of a core oligosaccharide on the lipid carrier dolichol phosphate, which is embedded in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)CTABcetyltrimethyl ammonium bromideDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleAbantibodyGPIglycosyl phosphatidylinositol. membrane. Once this oligosaccharide has been completed, it is transferred onto specific asparagine residues of proteins and subsequently altered by specific glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. The elaboration and initial processing of N-linked oligosaccharides in the ER are similar in all eukaryotes, but subsequent phases of glycosylation are different in a broad range of organisms (Tanner and Lehle, 50.Tanner W.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the N-linked core oligosaccharide is mainly constituted of Man8GlcNAc2 and may undergo Golgi maturation resulting in Man9-13GlcNAc2. In other cases, glycoproteins traversing the Golgi have their core oligosaccharide extended by outer chains containing up to 200 mannose residues (Ballou, 1990; Herscovics and Orlean, 1993; Lehle and Tanner, 1995). Protein N-glycosylation appears essential for cell function since mutants of S. cerevisiae lacking protein subunits of the core oligosaccharyltransferase or mutants defective in the synthesis of the dolichol pyrophosphate-oligosaccharyl precursor are not viable (Huffaker and Robbins, 18.Huffaker T.C.

The structure and biosynthesis of O-linked carbohydrate chains attached to serine and threonine show considerable evolutionary diversity. The primary reaction in the modification of mammalian O-linked proteins involves the attachment of a GalNAc that has been transferred from UDP-GalNAc within the Golgi (Roth, 42.Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate chains of mammalian O-linked modified proteins are variable in length and composition and include galactose, sialic acid, fucose, GalNAc, and GlcNAc (Elhammer and Kornfeld, 9.Elhammer A.

In contrast, it has been demonstrated that in S. cerevisiae O-modified proteins possess a linear carbohydrate chain consisting of up to 5 mannose residues (Tanner and Lehle, 1987; Herscovics and Orlean, 1993; Lehle and Tanner, 1995). Some of the structural genes coding for yeast mannosyltransferases have been isolated. OCH1 encodes the first α1,6-mannosyltransferase involved in initiating outer chain elaboration (Nakayama et al., 37.Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar; Nakanishi-Shindo et al., 36.Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol.

KRE2/MNT1 is the only known α1,2-mannosyltransferase gene isolated to date (Häusler and Robbins, 1992) and is implicated in N-linked outer chain oligosaccharide synthesis (Hill et al., 1992) and is also responsible for the addition of the third mannose residue of O-linked carbohydrate chains (Häusler et al., 1992). Outer chain and core modified oligosaccharides are brought to completion by the action of a terminal α1,3-mannosyltransferase encoded by the MNN1 gene and similarly to Kre2p/Mnt1p, Mnn1p also mannosylates O-linked glycans (Ballou, 1990; Yip et al., 53.Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To examine how post-translational modifications occur in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to further define the responsible enzymes, we have functionally characterized three members of the KRE2/MNT1 putative mannosyltransferase gene family. This growing gene family was known to contain KRE2/MNT1, YUR1, KTR1, KTR2 (Häusler and Robbins, 1992; Lussier et al., 31.Lussier M. Camirand A. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and recently two other homologues, KTR3 and KTR4, have been found by the yeast genome project (Mallet et al., 1994). These genes are predicted to encode type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic N terminus, a membrane-spanning region, and a highly conserved catalytic lumenal domain. While the precise role of Kre2p/Mnt1p as a mannosyltransferase in O-glycosylation has been established (Häusler and Robbins, 1992; Häusler et al., 1992), the role of the other genes remains to be determined. We have carried out a functional analysis of Yur1p, Ktr1p, and Ktr2p and demonstrate that they are mannosyltransferases involved in N-linked glycosylation. All yeast constructions used strain SEY6210 (MATa, leu2-3, ura3-52, his3-Δ200, lys2-801, trp1-Δ901, suc2-Δ9). Yeast cells were grown under standard conditions (yeast extract peptone dextrose, Yeast Nitrogen Base buffered with Halvorson medium, when required) as described previously (Boone et al., 2.Boone C. Sommer S.S. Hensel A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Strains were transformed using the lithium acetate procedure using sheared, denatured carrier DNA (Gietz et al., 10.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium with auxotrophic supplements. Levels of sensitivity to K1 killer toxin was evaluated in SEY6210 by a seeded plate assay using a modified medium consisting of 0.67% YNB, 0.0025% required amino acids, 1.0% Bacto Agar (DIFCO, Detroit, MI), 0.001% methylene blue, 2% glucose, and buffered to pH 4.7 with Halvorson minimal medium (Lussier et al., 1993; Brown et al., 4.Brown J.L. Roemer T. Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 217-231Google Scholar). Deletional disruptions of the KRE2/MNT1, KTR1, KTR2 and YUR1 genes were made by a single-step gene replacement procedure (Rothstein, 43.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The KRE2/MNT1 locus was disrupted with the TRP1 gene using the pAHI1 plasmid (kindly provided by Drs. A. Häusler and P. W. Robbins, Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Briefly, the 1329-bp KRE2 gene was interrupted by replacement of the region from bases 78 to 1315 with a 1.2-kb fragment encoding TRP1. A linearized DNA fragment obtained by digestion with Asp718, comprising the kre2::TRP1 allele, was used for integration. The KTR2 gene disruption is described elsewhere (Lussier et al., 1993). Briefly, the gene was digested by XhoI and ClaI, which are situated, respectively, 146 bp downstream from the ATG and 388 bp upstream from the stop codon. This digestion removed a 744-bp fragment encompassing 248 amino acids of the KTR2 sequence. After treatment to fill in both restriction sites, a 1170-bp blunted DNA fragment containing the complete URA3 gene was ligated into the blunted XhoI and ClaI sites of KTR2. A linear 2.7-kb SpeI fragment containing the complete URA3 gene, as well as the coding plus flanking sequences from the KTR2 gene, was excised and used to disrupt the KTR2 locus into the isogenic diploid SEY6210 cells. The YUR1 gene was disrupted by deleting a 716-bp AccI-NsiI fragment in the coding region and replacing it by the complete 1.8-kb HIS3 gene fragment. Both deleted YUR1 gene fragment and HIS3 gene fragment were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to accommodate the ligation. A 2.5-kb SpeI-EcoRV linearized fragment containing the complete HIS3 gene and the remains of YUR1 coding and flanking regions at each ends were used for integration in yeast. The KTR1 gene disruption was obtained by digestion of the gene with EcoRV, which deleted a 705-base pair fragment including 87 base pairs upstream from the ATG and replacing it by a 4.8-kb fragment containing the LYS2 gene. A linear 6-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the complete LYS2 gene, as well as the coding and flanking sequences from the KTR1 gene, was used to achieve integration at the KTR1 locus in yeast. All gene disruptions were confirmed by Southern analysis (data not shown). Yeast cells were mannose-labeled, and β-eliminations were performed as described previously (Haselbeck and Tanner, 12.Haselbeck A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Lussier et al., 1993). The extracellular yeast proteins Kre9p and invertase were overexpressed from yeast cells harboring 2μ-based multicopy vectors and concentrated from cultures exponentially growing in Yeast Nitrogen Base selective media containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2% glucose using Amicon Centriprep concentrators (W. R. Grace & Co., Danvers, MA). Proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were treated in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dried milk powder) and subsequently incubated in TBST buffer with affinity purified anti-Kre9p or anti-invertase antibodies. After antibody binding, membranes were washed in TBST buffer and a second antibody directed against rabbit immunoglobulins and conjugated with horseradish peroxydase, was then added. The blots were again washed and proteins detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario). The mannoprotein acceptors were prepared from yeast cells according to a modification of the method of Ballou(1990). Pelleted cells from a 200-ml culture of quadruple mutant yeast (containing disruption in the KRE2, YUR1, KTR1, and KTR2 genes) grown in Yeast Nitrogen Base media were washed once with 0.9% NaCl, then with water, and the paste was resuspended in 50 ml of 0.02 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.8, and autoclaved for 90 min. After cooling and low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was kept, and the gelatinous solid pellet was re-extracted with citrate buffer. The supernatants were combined and poured into three volumes of methanol to precipitate the crude mannoprotein. After an overnight precipitation at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged and the pelleted mannoprotein dissolved in water and dialyzed overnight against two changes of water. The crude mannoprotein was lyophilized, then dissolved in 30 ml of 7.5% CTAB, and left to stand at room temperature for 24 h. The solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was kept and an equal volume of 2% boric acid in water was added. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 8.8 with KOH, and precipitation of the mannoprotein-CTAB complex was left to proceed overnight at room temperature. The solution was then centrifuged, the pellet was washed with 0.5% sodium borate buffer at pH 8.8 and dissolved in 12 ml of 2% acetic acid to dissociate mannoproteins from CTAB. Finally, the mannoprotein was precipitated in three volumes of ethanol, washed once with 2% acetic acid in ethanol then once in ethanol, and dissolved in water. The solution was dialyzed overnight at room temperature against water, then lyophilized. For use as acceptor in enzyme reactions, the mannoprotein fraction was resuspended at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM MnCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Mannosyltransferase activity assays were performed essentially as described (Lewis and Ballou, 1991; Häusler and Robbins, 1992; Lussier et al., 1995b). Briefly, reactions were carried out in a solution containing yeast membranes and consisting of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM GDP-[14C]mannose, and 10 mM α-D-methylmannopyranoside or 5 μg of mannan acceptors. Values of specific mannosyltransferase activities (see Fig. 6) are expressed in dpm for a 10-min reaction and for 10 μg of membrane proteins. Results represent the average of three independent determinations. Invertase antiserum was obtained as described previously (Cooper and Bussey, 7.Cooper A. Bussey H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2706-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by injecting into rabbits a recombinant protein corresponding to the N-terminal half of invertase. Briefly, a DNA fragment was excised with SmaI and XbaI from pSEY304 (kindly provided by Dr. T. H. Stevens, Institute of Molecular Biology, Eugene, OR), cloned into plasmid pEXP2, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Ktr1p antibodies were raised in rabbits against a bovine serum albumin-coupled synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acid residues of the protein (NH2-NKLPKPAGWQNHIG-COOH; obtained from the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada). Initially, rabbits were injected with 500 μg of conjugated peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by three subsequent injections with equivalent amounts of peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 3-4-week intervals. The conjugated peptides were coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Montréal, Québec, Canada) and used in a column to affinity-purify the antiserum as described by Raymond et al. (39.Raymond C.K. O'Hara P.J. Eichinger G. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 877-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (sequence YPYDVPDYA; Kolodziej and Young(24.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar)) was inserted directly at the C-terminal domain of both Ktr2p and Yur1p. A NotI site was inserted in frame in both coding sequences by site-directed mutagenesis just before the termination codon. A triple epitope with NotI ends prepared from plasmid pSM191 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Manolson, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) was ligated into the modified coding sequences. Clones possessing the epitope insertion could be identified by restriction mapping a unique BamHI site situated in the triple hemagglutinin epitope. All positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain-termination procedure (Sanger et al., 45.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar) with the Sequenase enzyme (Amersham), [α-35S]dATP, and specific DNA primers. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (Lussier et al., 1995b). Anti-Ktr1p Ab were used at dilutions of 1:25 to 1:100. Epitope-tagged Ktr2p and Yur1p were detected with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Kolodziej and Young, 1991). The latter was used at dilutions ranging from 1:250 to 1:1000. Fluorescence signals were obtained by subsequent incubation of treated cells with rhodamine X sulfonyl chloride (Texas Red)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 to 1:200) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50 to 1:200), which were used as secondary antibodies. Nuclei and mitochondria were visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) and photographed with T-Max 400 film (Eastman Kodak). Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p are predicted to possess a similar structure to Kre2p and mammalian glycosyltransferases: a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a stem region, which links the large lumenal catalytic domain to the membrane-spanning region (Shaper and Shaper, 1992; Kleene and Berger, 1993; Lussier et al., 1995b) (see Fig. 1). The conserved region in the Kre2p family encompasses a large central region, with the N- and C-terminal portions being unique to each protein (for sequence comparison, see Lussier et al.(1993) and Mallet et al.(1994)). Yur1p and Ktr2p are the most similar members of the family, with 62% identity. However, both proteins are the most diverged from Kre2p, with just 37-38% identity at the amino acid level. In view of their sequence and structural similarities with Kre2p, the possible role of the KTR1, KTR2 and YUR1 gene products as protein mannosyltransferases was analyzed. One-step gene replacements were carried out using different marker genes (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). KRE2 and KTR2 single gene disruptions were previously shown to have no growth phenotypes at 30°C (Häusler et al., 1992; Lussier et al., 1993). Analysis of spore progeny derived from SEY6210 ktr1::LYS2 or yur1::HIS3 heterozygotes showed that neither gene was essential for cell viability nor were they required for normal vegetative cell growth. 2M. Lussier, A.-M. Sdicu, A. Camirand, and H. Bussey, unpublished observations. To assess whether a haploid strain carrying deletions in several of these genes possessed a more severe phenotype, double, triple, and quadruple disruptions were sequentially constructed using standard genetic techniques. Meiotic tetrads segregating combinations of these disrupted genes were dissected and haploid spore progeny grown at 30°C. Haploid strains harboring ktr1:LYS2 ktr2::URA3 yur1::HIS3 triple null mutations or haploids carrying a set of four disruptions were viable and did not grow noticeably slower than wild type cells.2 To examine whether Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p are involved in O-linked glycosylation, an analysis of O-modified glycoproteins was made from yeast strains carrying different null mutations. O-Linked carbohydrate chains were specifically released from the glycoprotein fraction of in vivo [3H] mannose-labeled yeast cells by β-elimination and resolved by chromatography. The wild type strain showed the normal profile of five oligosaccharide peaks (Fig. 3, Man1-Man5). The pattern obtained from the kre2 null strain gave two peaks (Man1 and Man2), consistent with failure to add the third α1,2-linked mannose residue in this mannosyltransferase-defective mutant. A ktr2 null mutation was previously shown to possess a wild type pattern of five oligosaccharide peaks (Lussier et al., 1993). The ktr1 and yur1 single null mutant strains also gave a wild type pattern of five mannose peaks2 as did the ktr1 ktr2 yur1 triple null mutant (Fig. 3), providing no evidence for their involvement in O-linked chain elaboration. The extent of O-glycosylation in yeast strains with mutations in these genes was also analyzed by measuring the mobility of a yeast O-glycoprotein, Kre9p. Kre9p is an extracellular matrix protein involved in cell wall assembly that is extensively O-mannosylated but lacks N-linked modifications (Brown et al., 1993). When synthesized in a wild type strain, Kre9p migrates at an apparent mass of 55 kDa. As expected, Kre9p isolated from a kre2 null strain migrated more quickly than did the wild type Kre9p, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 47 kDa (Fig. 4). However, Kre9p produced by ktr1, ktr2, or yur1 single null disruptants or by a triple null mutant strain was indistinguishable from that produced by a wild type strain. The Kre2p O-mannosyltransferase is also involved in the elaboration of N-linked carbohydrate chains (Hill et al., 1992); consequently, the effect of KTR1, KTR2 and YUR1 gene disruptions on invertase N-glycosyl modifications was analyzed. The product of the SUC2 gene, invertase, is a specifically N-modified protein, which is extensively glycosylated (Orlean, 38.Orlean P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Ziegler, 54.Ziegler F.D. Maley F. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three different classes of invertase can be distinguished: 1) a cytoplasmic form (60 kDa), which lacks a signal sequence and is therefore not glycosylated; 2) a transient ER form, which is heterogeneous in size (80-90 kDa), as a consequence of the number of core oligosaccharide chains that are attached to the protein; and 3) a secreted form, which constitutes a array of differently modified proteins (>100 kDa) resulting in elongation from the core oligosaccharide of outer chain glycans in the Golgi complex (see Fig. 5). As found previously (Hill et al., 1992), invertase synthesized in a kre2 null mutant has a molecular mass (≈ 137 kDa) that is smaller than the secreted wild type protein (≈145 kDa). In contrast, the carbohydrate chains of invertase produced in ktr1, ktr2, or yur1 single null mutants appear to be intact, as the molecular mass of the protein made in these strains is wild type (≈145 kDa). Similarly, in ktr1 ktr2, ktr1 yur1, or ktr2 yur1 double null mutants, no obvious reduction in size of invertase was apparent. However, invertase synthesized in a ktr1 ktr2 yur1 triple null mutant possessed a molecular mass of approximately ≈127 kDa. Invertase was smallest (≈120 kDa) when produced in a quadruple kre2 ktr1 ktr2 yur1 mutant, indicating a cumulative involvement of all four proteins in N-linked modifications. In parallel to the in vivo glycosylation studies, an analysis of the in vitro enzymatic activity of Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p in carbohydrate chain elaboration was performed by measuring the transfer of [14C]Man residues from GDP-[14C]Man to a specific acceptor. To reduce the possible background mannosyltransferase activity, the enzymatic source for the in vitro assays consisted of membrane preparations from a kre2 ktr1 ktr2 yur1 quadruple null strain in which each of the genes was individually overexpressed (Fig. 6). In one assay, α-methylmannoside was used as an acceptor. A second assay used mannoprotein prepared from a kre2 ktr1 ktr2 yur1 quadruple null strain as an acceptor. If these mutant acceptor proteins are incompletely mannosylated, they may allow detection of an expanded range of mannosyltransferase activities. Using α-methylmannoside, a kre2 disruptant possesses about 38% residual activity when compared to that of wild type,2 an activity consistent with that found previously (Häusler et al., 1992). A strain carrying deletions of all four genes showed diminished enzymatic activity corresponding to about 18% of that found in a wild type,2 indicating these deleted genes contribute to the total mannosyltransferase activity. The enzymatic activity of YUR1, KTR1, and KTR2 was subsequently assessed (Fig. 6). Using α-methylmannoside as an acceptor, an extract from the quadruple null strain overexpressing Kre2p showed an elevated (6.2-fold) enzymatic activity compared with an extract from the quadruple null strain. YUR1, when overexpressed, also displayed increased enzymatic activity (5.5-fold), demonstrating that Yur1p is a mannosyltransferase. However, using this acceptor, extracts from strain overexpressing KTR1 and KTR2 displayed activity levels equivalent to that of background. To attempt to detect mannosyltransferase activities using an alternative assay, a mannoprotein preparation from the quadruple null strain was used as an acceptor. Again a net increase in activity was seen with KRE2 (2.8-fold) and YUR1 (2.1-fold) when these genes were overexpressed singly in the quadruple null background. Activity higher than background was also detected with the KTR1 and KTR2 genes, although at lower levels. Strains overexpressing KTR2 or KTR1 had mannosyltransferase activities that were 1.8-fold higher and 1.5-fold higher than background, respectively. The role of the Ktr1p, Ktr2p, and Yur1p proteins as mannosyltransferases was also assessed in vivo by using a K1 killer toxin sensitivity assay (Fig. 7). K1 killer yeast strains secrete a small pore-forming toxin that requires a cell wall receptor for function (Bussey, 5.Bussey H. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2339-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This receptor appears to consist of the glycosyl moieties of cell wall glucomannoproteins. Killer-resistant mutants have been found to be defective in β1,6-glucan and in O-mannosylation, suggesting that the in vivo receptor includes these polymers, which are cross-linked in cell wall glucomannoproteins (Montijn et al., 35.Montijn R.C. van Rinsum J. van Schagen F.A.

Genes encoding two sterol reductases involved, respectively, in the reduction of sterol Δ14 and Δ24(28) double bonds have been cloned to date, but no sequence information was available on the enzyme responsible for Δ7-bond reduction. This study presents the cloning of the NADPH-sterol Δ7-reductase (Δ7-red) from Arabidopsis thaliana, based on a metabolic interference approach in yeast. The principle is the functional expression of a plant cDNA library in the yeast strain FY1679-28C tolerant to sterol modifications and the selection of clones resistant to the polyene fungicide nystatin. The toxicity of this compound is dependent on the presence of Δ5,7-unsaturated sterols in the yeast plasma membrane. One clone out of 105 transformants exhibits a cDNA-dependent alteration of cell sterol composition. The 1290-base pair cDNA open reading frame was isolated and sequenced. The corresponding protein presents a significant sequence similarity with yeast Δ14- and Δ24(28)-reductases and with human lamin B receptor. The coding sequence was extracted by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into a galactose-inducible yeast expression vector to optimize expression. Analysis using transformed wild type yeast or sterol altered mutants, indicated that Δ5,7-ergosta- and cholesta-sterols are efficiently reduced in vivo, regardless of the structural variations on the side chain. No reductase activity was observed toward the Δ14 or the Δ5 positions of sterols. In vivo extensive Δ7-reduction of the free and esterified pools of sterols was observed upon induction of the enzyme. Ergosterol present before induction was reduced into ergosta-5,22-dieneol, whereas ergosta-5-eneol is the new end product of sterol neosynthesis, indicating that the yeast Δ22 desaturase may be no longer active on C-7-saturated sterols. In vitro tests indicated that Δ7-reductase activity is preferentially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and confirmed the previous finding that NADPH is the reducing agent.

https://openalex.org/W2043128863,"We have examined vitamin D receptor (VDR), thyroid hormone receptor (TR), and retinoid X receptor β (RXRβ) binding to vitamin D response elements (VDREs), two thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) (DR4 and F2), and a retinoic acid response element (DR5). VDR/RXR bound well to the VDREs and to DR4 and DR5 using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Surprisingly, VDR/RXR also bound well to F2, which contains half-sites arranged as an inverted palindrome. In co-transfection experiments using CV-1 cells, we observed that VDR repressed basal transcription in the absence of ligand on DR3 and osteopontin VDREs and F2, but had no effect on DR4 or DR5. VDR selectively mediated ligand-dependent transcription on only VDREs. VDR also exhibited dominant negative activity as it blocked triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>)-mediated transcriptional activity on DR4 and F2. These results demonstrate that VDR/RXR heterodimers can bind promiscuously to a wide range of hormone response elements, including inverted palindromes. Moreover, they show that unliganded VDRs, similar to TRs and retinoic acid receptors, can repress basal transcription. Last, they also suggest a novel repressor function of VDR on T<sub>3</sub>-mediated transcription which may be significant in tissues where VDR and TR are co-expressed."

Recognition of the sequence of each half-site has generally been believed to be mediated exclusively by a zinc-finger motif within the center of each receptor (Fig. 1) (12.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X.

Amino acids in the P-box helix within this zinc-finger motif make direct contact with bases in the major grove of the DNA half-site, and altering amino acids in the P-box can alter the half-site specificity of the receptor(14.Rastinejad F.M.

An additional α-helix, the A-box located at the C-terminal extreme of the zinc-finger motif, makes minor groove contacts with bases at the 5′ end of the half-site(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 23.Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrant J.

The v-erbA oncogene, for example, is a mutated copy of the host cell gene (c-erbA) for T3Rα-1(24.Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennstrom B.

Nature. 1986; 234: 641-646Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). V-ErbA has sustained a number of mutations relative to its T3Rα progenitor (Fig. 1); as a result, v-ErbA is impaired in hormone binding and in transcriptional activation and appears to function in the cancer cell as a constitutive repressor(26.Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 27.Sap J. Munoz A. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H.G. Vennstrom B.

In addition v-ErbA exhibits a distinct DNA specificity from that of c-ErbAα; although both v-ErbA and c-ErbA efficiently recognize AGGTCA half-sites, only the c-ErbA polypeptide also recognizes AGGACA half-sites(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Smit-McBride Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar). This alteration in DNA specificity is due, in part, to the presence of a serine at codon 61 in the P-box of v-ErbA that is a glycine in c-ErbA (Fig. 1) and is consistent with structural studies that place codon 61 proximal to the fourth base of the half-site(12.Luisi B.F.

Unexpectedly, however, additional receptor domains N-terminal to the zinc-finger also strongly influence the half-site specificity of the ErbA polypeptides(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Smit-McBride Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

The amino acid at codon 32, a cysteine in v-ErbA and a tyrosine in c-ErbA (Fig. 1), is particularly critical, and only by changing the identity of both codon 32 and codon 61 is it possible to exchange the DNA recognition properties of v-ErbA and c-ErbA(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32.Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar). The analogous N-terminal domains of RARs, RXRs, and retinoid orphan receptors also play a critical role in DNA half-site specificity (32.Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G.

Unfortunately, this region of the nuclear receptors has not been modeled in structural studies, leaving the precise molecular basis of its actions unclear. Unlike the zinc-finger domain, it is doubtful that the N terminus makes direct base-specific contacts with the DNA half-site(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We describe here a detailed dissection of the effects of these N-terminal receptor determinants on half-site recognition. We report that the contributions of the N terminus to DNA recognition specificity are at least as potent as those of the zinc-finger domain itself and can broadly influence sequence recognition over multiple locations in the half-site; we propose a conformational model to explain these effects. We also demonstrate that interactions with RXR, a heterodimeric partner for many nuclear hormone receptors, has a differential effect on the DNA half-site recognition properties of v-ErbA and c-ErbA, indicating that processes influencing heterodimer formation by nuclear hormone receptors may also alter their target gene specificity. The wild-type v-ErbA, avian c-ErbAα-1, and avian RXRγ receptors were obtained as nuclear extracts from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The C32Y, S61G/T78K, and C32Y/S61G/T78K mutant v-ErbA polypeptides were isolated as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins from Escherichia coli transfected with the appropriate pGEX recombinant plasmid vectors(32.Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar); no significant differences were observed in the DNA binding specificities of ErbA proteins synthesized in the bacterial system compared to the same polypeptide encoded in the baculovirus system (data not shown). The different oligonucleotide probes employed in the binding experiments were synthesized on a Milligen Cyclone Plus using phosphoramidite chemistry. Each probe was created as two complementary oligonucleotides with four base overhangs (e.g. for the consensus, 5′-TCGAA TAAGG TCAAA TAAGG TCAGA G-3′ and 5′-TCGAC TCTGA CCTTA TTTGA CCTTA T-3′), the oligonucleotides were annealed, and the double-stranded DNAs were radiolabeled by fill-in using [γ-32P]dGTP and Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. Standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed as described previously(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38.Chen H.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5970-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (typically 1-3.5 × 105 counts/min, approximately 20-30 ng of DNA) was incubated with the protein of interest in 15 μl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 13.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 133 μg/ml poly(deoxyinosine• deoxycytosine)) for 15 min at room temperature. Any protein-DNA complexes that formed were then resolved by electrophoresis through a 4.5% polyacrylamide, 0.12% bisacrylamide gel at 200 V for 75 min. The resulting electrophoretograms were dried, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by use of a Betascan analyzer. In the absence of RXRs, c-ErbA and v-ErbA generally produced both monomeric and dimeric complexes, probably due to the low cooperativity with which the c-Erb Aα isoform forms homodimers(7.Wahlstrom G.M. Sjoberg M. Anderrson M. Nordstrom K. Vennstrom B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Perhaps as a consequence of this low cooperativity, the ratio of monomers to dimers formed by a given ErbA protein did not significantly vary from one response element to another (Fig. 2 and quantification data not shown). Competition assays were performed by binding the receptor of interest to 27 ng of the radiolabeled consensus sequence in the presence of differing amounts (0, 125, 500, or 1000 ng) of the unlabeled competing DNA. We wished to further explore the mechanisms by which the N terminus of the ErbA protein influences DNA recognition specificity. We first tested if the influence of the N-terminal and P-box amino acids on DNA recognition was localized to the fourth base position analyzed previously, or if their effects extended over additional positions in the half-site. We began with an optimized consensus half-site (TAAGGTCA), systematically altered each position to the alternative three bases, and tested the ability of each substituted DNA sequence to bind to ErbA. Our use of an 8-base half-site in the current study follows from the recent demonstration that alterations in bases 5′ to the traditionally defined hexanucleotide half-site can also influence DNA recognition(21.Nelson C.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These 5′ bases are probably recognized through interactions with the receptor A-box helix(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 23.Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrant J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To allow comparison with previous work, we number the original hexanucleotide half-site sequence as +1 thorough +6, and denote the two 5′ bases as the −2 and −1 positions. Each of the 25 possible permutated half-sites were synthesized as a direct repeat with a 4-base spacer (DR-4), an arrangement found in many physiological response elements for c-ErbA(8.Naar A.M. Boutin J.-M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 9.Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). We then tested the ability of c-ErbA or v-ErbA to bind to these elements in vitro using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. An autoradiograph of a typical assay is shown in Fig. 2, whereas the results from multiple assays were quantified, averaged, and are displayed in Fig. 3. Several observations are of note. (a) Although c-ErbA bound best to the consensus TAAGGTCA half-site, an extensive set of variations of this consensus were also strongly recognized by the receptor. This was particularly evident for the base substitutions at half-site positions −2, −1, +1, +4, +5, and +6, most of which were accommodated by c-ErbA with relatively modest effects on binding. (b) In contrast, most substitutions in the consensus half-site at positions +2 and +3 were highly destabilizing for c-ErbA binding (with the exception of the +3T substitution, which retained moderate T3R binding). The v-ErbA protein demonstrated a very different, and generally more restrictive, DNA specificity pattern from that of c-ErbA. V-ErbA bound the consensus half-site element relatively strongly. However, v-ErbA bound weakly, or not at all, to many of the substitutions at +4, +5, and +6 that were strongly bound by c-ErbA (Fig. 3B; presented as a difference plot in Fig. 3C). v-ErbA, in common with c-ErbA, also failed to bind to most of the base substitutions at positions +2 and +3. However, substitutions at −1 proved an intriguing exception and were recognized as well, or better, by v-ErbA as by c-ErbA. In fact, our results indicate that the optimal v-ErbA half-site sequence was TGAGGTCA, in contrast to the optimal c-ErbA site, TAAGGTCA, but consistent with results obtained by a randomized binding site selection procedure(42.Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Half-site sequences that exhibited differential recognition by v- and c-ErbA in these direct DNA binding studies were subsequently re-analyzed in DNA competition experiments with essentially the same results (Table 1). We conclude that differences in DNA recognition between v-ErbA and c-ErbA extend throughout the DNA half-site and are manifested as a more restrictive v-ErbA recognition of bases +3, +4, +5, and +6, and a broader recognition of bases at −1.TABLE 1 We next examined the relative contributions of the N-terminal and zinc-finger domains to the differing DNA half-site specificities of c- and v-ErbA. The zinc-finger domain of the nuclear hormone receptors mediates most of the known protein/base pair contacts (12.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowshi Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 13.Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, complete replacement of the v-ErbA zinc-finger domain with that of c-ErbA (a mutant denoted S61G/T78K, Fig. 1) produced only relatively modest effects on the half-site specificity of the v-ErbA protein (compare Fig. 3B and 4B). Most evident was an increase in v-ErbA binding to the +4A substitution, although some enhancement of binding to the +3T, +4C, +5A, +5G, +5T, and +6G substitutions was also observed. A difference plot (probe bound by wild-type v-ErbA minus that bound by the mutant; Fig. 4E) is also presented to allow comparison to Fig. 3C. Compared to the zinc-finger swap, just changing codon 32 in the v-ErbA N terminus to that of c-ErbA (a mutant denoted C32Y; Fig. 1) had a greater overall effect on DNA recognition, significantly enhancing recognition of the +3T, +4C, +4G, +5G, +5T, +6C, +6G, and +6T substitutions, and decreasing binding to −1G (Fig. 4A). In these aspects the specificity of the C32Y v-ErbA mutant nearly paralleled that of c-ErbA (compare Fig. 3A and 4A, and compare the difference plots in Fig. 4D and 3C). Nonetheless, the C32Y mutation alone failed to confer a strong, c-ErbA-like recognition of the +4A or +5A substitutions. Indeed, a triple v-ErbA mutation, denoted C32Y/S61G/T78K, significantly enhanced recognition of the +4A and +5A substitutions and yielded an overall DNA recognition pattern indistinguishable from that of c-ErbA (compare Fig. 4C and 3A, and compare the difference plots in Fig. 4F and 3C). Parallel results were obtained in DNA competition experiments (Table 1). We conclude that virtually all the differences in DNA recognition noted for v- and c-ErbA are accounted for by amino acid differences in the N terminus and zinc-finger domains of these proteins, and that the N-terminal domain plays a dominant role in this phenomenon. Many nuclear receptors can form heterodimers with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (reviewed in Refs. 43 and 44). In fact, RXR•c-ErbA heterodimers exhibit higher overall DNA binding affinity and enhanced target gene activation than do c-ErbA homodimers, and may be the dominant form of c-ErbA in living cells(43.Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Receptors. 1993; 3: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of RXR•c-ErbA heterodimerization on DNA half-site specificity. Interestingly, heterodimerization with RXR further extended the already broad DNA recognition properties of c-ErbA to allow recognition of virtually all the single base substitutions tested. Base substitutions at −2, −1, +4, +5 and +6 that were moderately well recognized by c-ErbA homodimers were now strongly recognized by RXR•c-ErbA heterodimers (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, base substitutions at +1, +2, and +3 that exhibited no detectable binding by c-ErbA homodimers were now strongly recognized by the RXR•c-ErbA heterodimer (Fig. 5A). The ability of the RXR•c-ErbA heterodimer to bind to each permutated half-site is expressed relative to its ability to bind the consensus sequence; thus our results reflect actual alterations in sequence specificity. All binding experiments were performed in DNA probe excess, under conditions such that only the binding of receptor heterodimers was measured; no binding of RXR homodimers was detected under these conditions. Surprisingly, formation of heterodimers with RXR had non-identical effects on v-ErbA relative to c-ErbA. In common with c-ErbA, heterodimerization of v-ErbA with RXR enhanced binding to half-site substitutions at the −2, +4, +5, and +6 positions (Fig. 5B). In contrast, however, heterodimerization with RXR had much less of an effect on recognition of the +1, +2, and +3 half-site positions by v-ErbA than by c-ErbA (Fig. 5B). As a consequence, certain differences between v- and c-ErbA in half-site recognition (at positions −1, +5, and +6) were muted by heterodimerization with RXR, whereas novel differences in half-site recognition (at positions +1, +2, and +3) were created (compare the difference plots in Fig. 5C and Fig. 3C). Structural modeling indicates that the base pairs in the DNA half-site are contacted through a web of multiple interactions with amino acids in both the P- and A-box of the receptor(12.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowshi Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 13.Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These multiple protein-base-specific DNA contacts, both direct and through immobilized water molecules, might be expected to impose a strict DNA sequence specificity on these receptors. In practice, however, nuclear hormone receptors exhibit a relatively promiscuous DNA sequence specificity and conversely can accept a surprising variety of P- and A-box amino acid substitutions without abolishing DNA binding(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19.Nelson C. Hendy S.C. Faris J.S. Romaniuk P.J. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In fact, as demonstrated here, c-ErbA homodimers exhibit a near absolute specificity for the consensus half-site sequence only at positions +2 and +3 (TAAGGTCA), whereas a broad range of substitutions are permissible at nearly all other positions. Although obtained with artificial elements, these results are consistent with the considerable sequence variation found in naturally occurring response elements(8.Naar A.M. Boutin J.-M. Lipkin S.M.

How can this promiscuity of DNA sequence recognition be reconciled with the specific base contacts seen in structural studies? Studies with non-cognate elements suggest that the precise receptor-DNA contacts can vary with modest changes in orientation or conformation of the receptor accommodating non-consensus sequences(12.Luisi B.F.

Structure. 1995; 3: 201-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is also likely that the specific base pair-receptor contacts, typically hydrogen bonds or van der Waals' interactions, contribute only modestly to the change in free energy of receptor upon DNA binding, compared with the stronger, sequence-independent ionic contacts between the receptor and the DNA backbone(12.Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowshi Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 45.Gewirth D.T. Sigler P.B. Struct.

Structure. 1995; 3: 201-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In fact, base-specific interactions may function chiefly to prevent receptor binding to inappropriate DNA sequences (by “clashing” sterically or otherwise with the amino acids in the receptor P- and A-boxes) rather than by contributing positively to binding by stabilizing contacts to the correct base pairs. Although structurally closely related to c-ErbA, the v-ErbA protein exhibits a much more narrow DNA sequence specificity over much of the half-site sequence. Intriguingly, although there is a difference in the P-box between v- and c-ErbA, at codon 61, alteration of this amino acid produces only modest effects on DNA recognition. In fact, in a crystallographic analysis(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), this codon does not make any base-specific contacts with the consensus half-site, although it potentially can make unfavorable contacts with incorrect half-sites (19.Nelson C. Hendy S.C. Faris J.S. Romaniuk P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 829-840PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Smit-McBride Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 819-828PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, alteration of codon 32 in the N terminus of the receptor (and outside of the previously defined DNA binding domain) dramatically broadens the sequence recognition properties of v-ErbA to more closely approximate those of c-ErbA; mutation of both N-terminal and zinc-finger domains confers a fully c-ErbA specificity. How might the N-terminal region be capable of such effects? The N-terminal domain has not been included in the structural studies reported to date, and therefore its precise actions must remain speculative. It appears unlikely, however, that the v-ErbA N terminus can make direct contact with the bases in the AGGTCA core hexanucleotide, precluding a direct effect on base pair recognition. We also disfavor a model in which the N terminus mediates its effects indirectly by altering the conformation of the target DNA; although both v-ErbA and c-ErbA induce DNA bending, the extent of the bend is independent of the nature of the N terminus. 2J. Hamaguchi and M. L. Privalsky, unpublished data. Instead, we suggest that the receptor N terminus acts indirectly by influencing the tertiary conformation of the zinc-finger P- and A-box helices. We propose that although the P- and A-box amino acids make the actual discriminatory contacts with bases in the DNA, the N terminus can alter the precise position or orientation of the zinc-finger recognition helices and thus can define in a global fashion the exact base contacts made, and the stringency of the protein-DNA interaction. Perhaps, due to these interactions with the N terminus, the P-box helix of c-ErbA is slightly tilted away from the 3′ end of the half-site relative to the P-box helix of v-ErbA, resulting in the enhanced ability of c-ErbA to accommodate a broader range of base substitutions over these positions. In fact, the zinc-finger domain is known to exhibit some flexibility in its location relative to the DNA major groove(45.Gewirth D.T. Sigler P.B. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a conformational coupling between the receptor N terminus and the zinc-finger domain is consistent with previous mutagenesis studies, and with the apparent proximity of these two domains, as suggested by the limited crystallographic data available(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 32.Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar). Many nuclear hormone receptors can bind to DNA both as homodimers, and as heterodimers with other members of the receptor family (reviewed in (43.Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (44.Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Receptors. 1993; 3: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar)). RXR•c-ErbA heterodimers exhibit an increased overall affinity for DNA and elevated transcriptional activation properties compared to those of homodimers. We demonstrate here that heterodimerization with RXRs can also alter the half-site specificity of c-ErbA and v-ErbA. For c-ErbA, this is manifested as a further broadening of half-site specificity, including a novel recognition of half-site substitutions (at +2 and +3) that are not detectably bound by c-ErbA homodimers. Perhaps reflecting a reciprocal phenomenon, the inhibitory effects of receptor P-box amino acid substitutions on DNA binding can also be counteracted by RXR heterodimerization. 3C. Nelson, C., S. C. Hendy, J. S. Faris, and P. J. Romaniuk, manuscript in preparation. It is possible that the inherently high overall affinity for DNA of the RXR•c-ErbA heterodimer simply overwhelms the destabilizing effects of these response element or amino acid substitutions. However, it is striking that recognition of certain half-site substitutions is relatively unaffected by RXR heterodimerization, whereas recognition of others is greatly enhanced. This was particularly evident for v-ErbA, which as an RXR heterodimer exhibits significantly enhanced binding to base substitutions at +4 to +6, but not to substitutions at +2 and +3. Notably, the N-terminal domain of ErbA forms part of the heterodimer interface with RXR(14.Rastinejad F.M. Perlmann T.P. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar); perhaps RXR influences half-site specificity in the heterodimer through this interaction with the ErbA N terminus, altering, in turn, the conformation of the ErbA zinc-finger domain. It is intriguing that the DNA recognition properties of the v-ErbA oncoprotein homodimer are both broader (at −1) and more narrow (at +4, +5, and +6) than those of the c-ErbA/T3R progenitor. v-ErbA acts in the cancer cell by interfering with erythroid differentiation, apparently by binding to and repressing target genes normally activated by c-ErbA, RARs, and possibly RXRs(26.Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 27.Sap J. Munoz A. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H.G. Vennstrom B.

Zenke M. Beug H. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar). The extended recognition specificity of v-ErbA at the −1 position may contribute to its ability to compete for, and repress target genes for heterologous receptors such as RARs. Conversely, the more narrow specificity of v-ErbA at +4 to +6 may prevent repression of c-ErbA-responsive genes critical for cell proliferation(18.Chen H.-W. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is intriguing in this regard to note the different effects of RXR heterodimerization on the DNA specificity of c-ErbA and v-ErbA. By enhancing v-ErbA recognition of base substitutions at +4 to +6, RXR heterodimerization would permit v-ErbA to bind to, and repress certain sets of c-ErbA target genes that are not repressed by v-ErbA homodimers. Conversely, by enhancing c-ErbA, but not v-ErbA, recognition of half-site substitutions at +2 and +3, RXR heterodimerization would create novel targets for c-ErbA activation that cannot be repressed by v-ErbA homo- or heterodimers. At the high levels of v-ErbA expression observed in the cancer cell, it is likely that both homodimeric and heterodimeric v-ErbA species co-exist, and that the precise balance between these species has an important influence in determining the effects of v-ErbA on the neoplastic phenotype. We are especially grateful to H. W. Chen for providing reagents, assistance, and helpful discussion, to J. Hamaguchi for providing Sf9 cell extracts, and to P. Romaniuk for sharing information and many excellent suggestions prior to publication."

We extended these studies and, in contrast to earlier reports, found that proteinase-1 contains 7.5 mol of Fuc, 8 mol of Man, 2 mol of Xyl, and 30 mol of GlcNAc per calculated mol of protein but no Man-6-P residues. The protein binds to concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin lectin affinity columns, and PNGase-F digestion released most of the mannose and xylose but little of the GlcNAc. β-Elimination under reducing conditions released only GlcNAc-α-1-P. There was no evidence for the release of disaccharides or of fucitol. A rabbit antiserum and monoclonal antibodies prepared against proteinase-1 recognize GlcNAc-α-1-P residues in immunoblots and are specifically competed by UDP-GlcNAc or GlcNAc-α-1-P. Use of other monoclonal antibodies showed the presence of mannose-6-sulfate on N-linked sugar chains, and α-fucose residues on the protein. Thus, proteinase-1 has at least two types of modifications: GlcNAc-α-1-P-Ser, which we call phosphoglycosylation, and N-linked oligosaccharides. This is the first purified lysosomal enzyme in Dictyostelium that does not contain Man-6-P residues. The GlcNAc-α-1-P-specific antibodies also recognize a group of developmentally regulated proteins, especially enriched in vegetative cells. Some of them are also lysosomal cysteine proteinases, and all bind to the GlcNAc-α-1-P-specific monoclonal antibody but not to the mammalian CI-Man-6-P receptor. Conversely, lysosomal enzymes that have Man-6-P do not bind to the GlcNAc-α-1-P-specific antibody. An exception to this is β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, where 15% of the activity binds to this antibody.

On the other hand, the functional relevance of the transmembrane region was revealed by the mutational work of Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), who suggested that six residues originating from four transmembrane helices (M4, Glu309; M5, Glu771; M6, Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800; M8, Glu908) are involved in Ca2+ binding (Fig. 1).

The chicken fast muscle SR ATPase cDNA (3.Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was inserted into the pUC19 plasmid for amplification and then subcloned into the pSELECT-1 vector for site-directed mutagenesis by the Altered Sites in Vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega; Madison, WI) or by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction(4.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Eleven unique restriction sites were introduced in the cDNA to allow cassette exchange, and a c-myc tag was added to the 3′ terminus to monitor ATPase expression as described by Zhang et al.(5.Zhang Z.

The cDNA constructs were finally transferred into the pCDL-SRα296 plasmid (6.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for transfection of COS-1 as described by Sumbilla et al.(7.Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Fang Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four days after transfection the confluent COS-1 cells from 20 plates (150 × 25 mm; 4 × 107 cells/plate) were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a Teflon spatula, and collected in 80 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The microsomal fraction was then obtained as described by Zhang et al.(5.Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed SERCA-1 ATPase was detected by Western blotting, using monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the c-myc epitope (8.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) and, in parallel, a monoclonal antibody to the chicken Ca-ATPase, CaF3-5C3(3.Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to Western blots, quantitation of SERCA-1 expression was also obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in microtiter plates. ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was measured by following the accumulation of radioactive calcium tracer in microsomal vesicles separated from the reaction mixture by filtration (0.45-μm Millipore filters), as described by Zhang et al.(5.Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured by determination of Pi (Lanzetta et al.(9.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), also as described by Zhang et al.(5.Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The Ca2+-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase from the total ATPase. Both Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity were corrected to account for the level of expressed protein in each microsomal preparation as revealed by immunoreactivity and with reference to microsomes obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with wild type cDNA. Steady-state levels of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate were obtained by adding 0.1 ml of 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP to 0.4 ml of a reaction mixture containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 30-100 μg of microsomal protein (the amount of microsomal protein was varied to approximate the amount of expressed ATPase contained by wild type controls, as revealed by immunoreactivity). The components of the reaction mixture were preincubated in ice, and vortex mixing was carried out in the cold room. The reaction was quenched after 10 s by the addition (vortex mixing) of 0.105 ml of 10.0 M perchloric acid. The suspension was transferred immediately onto an Eppendorf tube containing 100 μg of carrier protein and allowed to sit in ice for 5-10 min. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, the sedimented protein was washed twice with 0.125 M perchloric acid and once with water. An aliquot of the solubilized sample was then subjected to gel electrophoresis (10.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at pH 6.3, and the radioactive phosphoenzyme was detected by autoradiography. The rates of phosphoenzyme decay were determined by first obtaining steady-state levels of phosphoenzyme as explained above. Ten s after the addition of radioactive ATP, 0.5 ml of 1.0 mM nonradioactive ATP was added with rapid mixing, and samples were acid quenched at serial times. A zero time base line was obtained by acid quenching before the chase. The entire procedure was carried out in ice and in the cold room. Washings, electrophoresis, and autoradiography were performed as described above. Equilibrium levels of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate were obtained by adding 50 μg of microsomal protein (or an amount adjusted to match the ATPase content of the reference wild type preparation) to 0.2 ml of a medium containing 50 mM MES-Tris, pH 6.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 20% (v:v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2 mM EGTA-Tris (and/or various concentrations of CaCl2 according to experimental schedule). The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 1 mM32Pi (107 dpm/nmol) to reach a 50 μM final concentration. After a 10-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.11 ml of 10.0 M perchloric acid (ice cold). The suspension was transferred onto an Eppendorf tube containing 100 μg of carrier protein. After a 10-min incubation in ice, the denatured protein was sedimented by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 10 min) and washed four times with 1.0 ml of 0.125 M perchloric acid and once with water. The final sediment was dissolved and subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography as explained above. The rates of phosphoenzyme decay were determined by first obtaining equilibrium levels of phosphoenzyme incubated at 37°C with 50 μM32Pi as described above and then adding with rapid mixing 1.0 ml of 1.0 mM (ice-cold) nonradioactive Pi. The reaction was then quenched at serial times by the addition of 0.11 ml of 10.0 M perchloric acid. A zero time sample was obtained by quenching before the addition of nonradioactive Pi. Addition of carrier protein, centrifugations, washings, electrophoresis, and autoradiography were carried out as described above. Quanta and Hyperchem molecular graphics programs were used for molecular modeling. The valence mapping program was kindly supplied by Prof. E. Di Cera, Washington University, St. Louis. The studies reported here were performed with wild type and mutated cDNAs encoding the SR ATPase and the mutants listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3. After disruption of the transfected cells and fractionation, the expressed ATPase is recovered with microsomal vesicles and can be detected by Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titrations. The wild type ATPase and the mutants studied in these experiments were expressed at similar, but not identical levels (Fig. 2). Therefore, the relative level of expressed ATPase in each preparation, with reference to a selected wild type ATPase preparation, was used to obtain corrected values for the functional activity of 1 mg of microsomal protein (TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3).TABLE 1TABLE 2TABLE 2TABLE 3TABLE 3Figure 2:Immunologic detection of ATPase expression. The three rows of bands are examples of Western blot analysis using microsomal fractions derived from transfected COS-1 cells. The blots were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using monoclonal antibody 9E10 for detection of the c-myc tag. Note the absence of expression in pCDL control (cells transfected with plasmid without the cDNA insert) and K297G (cells transfected with cDNA encoding the Lys297 → Gly mutant). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A special case was the lack of expression of the Lys297 → Gly mutant (see Fig. 2), which we failed to recover with the microsomal fraction of COS-1 cells after repeated transfections with two batches of plasmid amplified, banded, and sequenced at different times. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of an mRNA transcript for this mutant consistent with that of wild type (results not shown). It is of interest that mutation of the same residue to Phe did yield expression, although at low level, and the Lys297 → Met, Lys297 → Arg, and Lys297 → Glu mutants were expressed at normal levels (Fig. 2). It is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 that several mutants within the M4, M5, M6, and M8 helices sustain levels of Ca2+ transport and ATPase activity which are comparable to those of the wild type ATPase. Therefore, it is possible to introduce point mutations within the transmembrane region without interfering with function. These findings confer a character of specificity to several other mutations that do interfere with function. In fact, not all mutants retaining high ATPase hydrolytic activity retained a correspondingly high Ca2+ uptake. Among the mutants retaining high hydrolytic activity, this differential effect is pronounced in Val314 → Ala, Ile315 → Ala, Trp794 → Ala, Val795 → Ala, and Leu802 → Ala mutants (Table 1). A group of mutations producing inhibition of ATPase hydrolytic activity is shown in Table 2. It is of interest that in all of these mutations, Ca2+ transport was inhibited significantly more than hydrolytic activity. Since this uncoupling effect is produced by mutations which do (Table 2) or do not (Table 1) inhibit hydrolytic activity, it is apparent that a specific structural perturbation is involved in its onset, independent of other perturbations that may affect catalytic activity. Characterization of the six mutations originally reported by Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), who proposed that the six native residues participate in Ca2+ binding, is shown in Table 3. We confirmed that these mutations produce total inhibition of Ca2+ transport and hydrolytic activity, and then we extended the functional characterization as explained below. It is noteworthy that the effects of mutations are very specific and dependent both on the residues that are mutated and the side chains that are introduced. An example of the high specificity of mutational effects is found in the total inhibition resulting from the Glu908 → Ala mutation compared with the full activity retained by the Glu908 → Gln mutant (Fig. 3). Of great interest are also the different and specific effects produced by mutating Lys297 to Gly (no expression), to Phe (low expression and low activity), to Met (low activity), and to Arg or Glu (nearly normal ATPase and slight inhibition of Ca2+ uptake). We performed several types of experiments to uncover whether specific partial reactions of the ATPase cycle (Fig. 4) were affected by mutations. As reported previously by Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we found (Fig. 5 and Table 3) that the Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, Asn796 → Ala, Thr799 → Ala, Asp800 → Asn, and Glu908 → Ala mutants do not produce significant levels of phosphoenzyme intermediate when incubated with ATP and Ca2+ (reaction 2 in Fig. 4). The phosphoenzyme levels obtained with all other mutants were within the range obtained with wild type enzyme. Minor variations of phosphoenzyme levels on the gels were not related meaningfully to the ATPase activities of the corresponding mutants (Fig. 5 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2).Figure 5:Examples of phosphoenzyme steady-state levels formed in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP. The phosphoenzyme was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” and determined by autoradiography. Note the absence or very low levels of phosphoenzyme when the Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, Asn796 → Ala, Thr799 → Ala, Asp800 → Asn, and Glu908 → Ala mutants are used. Characterization of these and all the other mutants is reported in the tables. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then conducted isotopic chase experiments to evaluate the effect of mutations on the decay of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (reactions 3 and 4 in Fig. 4). We found that mutants sustaining ATPase activity comparable to that of the wild type enzyme exhibited phosphoenzyme turnover that was similar to that of the wild type enzyme. On the other hand, the rate of phosphoenzyme decay was reduced in mutants exhibiting inhibition of steady-state ATPase activity (e.g. see Lys297 → Met, Cys774 → Ala, and Ile775 → Ala in Fig. 6 and Table 2). Observations of mutational effects on phosphoenzyme turnover are very important for two reasons. (a) They confirm the inhibitory effects of mutations under conditions that are not dependent on the enzyme concentration (since phosphoenzyme decay is a first order phenomenon); this dispels doubts on whether observed inhibitions of steady-state ATPase activity (which is dependent on enzyme concentration) may in fact be related to inaccuracies in the immunological determination of expressed ATPase. (b) They indicate that the mutational effect is on ATPase partial reactions that follow formation of the phosphorylated intermediate (step 3 and/or step 4 in Fig. 4), and these reactions are rate-limiting for completion of the catalytic and transport cycle. In addition to enzyme phosphorylation by utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+, phosphoenzyme can be formed in the reverse direction of the ATPase cycle by utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (reverse of reaction 4 in Fig. 4; see (13.Masuda H. De Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). We studied this reaction by equilibrating the enzyme with Pi in the absence of Ca2+, at mildly acid pH, and in the presence of 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide to facilitate phosphorylation, as was also done in the experiments by Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). When we used samples of wild type enzyme reacted separately with Pi under these conditions, we obtained identical phosphoenzyme levels, indicating that our technique of detection was highly reproducible (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the equilibrium levels of phosphoenzyme obtained with various mutants were quite different. These differences were not related to whether the mutants exhibited or did not exhibit inhibition of steady-state ATPase activity and/or enzyme phosphorylation with ATP. In some cases (Fig. 7 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3), high levels of phosphoenzyme were obtained through the Pi reaction with mutants yielding low ATPase activity (Val300 → Ala, Cys774 → Ala, Ile775 → Ala), or no ATPase activity and no phosphoenzyme in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ (Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln). On the other hand, hardly detectable levels of phosphoenzyme were obtained through the Pi reaction with some mutants (Val314 → Ala and Leu319 → Ala, for instance) retaining relatively high ATPase activity and enzyme phosphorylation with ATP (Fig. 7 and Table 1). As opposed to the steady-state levels (resulting from all four steps of the diagram in Fig. 4) obtained in the presence of ATP and Ca2+, the Pi reaction (reverse of step 4 of the diagram in Fig. 4) may be considered to occur as where E is the enzyme equilibrated with Pi. We then explored the possibility that the observed variations of E-P may be due to altered affinity of the mutants for Pi. We found, however, that the Pi concentration used in our experiments was saturating in all cases (not shown). Therefore, the observed variations of phosphoenzyme levels were likely due to mutational effects on the E•Pi ↔ E-P equilibrium constant, which is dependent on the ratio of the two bidirectional rate constants. In fact when we followed the phosphoenzyme decay after isotopic chase, we found that high levels of phosphoenzyme were in most cases accompanied by slow decays, whereas low levels of phosphoenzyme were accompanied by fast decays (Fig. 8 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3). The six mutants Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, Asn796 → Ala, Thr799 → Ala, Asp800 → Asn, and Glu908 → Ala display total inhibition of Ca2+ uptake, ATPase activity, and phosphoenzyme formation in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ while still able to be phosphorylated with Pi (Table 3). Occurrence of phosphorylation with Pi in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+ was taken as an indication of mutational interference with Ca2+ binding(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We extended the functional characterization of these mutants by measuring the levels of EP formed with Pi in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+. We performed these titrations at mildly acid pH to lower the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ and to maximize any effect of mutational perturbations on Ca2+ binding. Under these experimental conditions, half-maximal inhibition of the Pi reaction with wild type enzyme and several mutants is obtained at approximately 20 μM Ca2+. However, the same parameter is shifted to the mM range when the Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, Thr799 → Ala, Asp800 → Asn, and Glu908 → Ala mutants are used (Fig. 9, also (14.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These experiments are quite accurate and easy to interpret as they reflect equilibration of Ca2+ and Pi with the enzyme (as opposed to studies on the Ca2+ concentration dependence of ATP utilization, which depends on several kinetic constants). Our titration experiments (Fig. 9) show that single mutations do not eliminate completely the effect of Ca2+ but rather increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude the effective Ca2+ concentration (i.e. reduce the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+). They also demonstrate unambiguously that the Asn796 → Ala mutation does not interfere with Ca2+ inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi, even though it does interfere with Ca2+-dependent enzyme phosphorylation with ATP. We interpret our present findings to indicate that Asn796 does not participate in Ca2+ binding under our conditions (as well as those of Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)) for enzyme equilibration with Pi. It is possible that Asn796 participates in Ca2+ binding under different conditions and/or in another specific conformational state of the enzyme (e.g. Ca2+ occlusion in the presence of CrATP(17.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). It should be pointed out that Andersen and Vilsen (16.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Glu309 → Gln mutant is in the 10 μM range as opposed to the mM range observed in our experiments (Fig. 9). It is likely that this difference is due to the higher pH used by Andersen and Vilsen(16.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), favoring ionization of Ca2+ binding acidic functions with pK near neutrality(18.Yu X. Hao L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby increasing the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ and obscuring the effect of single mutations. Finally, we note that mutation of Glu908 → Ala interferes with inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+, whereas mutation of Glu → Gln leaves the enzyme perfectly functional (also noted by Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)). This is of specific interest, considering that mutation Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, or Asp800 → Asn interferes strongly with inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+ (TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3 and Fig. 9). The different effect of the Glu908 mutations to Gln or Ala suggests that although the Glu309, Glu771, and Asp800 contributions to Ca2+ complexation depend on both side chain oxygens, Glu908 contributes only one side chain oxygen, which is still present following mutation to Gln, but not to Ala. As the acidic function is lost by the Gln mutant, we conclude that the carbonyl oxygen is able to participate in coordination of Ca2+. We found it helpful to evaluate by molecular modeling whether the residues pointed out by mutational analysis can in fact generate a Ca2+ binding domain. Accordingly, a model was constructed by clustering transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 and thereby forming a channel that can admit two Ca2+ in single file(19.Inesi G. Kirtley M.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rotation of the helices for optimal positioning of acidic side chains within the lumen of the channel is favored by the amphiphilic character of the helices. An important question is whether it is possible to have two closely spaced calcium ions bound within the same domain (in spite of possible charge repulsion). Crystallographic resolution of several Ca2+ binding structures (for instance, the duplex Ca2+ binding site of thermolysin; (20.Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar)) indicates that two Ca2+ can in fact reside in close proximity and yields information regarding the appropriate distances between binding oxygens and Ca2+ and between the two bound Ca2+. In previous attempts to model all six residues suggested by Clarke et al.(1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we encountered difficulty in orienting the diverging side chains of the Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800 (which originate from the same helix M6) for simultaneous participation in Ca2+ binding. For this reason we proposed exclusion of Thr799(2.Inesi G. Sumbilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our present experimental observations, however, indicate clearly that Asn796 is the residue to be excluded; and this solves the problem. However, we do not exclude that Asn796 may participate in Ca2+ binding by the enzyme in some specific conformational state that we do not see under our conditions. Andersen and Vilsen suggested (16.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Asn796 may participate in complexation of only the proximal (closer to the cytosolic side of the membrane) Ca2+. However, modeling shows that Asn796 is actually the most distal of the putative binding residues and is unlikely to interact with the proximal Ca2+. We considered whether the two oxygen functions of each acidic residue may converge on the same Ca2+ or may be shared by the two Ca2+. Indications that the proximal Ca2+ may be independently influenced by the Glu309 → Gln mutation (21.Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that Glu309 contributes both oxygen functions to the proximal Ca2+ as shown in model 1 of Fig. 10. Both oxygens of Glu771 may then be approximated to the distal Ca2+ as proposed by Andersen and Vilsen (16.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to provide adequate distribution of charge. Approximation of Thr799 to the distal Ca2+ then places Asp800 in a position to share the two side chain oxygens with the proximal and distal Ca2+, thereby contributing binding cooperativity. Finally, we place one of the Glu908 oxygens near the proximal Ca2+ since the different effects of mutation of this residue to Gln or Ala indicate that only one oxygen participates in Ca2+ binding (see “Results”). Model 1 in Fig. 10 is not the only one that is consistent with the experimental results. For instance, it is possible to reposition the helices longitudinally so that Glu309 could bind the distal Ca2+ and Glu771 the proximal Ca2+, everything else remaining the same (model 2 in Fig. 10). To accommodate the five residues while excluding Asn796, we found it sterically convenient to alternate the four transmembrane helices as shown in Fig. 10. In the models the five binding residues were positioned to approximate their oxygen ligands within 2.6 Å of one or both calcium ions. Additional oxygens may be contributed by coordinated water. Although the arrangements in Fig. 10 are speculative, the important question that they answer is whether the oxygen functions singled out by mutational analysis can generate discrete areas of high binding potential for Ca2+ and if such areas are unique in the transmembrane helical cluster. To this aim, we subjected the two models to analysis of structural coordinates to obtain valence maps, using the algorithm of Nayal and Di Cera(22.Nayal M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which is a consistent predictor of Ca2+ binding sites in proteins of known structure. Analysis of the entire model generates two distinct areas with valence points of 1.4 or higher, i.e. a high probability for binding Ca2+. The two areas are shown in Fig. 10, A-D, as cluster of dots. No other site of high valence is present throughout the four clustered helices, consistent with the results of extensive mutational work on the four helices(23.Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 121Google Scholar, 24.Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The experimental observations discussed above indicate that five amino acids in the transmembrane region sustain short range functions as they participate directly in Ca2+ binding. In addition, several mutations within the four transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 result in inhibition of Ca2+ uptake with little or no inhibition of hydrolytic activity. A similar uncoupling effect was first reported by Andersen (25.Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) regarding the mutation Tyr763 → Gly. We found that the effect of the Tyr763 → Gly mutation is not unique but is also produced by several other mutations in the transmembrane region (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Inspection of TABLE 1, TABLE 2, in the light of the structural model, indicates that pronounced uncoupling is produced by mutations of amino acids with side chains exiting helices M4 or M5 from their outer and lateral surfaces, thereby interacting with the lipid bilayer and/or other components of the transmembrane cluster. Therefore, the uncoupling effects of these mutations are likely to be produced by local interference with proper packing of the helices and optimal flux of Ca2+ during active transport. These observations provide a cogent argument for the functional role of the transmembrane channel resulting from the four clustered helices and explain the effects of various hydrophobic compounds on Ca2+ fluxes through the ATPase(26.De Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5736-5742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of special interest are the mutations of Lys297, including Lys297 → Gly, which interferes with ATPase assembly and expression, Lys297 → Met and Lys297 → Phe producing strong functional inhibition, and Lys297 → Arg and Lys297 → Glu producing little or no inhibition (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). In the model, Lys297 places its charge at the distal end of the M4 segment, facing the lumenal end of the channel. In fact, Lys297 provides the only positive charge within the channel. It is apparent then that the presence of a highly polar moiety in this position is required to stabilize the channel structure. The important role of this stabilization is demonstrated by the interference with ATPase expression produced by replacement of Lys297 with the much less restrictive Gly, which may break propagation of the M4 helix during protein assembly(27.Aurora R. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Science. 1995; 264: 1126-1130Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the functional inhibition produced by Lys297 replacement with Met or Phe and the lack of inhibition by Lys297 replacement with Arg or even with Glu indicate that intrusion of a net charge (positive or negative) at the distal end of the channel seals the lumen and prevents flux of Ca2+. This suggests to us that the M4 helix may rotate (and possibly be displaced distally so that Lys297 can reach the membrane interface with water) in synchrony with ATPase phosphorylation to allow exit of transported Ca2+ into the lumen. In previous studies (1.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 14.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12682-12689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it was shown that structural perturbations in the transmembrane region interfere with Ca2+ binding and prevent Ca2+ activation of the enzyme reaction with ATP, as well as Ca2+ inhibition of the enzyme reaction with Pi. These findings suggested a long range functional linkage between the Ca2+ binding site within the transmembrane region and the catalytic site in the extramembranous region(30.Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Kirtley M.E. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 185-215Google Scholar). We now find the following. (a) Mutations of residues that are normally involved in Ca2+ binding affect the catalytic site (i.e. the Pi reaction) even in the absence of Ca2+. In fact, mutations Glu309 → Gln, Glu771 → Gln, and Asp800 → Asn increase the equilibrium level of the phosphoenzyme obtained with Pi (in the absence of Ca2+) through a drastic reduction of its breakdown kinetics (Fig. 8 and Table 3). An analogous finding was reported by Andersen (25.Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) regarding mutation of Glu771 to Ala or Gly. Therefore, specific mutations in the transmembrane region produce long range conformational effects favoring phosphorylation of the catalytic site with Pi. This suggests that the acidic functions of these residues sustain a very important structural role possibly through hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues in the absence of Ca2+, in addition to participating in cooperative coordination in the presence of Ca2+. Note that Glu908 does not sustain this function since its carbonyl oxygen, but not its carboxyl function, is required for Ca2+ coordination. (b) Mutations of neighboring residues that are not involved in Ca2+ binding interfere with catalytic activity both in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+. A specific case, in this regard, is Asn796 whose mutation to Ala produced total inhibition of Ca2+ uptake, ATPase activity, and phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+, as well as slow decay of the phosphoenzyme obtained by utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (Table 3 and Fig. 8). It is then apparent that Asn796 sustains a very important role in stabilization of the native enzyme conformation, possibly through involvement of its side chain oxygen or amino group in hydrogen bonding. In several other mutants (Table 2), an inhibitory effect is primarily manifested with a slow decay of the phosphorylated intermediate formed by utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, in the absence of Ca2+, the inhibition manifests itself with a slow decay of the phosphoenzyme formed by utilization of Pi (e.g. Val300 → Ala, Cys774 → Ala, Ile775 → Ala; Table 2). These experimental observations demonstrate that the long range linkage between the Ca2+ binding domain and the catalytic site is not necessarily dependent on Ca2+ but is rather an intrinsic feature of the protein structure. It is clear that both the energy transduction mechanism and kinetic regulation of the Ca2+ ATPase are not only related to the organic chemistry of the catalytic site, but are strongly dependent on extended features of protein conformation. We are indebted to Professor Enrico Di Cera for supplying the valence mapping program."

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5.Setyono B. Greenburg J.R.

Subsequent isolation and disruption of the Pabp gene (PAB1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that yeast Pabp is essential for cell viability, suggesting that the critical role of Pabp involves its binding interaction with mRNA poly(A) tails(8.Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for conveying the major function or functions of Pabp is unknown. poly(A)-binding protein untranslated region RNA binding domain. Several studies in vitro suggested that Pabp acts in concert with the poly(A) tail to enhance the translational efficiency of mRNA. For example, experiments in rabbit reticulocyte lysates showed that while excess poly(A) can inhibit translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNA, purified Pabp added in trans can reverse the inhibition(10.Jacobson A. Favreau M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6353-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11.Lemay G. Milward S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12.Grossi de Sa M.F. Standart N. Martins de Sa C. Akhayat O. Huesca M. Scherrer K. Eur J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these results also led to a model suggesting an interaction between the 5′ and 3′ termini of mRNA because the effect of added poly(A) and Pabp was cap-dependent(13.Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The function of S. cerevisiae Pabp in vivo was initially assessed by utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele of PAB1 (pab1-f364l), which at the non-permissive temperature resulted in a translation defect in addition to yielding longer than average poly(A) tails(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, the resultant lethality could be suppressed by a mutation (spb2) in ribosomal protein L46 (Rpl46) without restoration of normal poly(A) tail lengths(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This genetic result led to the appealing suggestion that the Pabp and the 60 S ribosome (perhaps via Rpl46) interact, thereby implicating a role for Pabp in translation initiation. Taken together, these studies supported a model in which the Pabp facilitates translation by improving the re-initiation efficiency of a terminating ribosome in cis via interaction with the poly(A) tail. Pabp from Xenopus laevis was also shown to be associated with translational activity during frog development(15.Zelus B.D. Giebelhaus D.H. Eib D.W. Kenner K.A. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analyses, beginning with stage VI oocytes and ending at the tadpole stage, revealed an increased synthesis of Pabp mRNA and protein that paralleled an increase in poly(A) content, even though total mRNA synthesis decreased during this time. In addition, Pabp was preferentially found in tissues with active protein synthesis, thereby supporting earlier observations that both poly(A) and Pabp are associated with the translational apparatus. Interestingly, Pabp levels are extremely low prior to, and during oocyte maturation, a time when discrimination between poly(A)- and poly(A)+ mRNAs plays a key role in regulating maternal mRNA translation (15.Zelus B.D. Giebelhaus D.H. Eib D.W. Kenner K.A. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The limited amount of Pabp present during this time could amplify the relative translational advantage of poly(A)+ compared to poly(A)- mRNAs if Pabp played a key role in initiation. Analysis of Pabp amino acid sequences from both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms revealed a highly homologous N terminus containing four RNA binding domains (I, II, III, and IV), each approximately 90-200 amino acids long and containing both RNP I- and II-type RNA recognition motifs (reviewed in (16.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 256: 615-621Crossref Scopus (1728) Google Scholar)). Extensive analyses using truncated Pabp peptides containing individual and/or combinations of RNA binding domains revealed that the domains do not harbor redundant functions as shown by differential binding to homoribopolymers and by the ability for specific domains to rescue the lethality of a PAB1 chromosomal deletion(9.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17.Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18.Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Curiously, individual domains are more closely related to the corresponding domain among different organisms than to the remaining domains from the same protein supporting the notion that each domain has evolved distinct functions. In yeast, only domain IV can maintain viability, but it has relatively low specificity for binding to poly(A) (9.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 18.Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); in fact, domains I and II, together, generate the greatest specificity and affinity for poly(A) under physiological salt conditions (~100 mM NaCl or KCl), yet are dispensable for cell growth(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18.Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, the temperature-sensitive PAB1 allele, pab1-f364l, actually encodes a truncated, 66-amino acid peptide containing only a mutated domain IV and C-terminal residues, and as such lacks the strong poly(A) binding capability(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Suppression of this allelic variant by a 60 S ribosomal protein (Rpl46) may therefore establish a critical involvement of Pabp in the translational apparatus, independent of a role in binding poly(A) tails(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we showed that poly(A)-deficient mRNA was efficiently translated in vivo after inactivation of poly(A) polymerase activity in a temperature-sensitive pap1-1 strain of S. cerevisiae(19.Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20.Proweller A. Butler J.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggested that poly(A) tails are not required for efficient translation under these conditions and thereby questioned the necessity for a Pabp-poly(A) tail interaction to facilitate translation. In this report, we present evidence that the Pabp of the yeast S. cerevisiae remains associated with polyribosomes in the presence or absence of polyadenylated mRNA in vivo. Furthermore, the non-lethal deletion of RPL46 does not alter the amount nor ribosomal association of Pabp along polyribosome gradients. Taken together, these findings suggest that the essential function of Pabp might not be exerted via direct interactions with poly(A) tails nor Rpl46, adding further complexity to the mechanism of Pabp action. The apparent association of Pabp with ribosomes suggests an undetermined mechanism whereby Pabp might directly interact with another ribosomal protein, a ribosome-associated protein, or with rRNA. The experiments reported here were carried out in the following strains: T481 (MATa, ura3-52, ade2-101, lys2-801) and UR31481B (MATa, ade1/ade2, lys2, gal1?, ura3-52, pap1-1). Construction of T481 and UR31481B strains harboring a chromosomal knockout of ribosomal protein L46 (rpl46) was done by electrotransformation of haploid cells with a BglII-EcoRI deletion fragment from pAS195 containing the URA3 marker flanked by RPL46 sequence. The resultant URA+ transformants were screened for cold sensitivity, and subsequent polyribosome profile analysis (see below) revealed the expected phenotype showing a decreased ratio of 60 S to 40 S subunits(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). All strains were propagated in YEPD media. Cells were grown to A600 between 1 and 5, and 40 units were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C. Pellets were washed in 0.2 ml of ice-cold water and finally resuspended in chilled 0.4 ml of disruption buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 300 mM ammonium sulfate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/ml chymostatin, and 50 ng/ml leupeptin). Approximately 0.2 ml of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added, followed by 5 cycles of vortexing for 45 s intermittent with 30 s on ice. The sample was spun for 30 s, and the supernatant transferred to a new tube followed by centrifugation for 15 min (4°C) at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70°C before use. Polyribosome lysates were prepared as described by Proweller and Butler(20.Proweller A. Butler J.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Twenty-five A254 units were layered on sucrose gradients (15-50%) prepared with 1 × (low salt) polysome buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 70 mM NH4OAc, 4 mM Mg(OAc)2) and sedimented by ultracentrifugation for 2.5 h (4°C) at 40,000 rpm using a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman). For high salt experiments, 0.25 volume of 2.5 M KCl was added to the lysate and incubated for 45 min (4°C) prior to layering on sucrose gradients (15-50%) prepared with 1 × (high salt) polysome buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 800 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2) (21.Martin T.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1973; 80: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and centrifuged as above. Where indicated, EDTA was added to 60 mM or RNase A (Sigma) to 0.3 mg/ml, followed by incubation for 45 min (4°C) prior to layering on low salt sucrose gradients with centrifugation as before. Polyribosome profiles were obtained by measuring A254 absorbance through an ISCO model UA-5 absorbance/fluorescence monitor. Twenty 0.6-ml fractions were collected per gradient and trichloroacetic acid added to 12.5%. Proteins precipitated overnight at −20°C, followed by centrifugation. Pellets were washed twice in ice-cold acetone, dried in vacuo, and resuspended in 70 μl of 1 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer prior to use. Isolation of RNA from polyribosome gradient fractions (20 0.6-ml fractions/gradient) and subsequent ribonuclease protection analysis were carried out as described previously(20.Proweller A. Butler J.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Equal volumes (35 μl) per polyribosome gradient fraction or equivalent A280 units of total cell protein lysates were resolved by 13% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by standard methods. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with 1% gelatin. For antigen detection, the primary antibody solution contained a 1:2500 dilution of IG1 monoclonal antibody against the yeast Pabp (kindly provided by M. Swanson, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) or a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal antibody against Tcm1p (kindly provided by J. Warner, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Primary antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h, followed by membrane washing and a 1-h incubation of a goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (H&)-fluorescein (Life Technologies, Inc.) secondary antibody. Signal was obtained following fluorochrome excitation using a Molecular Dynamics FluorImager 575, and all image and data analysis was done using ImageQuant software. For further signal amplification, we employed a third antibody against fluorescein, which was conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (anti-fluorescein AP conjugate, Amersham Corp.). Following a 1-h incubation with this antibody, Attophos(™) fluorescent substrate was added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vistra fluorescent Western blotting kit, Amersham), and the protein was visualized and quantitated as described above. The current model for Pabp function depicts the protein in a RNP complex, linking mRNA to ribosomes by binding to poly(A) tails and by binding to the 60 S ribosomal subunit through contact with ribosomal protein L46 (Rpl46) (reviewed by Jacobson in (22.Jacobson A. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 451-480Google Scholar)). Such interactions are predicted to enhance the rate of re-initiation of ribosomes in cis, thereby increasing the translational efficiency of a mRNA molecule. To test various features of this model, we considered a series of experiments that measure relative cellular and polyribosome-associated Pabp by monitoring its sedimentation profile in polyribosome gradients from S. cerevisiae deficient in poly(A) and/or Rpl46. In an early characterization of the Pabp of S. cerevisiae, it was predicted that the concentration of Pabp might be autoregulated at the translational level by the capacity for Pabp to bind A-rich sequences within the PAB1 mRNA 5′-untranslated region(9.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Presumably, under conditions where Pabp is in excess of poly(A) tail substrate, the protein would bind to its 5′-untranslated region inhibiting further synthesis. Indeed, Pabp represses translation of its own mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in a manner dependent on its own poly(A)-rich 5′-untranslated region(23.de Melo Neto O.P. Standart N. Martins de Sa C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that, when a yeast strain harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of poly(A) polymerase (pap1-1) is shifted to the non-permissive temperature (35°C) for 1 h, there is an 80% loss in poly(A) content as well as a 2-fold reduction in mRNA levels(20.Proweller A. Butler J.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we predicted that the loss of mRNA or poly(A) content might result in a reduction in total Pabp levels if an autoregulatory mechanism operates. We performed an initial experiment to determine the fate of Pabp levels under conditions where both mRNA and poly(A) were differentially reduced. Total cellular protein was isolated from strains containing either a normal (PAP1) or mutant (pap1-1) allele of poly(A) polymerase during growth at 25°C and after a 1-h shift to 35°C. Proteins were separated by 13% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. To quantitate the relative amount of Pabp under these conditions, the blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody against yeast Pabp followed by a fluorochrome-conjugated, anti-IgG secondary antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) to visualize the protein (Fig. 1). To control for loading errors, we included a primary antibody against the 60 S ribosomal protein L3 (Tcm1p), which was also visualized by the same fluorochrome-conjugated, anti-IgG secondary antibody. Relative amounts of Pabp were calculated by ImageQuant software after scanning the blots in a FluorImager-575(™) (Molecular Dynamics). The results of a typical experiment shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 indicate that inactivation of poly(A) polymerase and the ensuing loss of poly(A) from the cell have little impact on the total level of Pabp.TABLE 1TABLE 1 We also monitored Pabp levels in a strain containing a deletion of RPL46, since a mutation (spb2) in this non-essential gene suppresses the lethality of a yeast strain containing a mutant Pabp(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This suggested that Pabp might functionally interact with Rpl46 and that a chromosomal deletion of RPL46 might alter total steady-state Pabp levels by disrupting an important functional binding interaction. Such disruption might lead to a large pool of dispensable Pabp whose degradation or autoregulation leads to a new steady-state amount of protein. We constructed PAP1 and pap1-1 strains harboring a deletion of RPL46 by replacement of the chromosomal allele with one containing a URA3 disruption (see “Experimental Procedures”). The deletion results in a cold-sensitive growth phenotype and reduces the normal ratio of 60 S to 40 S ribosomal subunits (see below). Protein lysates from the deletion strains (PAP1, rpl46 and pap1-1, rpl46) were prepared as above and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the relative amounts of Pabp in RPL46 deletion strains grown at 25°C and after shifting to 35°C for 1 h and indicates that Pabp levels do not change significantly, even in the absence of Rpl46. In addition, we also measured relative amounts of the 60 S ribosomal protein, Tcm1p, and found a decrease in its level in RPL46 deletion strains, consistent with a response to a reduction in 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly as observed by deletions of other large subunit ribosomal proteins(24.Moritz M. Paulovich A.G. Tsay Y. Woolford Jr., J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 3: 2261-2274Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25.Moritz M. Pulaski B.A. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5681-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that sudden reductions in poly(A) content or the absence of Rpl46 do not significantly alter total levels of Pabp. Although total cellular Pabp levels remain unchanged in the absence of poly(A) tails, a more significant measure of Pabp's functional activity might result from an investigation of the levels of this protein associated with polyribosomes under conditions that alter the content of poly(A). As mentioned above, when pap1-1 cells are shifted to the non-permissive temperature (35°C) for 1 h, poly(A) content decreases by 80% and mRNA levels fall by 50%. Therefore, we predicted that if Pabp binds primarily to poly(A) or other mRNA sequences, then the amount of polyribosome-associated Pabp might be reduced by 80% or 50%, respectively, in shifted pap1-1 cells. Polyribosome lysates from wild-type (PAP1) and pap1-1 cells grown at both 25°C and 35°C were fractionated after sedimentation on low salt sucrose gradients generating the polyribosome profiles shown in Fig. 2. Protein isolated from each fraction was separated by 13% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blot. The relative amount of Pabp was visualized by anti-Pabp monoclonal antibody coupled to a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 3). The amount of Pabp associated with polyribosomes in PAP1 cells grown at 25°C or 35°C, or in a pap1-1 strain grown at 25°C, was similar (Table 2). Surprisingly, the 80% loss of poly(A) measured in pap1-1 cells shifted to 35°C did not result in a significant reduction in Pabp found in polyribosomes (Table 2). These findings suggest that Pabp might potentially interact with ribosomes or with mRNA sequences in addition to the poly(A) tail.Figure 3:Distribution of Pabp in polyribosome gradients from pap1-1 and rpl46 strains grown at 25°C and 35°C. Proteins in fractions from the gradients shown in Fig. 2 were separated and detected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The direction of sedimentation is from right to left. Fractions 11 and 12 and fractions 8 and 10 from pap1-1, rpl46 (35°C) and PAP1, rpl46 (25°C), respectively, were lost during sample preparation. Corresponding values for Table 3 were derived from additional Western blots of these strains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE 2TABLE 2 The apparent requirement for Pabp in translation initiation might be bypassed by alterations in 60 S ribosomal subunits since one suppressor (spb2) of a defective Pabp is a mutant form of RPL46(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To test the dependence on Rpl46 for Pabp-ribosome association, we utilized the PAP1 and pap1-1 strains harboring the deletion of RPL46. As discussed previously, the resultant strains exhibit cold sensitivity as well as a decreased ratio of 60 S to 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2; (14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)). Examination of polyribosome profiles obtained from cell lysates harvested at 25°C reveals a decrease in the number of large polyribosomes and an increase in the number of small polyribosomes (Fig. 2). This apparent change in polyribosome density results most likely from a decrease in the number of 60 S subunits available for 40 S subunit joining caused by the deletion of RPL46(14.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The polyribosome profiles appear to reveal an interesting difference between the polyribosome density after shift of pap1-1 to 35°C, depending on the presence or absence of Rpl46. The possible significance of this difference will be treated elsewhere. 2A. Proweller and J. S. Butler, manuscript in preparation. To determine the impact of a deletion of RPL46 on the levels of polyribosome-associated Pabp, we fractionated polyribosome lysates obtained from PAP1, RPL46; PAP1, rpl46; pap1-1, RPL46; and pap1-1, rpl46 strains grown either at 25°C or following a 1-h shift to 35°C. Again, proteins from each fraction were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of Pabp along the polyribosome gradients of each strain. We find that a deletion of RPL46 does not change the relative amount of polyribosome-associated Pabp (Table 2); however, there is shift in Pabp distribution coincident with the redistribution of polyribosomes due to the translation initiation defect seen in PAP1, rpl46 and pap1-1, rpl46 strains at 25°C. At 35°C in a pap1-1, rpl46 strain, the Pabp and polyribosome distributions are restored to that observed in strains with a normal RPL46 allele present, paralleling the restoration of a normal ratio of mRNA to ribosomes (Fig. 2). These data indicate that Pabp sediments in association with polyribosomes in the absence of Rpl46. Our experiments thus far support the conclusion that Pabp sediments along low salt sucrose gradients as a protein component of active polyribosomes and not as a homogeneous aggregate that may be engaged nonspecifically with RNA. To further clarify the apparent interaction between Pabp and polyribosomes, we treated identical poly(A)-deficient polyribosome lysates from pap1-1, rpl46 cells incubated at 35°C for 1 h with various agents known to differentially disrupt polyribosome complexes. We employed three types of established chemical treatments. First, treatment of the lysate with high salt (0.5 M KCl) does not alter the salt-resistant polyribosome complexes (data not shown), but can release associated factors by disrupting relatively weak ionic interactions(21.Martin T.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1973; 80: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, treatment with RNase A results in hydrolysis of RNA in polyribosomes, thereby releasing 80 S couples together with their associated factors. Finally, incubation of lysates with EDTA releases ribosomal subunits from mRNA and possibly disrupts other Mg2+-dependent protein interactions(13.Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Treated lysates were fractionated on sucrose gradients and protein fractions separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. For Western blotting, we again employed the anti-Pabp antibody used in previous experiments as well as the antibody against ribosomal protein L3 (Tcm1p) to monitor the sedimentation behavior of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Fig. 4A shows the results of these treatments on the sedimentation pattern of Pabp and Tcm1p in a pap1-1, rpl46 strain shifted to 35° for 1 h. The results show that inclusion of EDTA releases polyribosome-associated Pabp causing about half of the released Pabp to sediment with ribosomal subunits, while the remaining released Pabp sediments at the top of the gradient (Fig. 4A and Fig. 5, Table 3). This contrasts with the effect of high salt and RNase A treatment, each of which releases Pabp to the lightest, ribosome-free portions of the gradie"

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We reported previously the molecular cloning of two distinct rabbit GRO cDNA homologues from LPS-stimulated AM (RabGRO and rabbit permeability factor-2 or RPF2)(15.Johnson II, M.C. Goodman R.B. Kajikawa O. Wong V.A. Mongovin S.M. Martin T.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Of the two transcripts, RabGRO was the predominant AM-derived GRO homologue. We now report the expression in Escherichia coli of bioactive recombinant RabGRO protein (rRabGRO) and the development of a sensitive and specific RabGRO immunoassay. Using this assay, we have found that rabbit AM secrete native GRO protein in vitro in response to stimulation with a spectrum of biologically relevant agonists. We also report that biologically significant quantities of GRO protein are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of rabbits with acute bacterial pneumonia and identify the sites of GRO mRNA expression in the lungs. These data suggest that GRO chemokines make important contributions to acute inflammatory responses in the lungs. The coding sequence for mature RabGRO protein (219 base pairs, 72 amino acids) (15.Johnson II, M.C. Goodman R.B. Kajikawa O. Wong V.A. Mongovin S.M. Martin T.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was amplified from LPS-stimulated rabbit AM mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques using a 5′-primer with a BamHI restriction enzyme site (5′-CGGGATCCCGCGCTCACCGAGC-3′) and a 3′-primer with a BglII restriction enzyme site (5′-GAAGATCTTCCTCCTTTCCCAGG-3′). The primer sequences written in boldface correspond to base pairs coding for RabGRO. The RabGRO polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by sequencing and directionally cloned into the expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA). The pRSET vector encodes a fusion protein that contains an N-terminal fusion peptide sequence with polyhistidine residues for Ni2+ affinity column purification of the fusion protein and an enterokinase cleavage site for removal of the fusion peptide sequence to generate the mature recombinant protein. The transformants were cultured in the presence of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and M13/T7 bacteriophage to provide the T7 RNA polymerase required for transcription of the rRabGRO fusion protein (rRabGRO-fp) mRNA. After induction for 10 h, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mM PBS, pH 7.8, with lysozyme (100 μg/ml, Sigma) and then incubated on ice for 15 min with 10 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed at 37°C three times in succession. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against PBS, pH 7.8 (Mr 1000 limit membrane, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Following dialysis, the supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-activated resin and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was then washed with PBS at pH 7.8, 6.0, and 5.0 and then packed into a column. The rRabGRO-fp was eluted from the column in 1.0-ml fractions by rinsing with PBS at pH 2.0. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing rRabGRO-fp were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mM NaCl overnight. The rRabGRO-fp was incubated overnight with enterokinase (Biozyme, South Wales, United Kingdom) at a concentration of 1 unit/μg fusion protein in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 10 mM CaCl2 to cleave the fusion peptide sequence. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a C4 column (Dynamax-300A, Rainin Co., Emeryville, CA) and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a 5-95% acetonitrile gradient. The resulting HPLC peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation with a 475 Å pulse liquid protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific pathogen free female New Zealand White rabbits weighing approximately 3.0-3.5 kg (Western Oregon Rabbit Co., Philomath, OR) and 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, CA) were housed in the Seattle Veterans Affair Medical Center vivarium prior to all experiments. A female goat was purchased locally and housed at the University of Washington vivarium. Rabbit AM were recovered by whole lung lavage as described previously(16.Martin T.R. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Let'urcq D.J. Moriarty A.M. Maunder R.J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rabbit and human neutrophils were recovered from heparinized venous blood using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Mono-Poly resolving medium, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). The cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended at the indicated concentrations for chemotaxis or immunoprecipitation studies. Rabbit and human neutrophil chemotaxis to rRabGRO was measured by the modified Boyden method using 48-well microchemotaxis chambers and nitrocellulose membranes with 3.0-μm pores for neutrophils as described(17.Falk W. Goodwin R.H.J. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The samples were diluted with PBS, and 25 μl of each sample were added to the bottom well. Controls included 10% zymosan-activated human or rabbit serum (ZAS, positive control) or PBS alone (negative control). Neutrophils were added to the top wells, and the chambers were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 and humidified air. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and chemotaxis was measured as the total number of leukocytes migrating through the filters in 10 consecutive high power microscopic fields. Results were expressed as percent maximal chemotaxis, in which the average number of leukocytes migrating toward PBS for each chamber was subtracted from each measurement (including ZAS) and then each measurement was divided by the adjusted value for ZAS. The value for ZAS was set as 100% maximal chemotaxis. Results are reported as mean ± S.E. To test the bioactivity of rRabGRO in the lung, 1.0 μg of LPS-free protein in 1.0 ml sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% NaCl (approximately 10-7M solution) was instilled into the right lung of an anesthetized rabbit through an intratracheal catheter directed toward the right mainstem bronchus. For comparison, another rabbit was treated with 0.9% NaCl alone. The catheters were removed immediately following the instillations, and the animals were closely monitored to ensure adequate recovery from the procedure. The rabbits were euthanized 4 h later with pentobarbital, and selective right lung lavage was performed to obtain BALF for total and differential cell counts using methods as described(16.Martin T.R. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Let'urcq D.J. Moriarty A.M. Maunder R.J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A female goat was immunized with successive doses of rRabGRO-fp. Polyclonal goat IgG was purified from serum using protein G columns (Pierce), and a portion was biotinylated (Pierce). The specificity of the goat antisera was tested by Western blotting using biotinylated goat anti-RabGRO IgG or biotinylated nonimmune IgG and recombinant rabbit IL-8, rabbit monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)(18.Kajikawa O. Goodman R.B. Mongovin S.M. Wong V.A. Martin T.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: A751Google Scholar), recombinant human GRO-α (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and rRabGRO protein. Rabbit AM (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 24-well plates containing 1 ml of labeling medium containing 250 μCi of [35S]Cys (DuPont NEN). The cells were then stimulated by adding one of the following agents: LPS (E. coli, serotype 0111:B4, 10 μg/ml), intact or heat-inactivated human TNF-α (500 units/ml, R & D Systems), concanavalin A (ConA, 5 μg/ml), heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA, 1 × 108 bacteria/ml), crystalline silica (α-quartz, 100 μg/ml SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3, μg/ml), or media alone for an additional 19 h at 37°C. The supernatant from each well was collected and diluted 1:2 with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and then incubated with goat IgG coupled to protein G-agarose resin (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH, Germany) for 24 h at 4°C. The protein-IgG-protein G-agarose resin complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. The resulting protein mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography with quantitative phosphorimaging(19.Johnston R.F. Pickett S.C. Barker D.L. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was constructed using goat polyclonal anti-rRabGRO IgG as both the capturing and detecting antibody. After coating and overnight incubation at 4°C with nonbiotinylated immune goat IgG (1:350 dilution), microtiter plates were blocked with 10% non-fat milk for 1 h at 37°C. The blocking buffer was removed, samples and standards (serial dilutions of rRabGRO protein) were added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing four times, biotinylated immune goat IgG (1:800 dilution) was added to the plates and they were again incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The chromogen 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the optical density (A450) in each well was measured using a microtiter plate reader (Dynatech Co., Chantilly, VA). Based on a standard curve generated with rRabGRO protein, the lower limit of detection for the ELISA was 22 pg/ml. There was no cross-reactivity with either recombinant rabbit IL-8 or recombinant rabbit MCP-1 at concentrations varying from 10 pg/ml to 1 mg/ml in spiked rabbit BALF samples. For statistical analysis, undetectable GRO levels were assigned a value of 11 pg/ml (one-half the limit of detection of the assay). Rabbit AM (1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) were incubated with either LPS, intact or heat-inactivated human TNF-α (500 units/ml), ConA (5 μg/ml), HKSA (1 × 108 bacteria/ml), SiO2 (100 μg/ml), Al2O3 (100 μg/ml), or rabbit interferon-γ (INF-γ, 500 units/ml, Genentech, San Francisco, CA), or 0.9% NaCl (10 μl/ml) for 2, 6, or 20 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. To minimize adherence, the incubations were performed in gently agitated polypropylene tubes. After incubation, the cell supernatants were removed, clarified by centrifugation, and the levels of GRO protein were measured by ELISA. Anesthetized rabbits were treated with either a 1.0 ml bolus of 2 × 1010 colony-stimulating factor E. coli (serotype K1) in sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% NaCl (n = 8) or NaCl alone (n = 8) through an intratracheal catheter directed toward the right mainstem bronchus. The animals were euthanized 4 or 24 h later, and selective right lung lavage was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts and differentials were calculated and GRO protein levels were measured by ELISA. In situ hybridization was performed on right lung tissue from rabbits treated with endobronchial E. coli (1 × 109 colony-stimulating factor) and sacrificed after 4 h as described above. Lung tissue samples were frozen in liquid Freon® and placed in O.C.T. Compound (Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN). The embedded samples were then sectioned (9-μm slices) and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides (Fisher). After treatment with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, the slides were dehydrated with graded ethanol rinses. Antisense and sense (base pairs 111-140(15.Johnson II, M.C. Goodman R.B. Kajikawa O. Wong V.A. Mongovin S.M. Martin T.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) RabGRO cDNA probes were made by end labeling synthesized oligonucleotides with 35S-dATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (DuPont). The specificity of the probe for rabbit GRO cDNA was confirmed by the absence of hybridization signals with rabbit IL-8, IL-1, and TNF-α cDNA on Southern blots (data not shown). Hybridization was performed at 48°C overnight by incubating each slide in a buffer containing 50% formamide and 1 × 106 cpm antisense or sense (negative control) RabGRO cDNA. Post-hybridization washings were performed twice in 1 × standard saline citrate solution at 66°C for 30 min and once at room temperature for 1 h. The slides were then dehydrated with successive ethanol rinses and dipped into warmed Kodak NTB2 emulsion solution (Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiographic analysis. After exposure for 9 days at 4°C, the slides were developed, fixed, counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin, and visualized by light microscopy. The coding sequence for mature RabGRO was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pRSET expression vector. After confirming the sequence for the RabGRO cDNA, the recombinant protein was expressed in JM109 E. coli and purified from bacterial lysates by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Analysis by SDS-PAGE confirmed that the purified protein was of the expected size for rRabGRO-fp (approximately 14,000 kDa) (Fig. 1A). The rRabGRO-fp was then treated with enterokinase, and the products were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1B). The HPLC peak labeled “rRabGRO” was found to contain mature rRabGRO of the expected sequence as determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The chemotactic activity of rRabGRO was tested in vitro using rabbit and human neutrophils. For comparison, recombinant human GRO-α (R & D Systems) was also tested. Recombinant RabGRO protein stimulated chemotaxis of rabbit neutrophils at concentrations as low as 3 × 10-10M, with maximal activity at approximately 10-7M and a decline in activity at 10-6M (Fig. 2A). In contrast, rRabGRO had little chemotactic activity for human neutrophils over the same concentration range. Similarly, human GRO-α showed no significant chemotactic activity for rabbit neutrophils, despite being chemotactically active for human neutrophils (Fig. 2B). To assess in vivo bioactivity, rRabGRO was instilled endobronchially into a rabbit. This produced a brisk influx of neutrophils into the lung (45% neutrophils in the BALF cell count from the treated lung at 4 h). For comparison, the BALF from the untreated lung in the same rabbit and from the lungs of a rabbit treated with sterile 0.9% NaCl alone contained only 6 and 5% neutrophils, respectively. After isolating total IgG from immune goat serum, the specificity of the anti-rRabGRO IgG was tested by Western analysis using rRabGRO, recombinant rabbit MCP-1, rabbit IL-8 (each produced using similar methods(18.Kajikawa O. Goodman R.B. Mongovin S.M. Wong V.A. Martin T.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: A751Google Scholar)), and recombinant human GRO-α. The anti-rRabGRO IgG reacted strongly with both the fusion protein and the cleaved mature rRabGRO protein (data not shown). Although there was very weak cross-reactivity with human GRO-α, there was no cross-reactivity with either rabbit IL-8 or rabbit MCP-1. The specificity of the goat anti-rRabGRO antibodies for native rabbit GRO protein was further confirmed by RIP (described below). We performed RIP and ELISA measurements of stimulated rabbit AM supernatants to measure the expression of newly synthesized and secreted GRO protein. The immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted using the supernatants of adherent rabbit AM metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine and stimulated for 19 h with a variety of endogenous and exogenous proinflammatory agents. Immunoprecipitation of these supernatants with the goat anti-rRabGRO IgG resulted in a major band of the expected size (approximately 7 kDa) for each stimulus (Fig. 3). Further analysis of the gels by phosphorimaging allowed quantitation of GRO protein in the supernatants. SiO2, Al2O3, LPS, human TNF-α, and HKSA were each strong inducers of GRO secretion, while ConA and heat-inactivated human TNF-α were very weak stimuli. GRO protein was not detected when RIP was performed with nonimmune goat serum. Because adherence alone appeared to be a stimulus for GRO protein production in the RIP studies, we measured GRO levels by ELISA using the supernatants of rabbit AM cultured in polypropylene tubes which were periodically agitated. These results showed significant time- and stimulus-dependent differences in the accumulation of GRO protein in the supernatants of relatively nonadherent AM (Fig. 4). In response to stimulation by HKSA and LPS, significant amounts of extracellular GRO were detected after only 2 h of incubation. For HKSA, GRO increased steadily and was maximal by 20 h of incubation. For LPS, maximal amounts of GRO were detected at 4 h of incubation and the concentration failed to increase further at 20 h. Incubation with SiO2 caused the secretion of relatively small amounts of GRO protein during the first 6 h, but relatively high concentrations of GRO were present in the supernatants at 20 h. Stimulation with ConA and Al2O3 did not result in significant secretion of GRO when compared with incubation with 0.9% NaCl (negative control). Likewise, human TNF-α and rabbit IFN-γ (both intact and heat-inactivated) failed to stimulate increased amounts of GRO in the supernatants of nonadherent AM (data for heat-inactivated proteins not shown). Significantly increased amounts of GRO protein were detected in the BALF of rabbits treated with endobronchial E. coli when compared with rabbits treated with NaCl alone at both 4 and 24 h (p < 0.03 by unpaired t tests for both groups) (Table 1). There was also a significant increase in the number and percentage of neutrophils in the E. coli-treated animal BALF at both 4 and 24 h when compared with the NaCl-treated animals (p < 0.0001 for both groups) and a significant positive relationship between GRO protein levels and the number and percentage of BALF neutrophils (r = 0.82, p < 0.001 for BALF total neutrophils versus BALF GRO concentration).TABLE 1 To better define which lung cells in the lung express GRO mRNA in acute pulmonary inflammation, we used in situ hybridization techniques to localize GRO mRNA in lung tissue from rabbits with E. coli pneumonia. Hybridization signals with the RabGRO antisense probe were detected in bronchial epithelial cells and in inflammatory cells in the lung parenchyma around the airways (Fig. 5, A and C). The tissue inflammatory cells were strongly positive and appeared to be either macrophages or neutrophils infiltrating the peribronchial lung parenchyma. Hybridization with the negative control (sense) RabGRO probe produced virtually no signals (Fig. 5, B and D). Alveolar macrophages are important cellular mediators of pulmonary inflammation, in part due to their ability to elaborate a variety of leukocyte chemotactic factors(20.Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Among these factors, IL-8 is thought by many investigators to be the major neutrophil chemoattractant in the lung(21.Kunkel S.L. Standiford T.J. Kasahara K. Strieter R.M. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, studies using specific antisera to neutralize IL-8 in the supernatants of activated human AM (22.Sylvester I. Rankin J.A. Yoshimura T. Tanaka S. Leonard E.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and BALF from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (23.Miller E.J. Cohen A.B. Nagao S. Griffith D. Maunder R.J. Martin T.R. Weiner-Kronish J.P. Sticherling M. Christophers E. Matthay M.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) suggest that a significant proportion of AM-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity is due to other non-IL-8 chemoattractants. Possible candidates include the GRO subgroup of α-chemokines, which are closely related to IL-8 and are also potent neutrophil chemoattractants and activators(2.Geiser T. Dewald B. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15419-15424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, our goals were: 1) to express recombinant rabbit GRO protein and develop a specific and sensitive ELISA; 2) to investigate GRO protein expression by rabbit AM in response to stimulation with both endogenous and exogenous inflammatory agents; and 3) to determine whether GRO protein and mRNA can be detected in the lung in vivo during the acute inflammatory response that accompanies bacterial pneumonia. In order to generate the species-specific reagents necessary to measure rabbit GRO protein, we first produced rRabGRO as a fusion protein in E. coli. We used a prokaryotic expression system for producing the recombinant protein because GRO proteins have been shown not to undergo post-translational sulfation, glycosylation, or phosphorylation(24.Derynck R. Balentien E. Han J.H. Thomas H.G. Wen D.Z. Samantha A.K. Zachariae C.O. Griffin P.R. Brachmann R. Wong W.L. Matsushima K. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10225-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RabGRO amino acid sequence alignment with all reported full-length GRO homologues demonstrated identities ranging from 41% for 9E3 (chicken GRO homologue) to 78% for human GRO-β (Table 2). Given the high degree of identity with human GRO proteins, it is perhaps surprising that rRabGRO had little chemotactic activity for human neutrophils. However, this confirms previous observations by other investigators that 125I-labeled human GRO-α does not bind to rabbit neutrophils (25.Thomas K.M. Taylor L. Prado G. Romero J. Moser B. Car B. Walz A. Baggiolini M. Navarro J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2496-2500PubMed Google Scholar) and further underscores the necessity of using species-specific reagents when studying α-chemokines(26.Rot A. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).TABLE 2 The rRabGRO-fp proved to be a good immunogen for raising specific goat anti-rabbit GRO polyclonal antibodies, as Western analysis confirmed that the goat antibodies did not cross-react with either rabbit IL-8 or MCP-1. The antibodies did show a small amount of cross-reactivity for recombinant human GRO-α, which is not surprising given the high degree of homology between these proteins (Table 2). As RabGRO and RPF2 are nearly identical at the mature protein level (93% identity), the anti-rRabGRO antibodies are likely to cross-react with RPF2 as well. We have also shown that rabbit AM express and secrete GRO protein in response to stimulation by LPS, TNF-α, SiO2, Al2O3, and HKSA. Adherence and/or culture conditions alone also appear to stimulate GRO expression. Under nonadherent conditions, LPS, HKSA, and SiO2 were the most potent inducers of GRO protein"

We have observed that disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized AChR α-subunits occurs 5-20 min after translation and that this modification can be blocked by dithiothreitol (DTT), a membrane-permeant thiol-reducing agent. DTT treatment was found to arrest AChR α-subunit conformational maturation, assembly, and appearance on the cell surface, showing that these events are dependent on prior formation of disulfide bonds. Subunits prevented from maturation by the reducing agent do not irreversibly misfold or aggregate, since upon removal of DTT, AChR α-subunits undergo formation of disulfide bonds and resume folding, oligomerization, and surface expression. We have previously found that nascent α-subunits form transient complexes with the molecular chaperone calnexin immediately after subunit synthesis (Gelman, M. S., Chang, W., Thomas, D. Y., Bergeron, J. J. M., and Prives, J. M.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 15085-15092) and have now observed that both the formation and the subsequent dissociation of these complexes are unaffected by DTT treatment. Thus, α-subunits appear to dissociate from calnexin independently of their undergoing disulfide bond formation and achieving conformational maturation. This finding together with the absence of irreversible misfolding of DTT-arrested α-subunits suggests that calnexin may act to prevent misfolding by aiding in the initial folding events and is not an essential participant in the late stages of α-subunit maturation.

The extracellular domains of many transmembrane proteins contain intrachain disulfide bonds, which are thought to contribute to the formation and stabilization of their mature conformation (for reviews see (1.Creighton T.E.

This organelle also contains the enzymes that facilitate formation of disulfide bonds and assist in protein folding, including “foldases,” such as protein disulfide isomerase and peptidylprolyl isomerase, and molecular chaperones such as calnexin and BiP(8.Gething M.-J.

In addition, the ER is the site of assembly of most oligomeric membrane and secretory proteins, which exit to the Golgi complex and are transported to the cell surface only after the completion of assembly(12.Hurtley S.M.

The assembly of subunits into pentamers in a precise stoichiometry and order of subunits does not occur immediately upon synthesis of the subunits, but only after a lag period of ∼30 min(17.Merlie J.P.

During this interval AChR subunits undergo post-translational modifications leading to conformational maturation and acquisition of the capacity to assemble(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H.

Conformational maturation has been studied in the α-subunit, which besides its prominence from a stoichiometric standpoint, has binding properties distinct from those of the other subunits. The extracellular domain of each α-subunit contains a region essential for acetylcholine binding, as well as a binding site for the elapid venom neurotoxin α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) and a characteristic sequence termed the main immunogenic region, the epitope for most antibodies made against native AChR(21.Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these sites are initially absent in newly translated α-subunit polypeptides in intact cells(22.Merlie J.P. Sebbane R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3605-3608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), nor are they present in α-subunit polypeptides expressed in a cell-free system(24.Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5598-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In intact cells the toxin binding site and main immunogenic region epitope are acquired by the α-subunit monomers in the interval between biosynthesis and subunit assembly, while the agonist binding sites are not acquired until the assembly of α- with γ- or δ-subunits(23.Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). On this basis the binding of mAb 35, a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes the main immunogenic region(21.Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as acquisition of the ability to bind α-Bgt (25.Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) can be used to monitor the course of α-subunit folding toward conformational maturation. The reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) has played a major role in the molecular characterization of AChR. Before sequence information became available, the presence of disulfide bonds in AChR was first inferred from studies demonstrating that DTT treatment altered functional properties of AChR on the surface of intact electrogenic cells from electric eel(27.Karlin A. Bartels E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 126: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This effect was demonstrated to be due to the in situ reduction of a disulfide bond near the acetylcholine binding site(28.Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 245s-264sCrossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After AChR α-subunit was cloned and sequenced (29.Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Kikyotani S. Furutani Y. Hirose T. Takashima H. Inayama S. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) the precise location of this disulfide bond was determined by the covalent binding of a radioactive affinity alkylating agent to a pair of cysteine residues (Cys192-Cys193) after DTT treatment(30.Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8085-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This disulfide bond is unique to α-subunit: an additional disulfide bond between Cys128 and Cys142, forming a 15-residue loop in the N-terminal extracellular domain, is conserved among all four AChR subunits (30.Kao P.N. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8085-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, interest in DTT has been renewed by the demonstration that it can permeate across cellular membranes and prevent formation of disulfide bonds on nascent proteins in the ER of living cells(31.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 32.Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This approach has been applied to study the contribution of the ER redox environment to the posttranslational processing and intracellular transport of individual disulfide-containing secretory and membrane proteins. Under these conditions DTT blocked disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized proteins without adverse effects on most cellular functions, including ATP synthesis and transport of proteins through the secretory pathway(32.Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33.Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now used this approach to investigate the relationship between disulfide bond formation and AChR subunit folding and assembly in cultured myotubes. [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine protein labeling mix (specific activity 1050-1200 Ci/mmol) and 125I-α-bungarotoxin (specific activity 13-15 mCi/μg) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma. Muscle primary cultures were prepared from breast muscle of 12-day chick embryos and plated on collagen-coated culture dishes (initial density = 6 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish) as described previously(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.O'Neill M. Stockdale F.E. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 2% chick embryo extract at 37°C in an atmosphere of 92% air, 8% CO2. Under these conditions the myoblasts fused to form multinucleated myotubes on the second day after plating, initiated rapid synthesis of AChR on the third day, and were used 3-4 days postplating. Anti-chick AChR α-subunit antibody and anti-chick AChR δ-subunit antibody were raised in rabbits against the individual subunits purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from denervated chick leg muscle and were shown to be non-cross-reactive(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-α-bungarotoxin antibody was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified on α-bungarotoxin-Sepharose(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody mAb 35, which recognizes the main immunogenic region of AChR α-subunit (21.Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated from the supernatant of hybridoma TIB 175 (American Type Culture Collection). Anti-calnexin antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved stretch near the C terminus (amino acids 487-505) of calnexin(35.Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrel G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Wada I. Ou W-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For surface labeling of AChR on intact muscle cells, cultures were washed once with DMEM and incubated with 125I-α-Bgt (10−8 M) in DMEM containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Prives J.M. Fulton A.B. Penman S. Daniels M.P. Christian C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At the end of this period, cultures were washed five times with 3-ml volumes of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound toxin. Surface labeling was quantitated by γ-counting of the cell extracts. For metabolic labeling, cultures were methionine/cysteine-depleted by incubation with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h and then labeled at 37°C with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for the specified time. In the pulse-chase experiments, chase was performed by washing cells once with DMEM, followed by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 5 mML-methionine. Where specified, freshly prepared 5 mM DTT was added to the chase medium or the labeling medium. Cells were harvested as follows. Cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and extracted for 30 min at 4°C in STE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA) containing 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Clarification of the extracts was achieved by centrifugation for 15 min in the microcentrifuge at 4°C. The clarified supernatants were incubated at 4°C with the specified antiserum for 3 h. Then protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation at 4°C was continued for a further 1 h. Where indicated, sequential immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described before(20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38.Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 6: 771-776Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted in HBS buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% aprotinin, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 2% sodium cholate. After immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with anti-calnexin or anti-α-subunit antibody, proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads under denaturing conditions by incubating the beads in 50 μl of HBS buffer containing 1% SDS at 75°C for 10 min. The supernatants were then diluted with 1 ml of HBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and precipitated with second antibody. The precipitates were washed five times with STE, 1% Triton and suspended in 50 μl of 2 × sample buffer(39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204334) Google Scholar). For fractionation of proteins under nonreducing conditions β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample buffer. After incubation for 5 min in a boiling water bath, the protein A-Sepharose beads were centrifuged, and the supernatants were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive bands were visualized by radiofluorography and quantitated by scanning densitometry or phosphor imaging. To determine the effect of DTT on the cell surface expression of newly made AChR, cultured myotubes were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 15 min and then incubated for the specified intervals in chase medium in the absence or presence of DTT (5 mM). To monitor the appearance of labeled receptors on the external surface of myotubes, the pulse-labeled cells were incubated with the AChR ligand α-Bgt and subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-α-Bgt antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in the absence of DTT, labeled AChR α-subunit was detected at the cell surface after chase intervals of 3 h and longer following its synthesis (lanes 2 and 3). No labeled AChR was detected at the cell surface after chase intervals of 2 h or less (not shown), consistent with a duration of between 2 and 3 h between AChR biosynthesis and its surface appearance(40.Prives J. Bradshaw R.A. Frazier W.A. Merrel R.C. Gottlieb D.I. Hogue-Angeletti R.A. Surface Membrane Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1976: 363-375Crossref Google Scholar, 41.Devreotes P.N. Gardner J.M. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1977; 10: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When DTT was present in the chase medium (lanes 4 and 5), significant amounts of labeled receptors could not be immunoprecipitated from the cell surface, showing that DTT treatment blocks the appearance of newly made AChR at the plasma membrane. The faint bands in lanes 4 and 5 that comigrate with α-subunit probably correspond to the small population of pulse-labeled subunits that underwent oxidation and assembly during the 15-min pulse period before application of DTT. It should be noted that DTT was removed immediately prior to labeling of DTT-treated cells with α-Bgt to prevent reduction of the disulfide bonds in α-Bgt and its consequent inactivation. The block of AChR surface appearance by DTT was reversible: upon removal of the reducing agent from the chase medium and incubation of myotubes in DTT-free medium for an additional 3 or 4 h, labeled AChR was detected at the cell surface (lanes 6 and 7). To test whether the block in AChR surface expression upon exposure to DTT occurred before or after AChR assembly, DTT was added to the culture medium 90 min after the end of the pulse, at a time after completion of AChR assembly but before the receptor had reached the cell surface. As seen in lanes 8 and 9, application of DTT after assembly does not block surface appearance of AChR (or impair the binding of α-Bgt to these receptors). Therefore, in order to block AChR surface expression DTT must be present before the assembly of AChR takes place. To test directly the effect of DTT treatment on AChR subunit assembly, myotubes were pulse-labeled and then chased in the absence or presence of DTT, and AChR assembly was measured by coimmunoprecipitation of α-subunit with a non-cross-reactive antibody directed against the δ-subunit. Fig. 2(left panel) shows the time course of AChR assembly under control conditions, as monitored by the accumulation of α-subunit immunoprecipitated with anti-δ-subunit antibody with increasing chase times. The δ-subunit itself is not visible in [35S]methionine-labeled preparations due to its diffuse migration as a heterogeneous band, high susceptibility to proteolysis, and nonspecific backgrounds in this region of the gel, as noted previously by ourselves (18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and others(43.Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the δ-subunit is phosphorylated and is clearly visible in immunoprecipitates from cultures labeled with 32Pi (18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen, appreciable AChR assembly was not detected immediately after the pulse but was clearly evident by 40 min and continued to increase with the further chase intervals. In contrast, when DTT was present in the chase medium (right panel) no labeled α-subunit was precipitated by anti-δ-subunit antibody at any time point. The ability of anti-δ-subunit antibody to recognize δ-subunit was not impaired by this DTT treatment, as determined by immunoprecipitation of this subunit from cultures 32Pi-labeled in the presence of DTT (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the absence of α-subunit in anti-δ-subunit immunoprecipitates reflects a block in AChR assembly in the ER in the presence of the reducing agent. The effect of DTT treatment on the rate of AChR assembly is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, upon removal of DTT from the culture medium, the assembly of the labeled AChR subunits resumed at the same rate as in untreated cultures (Fig. 3). This finding indicates that DTT treatment does not induce the subunits to misfold permanently, but rather arrests them in a partially folded conformation that remains conducive to assembly upon withdrawal of the reducing agent. When DTT treatment was followed by brief exposure to the cell-permeant alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (20 mM), the assembly of the AChR subunits was not restored even after prolonged incubation in the absence of both drugs (not shown), likely due to the alkylation of the -SH groups and indicating that the recovery of assembly requires the formation of disulfide bonds.Figure 3:Kinetics of AChR assembly under control conditions, in the presence of DTT, and after removal of DTT. Quantitation of AChR assembly time course data was obtained using scanning densitometry and plotted as a function of chase time. The curves show the kinetics of AChR assembly in the absence of DTT (squares), in the presence of 5 mM DTT (circles), or upon removal of DTT after 30 min of chase (triangles). Each point represents the average of three measurements (n = 3, ±S.D.). The timing of DTT removal is shown by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the arrest of AChR assembly by DTT treatment is due to impaired subunit folding, pulse-labeled cultures were chased in the absence or presence of 5 mM DTT as described above, and cellular extracts were then immunoprecipitated with mAb 35, an antibody specific for conformationally mature AChR α-subunit(21.Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, α-subunits were not recognized by mAb 35 to an appreciable extent immediately after the pulse (lane 1), but became immunoprecipitable with this antibody by 60 min of chase in untreated cells (lane 2). In contrast, when DTT was present during the chase α-subunit was not recognized by mAb 35 even after 60 min of chase (lane 4), although equivalent amounts of labeled α-subunit were immunoprecipitable by anti-chick α subunit antibody from untreated and DTT-treated cell extracts (not shown). Replicate cultures were chased in the presence of DTT for 30 min and then rinsed and shifted to medium lacking DTT. Upon removal of the reducing agent, the labeled α-subunits acquired the mAb 35 epitope at a rate and to an extent comparable with that observed under control conditions. These results show that, as in the cases of AChR subunit assembly and surface expression, α-subunit folding is dependent on disulfide bond formation and thus susceptible to DTT. Furthermore, in all three cases the DTT arrest is reversed when the oxidizing environment in the ER is restored. In order to determine the time course of the formation of disulfide bonds on the nascent α-subunits, we used nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in an attempt to distinguish the oxidized and reduced forms of α-subunit. Cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min to isolate a relatively synchronous population of newly made subunits, chased for the specified intervals, and then extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-α-subunit antibody. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. To detect the difference in migration between the nascent and disulfide-bonded forms of α-subunit, samples harvested immediately after pulse were run next to each sample harvested after the specified chase interval (Fig. 5, lanes 1-10). To compare the migration pattern of the fully reduced and oxidized forms of α-subunit, replicate cultures were chased in the presence or absence of 5 mM DTT for 1 h, an interval sufficient for the completion of α-subunit folding in the untreated cultures. As can be seen in Fig. 5, lanes 11 and 12, a small but clearly detectable difference in the mobility of reduced versus oxidized α-subunit is evident under these conditions. In untreated cultures the shift in migration of α-subunit indicative of disulfide bond formation was only marginally detectable after 5 min of chase (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2), was more clearly seen after 10 min (lanes 3 and 4), and appeared to be maximal at 15 min of chase and longer (lanes 5-10). These results indicate that disulfide bonds on α-subunits are established before the acquisition of mAb 35 epitope. Since DTT treatment that prevents formation of these disulfide bonds results in the block of folding and assembly it is likely that the formation of intrachain disulfides is essential for conformational maturation of the individual subunits. We have recently found that nascent AChR α-subunit binds to the molecular chaperone calnexin immediately after α-subunit synthesis(20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The time course of α-subunit-calnexin dissociation was observed to coincide with the conformational maturation of α-subunit, consistent with a role for calnexin in mediating α-subunit folding. Since DTT has now been shown to block the folding of α-subunit (Fig. 4), it is of interest to determine the fate of a-subunit-calnexin complexes in the presence of DTT. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 15 min and chased in the absence or presence of 5 mM DTT. To determine the amount of radiolabeled α-subunit associated with calnexin at each time point, cells were extracted in HBS, 2% sodium cholate buffer, which preserves interactions of calnexin with substrate proteins, and immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibody. The immunoprecipitated calnexin-substrate complexes were eluted from the pellet and reprecipitated with anti-α-subunit antibody. The rate of α-subunit dissociation from calnexin in DTT-treated cells, with a half-time of 18 min, is indistinguishable from that observed in the absence of DTT(20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, no difference is seen in the amounts of α subunit bound to calnexin after 15 min of chase in DTT-treated and untreated cultures (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, α-subunit-calnexin dissociation does not appear to be altered by the presence of DTT in the chase medium. Finally, we tested whether or not the initial binding of calnexin to α-subunit is affected by DTT when the reducing agent is present in the medium during the pulse period. A measurable amount of α-subunit was coprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibody after pulses in the absence and presence of DTT (not shown), and quantitation by Phosphor imager established that the proportion of α-subunits complexed to calnexin was unchanged in the presence of DTT. Together these results indicate that DTT treatment does not alter appreciably both association and dissociation of nascent AChR α-subunit with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin. In the present study we have measured the time course of disulfide bond formation in AChR α-subunits and have shown that this posttranslational modification is crucial for further folding, assembly, and surface expression of AChR. As established previously under similar experimental conditions, AChR α-subunit conformational maturation is first detectable at 30 min after translation (interval measured from the beginning of the pulse) and increases linearly, achieving a maximum by 60-75 min after translation(20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Assembly into pentameric complexes takes place shortly after maturation, beginning 30-45 min after translation and attaining completion by 90 min(18.Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The assembled AChR reaches the cell surface 2.5-3 h after subunit synthesis ((40.Prives J. Bradshaw R.A. Frazier W.A. Merrel R.C. Gottlieb D.I. Hogue-Angeletti R.A. Surface Membrane Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1976: 363-375Crossref Google Scholar) and (41.Devreotes P.N. Gardner J.M. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1977; 10: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); our present results). We have now determined that disulfide bond formation on α-subunit is completed by 20 min after subunit translation, preceding subunit maturation as measured with the conformation-specific antibody. Our observation that the AChR α-subunit needs to undergo additional folding after this disulfide bond formation to acquire the mAb 35 epitope indicates that the newly oxidized subunit constitutes a discrete folding intermediate that is a precursor of the mature, assembly-competent α-subunit. Our results show that DTT treatment blocked the appearance of newly made AChR at the plasma membrane, but only when the reducing agent was present in the culture medium within the first few minutes after pulse labeling. Under these conditions DTT blocked disulfide bond formation on α-subunit and arrested subsequent subunit folding and assembly. The addition of DTT after the disulfide bonds have formed (at 30 min after the pulse; data not shown) no longer had any effect on the extent and timing of assembly. Similarly, adding DTT after the completion of assembly (90 min) did not affect the transport of pulse-labeled AChR to the cell surface. Although the block of disulfide bond formation on nascent secretory and membrane proteins in the ER is a general consequence of DTT treatment, the time course data strongly suggest that DTT exerts its effects on AChR directly, by preventing the oxidation of AChR subunits. Together these results indicate that formation of disulfide bonds on AChR α-subunit is a fundamental step required for subunit maturation and assembly into pentameric AChR. The contribution of disulfide bonds to AChR biogenesis has been addressed in recent studies using recombinant subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (42.Sumikawa K. Gehle V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6286-6290Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) or in transfected fibroblasts(43.Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In these experiments mutant α-subunits lacking the conserved disulfide bond between Cys128 and Cys142 failed to form α-Bgt binding sites, which like the mAb 35 epitope, are dependent on the acquisition of the correctly folded conformation(25.Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4367-4376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Forsayeth J.R. Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, both studies reported association of these mutant α subunits with normal δ subunits, suggesting that formation of this disulfide bond is not an absolute prerequisite for AChR assembly. In contrast, under the present experimental conditions DTT treatment abolished detectable assembly of α- and δ-subunits. How can these apparent differences be reconciled? First, elimination of disulfide bond formation either by DTT or by mutagenesis of the α-subunit may result in a significant decrease in the affinity between subunits. Consequently, in DTT-treated cultured muscle cells the assembly of endogenously expressed AChR subunits is diminished to undetectable levels, while in transfected cells association between mutant α- and δ-subunits, although markedly less efficient, could remain detectable due to overexpression of the recombinant subunits. In addition, since DTT is anticipated to prevent formation of the conserved disulfide bond in all four AChR subunits, it is possible that the impaired folding of other subunits as well as the α-subunit contributes to the block in assembly. As α-subunits directly assemble with both γ- and δ-subunits(23.Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), it would be of interest to determine if α-γ binding is also vulnerable to DTT treatment. We found that the described effects of DTT on AChR biogenesis are fully reversible. Removal of the reducing agent leads to the resumption of disulfide bond formation on the arrested subunits, with subsequent folding and assembly into pentameric AChR, followed by transport to the cell surface. Moreover, upon reversal of the DTT effect, the time course of these events is indistinguishable from that of subunit folding, assembly, and cell surface appearance in untreated cultures. These results indicate that DTT treatment at least for the durations used in this experiment does not cause irreversible misfolding or aggregation of the subunits: instead, subunit conformational maturation is suspended until the oxidizing environment in the ER is restored. It is possible that the prevention of irreversible misfolding of proteins reduced by DTT is mediated by one or more ER-resident molecular chaperones, proteins that are thought to prevent misfolding and facilitate correct folding of nascent polypeptides. The ER chaperone calnexin forms complexes with newly made AChR α-subunit, and these complexes subsequently dissociate with a t½ of approximately 20 min, concomitantly with α-subunit folding(20.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study we have observed that formation of α-subunit-calnexin complexes was not impaired by DTT. Moreover, the kinetics of calnexin dissociation were apparently unchanged in the presence of DTT, although the folding and assembly of the α-subunit remained arrested for as long as DTT was present, indicating that calnexin dissociation from α-subunit is independent of the completion of α-subunit folding. This finding supports the possibility that calnexin performs its function mainly during the translational and early posttranslational stages of AChR subunit folding, when nascent subunits may be most susceptible to misfolding and aggregation. In a similar manner, calnexin has been reported to mediate early folding of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), dissociating prior to conformational maturation of HA monomer(44.Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In an earlier study a mechanism has been proposed in which the ER-resident molecular chaperone BiP forms transient complexes with nascent HA during the folding process and prevents its misfolding by blocking formation of inappropriate disulfide bonds(7.Segal M.S. Bye J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies describe divergent effects of DTT on calnexin interaction with substrate proteins(36.Wada I. Ou W-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Kim P. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 46.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 423-425Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In two instances, the major secretory glycoprotein in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (36.Wada I. Ou W-J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thyroglobulin in thyroid epithelial cells(45.Kim P. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), DTT has been reported to lock substrates onto calnexin by blocking the dissociation of the complexes. In contrast, in the case of HA, the addition of DTT to a cell-free translation system has been reported to cause detachment of calnexin from unfolded HA, apparently due to reduction of the disulfide bond(s) in calnexin itself(46.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 423-425Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Since this susceptibility of calnexin to DTT is not restricted to cell-free preparations(46.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 423-425Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (481) Google Scholar), it is possible that the ER in different cell types varies with respect to the ability of DTT to alter its redox potential. In addition, since the structural requirements for complexing with calnexin apparently differ among its various substrate proteins(45.Kim P. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 47.Arunachalam B. Cresswell P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3944-3948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), calnexin-substrate interactions may also vary with respect to their sensitivity to disulfide bond reduction. Our present findings summarized schematically in Fig. 7 indicate that formation of disulfide bonds is an essential aspect of the quality control mechanism that ascertains that only correctly folded and assembled AChR pentamers exit the ER and are transported to the cell surface. The ability to interrupt AChR folding and assembly by preventing disulfide bond formation in intact cells offers a means for isolation of folding intermediates as well as the potential for identification of additional ER-resident proteins that participate in the quality control process. We are grateful to Dr. John J. M. Bergeron for helpful discussions and a generous gift of anti-calnexin antibody. We thank Sandeep Mody for preparation of muscle cell cultures."

In addition, these cells express and secrete this factor. To determine whether this peptide plays an autocrine role in BAC, cells were transfected with 10 μM unmodified sense (SON) or antisense (AON) oligonucleotide complementary to the translation initiation region of the TGFβ1 mRNA in an attempt to inhibit TGFβ1 protein synthesis. We investigated first, the cellular uptake, the stability, and the intracellular distribution of 32P-labeled TGFβ1 AON and SON; and second, the effects of both oligonucleotides on BAC specific functions. We have demonstrated that in BAC, the TGFβ1 AON uptake reached a plateau after 8 h of transfection (16% of the radioactivity added) and remained fairly constant for at least 24 h. In contrast, the uptake of TGFβ1 SON reached a plateau after 2 h of transfection (8% of the radioactivity added), remained stable for only 3 h, and then declined. After 8 h of transfection, followed by 44 h of culture without oligonucleotides, the intracellular level of TGFβ1 AON was still high with about 8% of the radioactivity added, whereas that of TGFβ1 SON represented only 1.2%. Moreover, AON was present in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and it was hybridized in both compartments. However, TGFβ1 SON was present mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction where it was not hybridized. Neither TGFβ1 AON nor SON modified TGFβ1 mRNA levels; however, TGFβ1 AON, but not SON, caused the disappearance of TGFβ1 immunoreactivity inside the cells. Finally, the steroidogenic responsiveness of BAC transfected with TGFβ1 AON increased about 2-fold, and this was associated with a 2-fold increase of the mRNA levels of both cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Neither TGFβ1 SON nor a scrambled oligonucleotide containing the same number of G nucleotides as TGFβ1 AON had any effect on these parameters.

Although in many cells the three TGFβs display comparable activities and potencies, marked differences have been noted in some cases(2.Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Cross-linking experiments have shown that the TGFβ family of peptides binds to three different receptors, named type I, II, and III(2.Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1993; 260: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recent studies have determined the role of each type of TGFβ receptor. Type III receptor, also known as betaglycan, has no direct role in TGFβ signaling, but increases the binding of TGFβ, in particular TGFβ2, to type II receptor, enhances cell responsiveness to TGFβ, and diminishes the biological differences between TGFβ isoforms(9.Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Types I and II receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. The role of these molecules in signaling has now been determined, and both types are required for TGFβ signaling(10.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Weiser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). TGFβ binds directly to receptor II. Bound TGFβ is then recognized by receptor I, which is recruited into the complex and becomes phosphorylated by receptor II. Phosphorylation allows receptor I to propagate the signal to downstream substrates. Recent results suggest that serine residues in the GS domain (region preceding the kinase domain) of receptor I, which are phosphorylated by receptor II, are important for signal transduction by receptor I (11.Franzén P. Heildin C.-H. Miyazono K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In bovine fasciculata adrenal cells (BAC), the expression and the maintenance of specific differentiated functions are regulated not only by corticotropin (ACTH) and angiotensin-II (AngII), the two main hormones that control steroidogenesis, but also by growth factors, which have been shown to have pleiotropic effects in addition to their mitogenic action. In bovine and ovine adrenocortical cells, it has been shown that TGFβ1 is a potent inhibitor of basal as well as ACTH-induced cortisol production(12.Hotta M. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In BAC, TGFβ1 secretion is regulated by specific peptide hormones; ACTH decreases TGFβ1 mRNA level, whereas AngII increases TGFβ1 mRNA and protein levels. 2C. Le Roy, P. Leduque, P. M. Dubois, J. M. Saez, and D. Langlois, unpublished results. All these data suggest that TGFβ1 local production could play an autocrine role on BAC differentiated functions.Synthetic oligonucleotides represent a new tool to investigate the role of many proteins in cell growth and differentiation. Ideally, an antisense oligonucleotide is targeted in a sequence-specific manner to nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) to inhibit the expression of a specific protein involved in cellular signal transduction, growth, proliferation, or differentiation(21.Baertschi A.J.

Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated to peroxidase was purchased from Nordic Immunology (Tilburg, The Netherlands).Isolation and Culture of Bovine Adrenocortical CellsBAC were prepared by sequential treatment of adrenal cortical slices with trypsin (0.16%) as described previously(31.Langlois D. Hinsch K.D. Saez J.M. Bégeot M. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1867-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Then, cells were purified on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (d = 1.032, 1.048, and 1.082 g/ml) to eliminate cellular fragments and red blood cells. The purified fasciculata cells recovered on the Percoll gradient with a density of 1.048 g/ml were collected, washed and cultured in a chemically defined medium, Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), containing 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10-4M vitamin C, and antibiotics without serum.OligonucleotidesAntisense, sense, and scrambled unmodified 15-base deoxyribonucleotides corresponding to the translation initiation region of human TGFβ1 mRNA were used: antisense (AON) (5′-GGA GGG CGG CAT GGG-3′); sense (SON) (5′-CCC ATG CCG CCC TCC-3′); scrambled (SCR) (5′-AGG TGG GAG GCG GCG −3′).Cell Transfection and Viability TestOn day 2 of culture, cells were transfected with labeled and/or unlabeled TGFβ1 AON or SON. To introduce the oligonucleotides into BAC, a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method was used. Oligonucleotides dissolved in one volume of antibiotic-free medium were mixed with Lipofectamine(™) reagent dissolved in the same volume of antibiotic-free medium and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the oligonucleotide-liposome complexes were diluted with eight volumes of antibiotic-free medium and then added to cells that had been washed twice with antibiotic-free medium. In the experiments reported, the concentration of oligonucleotides and Lipofectamine(™) in the transfection medium was 10 μM (50 μg/ml) and 1.25%, respectively. For the viability test (trypan blue exclusion assay), the number of living cells was assessed at the end of the experimental period (8 h of transfection followed by 44 h of culture).Oligonucleotide Cellular Uptake and DegradationOligonucleotides were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by use of bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and further purified by dialysis (specific activity 8 × 108 dpm/μg). The transfection medium containing 1 × 106 dpm/ml 32P oligonucleotides and 10 μM unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the cells. At indicated times, the culture medium was removed and saved, cells were washed three times with medium, and the cell washes were also removed and saved. Cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and extracted with phenol-chloroform-amyl alcohol (25:25:1, v/v/v). After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), the aqueous phase was removed and saved. Then the phenol phase was extracted with water and centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was removed and pooled with the first one. Aliquots of the three fractions, i.e. combined aqueous phases corresponding to the intracellular radioactivity, cell washes, and culture medium, were counted. Oligonucleotide uptake was calculated as the percentage of the intracellular radioactivity over the counts recovered in the three fractions. To determine oligonucleotide degradation, aliquots containing equal amounts of radioactivity of the combined aqueous phases and of the culture medium fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel) and autoradiographed.Oligonucleotide Distribution and HybridizationAfter transfection with 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide, a subcellular fractionation of the cells was carried out. Briefly, after washes, cells were removed from the culture plate with trypsin (100 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and washed twice with medium. The cells were lysed for 10 min at 4°C in buffer A (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the upper cytoplasmic fraction (combined cytosol and cell membranes) was removed and saved. The pellet (nuclei) was dissolved in a small quantity of buffer A and then laid over 1 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 M sucrose and centrifuged (800 × g for 10 min). The purified nuclei pellet was dissolved in buffer A. Aliquots of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were counted. In order to determine whether the oligonucleotide formed duplexes with cellular RNA, an S1 nuclease protection assay was performed on aliquots of cell lysates, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions. As a control the medium was also treated with the enzyme. The nucleic acids of each fraction were precipitated at −20°C for 20 min and −70°C for 10 min with cold ethanol (2.2 volumes), 3 M sodium acetate (0.1 volume), pH 5.2, and 10 μg of tRNA. After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C), the pellet was washed with cold ethanol (70%), lyophilized for a short time, and then resuspended in 70 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mM PIPES, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Then 30 μl of each aliquot was incubated without (control) or with 20 units of S1 nuclease 30 min at 37°C in 200 μl of digestion buffer (280 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium acetate, 4.5 mM ZnSO4, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The nuclease action was stopped by putting the samples on ice and by addition of 60 μl of termination buffer (1.5 M sodium acetate, 125 mM EDTA, 75 mM MgCl2). Samples were precipitated at −20°C for 20 min and −70°C for 10 min with 20 μg of tRNA and 0.75 ml of ethanol, centrifuged, and washed as described above. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. Protected fragments were visualized byautoradiography.RNA Preparation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Samples (10-15 μg of RNA) were separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 10% formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to Hybond-N membrane. Prehybridization and hybridization solutions used were described previously(30.Avallet O. Vigier M. Leduque P. Dubois P.M. Saez J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Labeled human TGFβ1 cDNA, bovine P450 17α-hydroxylase cDNA, and human 3β HSD were used as probes (1-2 × 106 dpm/ml). Labeling of these probes in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP was performed with a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). The blots were washed with more or less stringency depending on the probes used and then exposed to photographic film. The relative intensity of hybridization signals was quantified by using a scanning densitometer (Preference Sebia, Paris, France). Equal loading of RNA samples was confirmed by scanning the 28 S RNA negatives.ImmunocytochemistryBAC cells were plated at a density of 6.0 104 cells/chamber in eight-chamber tissue culture slides (Plastic Labtek) and transfected with antisense or sense oligonucleotide as described above. After the transfection medium was removed, cells were washed two times with fresh medium, cultured during 44 h and subjected to immunocytochemical analysis. For comparative studies, control cells were always run in the same immunocytochemical assay to reduce discrepancies related to interassay variability in staining intensity.TGFβ1 expression was examined by an indirect immunocytochemical method as described previously(30.Avallet O. Vigier M. Leduque P. Dubois P.M. Saez J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed 30 min at room temperature in 2% acrolein in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and washed overnight in 100 mM PBS (pH 7.6) at 4°C. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, rinsed, and exposed for 1 h to a 1/40 dilution of nonimmune rabbit serum. The polyclonal anti-TGFβ1 rabbit antibody was used as primary antibody at a dilution of 1/1000 overnight in a humidity chamber at 4°C. The second antibody to rabbit IgGs conjugated to peroxidase was used at a dilution of 1/200 for 1 h at room temperature. To localize the antigen-antibody complexes, cells were incubated for 2 min with 0.05% 3,3′ diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 0.01% H2O2, and 2.5% nickel ammonium sulfate. Next, the cultured cell preparations were mounted in PBS-glycerol (1:1). The specificity of the TGFβ1 antibody has been tested previously (30.Avallet O. Vigier M. Leduque P. Dubois P.M. Saez J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Cortisol ProductionIt was measured in the medium by a specific radioimmunoassay(33.Ouali R. Poulette S. Penhoat A. Saez J.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Metabolic LabelingFor metabolic labeling, before the end of the culture, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in methionine-free medium, after which the medium was replaced by fresh methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) during the last 4 h.ImmunoprecipitationAfter metabolic labeling, cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline. Cells were then lysed by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatants from the cells extracts were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with nonimmune rabbit serum at a final concentration of 5% and then with 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. After 1 h of incubation, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation. The supernatants were collected and submitted to immunoprecipitation with anti-αq/α11 IgG (1/50, v/v) at 4°C for 2 h, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. After centrifugation, the beads were washed four times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer and once with 0.1% SDS. The radiolabeled proteins in the final pellet were analyzed by electrophoresis using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify, dried, and the labeled proteins were revealed by fluorography.Western Blot AnalysisAfter appropriate treatments, cells were lysed and submitted to Western blot analysis as described previously (34.Langlois D. Ouali R. Berthelon M.C. Derrien A. Saez J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except 10% polyacrylamide gels were without urea.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis were performed with Student's t test for comparison of two groups. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSCell ViabilityExposure of BAC to AON or SON or SCR oligonucleotides did not affect cell viability: 89.5%± 1.0%, 87.4%± 3.4%, 90.2%± 2.7%, respectively, versus 91.3%± 0.4% in control cells (n = 3).Oligonucleotide Uptake and DegradationTo investigate the kinetics of oligonucleotide uptake and degradation, cells were transfected with 32P-labeled TGFβ1 AON or SON (final concentration 10 μM) for different times as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 1 shows the time-dependent cellular uptake of TGFβ1 AON (solid line) and TGFβ1 SON (dotted line). TGFβ1 AON cellular uptake started within the first minutes of transfection, increased progressively to reach a plateau at 8 h, and remained stable for the next 24 h. At this time, 16% of the radioactivity were inside the cells. Taking into account the cellular volume and the specific activity, TGFβ1 AON intracellular concentration (500 μM) was about 50-fold higher than that in the medium. TGFβ1 SON cellular uptake was also rapid. Uptake reached a plateau at 2 h, remained stable for only 3 h, and then declined. At the plateau, 8% of the radioactivity was inside the cells.To examine the extent of oligonucleotide degradation within cells and in the medium during the cellular uptake, TGFβ1 AON was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results of Fig. 1 show that, inside the cells, TGFβ1 AON appeared to be intact for up to 24 h. However, in the culture medium, a progressive degradation of the TGFβ1 AON was observed. The oligonucleotide was first transformed into another compound with higher mobility. This in turn was converted into another compound with faster mobility after 3 h. A similar pattern of degradation, but much more rapid, was observed with TGFβ1 SON (data not shown).Intracellular Stability of the TGFβ1 AON and SONTo determine the intracellular stability of the oligonucleotides, cells were transfected with 32P-labeled TGFβ1 AON or SON for 8 h (time at which TGFβ1 AON uptake was maximum), the medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium without oligonucleotides, and the culture continued for another 44 h (Fig. 2). As shown, after 8 h of transfection, the intracellular concentration of TGFβ1 AON or SON represented 16% and 6%, respectively, of the radioactivity added. However, after 44 h of culture, the intracellular concentration of TGFβ1 AON was still 8% of the radioactivity added, whereas that of TGFβ1 SON represented only 1.2%.Figure 2:Intracellular stability of the TGFβ1 AON and SON. Cells were transfected with 32P-labeled AON or SON for 8 h. Several wells were harvested, while the medium of the other wells was removed and replaced with fresh medium without oligonucleotides. The culture was continued for another 44 h. Aliquots of cell extracts at 8 h and 8 h followed by 44 h of culture were taken and counted. The results are expressed as percent of total radioactivity. Results are the mean ± S.D. of duplicate measurements from two separate experiments for the TGFβ1 AON and from one experiment for TGFβ1 SON.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Intracellular Distribution and Hybridization of TGFβ1 AON and SONIn order to determine the intracellular distribution of both TGFβ1 AON and SON, subcellular fractionation of the cells was performed after 8 h of transfection and 44 h after the oligonucleotides' removal (Fig. 3). After 8 h of transfection 60% and 40% of the intracellular TGFβ1 AON were in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. This distribution was the opposite after 44 h of culture. In contrast, at both times more than 85% of the intracellular TGFβ1 SON were in the cytoplasmic fraction. Indeed, the TGFβ1 SON present in the nuclear fraction after 44 h of culture without oligonucleotides represented less than 0.2% of the radioactivity added.Figure 3:Intracellular distribution of the TGFβ1 AON and SON. Cells were transfected with 32P-labeled AON or SON for 8 h or 8 h followed by 44 h of culture and subcellular fractionation was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were counted. The results are expressed as percent of intracellular radioactivity. Results are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements from three separate experimen"

In vertebrate organisms, two isoforms of topo II have been identified, which have been designated topo IIα and topo IIβ, the latter having been discovered later(33.Drake F.H. Zimmerman J.P. McCabe F.L. Bartus H.F. Per S.R. Sullivan D.M. Ross W.E. Mattern M.R. Johnson R.K. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, most reports describing the phosphorylation of topo II of mammalian cells referred to topo IIα, except for a few(16.Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24.Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol.

Negri C. Donzelli M. Guano F. Scovassi A.I. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 6: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). While it appears that in yeast and Drosophila melanogaster, there is one enzyme which more closely resembles topo IIα. We reported that an unidentified protein kinase, PKII phosphorylated topo IIα, which stimulated enzyme activity(36.Saijo M. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of topo II varied among preparations. In addition, Shiozaki and Yanagida (37.Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6093-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have reported that yeast topo II without the phosphorylated termini had about 4-fold more catalytic activity than intact topoisomerase II, and that dephosphorylated topo II retained enzymatic activity(38.Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, to re-evaluate our results and to examine the effect of phosphorylation upon the activity of topo II, we investigated the kinase that phosphorylates topo IIα in mouse FM3A cells, which dominantly express topo IIα. We found that casein kinase II phosphorylated topo IIα in FM3A cells and that phosphorylation of topo IIα by casein kinase II had no effect on the activity of topo IIα under our experimental conditions. More importantly, we found that the incubation itself stimulated the activity of topo IIα. Buffer 1 contained 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM Na3EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% ethanol. Buffer 2 consisted of all components of buffer 1, plus 20% ethylene glycol and 0.01% Triton X-100. Buffer 3 consists of all components of buffer 1, plus 50% glycerol and 0.01% Triton X-100. DNA topo II activity was assayed by measuring supercoiled DNA relaxing or DNA unknotting activities. The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) for the DNA relaxation assay consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM Na3EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.225 mg of supercoiled pUC19 DNA. The incubation proceeded at 30°C, and the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of stop solution (5% SDS, 25% Ficoll, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The sample was incubated for 15 min at 50°C, then loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris borate, pH 8.2, and 2 mM EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination. DNA unknotting activity was assayed as described above for the relaxing assay except that knotted P4 phage DNA was used as the substrate DNA. All operations were performed at 0-4°C. A total of 8 × 109 frozen FM3A cells were thawed, suspended in buffer 1 at a concentration of 1.25 × 109 cells/ml, and sonicated 4 times for 10 s at each interval of 20 s with a Branson model 185 sonifier. Buffer 1 (0.1 volume) containing 3.3 M KCl was added dropwise to the sonicate to bring the final concentration of KCl to 0.3 M. After stirring for 30 min, the sonicate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered as the crude extract and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (30 ml) equilibrated with 0.45 M KCl in buffer 2. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with 0.6 M KCl in buffer 2. The eluted fractions were pooled and 5/12 volume of buffer 2 was added to bring the final concentration of KCl to 0.35 M and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (5 ml) equilibrated with 0.35 M KCl in buffer 2. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with 10 bed volumes of a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, from 20 mM to 0.35 M in buffer 2 containing 0.35 M KCl. Topo IIα was detected by SDS-PAGE. Topo IIα was eluted from the column between 0.25 and 0.3 M potassium phosphate. The fractions containing topo IIα were pooled and dialyzed against 0.2 M KCl in buffer 2. The dialysate was loaded onto a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 M KCl in buffer 2 at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer and eluted with a 30-min gradient of 0.2-0.5 M KCl in buffer 2 at 0.5 ml/min. Topo IIα detected by SDS-PAGE was eluted at 0.3 M KCl. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 0.15 M KCl in buffer 3. The dialysate was stored at −20°C. Cell extracts were prepared from 8 × 109 frozen FM3A cells as described above. To remove the nucleic acids, the extract was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (70 ml) equilibrated with 0.3 M KCl in buffer 1. The flow-through fraction was dialyzed against 140 mM KCl in buffer 2 and applied to a second DEAE-cellulose column (40 ml) equilibrated with 140 mM KCl in buffer 2. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with 3 bed volumes of 0.3 M KCl in buffer 2. The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (10 ml) equilibrated with 0.3 M KCl in buffer 2. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 0.3 to 1 M in buffer 2. Casein kinase activity was eluted from the column at 0.7 M KCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM KCl in buffer 2. The dialysate was loaded onto a FPLC Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM KCl in buffer 2 at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 50 mM to 0.6 M in buffer 2. Casein kinase II activity was eluted from the column between 0.4 and 0.45 M KCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 0.15 M KCl in buffer 3, and stored at −20°C. Exponentially growing FM3A cells were washed once with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 and inoculated into 60-mm plastic dishes at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml with 5 ml of above medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (60 μCi/ml, 8500-9100 Ci/mmol) for 2 h at 37°C. 32P-Labeled topo IIα was immunoprecipitated with anti-topo II antibody by the procedure of Saijo et al. (23.Saijo M. Ui M. Enomoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified topo IIα (60 ng) was incubated with 50 ng of casein kinase II in the reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM ATP or 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 Ci/mmol), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol at 30°C for the indicated periods. For phosphopeptide mapping, purified topo IIα (1 μg) was phosphorylated by the indicated kinases as follows. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II proceeded in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1-5 Ci/mmol) at 30°C for 30 min. Phosphorylation by PKII proceeded in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1-5 Ci/mmol) at 30°C for 30 min. Protein kinase C phosphorylation proceeded in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1-5 Ci/mmol), 25 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 4 μg/ml dioleoylglycerol at 30°C for 30 min. 32P-Labeled topo IIα was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The stained band of topo IIα was cut and washed with 25% isopropyl alcohol 5 times, with 10% methanol twice, and with double distilled water twice at 30-min intervals. The gel slice was crushed and incubated in 50 μl of medium containing 0.1 mg/ml Achrombacter protease 1 and 50 mM NH4HCO4, pH 9.0, or 0.1 mg/ml V8 protease and 50 mM NH4HCO4, pH 7.8, or 0.1 mg/ml endoproteinase Asp-N and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37°C for 12 h. The crashed gels were removed from the medium by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, then the supernatant was recovered and dried. A solution (40 μl) containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue was added to dissolve the digested peptides and boiled for 30 s. The sample was resolved by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE according to Schagger and Jagow(39.Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar), and phosphopeptides were detected with an image analyzer (BAS 2000 Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan). Topo IIα (60 ng) was incubated with 0.2 units of purified potato acid phosphatase (PAP) as described by Shiozaki and Yanagida (38.Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or incubated with 25 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) at 30°C for 30 min. We purified topo IIα and casein kinase II from mouse FM3A cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified topo IIα fraction contained a single 170-kDa band (Fig. 1A) and purified casein kinase II fraction consisted of two major bands at 28 and 43 kDa (Fig. 1B). The purified topo IIα was phosphorylated by protein kinase C, casein kinase II, or PKII. The labeled topo IIα was separated by SDS-PAGE, digested by Achrombacter protease 1, and the phosphopeptides were mapped as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Topo IIα labeled by each kinase had a distinct phosphopeptide profile (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3), indicating that these kinases phosphorylate topo IIα at different sites. By contrast, the phosphopeptide maps of topo IIα phosphorylated by casein kinase II and that of topo IIα labeled in intact cells, which were produced by digestion with Achromobacter protease 1, V8 protease, or endopeptidase Asp-N, were similar (Fig. 2, lanes 4-9). Thus it is likely that casein kinase II phosphorylates topo IIα in FM3A cells.Figure 2:Phosphopeptide analysis of topo IIα labeled in intact cells or in vitro with various kinases. Topo IIα was labeled in intact cells or in vitro with the indicated kinases, digested by Achrombacter protease 1 (lanes 1-3, 6, and 7), V8 protease (lanes 4 and 5), or endoproteinase Asp-N (lanes 8 and 9), and resolved by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were detected with an image analyzer. Lane 1, phosphopeptide map of topo IIα phosphorylated by protein kinase C; lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, phosphorylated by casein kinase II; lane 3, phosphorylated by PKII; lanes 5, 7, and 9, phosphorylated in intact cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Casein kinase II appeared to phosphorylate topo IIα in intact cells. Thus, we examined the effect of phosphorylation by casein kinase II upon the activity of topo IIα. Fig. 3 shows the time course of topo IIα phosphorylation by casein kinase II. At the maximal level, about 2 molecules of phosphate were incorporated into one molecule of topo IIα. Incubating topo IIα with heat-inactivated casein kinase II or in the absence of the kinase resulted in no phosphate incorporation. Topo IIα was incubated with casein kinase II or heat-inactivated casein kinase II for 30 min under the same conditions as those of Fig. 3, then the activity of topo IIα was measured. The levels of activity of topo IIα incubated with casein kinase II or heat-inactivated casein kinase II were considerably higher than that of activity of topo IIα without incubation when topo II activity was determined by the DNA relaxing assay (Fig. 4A) or the DNA unknotting assay (Fig. 4B). This indicated that the activity of topo IIα was stimulated during the incubation independently of phosphorylation by casein kinase II, because the heat-inactivated casein kinase II did not phosphorylate topo IIα (Fig. 3). To determine whether the purified topo IIα had been sufficiently phosphorylated in the cells and that additional phosphorylation scarcely affected the activity of topo IIα, we incubated it with PAP. We first confirmed the dephosphorylating activity of PAP using topo IIα labeled with 32P in intact cells. The 32P-labeled topo IIα was incubated with PAP or heat-inactivated PAP. As shown in Fig. 5A, PAP removed almost all 32P label from topo IIα and heat-inactivated PAP had no effect upon phosphate removal (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Topo IIα was incubated with PAP or heat-inactivated PAP under the same conditions as those of Fig. 5A, and the activity of topo IIα was assayed. Again, the activity of topo IIα was stimulated by an incubation either with PAP or with heat-inactivated PAP, when the activity was compared with that of topo IIα without this incubation (Fig. 5, B and C). The levels of topo IIα activity incubated with PAP and heat-inactivated PAP were similar in the DNA relaxing (Fig. 5B) or the DNA unknotting assays (Fig. 5C), indicating that dephosphorylated and phosphorylated topo IIα retained the same level of activity. By contrast, incubation with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase markedly inhibited topo IIα activity (compare Fig. 6A, a and b). In this case, ATP in the reaction mixture was almost completely degraded (Fig. 6B). We determined whether the activity of topo IIα was affected by the incubation itself. Topo IIα was incubated in medium containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM ATP, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol for the indicated periods, then its activity was assayed. Both DNA relaxing and unknotting activities of topo IIα were stimulated more than 3-fold by a 30-min incubation in the buffer indicated above (Fig. 7, A and B). The stimulatory effect was evident after 5 min (compare Fig. 7A, a and b) and nearly saturated by 15 min (compare c and d). Purified topo IIα was stored in a buffer containing 50% glycerol, whereas the concentration of glycerol in the buffer in which topo IIα was preincubated was only 5%. Thus we examined the effect of glycerol concentration on the activation of topo IIα activity. Topo IIα was incubated in the buffer containing various concentrations of glycerol for 30 min. Then the activity of topo IIα was measured by the DNA relaxing (Fig. 8A) or unknotting assays (Fig. 8B) in a reaction mixture containing glycerol of a concentration below 3.75%. Incubation of topo IIα in the buffer containing 75 and 50% glycerol did not stimulate the activity of topo IIα, whereas the activity was enhanced during incubation in the buffer containing 5 or 20% glycerol. When the concentration of topo IIα was decreased to one-tenth during the incubation for activation, topo IIα was not activated by the incubation, indicating that the activation is dependent on the concentration of topo IIα (Fig. 9). Phosphorylation is an important means by which enzymatic activity and protein functions are regulated in the cells. DNA topoisomerase exists as a phosphoprotein in the cells of various species(16.Taagepera S. Rao P.N. Drake F.H. Gorbsky G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We reported that topo II is phosphorylated in mouse FM3A cells and that the phosphorylation of topo IIα purified from the mouse cells by an unidentified protein kinase, PK II, stimulated the activity of topo IIα(36.Saijo M. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To evaluate these results, we first tried to identify the protein kinase that phosphorylates topo IIα in FM3A cells. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that casein kinase II phosphorylates topo IIα in mouse cells. Topo II in Drosophila and yeast cells are phosphorylated by casein kinase II(27.Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30.Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29746-29751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that casein kinase II phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of topo IIα, primarily, the 2 serine residues in vitro, which are sites of modification in intact cells. Thus, casein kinase II is the major enzyme that phosphorylates topo II in various eukaryotic cells. The activity of topo II from Drosophila and yeast cells is stimulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation. Thus we examined whether the phosphorylation of mouse topo IIα by casein kinase II stimulated topo IIα activity. Phosphorylation of topo IIα (~2 phosphates/enzyme) by casein kinase II had no effect on topo IIα activity (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The inability to stimulate topo IIα activity by phosphorylation may be due to the fact that the topo IIα is sufficiently phosphorylated to exhibit enzyme activity. However, this possibility was excluded because the almost total dephosphorylation of topo IIα by PAP did not decrease topo IIα activity (Fig. 5). Thus phosphorylation of topo IIα had no effect upon the enzyme activity under our experimental conditions. In this context, it is interesting that the C-terminal domain of topo II, which is the site of phosphorylation, is not required for the activity of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae topo II(38.Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41.Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol.

The key finding in this study was that the incubation itself stimulates topo IIα activity (Fig. 7). Frere et al. (43.Frere V. Sourgen F. Monnot M. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have reported that the human topo IIα 1013-1056 fragment associates into stable two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil structures through hydrophobic interactions. In addition, Lamhasni et al.(44.Lamhasni S. Larsen A.K. Barray M. Monnot M. Delain E. Fermandjian S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3632-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have reported that yeast topo II exists as a monomer-dimer equilibrium depending on both the enzyme concentration and salt concentration. Vassetzky et al. (45.Vassetzky Y.S. Dang Q. Benedetti P. Gasser S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6962-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) indicated that multimerization of topo IIα required its phosphorylation. Since topo IIα was stimulated even by the incubation with PAP, multimerization of topo IIα is not required for the stimulation. Thus it seems likely that mutual interaction of topo IIα to form homodimers or a conformational change of topo IIα dimers occurs during incubation, resulting in activation of topo IIα. It must be noted that the stimulation by incubation was not observed with the topo IIα after storage for long periods. In this case, the increase in the level of topo II activity was observed during the storage. We reported that the activity of mouse topo II, which corresponded to topo IIα, was stimulated by an incubation with PKII(36.Saijo M. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the degree of stimulation by PKII varied among preparations. The purified PKII fractions were stored in a medium containing 50% glycerol. It is likely that the purified PKII fractions contained inactive topo IIα, which could be activated by incubation in a medium containing a low concentration of glycerol and then, apparently stimulated topo IIα activity, being independent of phosphorylation of topo IIα. We also reported that treatment of topo IIα with agarose bead-conjugated CIAP reduced topo IIα activity. By contrast, in this study topo IIα activity was not reduced after treatment with potato acid phosphatase, which removes almost all the phosphate groups from topo IIα. Fig. 6 shows that ATP in the reaction mixture for the assay of topo II activity degraded rapidly when topo IIα was first incubated with CIAP. Although the cause of the inhibition of topo II activity in our previous study must be studied precisely, one possibility is that topo IIα activity was inhibited by CIAP, which was released from agarose beads and carried over to topo II assay mixture, due not to the dephosphorylation of topo IIα but to ATP degradation. The present finding that phosphorylation has no effect on topo IIα activity is incompatible with previous studies on Drosophila and S. cerevisiae topo II(27.Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29.Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20513-20518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy must be analyzed in detail in future experiments. Thus, the conclusions of the present work do not at this time appear to be applicable to the regulation of topo II activity from lower eukaryotes. This study showed that the activity of topo IIα was stimulated by incubation itself. The stimulation was observed under specific conditions: a relatively low concentration of glycerol and high concentrations of topo IIα, which had not been stored for long periods. Thus, there is at present no evidence to suggest that the previously reported conclusion that the activity of topo II is modulated by its phosphorylated state is not valid. We emphasize that the studies on the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of topo II must be done and interpreted very carefully."
