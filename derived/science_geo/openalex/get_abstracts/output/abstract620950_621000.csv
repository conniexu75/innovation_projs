https://openalex.org/W2898215009,"We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples spanning 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709 transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. These data reveal genetic risk loci of cancer predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in cancer, identify gene-regulatory interactions underlying cancer immune evasion, and pinpoint noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in cancer to advance diagnosis and therapy."

An alternative would be differential sorption in microporous materials. Most of these materials bind ethylene more strongly that ethane, but adsorption of ethane would be more efficient. Li et al. found that a metal-organic framework containing iron-peroxo sites bound ethane more strongly than ethylene and could be used to separate the gases at ambient conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2898514070,"The spatial organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation."
https://openalex.org/W2898289679,"Limited proteolysis of gasdermin D (GSDMD) generates an N-terminal pore-forming fragment that controls pyroptosis in macrophages. GSDMD is processed via inflammasome-activated caspase-1 or -11. It is currently unknown whether macrophage GSDMD can be processed by other mechanisms. Here, we describe an additional pathway controlling GSDMD processing. The inhibition of TAK1 or IκB kinase (IKK) by the Yersinia effector protein YopJ elicits RIPK1- and caspase-8–dependent cleavage of GSDMD, which subsequently results in cell death. GSDMD processing also contributes to the NLRP3 inflammasome–dependent release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Thus, caspase-8 acts as a regulator of GSDMD-driven cell death. Furthermore, this study establishes the importance of TAK1 and IKK activity in the control of GSDMD cleavage and cytotoxicity."

Zeng et al. found that both ion channels are expressed in sensory neurons of a ganglion complex that contribute to the baroreflex, a homeostatic mechanism that helps to keep blood pressure stable (see the Perspective by Ehmke). Conditional double knockout of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in these neurons abolished the baroreflex and disrupted blood pressure regulation and heart rates in mice. These changes were very similar to those seen in patients with baroreflex failure. In mice, selective activation of PIEZO2-expressing ganglion neurons triggered immediate increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Science , this issue p. 464 ; see also p. 398"
https://openalex.org/W2892103024,"The capability to switch electrically between superconducting and insulating states of matter represents a novel paradigm in the state-of-the-art engineering of correlated electronic systems. An exciting possibility is to turn on superconductivity in a topologically non-trivial insulator, which provides a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only topologically trivial systems, and even those are rare due to the stringent requirement to tune the carrier density over a wide range. Here we report reversible, in-situ electrostatic on off switching of superconductivity in a recently established quantum spin Hall insulator, namely monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2). Fabricated into a van der Waals field effect transistor, the monolayer's ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures Tc up to ~ 1 Kelvin. The critical density for the onset of superconductivity is estimated to be ~ 5 x 10^12 cm^-2, among the lowest for two-dimensional (2D) superconductors. Our results establish monolayer WTe2 as a material platform for engineering novel superconducting nanodevices and topological phases of matter."

We report here that intrinsic superconductivity can be induced in this monolayer 2D TI by mild electrostatic doping, at temperatures below 1 K. The 2D TI-superconductor transition can be easily driven by applying a just a small gate voltage. This discovery offers new possibilities for gate-controlled devices combining superconductivity and topology, and could provide a basis for quantum information schemes based on topological protection."

Some genera of bacteria are transmitted from mothers to offspring, whereas others are acquired from the wider environment. Moeller et al. derived inbred mouse lines from two wild populations of mice with distinct microbiota and monitored the populations' microbiomes for 3 years while they were kept in the same animal facility. The microbiota of the two mouse lineages remained distinct even after 10 generations. Most microbiota genera transmitted vertically.

https://openalex.org/W2898409311,"How membrane viscosity affects respiration In bacteria, energy production by the electron transport chain occurs at cell membranes and can be influenced by the lipid composition of the membrane. Budin et al. used genetic engineering to influence the concentration of unsaturated branched-chain fatty acids and thus control membrane viscosity (see the Perspective by Schon). Experimental measurements and mathematical modeling indicated that rates of respiratory metabolism and rates of cell growth were dependent on membrane viscosity and its effects on diffusion. Experiments on yeast mitochondria also showed similar effects. Maintaining efficient respiration may thus place evolutionary constraints on cellular lipid composition.

Across these species, many convergent traits have emerged, including the presence or absence of horizontal stripes. Kratochwil et al. show that the appearance or loss of stripes is related to changes in the agouti-related peptide 2 gene, which acts as a kind of on-off switch for stripe generation (see the Perspective by Gante).

https://openalex.org/W2805521754,"Tailored quantum states of light can be created via a transfer of collective quantum states of matter to light modes. Such collective quantum states emerge in interacting many-body systems if thermal fluctuations are overcome by sufficient interaction strengths. Therefore, typically ultracold temperatures or strong confinement are required. We show that the exaggerated interactions between giant Rydberg atoms allow for collective quantum states even above room temperature. The emerging Rydberg blockade allows then only for a single Rydberg excitation. We experimentally implement a four-wave mixing scheme to demonstrate an on-demand single-photon source. The combination of glass cell technology, identical atoms, and operation around room temperature promises scalability and integrability. This approach has the potential for various applications in quantum information processing and communication."

It comprises a complex III dimer flanked on either side by individual complex IV subunits. Complex III and IV associate so that electrons can be transferred from quinol in complex III to the oxygen reduction center in complex IV by way of a bridging cytochrome subunit. We observed a superoxide dismutase-like subunit at the periplasmic face, which may be responsible for detoxification of superoxide formed by complex III. The structure reveals features of an established drug target and provides a foundation for the development of treatments for human tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2897037924,"Adhesion to the extracellular matrix persists during mitosis in most cell types. However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify 'reticular adhesions', a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division."
https://openalex.org/W2898591134,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is one of very few cytokines produced in a latent form, requiring activation to exert any of its vastly diverse effects on development, immunity, and cancer. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress immune cells within close proximity by activating latent TGF-β1 presented by GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant) to integrin αVβ8 on their surface. We solved the crystal structure of GARP:latent TGF-β1 bound to an antibody that stabilizes the complex and blocks release of active TGF-β1. This finding reveals how GARP exploits an unusual medley of interactions, including fold complementation by the amino terminus of TGF-β1, to chaperone and orient the cytokine for binding and activation by αVβ8. Thus, this work further elucidates the mechanism of antibody-mediated blockade of TGF-β1 activation and immunosuppression by Tregs."

https://openalex.org/W2898473057,"MLKL is a central mediator for necroptosis. Its knockout significantly relieves acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its upstream regulatory mechanism in AKI has not been fully elucidated. We recently reviewed how microRNAs (miRNAs), a type of well-studied epigenetic regulator, play critical roles in AKI. Here, we evaluated miRNAs that potentially target MLKL and evaluated their function in human tubular epithelial cells in response to toxic and ischemic insults. TargetScan analysis showed that miR-194-5P, miR-338-3P, miR-500a-3P, and miR-577 had MLKL binding sites. Although all 4 miRNAs are reduced in AKI, our data show that only hsa-miR-500a-3P was significantly suppressed in cisplatin-treated human tubular epithelial (HK2) cells. We further found that hsa-miR-500a-3P alleviated cisplatin-induced HK2 cell death, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. In addition, overexpression of hsa-miR-500a-3P decreased kidney injury molecule-1 mRNA and protein levels. Real-time PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence data show that hsa-miR-500a-3P protected against inflammatory response, evidenced by decreased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8. Further, hsa-miR-500a-3P attenuated P65 NF-κB phosphorylation and promoter activity. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter assay showed that hsa-miR-500a-3P bound the 3'UTR of MLKL, thereby suppressing phosphorylation and membrane translocation of MLKL. In agreement with these findings, we identified that overexpression of hsa-miR-500a-3P attenuated cell injury and the inflammatory response in response to sodium azide treatment in an in vitro model. Results show that circulating exosomes from patients with AKI down-regulated miR-500a-3P, which suppressed cell injury and inflammation in HK2 cells. hsa-miR-500a-3P alleviated toxic and ischemic insults that were triggered by cell necroptosis and the inflammatory response in human HK2 cells by targeting MLKL. This may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of AKI.-Jiang, L., Liu, X.-Q., Ma, Q., Yang, Q., Gao, L., Li, H.-D., Wang, J.-N., Wei, B., Wen, J., Li, J., Wu, Y.-G., Meng, X.-M. hsa-miR-500a-3P alleviates kidney injury by targeting MLKL-mediated necroptosis in renal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2898210146,"Fat tissue, overgrowing in obesity, promotes the progression of various carcinomas. Clinical and animal model studies indicate that adipose stromal cells (ASC), the progenitors of adipocytes, are recruited by tumors and promote tumor growth as tumor stromal cells. Here, we investigated the role of ASC in cancer chemoresistance and invasiveness, the attributes of tumor aggressiveness. By using human cell co-culture models, we demonstrate that ASC induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells. Our results for the first time demonstrate that ASC interaction renders cancer cells more migratory and resistant to docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and cisplatin chemotherapy. To confirm these findings in vivo, we compared cancer aggressiveness in lean and obese mice grafted with prostate tumors. We show that obesity promotes EMT in cancer cells and tumor invasion into the surrounding fat tissue. A hunter-killer peptide D-CAN, previously developed for targeted ASC ablation, suppressed the obesity-associated EMT and cancer progression. Importantly, cisplatin combined with D-CAN was more effective than cisplatin alone in suppressing growth of mouse prostate cancer allografts and xenografts even in non-obese mice. Our data demonstrate that ASC promote tumor aggressiveness and identify them as a target of combination cancer therapy."

The influence of habitat on vertebrate diversification thus remains a persistent question. Sallan et al. studied fossil vertebrates spanning the mid-Paleozoic, including both jawed and jawless fish (see the Perspective by Pimiento). They found that diversification occurred primarily in nearshore environments, with diversified forms later colonizing deeper marine or freshwater habitats. Furthermore, more robust forms remained in the nearshore, whereas more gracile forms moved to deeper waters. This split is similar to current relationships between form and environment in aquatic habitats. Science , this issue p. 460 ; see also p. 402"
https://openalex.org/W2897204017,"The mechanisms that restrict regeneration and maintain cell identity following injury are poorly characterized in higher vertebrates. Following β-cell loss, 1-2% of the glucagon-producing α-cells spontaneously engage in insulin production in mice. Here we explore the mechanisms inhibiting α-cell plasticity. We show that adaptive α-cell identity changes are constrained by intra-islet insulin- and Smoothened-mediated signalling, among others. The combination of β-cell loss or insulin-signalling inhibition, with Smoothened inactivation in α- or δ-cells, stimulates insulin production in more α-cells. These findings suggest that the removal of constitutive 'brake signals' is crucial to neutralize the refractoriness to adaptive cell-fate changes. It appears that the maintenance of cell identity is an active process mediated by repressive signals, which are released by neighbouring cells and curb an intrinsic trend of differentiated cells to change."

The hyperactivation of WNT/β-catenin signaling is the major cause of tumorigenesis, but the mechanism in tumors such as hepatoma remains unclear. Here, we observed that WNT3A manifested the hyperactivity in β-catenin–dependent signaling after binding to FZD’s competitive inhibitory molecule secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2). To understand the mechanism of FZDs in the presence of SFRP2, we explored how FZDs can bind and activate the LRP5/6 signalosome independently of WNT glycoproteins. Our findings further revealed that oligomerizations of FZDs and LRP5/6 can integrate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled into the LRP5/6 signalosome, resulting in a robust activation of ligand-independent β-catenin signaling. We propose that besides WNT-bridged FZD–WNT–LRP5/6 protein complexes, the homo- and hetero-oligomerizations of WNT receptors may contribute to the formation of the LRP5/6 signalosome on the cell surface. Of note, we identified four highly expressed FZDs in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, all of which significantly promoted ligand-independent LRP5/β-catenin signaling. As FZDs are ectopically expressed in numerous tumors, our findings may provide a new perspective on tumor pathologies.

At the same time, the structural analyses of WNT glycoproteins as well as their receptors also provide interesting information regarding the establishment of LRP5/6–FZD signalosome.

Hence, these observations strongly suggest that the arrangement of the LRP5/6 signalosome may be variable rather than a simple oligomerization of trimeric FZD–WNT–LRP5/6 protein complex. In addition, during signalosome formation on the cell surface, whether or not the simultaneously binding of WNT glycoproteins to LRP5/6 and FZDs is essential is still unknown. In fact, there is still a lack of sufficient biochemical and structural evidence for simultaneous binding of a WNT ligand to a Frizzled receptor and an LRP5/6 receptor. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that the large-sized LRP6 signalosome can also be induced by APC loss in tumor cells regardless of the presence or absence of WNT glycoproteins (13Saito-Diaz K.

Recently, the function of FZDs in the LRP5/6 signalosome has been challenged as several studies have demonstrated that the secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), the conserved inhibitors competing with FZDs to bind to WNT glycoproteins, can promote, but not inhibit, ligand-dependent β-catenin signaling. These observations contradict the established mechanism for FZDs in the canonical WNT pathway. Unlike LRP5/6 proteins, which appear to possess intrinsic capability of inducing intracellular β-catenin signaling (14Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr 3rd, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S.

In structure, FZDs resemble G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) (16Kilander M.B. Petersen J. Andressen K.W. Ganji R.S. Levy F.O. Schuster J. Dahl N. Bryja V. Schulte G. Disheveled regulates precoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins to Frizzled 6.FASEB J. 2014; 28 (24500924): 2293-230510.1096/fj.13-246363Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Dijksterhuis J.P.

Therefore, except for the CRD crucial for binding to WNT glycoproteins, the role of other structure modules on FZDs in the formation of the LRP5/6-FZD signalosome and subsequent signaling transduction is not fully understood. Here, we confirmed that WNT3A could induce β-catenin signaling more strongly after binding to SFRP2. Although the binding of FZD5 to WNT3A was inhibited by SFRP2, the regulation of FZD5 in the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway appeared to be unaffected by the presence of SFRP2. A previous report has demonstrated that the homo-oligomerization of LRP6 via LDLR repeats is required for the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling (18Chen J. Yan H. Ren D.N. Yin Y. Li Z. He Q. Wo D. Ho M.S. Chen Y. Liu Z. Yang J. Liu S. Zhu W. LRP6 dimerization through its LDLR domain is required for robust canonical Wnt pathway activation.Cell.

In the current study, we further revealed that the hetero-oligomerization of FZD5 and LRP5 could induce robust activation of β-catenin signaling in a ligand-independent manner and that the oligomerization between the FZD5 extracellular N terminus and the LDLR repeats of LRP5 was critical for this ligand-independent mechanism. Moreover, we also observed the homo-oligomerization of FZD5, which may also be involved in initiation of canonical WNT signals on the cell surface. Furthermore, the state of receptor oligomerization within the LRP5/6 signalosome may be involved in the configuration of the extracellular and intracellular signaling axis for canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling transduction. Therefore, these findings provide novel insight into the architecture of the LRP5/6 signalosome and the underlying mechanisms for fine-tuning the signaling axis according to physiological or pathological changes of cells or tissues. As the SFRPs resemble the ligand-binding CRD of the FZD family and thereby can compete with FZDs for binding to WNT glycoproteins, they have been identified as the largest family of secreted WNT inhibitors. However, a number of recent studies demonstrate that SFRPs, such as SFRP1 and SFRP2, can also act as agonists in canonical WNT/β-catenin–dependent physiologies and pathologies (19Xavier C.P.

To determine the mechanism underlying SFRP2 regulation, purified WNT3A proteins were preincubated with an excess amount of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SFRP2-conditioned medium (CM) for 6 h and then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and β-catenin–responsive TOPFlash reporter assays, respectively (Fig. 1A). The result of co-IP experiments showed that ∼90% of input WNT3A proteins was precipitated by SFRP2-HA immobilized on beads (Fig. 1B), indicating that WNT3A proteins were nearly completely embedded by SFRP2-HA molecules. At the same time, WNT3A proteins embedded by SFRP2 exhibited a much stronger agonistic ability than free WNT3A proteins in the β-catenin–responsive TOPFlash reporter assays (Fig. 1C). In addition, we also confirmed this agonistic activity in other cells such as U2OS osteosarcoma cells and C2C12 pluripotent precursor cells and observed similar regulation of SFRP1 in canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling (data not shown). By contrast, when cells were pretreated with vehicle or SFRP2 CM for 6 h and then CM was withdrawn, the subsequent WNT3A-stimulated β-catenin signaling in both vehicle- and SFRP2-pretreated cells was comparable (Fig. 1D). The immunofluorescence against β-catenin proteins validated that the presence of SFRP2 could really enhance WNT3A-mediated stabilization of intracellular β-catenin proteins (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the presence of SFRP2 significantly accelerated WNT3A-mediated accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin proteins (Fig. 1F) and enhanced the sensitivity of cells responding to WNT3A (Fig. 1G). Taking these results together, we conclude that SFRP2 elicits the enhanced WNT3A-dependent β-catenin stabilization by competitively binding to WNT3A rather than other cell surface molecules. The binding of WNT glycoproteins to FZDs is essential to canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling. Hence, several indirect mechanisms have been proposed to explain the unexpected agonistic activity of SFRP1/2, for example via forming a complex with FZDs, inhibiting noncanonical WNT signaling, or promoting the spread of WNT glycoproteins among tissues (23Brinkmann E.M.

Here, we showed that SFRP2 did bind to WNT3A with a higher affinity (Fig. 2A) and could inhibit the interaction of WNT3A with the CRD derived from the N terminus of Frizzled-5 (FZD5-N) (Fig. 2B). The result that SFRP2 suppresses but does not participate in WNT3A–FZD5-N protein complexes seems to rule out the possibility of SFRP2–WNT3A–FZD trimeric complexes. Interestingly, we further detected a high ratio (>2.0) of WNT3A:SFRP2 in SFRP2–WNT3A coimmunoprecipitation complexes (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the SFRP2–WNT3A complex may not be composed in a one-to-one manner. There have been reports that the C-terminal netrin-related motif (NTR) but not the CRD of SFRP1 is also capable of binding to Wingless (26Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. Secreted frizzled-related protein-1 binds directly to Wingless and is a biphasic modulator of Wnt signaling.J. Biol.

However, our result clearly showed that the CRD but not the NTR of SFRP2 is responsible for binding to WNT3A (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, deletion of the CRD completely abolished SFRP2-mediated enhancement in WNT3A/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 2E). In addition, although the NTR could not bind to WNT3A, its absence impaired SFRP2 regulation, but only moderately (Fig. 2E). In conclusion, these results support that CRD-dependent competitive binding to WNT3A is pivotal in SFRP2 regulation. Next, we used the protein-serine O-palmitoleoyltransferase porcupine (PORCN) inhibitor LGK974 (27Liu J. Pan S. Hsieh M.H. Ng N. Sun F. Wang T. Kasibhatla S. Schuller A.G. Li A.G. Cheng D. Li J. Tompkins C. Pferdekamper A. Steffy A. Cheng J. et al.Targeting Wnt-driven cancer through the inhibition of Porcupine by LGK974.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24277854): 20224-2022910.1073/pnas.1314239110Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) to block the production of noncanonical WNT glycoproteins. Fig. 2F shows that transfected WNT11-mediated suppression of WNT3A/β-catenin signaling was well restored by LGK974 treatment; however, the activity of WNT3A or SFRP2-embedded WNT3A could not be counteracted by LGK974 treatment, strongly ruling out potential inhibition of endogenous noncanonical WNT glycoproteins in SFRP2 regulation. Unlike R-spondin 1, which can facilitate both autocrine and paracrine activities of WNT3A glycoproteins, SFRP2 could only act on paracrine WNT3A proteins (Fig. 2G). To further confirm this finding, cells were transfected with WNT1 or WNT3A plasmids and with TOPFlash reporter separately. The reporter assays showed that both paracrine WNT1 and WNT3A could be similarly enhanced by SFRP2 supplement (Fig. 2H). Therefore, these results demonstrate that SFRP2 regulates the paracrine activity of WNT glycoproteins. Given that SFRP2 competes with FZDs to bind to WNT glycoproteins, we then set out to investigate whether the signaling transduction by LRP5/6 or FZDs can be affected by SFRP2. SFRP2 could not regulate LRP5 itself but significantly promoted ligand-dependent LRP5/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3A). Moreover, SFRP2 could also augment WNT3A-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, although the binding of FZD5 to WNT3A could be inhibited by SFRP2 (Fig. 2B), FZD5-mediated WNT3A/β-catenin signaling was not perturbed by SFRP2, which unexpectedly exhibited a superposition effect on WNT3A/β-catenin signaling rather than the mutual repulsion in the presence of SFRP2 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, perturbation of the binding of FZDs to WNT3A by SFRP2 seems not to interfere with signaling transduction modulated by both LRP5/6 and FZDs. We therefore speculate that, in addition to binding to the canonical WNT glycoproteins, there may be other mechanism for FZDs to participate in the activation of the LRP5/6 signalosome. Indeed, overexpression of LRP5 along with FZD5 resulted in a much stronger ability to activate β-catenin signaling than LRP5 alone, but DKK1 had no effect (Fig. 3D), suggesting that FZD5-regulated LRP5 activation is independent of the binding of WNT glycoproteins to LRP5. To further exclude the potential regulation of endogenous canonical WNT glycoproteins, we treated cells with PORCN inhibitor LGK974. The activities of the transfected WNT1 or WNT3A plasmids, but not WNT3A proteins, were completely suppressed, indicating that LGK974 can efficiently block the production of canonical WNT family glycoproteins (Fig. 3E). However, when LGK974 was applied to FZD5-activated LRP5/β-catenin signaling, it did not show inhibition like that in cells transfected with WNT1 or WNT3A (Fig. 3E). In addition to FZD5, other members of Frizzled receptors, such as FZD3 and FZD4, could also activate the LRP5 signalosome (Fig. 3F). Taking these results together, we conclude that FZDs can activate LRP5/β-catenin signaling independently of the canonical WNT glycoproteins. Next, we further investigated how FZDs activate the LRP5/6 signalosome. The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone MESD, which regulates LRP5/6 maturation and membrane localization (28Hsieh J.C. Lee L. Zhang L. Wefer S. Brown K. DeRossi C. Wines M.E. Rosenquist T. Holdener B.C. Mesd encodes an LRP5/6 chaperone essential for specification of mouse embryonic polarity.Cell. 2003; 112 (12581525): 355-36710.1016/S0092-8674(03)00045-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), could significantly enhance FZD5-activated LRP5/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3G), suggesting that ligand-independent regulation of FZDs favors plasma membrane–localized LRP5/6. Of note, overexpression of FZD5 did not evidently change the key components within the LRP5/6 signalosome, such as LRP5/6, DVL3, and AXIN1, except for the hyperphosphorylation of DVL3 (data not shown). However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed strong interaction of FZD5 with LRP5 (Fig. 3H) or with LRP6 (Fig. 3I). The endogenous interaction between FZD5 and LRP5 could be validated in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, which harbors strong constitutive canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway activity (Fig. 3J). Importantly, the interaction between LRP5 and FZD5 was free of WNT1 or WNT3A stimulation (Fig. 3K) but could be mildly regulated by AXIN1 and GSK3β (Fig. 3L), two key modulators for LRP5/6 signalosome activation (6Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C. Wnt induces LRP6 signalosomes and promotes dishevelled-dependent LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 316 (17569865): 1619-162210.1126/science.1137065Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence for ligand-independent FZD–LRP5/6 signaling transduction. To further access the molecular basis for the interaction of FZD5 and LRP5 in the LRP5/6 signalosome, we first mapped the critical amino acid sequences responsible for FZD5–LRP5/6 interaction. FZD5 is composed of three parts: the extracellular N terminus containing a CRD and a linker sequence between CRD and the first transmembrane helix, six extracellular and intracellular loop sequences, and a cytosolic tail of ∼60 amino acid residues. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the FZD5 extracellular domain (FZD5-ECD) was sufficient for binding to LRP5 or LRP6 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the interaction of FZD5-ECD with LRP5 and LRP6 was not regulated by the CRD but instead by the linker sequence between CRD and first transmembrane helix (Fig. 4B). The extracellular domain of LRP5/6 possesses four β-propeller motifs that alternate with four epidermal growth factor–like repeats (P1E1–P4E4), which are followed by three LDLR type A repeats. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that P1E1–P4E4 of LRP5 are dispensable for the interaction of LRP5 with FZD5-ECD, but LDLR repeats are required (Fig. 4C). It has been reported that P1E1–P4E4 of LRP6 bind to the extracellular loop sequences of FZD8 by which LRP6 can suppress noncanonical WNT/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling in metastasis cancer cells (29Ren D.N. Chen J. Li Z. Yan H. Yin Y. Wo D. Zhang J. Ao L. Chen B. Ito T.K. Chen Y. Liu Z. Li Y. Yang J. Lu X. et al.LRP5/6 directly bind to Frizzled and prevent Frizzled-regulated tumour metastasis.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25902418)690610.1038/ncomms7906Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we also confirmed that the loop and cytosolic tail modules (FZD5-loop-tail) could still bind to LRP5, but the affinity seemed to be weaker than that of FZD5-ECD (Fig. 4D). Taking these results together, we conclude that the FZD5–LRP5 interaction is a multisite-mediated protein interaction. To investigate the regulatory role of FZD5–LRP5 interaction, we introduced different truncated mutants of FZD5 or LRP5 into HEK293T cells and examined their abilities in ligand-independent β-catenin signaling. Compared with WT LRP5, both LRP5-ΔPE (P1E1–P4E4 repeat deletion) and LRP5-ΔPE-LDLR (extracellular domain deletion) possess strong constitutive activity (Fig. 5A); these mutants have been previously reported to be desensitized to the canonical WNT signals (14Mao J.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that suppress their cancer-driving potential to maintain tissue homeostasis are unknown. By employing assays for the direct and quantitative assessment of cell fate choices in vivo, we show that oncogenic activation of PI3K–AKT, the most commonly activated oncogenic pathway in cancer, promotes the differentiation and cell cycle exit of epidermal progenitors. As a result, oncogenic PI3K–AKT-activated epidermis exhibits a growth disadvantage even though its cells are more proliferative. We then sought to uncover the underlying mechanism behind oncogene-induced differentiation via a series of genetic screens in vivo. An AKT substrate, SH3RF1, is identified as a specific promoter of epidermal differentiation that has no effect on proliferation. Our study provides evidence for a direct, cell autonomous mechanism that can suppresses progenitor cell renewal and block clonal expansion of epidermal cells bearing a common and activating mutation in Pik3ca. Ying et al. show that oncogenic PI3K–AKT activation, through the suppression of SH3RF1, induces epidermal differentiation, inhibits progenitor self-renewal and prevents tumour initiation."

https://openalex.org/W2895930912,"Epithelial integrity is maintained by the cytoskeleton and through cell adhesion. However, it is not yet known how a deregulated cytoskeleton is associated with cancer. We identified cancer-related regulator of actin dynamics (CRAD) as frequently mutated or transcriptionally downregulated in colorectal cancer. We found that CRAD stabilizes the cadherin-catenin-actin complex via capping protein inhibition. The loss of CRAD inhibits F-actin polymerization and subsequently disrupts the cadherin-catenin-actin complex, which leads to β-catenin release and Wnt signalling hyperactivation. In mice, CRAD knockout induces epithelial cell integrity loss and Wnt signalling activation, resulting in the development of intestinal mucinous adenoma. With APC mutation, CRAD knockout initiates and accelerates mucinous and invasive adenoma development in the colorectum. These results define CRAD as a tumour suppressor, the inactivation of which deregulates the cytoskeleton and hyperactivates Wnt signalling thus initiating mucinous colorectal cancer. Our study reveals the unexpected roles of an actin cytoskeletal regulator in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and suppressing tumorigenesis."

Once TNFα binds to its receptor, signaling molecules such as the TNF receptor 1-associated DEATH domain, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are recruited and form the receptor-signaling complex.

In addition, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) directly and indirectly suppress caspases activation (10Karin M. Lin A.

Recently, researchers discovered M1-linked ubiquitination to be a novel type of ubiquitination involved in the TNFα signaling pathway, especially NF-κB signaling (16Iwai K. Tokunaga F. Linear polyubiquitination: a new regulator of NF-κB activation.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10 (19543231): 706-71310.1038/embor.2009.144Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To date, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) was identified as the only ligase complex for M1-linked ubiquitination. LUBAC has three components: RNF31 (also named as HOIP), HOIL-1(also named as HOIL-1L or RBCK1), and Sharpin. In particular, RNF31 has a major role in activation of NF-κB signaling by conjugating M1-linked ubiquitination chains with NEMO and RIPK1, whereas HOIL-1 and Sharpin are involved in the functional activation of RNF31 (17Iwai K. Fujita H. Sasaki Y. Linear ubiquitin chains: NF-κB signalling, cell death and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 (25027653): 503-50810.1038/nrm3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Genetic studies demonstrated that defects in LUBAC components attenuate TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and gene expression (18Gerlach B. Cordier S.M. Schmukle A.C. Emmerich C.H. Rieser E. Haas T.L.

Additionally, biochemical and mouse developmental data have suggested that LUBAC has a role in apoptosis signaling. For example, Sharpin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were highly susceptible to TNFα-induced cell death (20Tokunaga F. Nakagawa T. Nakahara M. Saeki Y. Taniguchi M. Sakata S. Tanaka K.

However, the exact molecular mechanism of M1-linked ubiquitination in TNFα-mediated cell death remains largely unknown. Because the deregulation of cell survival and death is the main cause of many diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disease, the clear understanding of cell death regulation is critical for the therapeutic strategies to control these diseases. In the present study, we determined the molecular mechanism of RNF31 in the regulation of apoptosis pathway. We identified cFLIP as a new substrate of LUBAC, and found that LUBAC conjugates M1-linked ubiquitination to cFLIP, and stabilizes it to protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. These findings provide molecular insight into the regulatory mechanism of apoptosis by M1-linked ubiquitination, and modulating this mechanism may be a novel therapeutic approach for diseases oriented from deregulation of cell death. Previous studies have shown that loss of LUBAC components could promote TNFα-induced apoptosis (18Gerlach B. Cordier S.M. Schmukle A.C. Emmerich C.H. Rieser E. Haas T.L. Webb A.I. Rickard J.A.

But it is unclear whether LUBAC directly regulates apoptosis. First, we generated stable HeLa cells in which RNF31 was silenced using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system and compared them with control HeLa cells. After TNFα plus cycloheximide (CHX) stimulation, RNF31-silenced cells were highly sensitive to apoptosis, which were indicated by cleavage of caspase 3/8 and PARP (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Smac is a mitochondrial protein that can be released into the cytosol to promote caspase activation in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase 9 pathway (31Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Smac, a mitochondrial protein that promotes cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation by eliminating IAP inhibition.Cell. 2000; 102 (10929711): 33-4210.1016/S0092-8674(00)00008-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). TNFα plus Smac mimetics stimulation also triggered more apoptosis in RNF31-silenced cells (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which RNF31 regulates the apoptosis pathway, we examined the levels of anti-apoptotic molecules in TNFα-treated HeLa cells. RNF31 silencing did not alter the level of most of anti-apoptotic molecules, including BCL2 family proteins (BCLxL, BCL2, and NOXA), MCL-1 and cIAP2 (Fig. 1C), but we found that the level of cFLIP decreased markedly in RNF31-silenced HeLa cells upon treatment with TNFα and CHX (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1C). To confirm this result, we generated RNF31 knockout cells by CRISPR-Cas9 technique. After TNFα and Smac mimetics stimulation, cFLIP also degraded faster in RNF31 knockout cells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D). Above all, deficiency of RNF31 could promote TNFα-induced apoptosis and accelerate the degradation of cFLIP. To determine whether the rapid decrease of cFLIP in RNF31-deficient cells depended on activation of TNFα signaling, we treated control and RNF31-silenced HeLa cells with CHX only. We observed a similar pattern of decreased cFLIP in control and RNF31-silenced cells upon CHX treatment (Fig. 2A), indicating that loss of RNF31 did not alter the basal turnover rate for cFLIP. Previous studies reported that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib reduced the severity of skin problems in Sharpin-deficient mice (32Liang Y. Seymour R.E. Sundberg J.P. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling retards eosinophilic dermatitis in SHARPIN-deficient mice.J. Invest.

Furthermore, cFLIP also was identified as a substrate of caspase 8 and can be cleaved by activated caspase 8 during apoptosis (9Budd R.C. Yeh W.C. Tschopp J. cFLIP regulation of lymphocyte activation and development.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 (16498450): 196-20410.1038/nri1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). So, we pre-treated HeLa cells with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to determine whether the decreased cFLIP resulted from caspase activity or occurred in a degradation-dependent manner. We found that pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK fully inhibited cleavage of PARP and caspase 8 but only slightly restored the level of cFLIP (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2A). However, pre-treatment with MG132 fully blocked the decrease of cFLIP, cleavage of PARP and caspase 8(Fig. 2B and Fig. S2A), suggesting that the TNFα/CHX-induced decrease of cFLIP mainly results from the proteasome-dependent degradation. To confirm the role of proteasome-mediated degradation in the increased sensitivity of RNF31-silenced cells to apoptosis, we pre-treated control and RNF31-silenced HeLa cells with MG132 and then induced apoptosis with stimulation of TNFα plus CHX. Pre-treatment with MG132 completely blocked the decrease of cFLIP in RNF31-silenced cells (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2B), and the apoptosis sensitization in RNF31-silencing cells was also fully blocked (Fig. 2C), indicating that the sensitization of RNF31-silencing cells to apoptosis is mainly mediated by a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Moreover, in RNF31 knockout cells, degradation of cFLIP is fully suppressed by MG132 treatment, but not by Z-VAD-FMK treatment (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2C). Taken together, these data suggested that deficiency of RNF31 promotes cFLIP degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Next, we examined whether RNF31 have a direct interaction with cFLIP. We expressed Myc-tagged RNF31 together with FLAG-tagged cFLIP in HEK293T cells, and found that RNF31 were co-precipitated with cFLIP (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2D). In addition, stimulation of HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged cFLIP with TNFα led to inducible interaction between cFLIP and LUBAC components, including RNF31 and Sharpin (Fig. 3B). Similarly, TNFα induces endogenous interaction between RNF31 and cFLIP (Fig. 3C). RNF31 and cFLIP are composed of multiple domains (Fig. 3D). Therefore, we determined which domains in cFLIP and RNF31 are responsible for their interaction with each other. The domain mapping by expressing full-length cFLIP together with different RNF31 domains indicated that the RING-IBR-RING (RBR) domain of RNF31 is essential for its binding with cFLIP (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment with full-length RNF31 and constructs encoding different cFLIP domains demonstrated that death effector domain 1 (DED1) of cFLIP is critical for the interaction between RNF31 and cFLIP (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data suggested that the RBR domain of RNF31 and DED1 domain of cFLIP are responsible for their interaction. RNF31 directly interact with cFLIP, indicating that cFLIP may be a substrate of LUBAC components. To test our hypothesis, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay to determine whether cFLIP is a substrate of LUBAC. We incubated recombinant cFLIP with or without recombinant LUBAC, E1, E2, and lysine KO ubiquitin (all lysine residues are mutated to arginine), and then detected M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP. The results showed LUBAC conjugates M1-linked ubiquitination chains to cFLIP (Fig. 4A). However, catalytically dead mutant C885S of RNF31 failed to induce M1-linked ubiquitination chains to cFLIP (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the catalytic activity of RNF31 is critical for the M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP. Besides, expression of LUBAC promoted M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP as well as the known substrate RIPK1 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B). Because cFLIP degrades rapidly in RNF31-deficient cells through a proteasome-dependent manner, we hypothesized that M1-linked ubiquitination stabilizes cFLIP by competing with Lys-48–linked ubiquitination, thereby suppressing proteasome-mediated degradation of cFLIP. We detected the Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of cFLIP in control and RNF31-silenced HeLa cells introduced with FLAG-cFLIP, and observed that silencing of RNF31 promoted Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of cFLIP at the endogenous level upon treatment with TNFα and CHX (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2E). These results were consistent with the results of MG132 treatment, and suggested that M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP can compete with Lys-48 ubiquitination to stabilize cFLIP. To determine which residues in cFLIP are the sites for RNF31-mediated ubiquitination and contribute to the regulation of apoptosis, we performed LC and MS to find the sites of M1-linked ubiquitination on cFLIP by LUBAC (Fig. 5A). We co-expressed FLAG-tagged cFLIP with LUBAC complex in HEK293T cells, and expression of cFLIP alone as control. Using FLAG antibody-conjugated beads to pull down the cFLIP protein, and then detected ubiquitination sites on cFLIP by mass spectrometry. Finally, six candidate ubiquitination sites that were dependent on the expression of LUBAC were detected (Lys-49, Lys-69, Lys-154, Lys-157, Lys-351, and Lys-353) (Fig. 5A). Because the above data suggested that M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP can protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis, we hypothesized that mutations of these M1-linked ubiquitination sites on cFLIP should promote TNFα-induced apoptosis. We replaced those identified lysine residues with arginine (K49R, K69R, K154R, K157R, K351R, K353R) in different combinations, and expressed these cFLIP mutants in cFLIP KO Jurkat cells generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 method (Fig. S3, A–C). We then monitored the sensitivity of these cells to TNFα/CHX-induced apoptosis. The results showed that cFLIP KO cells reconstituted with cFLIP-K351R/K353R double mutations were more sensitive to TNFα/CHX-induced apoptosis than cells reconstituted with other cFLIP mutants, but comparable with cells expressing the cFLIP mutant with all six lysine residues converted to arginine (simplify to K6R) (Fig. S3D), indicating that Lys-351 and Lys-353 are the main M1-linked ubiquitination sites contributing to the protection of cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. To further determine which M1-linked ubiquitination site in cFLIP is functionally important for preventing TNFα-induced apoptosis, we generated cFLIP mutants with K351R or K353R alone and expressed these mutants in cFLIP KO cells. We found that cells expressing K351R or K353R enhance both the TNFα/Smac mimetics and TNFα/CHX-induced apoptosis compared with WT cFLIP-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5, B and C, and Fig. S3, E and F). These data indicated that Lys-351 and Lys-353 may play a redundant role in protecting cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. Consistent with the annexin V staining, we found that more and earlier cleavage of PARP and caspase 8 in cFLIP KO cells reconstituted with K351R/K353R double mutant (Fig. 5D), and mutated cFLIP also degraded faster than WT cFLIP (Fig. 5D). Finally, we monitored the NF-κB activation in K351R/K353R double-mutated cells. The results showed that K351R/K353R mutation of cFLIP did not affect TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, indicated by phosphorylation of IκBα, degradation of IκBα, and translocated p65 in the nucleus (Fig. 5E). These results suggested that linear ubiquitination of cFLIP protected the cell from TNFα-induced apoptosis through a NF-κB-independent manner. To further confirm whether Lys-351 and Lys-353 are the main M1-linked ubiquitination sites of cFLIP, we performed the ubiquitin assay in HEK293T cells. The results also showed that mutation of K351R/K353R significantly blocked M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP compared with WT cFLIP (Fig. 6A). Because we proposed that M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP could compete Lys-48–linked ubiquitination, we detected M1-ubiquitination and Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of WT and mutated cFLIP in reconstituted Jurkat cells. After TNFα/CHX treatment, the M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP was significantly inhibited in cFLIP-K351R/K353R cells, but Lys-48–linked ubiquitination was significantly increased (Fig. 6B). Together, these results indicate that M1-linked ubiquitination of cFLIP on Lys-351 and Lys-353 competes with Lys-48-linked ubiquitination, which contributes to protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7).Figure 7Proposed model of LUBAC-mediated ubiquitination on cFLIP in the TNFα receptor signaling pathway. In normal conditions, linear ubiquitination of cFLIP induced by LUBAC inhibits Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of cFLIP, thereby suppressing caspase 8 activity and apoptosis process. When LUBAC is deficient, cFLIP cannot be ubiquitinated by LUBAC. Instead, cFLIP degrades through Lys-48–linked ubiquitination in a dependent manner, thereby promoting apoptosis process.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, we found that cFLIP was a new substrate of M1-linked ubiquitination and identified the target sites of this modification, reve"
https://openalex.org/W2898489067,"With the rapid increase in cancer survival because of improved diagnosis and therapy in the past decades, cancer treatment–related cardiotoxicity is becoming an urgent healthcare concern. The anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents to date, causes cardiomyopathy by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 promotes resistance against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Here we show that DOX exposure provokes cardiac CDK2 activation and cardiomyocyte cell cycle S phase reentry, resulting in enhanced cellular sensitivity to DOX. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 markedly suppressed DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Conversely, CDK2 overexpression augmented DOX-induced apoptosis. We also found that DOX-induced CDK2 activation in the mouse heart is associated with up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2-like 11 (Bim), a BH3-only protein essential for triggering Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Further experiments revealed that DOX induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through CDK2-dependent expression of Bim. Inhibition of CDK2 with roscovitine robustly repressed DOX-induced mitochondrial depolarization. In a cardiotoxicity model of chronic DOX exposure (5 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks), roscovitine administration significantly attenuated DOX-induced contractile dysfunction and ventricular remodeling. These findings identify CDK2 as a key determinant of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. CDK2 activation is necessary for DOX-induced Bim expression and mitochondrial damage. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 may be a cardioprotective strategy for preventing anthracycline-induced heart damage. With the rapid increase in cancer survival because of improved diagnosis and therapy in the past decades, cancer treatment–related cardiotoxicity is becoming an urgent healthcare concern. The anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents to date, causes cardiomyopathy by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 promotes resistance against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Here we show that DOX exposure provokes cardiac CDK2 activation and cardiomyocyte cell cycle S phase reentry, resulting in enhanced cellular sensitivity to DOX. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 markedly suppressed DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Conversely, CDK2 overexpression augmented DOX-induced apoptosis. We also found that DOX-induced CDK2 activation in the mouse heart is associated with up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2-like 11 (Bim), a BH3-only protein essential for triggering Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Further experiments revealed that DOX induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through CDK2-dependent expression of Bim. Inhibition of CDK2 with roscovitine robustly repressed DOX-induced mitochondrial depolarization. In a cardiotoxicity model of chronic DOX exposure (5 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks), roscovitine administration significantly attenuated DOX-induced contractile dysfunction and ventricular remodeling. These findings identify CDK2 as a key determinant of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. CDK2 activation is necessary for DOX-induced Bim expression and mitochondrial damage. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 may be a cardioprotective strategy for preventing anthracycline-induced heart damage."

In this case, the synchrotron radiation at terahertz frequencies was produced by the nonlinear polarization induced by the light pulse.

https://openalex.org/W2898306085,"Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The interaction of cancer cells with their microenvironment, results in tumor escape or elimination. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a significant role in lung immunoregulation, however their role in LC has been outshined by the study of tumor associated macrophages. Inflammasomes are key components of innate immune responses and can exert either tumor-suppressive or oncogenic functions, while their role in lung cancer is largely unknown. We thus investigated the NLRP3 pathway in Bronchoalveolar Lavage derived alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with primary lung cancer and healthy individuals. IL-1β and IL-18 secretion was significantly higher in unstimulated peripheral blood leukocytes from LC patients, while IL-1β secretion could be further increased upon NLRP3 stimulation. In contrast, in LC AMs, we observed a different profile of IL-1β secretion, characterized mainly by the impairment of IL-1β production in NLRP3 stimulated cells. AMs also exhibited an impaired TLR4/LPS pathway as shown by the reduced induction of IL-6 and TNF-α. Our results support the hypothesis of tumour induced immunosuppression in the lung microenvironment and may provide novel targets for cancer immunotherapy."

However, it is unclear why IgG binds CD16a with more than 10-fold higher affinity than CD16b even though these receptors share more than 97% identity. Here we identified one residue, Gly-129, that contributes to the greater IgG binding affinity of CD16a. The CD16b variant D129G bound IgG1 Fc with 2-fold higher affinity than CD16a and with 90-fold higher affinity than the WT.

https://openalex.org/W2898538513,"Phishing email is one of the biggest risks to online information security due to its ability to exploit human trust and naivety. Prior research has examined whether some people are more susceptible to phishing than others and what characteristics may predict this susceptibility. Given that there are no standardised measures or methodologies to detect phishing susceptibility, results have conflicted. To address this issue, the current study created a 40-item phishing detection task to measure both cognitive and behavioural indicators of phishing susceptibility and false positives (misjudged genuine email). The task is based on current real-life email stimuli (i.e., phishing and genuine) relevant to the student and general population. Extending previous literature we also designed a methodology for assessing phishing susceptibility by allowing participants to indicate perception of maliciousness of each email type and the actions they would take (keep it, trash it or seek further information). This enabled us to: (1) examine the relationships that psychological variables share with phishing susceptibility and false positives-both captured as consistent tendencies; (2) determine the relationships between perceptions of maliciousness with behavioural outcomes and psychological variables; and (3) determine the relationships between these tendencies and email characteristics. In our study, 150 undergraduate psychology students participated in exchange for partial course credit (98 Females; Mean age = 19.70, SD = 2.27). Participants also completed a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests assessing intelligence, pre- and on-task confidence, Big 6 personality, and familiarity/competence in computing and phishing. Results revealed that people showed distinct and robust tendencies for phishing susceptibility and false positives. A series of regression analyses looking at the accuracy of both phishing and false positives detection revealed that human-centred variables accounted for a good degree of variance in phishing susceptibility (about 54%), with perceptions of maliciousness, intelligence, knowledge of phishing, and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. A regression model looking at discriminating false positives has also shown that human-centred variables accounted for a reasonable degree of variance (41%), with perceptions of maliciousness, intelligence and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. Furthermore, the characteristics of the most effective phishing and misjudged genuine email items were profiled. Based on our findings, we suggest that future research should investigate these significant variables in more detail. We also recommend that future research should capture consistent response tendencies to determine vulnerability to phishing and false positives (rather than a one off response to a single email), and use the collection of the most current phishing email obtained from relevant sources to the population. It is important to capture perceptions of maliciousness of email because it is a key predictor of the action taken on the email. It directly predicts accuracy detection of phishing and genuine email, as well as mediating the relationships between some other predictors whose role would have been overlooked if the perceptions were not captured. The study provides the framework of human-centred variables which predict phishing and false positive susceptibility as well as the characteristics of email which most deceive people."

The present study explores the structure–function relationships of flavonoid–GLUT1 interactions. We find that low concentrations of flavonoids act as cis-allosteric activators of sugar uptake, whereas higher concentrations competitively inhibit sugar uptake and noncompetitively inhibit sugar exit. Studies with heterologously expressed human GLUT1, -3, or -4 reveal that quercetin–GLUT1 and –GLUT4 interactions are stronger than quercetin–GLUT3 interactions, that epicatechin gallate (ECG) is more selective for GLUT1, and that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is less GLUT isoform–selective. Docking studies suggest that only one flavonoid can bind to GLUT1 at any instant, but sugar transport and ligand-binding studies indicate that human erythrocyte GLUT1 can bind at least two flavonoid molecules simultaneously. Quercetin and EGCG are each characterized by positive, cooperative binding, whereas ECG shows negative cooperative binding. These findings support recent studies suggesting that GLUT1 forms an oligomeric complex of interacting, allosteric, alternating access transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2898380226,"Bacterial microcompartments encapsulate enzymatic pathways that generate small, volatile, aldehyde intermediates. The Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium microcompartment (RMM) operon from Mycobacterium smegmatis encodes four enzymes, including (S)-1-amino-2-propanol dehydrogenase and a likely propionaldehyde dehydrogenase. We show here that a third enzyme (and its nonmicrocompartment-associated paralog) is a moderately specific (S)-1-amino-2-propanol kinase. We determined the structure of apo-aminopropanol kinase at 1.35 A, revealing that it has structural similarity to hexosamine kinases, choline kinases, and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases. We modeled substrate binding, and tested our model by characterizing key enzyme variants. Bioinformatics analysis established that this enzyme is widespread in Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, and is very commonly associated with a candidate phospholyase. In Rhizobia, aminopropanol kinase is generally associated with aromatic degradation pathways. In the RMM (and the parallel pathway that includes the second paralog), aminopropanol kinase likely degrades aminoacetone through a propanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase-dependent pathway. These enzymatic activities were originally described in Pseudomonas, but the proteins responsible have not been previously identified. Bacterial microcompartments typically co-encapsulate enzymes which can regenerate required co-factors, but the RMM enzymes require four biochemically distinct co-factors with no overlap. This suggests that either the RMM shell can uniquely transport multiple co-factors in stoichiometric quantities, or that all enzymes except the phospho-lyase reside outside of the shell. In summary, aminopropanol kinase is a novel enzyme found in diverse bacteria and multiple metabolic pathways; its presence in the RMM implies that this microcompartment degrades aminoacetone, using a pathway that appears to violate some established precepts as to how microcompartments function."

Skinned SOL muscles and ventricular PMs of R58Q animals exhibited lower contractile force that was not observed in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles of R58Q vs. wild-type-RLC mice, but mutant animals did not display gross muscle weakness in vivo. Consistent with SOL muscle abnormalities in R58Q vs. wild-type mice, myosin ATPase staining revealed a decreased proportion of fiber type I/type II only in SOL muscles but not in the extensor digitorum longus muscles. The similarities between SOL muscles and PMs of R58Q mice were further supported by quantitative proteomics. Differential regulation of proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell-cell interactions, and protein-protein signaling was concurrently observed in the hearts and SOL muscles of R58Q mice.

We found that deletion of the linker region or mutation of the RKKR motif increases the formation of supersized LDs compared with LD formation in cells with WT CIDEC. This enhanced LD fusion activity required the interaction between CIDE-N domains. Mechanistically, we found that the RKKR motif interacts with acidic phospholipids via electrostatic attraction. Loss of this motif disrupted the protein–lipid interaction, resulting in enhanced lipid droplet fusion activity and thus formation of larger LDs.

https://openalex.org/W2898318735,"Optogenetics has become an important tool for perturbing neural circuitry with unparalleled temporal precision and cell-type specificity. However, direct activation of a specific subpopulation of neurons can rapidly modulate the activity of other neurons within the network and may lead to unexpected and complex downstream effects. Here, we have developed a biologically-constrained computational model that exploits these non-intuitive network responses in order to gain insight into underlying properties of the network. We apply this model to data recorded during optogenetic stimulation in the primary visual cortex of the alert macaque. In these experiments, we found that optogenetic depolarization of excitatory neurons often suppressed neuronal responses, consistent with engagement of normalization circuitry. Our model suggests that the suppression seen in these responses may be mediated by slow excitatory and inhibitory conductance channels. Furthermore, the model predicted that the response of the network to optogenetic perturbation depends critically on the relationship between inherent temporal properties of the network and the temporal properties of the opsin. Consistent with model predictions, stimulation of the C1V1TT opsin, an opsin with a fast time constant (tau = 45 ms), caused faster and stronger suppressive effects after laser offset, as compared to stimulation of the slower C1V1T opsin (tau = 60ms). This work illustrates how the non-intuitive network responses that result from optogenetic stimulation can be exploited to gain insight regarding network properties that underlie fundamental neuronal computations, such as normalization.

https://openalex.org/W2949238441,"Aphids, like most animals, mount a diverse set of defenses against pathogens. For aphids, two of the best studied defenses are symbiont-conferred protection and transgenerational wing induction. Aphids can harbor bacterial symbionts that provide protection against pathogens, parasitoids and predators, as well as against other environmental stressors. In response to signals of danger, aphids also protect not themselves but their offspring by producing more winged than unwinged offspring as a way to ensure that their progeny may be able to escape deteriorating conditions. Such transgenerational wing induction has been studied most commonly as a response to overcrowding of host plants and presence of predators, but recent evidence suggests that pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) may also begin to produce a greater proportion of winged offspring when infected with fungal pathogens. Here, we explore this phenomenon further by asking how protective symbionts, pathogen dosage and environmental conditions influence this response. Overall, while we find some evidence that protective symbionts can modulate transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal pathogens, we observe that transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal infection is highly variable. That variability cannot be explained entirely by symbiont association, by pathogen load or by environmental stress, leaving the possibility that a complex interplay of genotypic and environmental factors may together influence this trait."

https://openalex.org/W2898338396,"This paper presents vehicle-to-vehicle telescreen (VVT) and a multicast scheme to disseminate digital signage multimedia services to vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Multimedia dissemination in VANETs is challenging because of the high packet losses (PLs), delays and longer disconnection times, which degrade the network quality of service (QoS) and user quality of experience (QoE). To reduce the PLs and delays, most existing multimedia multicast schemes in VANETs primarily select routes based on longer route expiration times (RET) or lowest path delays. The RET-based schemes suffer less from PLs when there are fewer active multicastings in the network. When the number of active multicastings increases, delay-based schemes suffer less from PLs comparatively. This tradeoff implies to design an adaptive mechanism by mutually complementing the RET-based and delay-based schemes to reduce PLs and delays. In this paper, we propose a multicriteria adaptive opportunistic treecast routing protocol (MAOTRP), which adapts the route selection mechanism according to active multicastings for efficient multimedia dissemination in VVT. The MAOTRP adjusts the weights of route selection parameters, including RET and delays, by considering their contribution in improving packet delivery ratio. MAOTRP extends a tree-based multicast protocol to provide robustness through alternate routes for link failures to reduce PLs. Through several experimental evaluations, we show that the proposed dissemination scheme improves QoS and QoE, and reduces the average disconnection time."

Six months before my Ph.D. thesis was due, I faced a dilemma. The data I had collected over two and a half years made me seriously doubt my main hypothesis, which was based on previous research in my lab—dutifully carried out but perhaps misinterpreted. In my time as a graduate student, I had always worried about unknowingly breaking research rules, such as being too attached to an idea or overselling my findings. This tendency to ruminate led to many philosophical discussions with my patient, supportive supervisor about how scientific research is—and should be—conducted.

Now, I had to make a decision: Would I continue down the path I had laboriously cleared for myself, even though I suspected my conclusions would be flawed? Or would I embark on an investigation of the uncharted territory my results pointed toward, knowing that I might end up with no meaningful data on which to build my thesis?

After a summer holiday on the beach spent thinking and discussing my doubts with a friend and fellow researcher, I chose the latter. Running out of time seemed preferable to producing flawed conclusions.

I spent weeks in the darkness of our microscopy room, collecting preliminary data to convince my supervisor that our previous interpretation was wrong and a very different conclusion made more sense. I was terrified that nothing would come of it, but I also felt the excitement of discovering something novel. I ended up with a less coherent thesis than I had envisioned, but I was proud that it told an honest story about the way science goes sometimes.

Then it came time to find a job. Long before starting the hunt, I had decided that a research career was not for me. Although I wholly enjoyed my Ph.D. experience, I recognized that my tendency to ruminate made me an inefficient scientist. So I looked for opportunities that would keep me out of the lab but still close to research. While trawling through job listings, I was surprised to come across one in which I would be paid to grapple with the same questions that had haunted me during my Ph.D. The title was something I had never heard of before: research integrity officer.

So, what is a research integrity officer? I get closer to answering that each day. I teach courses about good scientific practice and keep myself informed about ethics policies that may affect our researchers. I answer questions from Ph.D. students and professors alike, providing assurance and guidance as best I can. It helps that my own research experience is fresh in my mind. I recall the thrill of results that may cause you to forget about rules and formalities, as well as the sincere wish to do things right and not undermine the reason we do research in the first place: to get as close to a truth as possible.

The main thing I have had to get my head around is that I cannot know everything. Like the researchers I counsel, I have to keep educating myself, keep an open mind, and be humble. I seek advice from legal officers, more experienced administrators, and—not least—the researchers themselves. In this way, I hope to contribute to a more honest, transparent, and accountable scientific community—just what my anxious graduate student self wanted.
