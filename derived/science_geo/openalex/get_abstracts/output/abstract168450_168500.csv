https://openalex.org/W2042216712,"Mammalian cells respond to changes in oxygen availability through a conserved pathway that is regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The alpha subunit of HIF is targeted for degradation under normoxic conditions by a ubiquitin-ligase complex that recognizes a hydroxylated proline residue in HIF. We identified a conserved family of HIF prolyl hydoxylase (HPH) enzymes that appear to be responsible for this posttranslational modification. In cultured mammalian cells, inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the HIF-1alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression of a hypoxia-inducible gene (LDH, encoding lactate dehydrogenase) under normoxic conditions. These findings indicate that HPH is an essential component of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen."

Among the genes identified, the PRL-3 protein tyrosine phosphatase gene was of particular interest. It was expressed at high levels in each of 18 cancer metastases studied but at lower levels in nonmetastatic tumors and normal colorectal epithelium. In 3 of 12 metastases examined, multiple copies of the PRL-3 gene were found within a small amplicon located at chromosome 8q24.3. These data suggest that the PRL-3 gene is important for colorectal cancer metastasis and provide a new therapeutic target for these intractable lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2070122527,"Centromeres are heterochromatic in many organisms, but the mitotic function of this silent chromatin remains unknown. During cell division, newly replicated sister chromatids must cohere until anaphase when Scc1/Rad21-mediated cohesion is destroyed. In metazoans, chromosome arm cohesins dissociate during prophase, leaving centromeres as the only linkage before anaphase. It is not known what distinguishes centromere cohesion from arm cohesion. Fission yeast Swi6 (a Heterochromatin protein 1 counterpart) is a component of silent heterochromatin. Here we show that this heterochromatin is specifically required for cohesion between sister centromeres. Swi6 is required for association of Rad21-cohesin with centromeres but not along chromosome arms and, thus, acts to distinguish centromere from arm cohesion. Therefore, one function of centromeric heterochromatin is to attract cohesin, thereby ensuring sister centromere cohesion and proper chromosome segregation."

We recently found that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII (or Epac 2), interacting with Rim2, a target of the small G protein Rab3, mediates cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent exocytosis in a reconstituted system. In the present study, we investigated the role of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 pathway in incretin-potentiated insulin secretion in native pancreatic β-cells. Treatment of pancreatic islets with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against cAMP-GEFII alone or with the PKA inhibitor H-89 alone inhibited incretin-potentiated insulin secretion ∼50%, while a combination of antisense ODNs and H-89 inhibited the secretion ∼80–90%. The effect of cAMP-GEFII on insulin secretion is mediated by Rim2 and depends on intracellular calcium as well as on cAMP. Treatment of the islets with antisense ODNs attenuated both the first and second phases of insulin secretion potentiated by the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP. These results indicate that the PKA-independent mechanism involving the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 pathway is critical in the potentiation of insulin secretion by incretins.

Insulin secretion from the β-cells is regulated positively and negatively by many intracellular signals generated by various factors, including nutrients, hormones, and neurotransmitters (1Wollheim C.B.

In fact, insulin secretion varies significantly with treatment by adenylyl cyclase activators and inhibitors and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that alter cAMP levels in pancreatic islets (5Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Mayhew D. J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46: 1724-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol.

In addition, phosphorylation of many regulatory proteins by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA)1 in the β-cells has been suggested in the regulation of insulin secretion (10Montague W. Howell S.L. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, despite its importance as an intracellular signal in the β-cells, cAMP is not considered a primary signal in the insulin secretion process (5Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Mayhew D. J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46: 1724-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Montague W. Cook J.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Rather, cAMP is thought to be a potentiating signal that modulates nutrient-induced insulin secretion, especially the potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion (5Malaisse W.J.

It is known that glucose administered via the gastrointestinal tract induces a greater stimulation of insulin secretion than a comparable glucose challenge intravenously (11Elrick H. Stimmler L.

Prog. Horm. Res. 1975; 31: 487-532PubMed Google Scholar) mediate this effect. Incretins increase cAMP production by activating adenylyl cyclase by binding to their specific guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors in the pancreatic β-cell membrane (17Thorens B.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 257-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought generally that the potentiating effects of incretins on insulin secretion are mediated mainly by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in the β-cells (3Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that incretins also exert their effects in the β-cells in a cAMP-independent manner (23Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.H. Chen C. Boyd A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Bode H.P. Moormann B. Dabew R. Göke B.

For example, GLP-1 has been suggested to mobilize intracellular calcium by activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channels (23Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.H. Chen C. Boyd A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). GLP-1 has also been shown to elevate [Ca2+] i (24Bode H.P. Moormann B. Dabew R. Göke B. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3919-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as to stimulate insulin gene promoter activity (25Skoglund G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) by a PKA-independent mechanism in a β-cell-derived cell line. Until recently, PKA was the only molecule identified as a direct target of cAMP in pancreatic β-cells (21Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Activation of PKA upon stimulation is assumed to phosphorylate regulatory proteins associated with the process of insulin secretion (21Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takahashi N. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the substrates for PKA activated by cAMP or incretins and the roles of PKA-phosphorylated proteins in cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion are not clear. Although GLUT2 (a low K m glucose transporter), Kir6.2, and SUR1 (subunits of the pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel) and α-SNAP (a vesicle-associated protein), all of which are known to be expressed in pancreatic β-cells, have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKA (28Thorens B.

Furthermore, using electrophysiological measurements, cAMP has been found to promote exocytosis in the pancreatic β-cells by a PKA-independent mechanism as well as by a PKA-dependent mechanism (32Renström E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We reported recently that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII (33Kawasaki H. Springett G.M.

However, the role of cAMP-GEFII in insulin secretion in native pancreatic β-cells is not known. In the present study, we have investigated the role of cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 in incretin-potentiated insulin secretion. Our data indicate that a PKA-independent mechanism involving cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 is critical in the potentiation of insulin secretion by both GLP-1 and GIP. Synthetic GLP-1 (7–36) amide and GIP were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), carbachol, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were from Sigma. H-89 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. MDL 12330A was from RBI (Natick, MA). All animal procedures were approved by the Chiba University Animal Care Committee. Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion method as described previously (36Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 60.5 mg/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 11.1 mm glucose under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. The islets then were cultured with the medium containing 4 μm of antisense phosphorothioate-substituted ODNs against mouse cAMP-GEFII (5′-CAACGGCCTTTTATCC-3′) or control ODNs (5′-ACCTACGTGACTACGT-3′) (BIOGNOSTIK, Göttingen, Germany) for 96 h. Batch incubation experiments were performed as described previously (36Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). After preincubation (30 min) of isolated islets with Hepes-Krebs buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose, five size-matched islets were collected in each tube and incubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing glucose and test substances at the indicated concentrations for 30 min. GLP-1, GIP, H-89 as a PKA inhibitor, MDL 12330A as an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were added in the preincubation period, and 8-Br-cAMP was added in the incubation period. Insulin released into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) (37Kawaki J. Nagashima K. Tanaka J. Miki T. Miyazaki M. Gonoi T. Mitsuhashi N. Nakajima N. Iwanaga T. Yano H. Seino S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cAMP content of the islets was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions for the cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 20 mm glucose. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (250 μm) was always added to the incubation buffer. Twenty islets were used for cAMP measurements in each batch. The cAMP levels were normalized to the protein concentration. The isolated mouse pancreatic islets, treated with control ODNs or antisense ODNs as described above, were homogenized and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rim2 (residues 1466–2453) or glutathione S-transferase alone immobilized on glutathione beads. The complexes were washed and then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the IgG-purified anti-cAMP-GEFII antibody (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Homogenates of mouse pancreatic islets, treated with control ODNs or antisense ODNs, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PKA regulatory subunit IIα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rab3A antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-VAMP-2 antibody (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The wild-type (WT) Rim2 cDNA was subcloned into the modified pCMV containing HA epitope (pCMV-HA). The mutant cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D) was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). The WT cAMP-GEFII cDNA was subcloned into the pCMV containing GFP and Myc epitopes (pCMV-GFP, Myc). COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmid vectors for HA-tagged Rim2, FLAG-tagged mutant cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D), or GFP- and Myc-tagged cAMP-GEFII. For co-immunoprecipitation, cellular lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-GFP antibody (Living Colors A.v. Peptide Antibody;CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mmglucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 60.5 mg/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2 (37Kawaki J.

MIN6 cells were transfected with human preproinsulin expression vector (pCMV-hproins) plus pCMV-luciferase, pCMV-HA-Rim2ΔA, pFLAG-CMV-2-mutant cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D), pCMV-HA-Rim2, or pCMV-GFP- and Myc-cAMP-GEFII. The deletion mutant Rim2 (Rim2ΔA) lacks the zinc finger and C2 domains but retains the cAMP-GEFII binding region and has a dominant negative effect on interaction between WT cAMP-GEFII and WT Rim2 (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The mutant cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D), in which both cAMP binding sites are disrupted, was also used (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As control, luciferase was used. Three days after transfection, the C-peptide secretory response to 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) in the presence of glucose (16.7 mm) for 60 min was evaluated by human C-peptide released into medium. Human C-peptide was measured by a human C-peptide radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Perifusion of pancreatic islets was performed as described previously (36Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 100 isolated mouse islets treated for 96 h with 4 μm control or antisense ODNs as described above were loaded onto filters in columns with Bio-Gel P-2 (Bio-Rad) and continuously perifused with Hepes-Krebs buffer at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. After a 30-min stabilization period with 2.8 mm glucose, the groups of islets were successively stimulated with 16.7 mm glucose with or without 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Results presented are derived from at least three independent experiments performed on different days. The values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data were compared using Student's unpaired t test. Both GLP-1 and GIP (100 nm for each) potentiate insulin secretion in a glucose concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1, A and B), as has been reported previously (15Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown J.C. Dryburgh J.R. Ross S.A. Dupré J. Prog. Horm. Res. 1975; 31: 487-532PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mojsov S. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J.

We next examined cAMP production by GLP-1 and GIP in pancreatic islets. GLP-1 (100 nm) induced about 2-fold cAMP production in the islets, compared with basal level (basal, 26.5 ± 1.8 ng/μg protein,n = 5; GLP-1 alone, 58.1 ± 7.2 ng/μg protein,n = 6, p < 0.005) (Fig.2 A). The effect of GLP-1 on cAMP production was completely blocked by treatment with MDL12330A (10 μm), an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (39Brown J.C. Otte S.C. Diabetes. 1978; 27: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (GLP-1 plus MDL12330A, 27.3 ± 1.2 ng/μg protein, n = 6) (Fig. 2 A). MDL12330A did not affect the cAMP level at the basal state (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, GIP (100 nm) induced about 2-fold cAMP production in the islets, compared with basal level (basal, 27.3 ± 1.0 ng/μg protein, n = 5; GIP alone, 56.4 ± 3.3 ng/μg protein, n = 5,p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 B). The GIP-induced cAMP production was completely abolished by treatment with MDL12330A (GIP plus MDL12330A, 27.2 ± 2.4 ng/μg protein, n = 6) (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effects of MDL 12330A on GLP-1 - or GIP-induced cAMP production and GLP-1 - or GIP-potentiated insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic islets.

One of three or four similar experiments is shown (n = 4–6 for each) inA–D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether cAMP is an essential signal in incretin-potentiated insulin secretion, we examined the effects of MDL12330A (10 μm) on the GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions in the presence of 11.1 mm glucose using the batch incubation method (Fig. 2, C and D). MDL12330A did not alter the insulin secretion at the basal state (basal, 2.53 ± 0.22 ng/islet/30 min; MDL12330A alone, 2.88 ± 0.24 ng/islet/30 min, n = 4) (Fig. 2 C). MDL12330A treatment remarkably inhibited GLP-1 (100 nm)-potentiated insulin secretion (GLP-1 alone, 8.50 ± 0.20 ng/islet/30 min; GLP-1 plus MDL12330A, 3.93 ± 0.14 ng/islet/30 min, n = 4, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, MDL12330A treatment inhibited GIP-potentiated insulin secretion (basal, 2.50 ± 0.18 ng/islet/30 min; MDL12330A alone, 2.76 ± 0.15 ng/islet/30 min; GIP alone, 7.72 ± 0.50 ng/islet/30 min; GIP plus MDL12330A, 3.08 ± 0.15 ng/islet/30 min, n = 5 for each) (GIP aloneversus GIP plus MDL12330A, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 D). Together, these data indicate that both the GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions depend critically on cAMP production in pancreatic β-cells. We have shown recently that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII is a direct target of cAMP in regulated exocytosis (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated with the purpose of evaluating cAMP-GEFII involvement in the potentiation of insulin secretion by incretins with native pancreatic β-cells. We first ascertained if treatment of the islets with antisense ODNs could suppress the level of endogenous cAMP-GEFII protein. Treatment with antisense ODNs markedly decreased the cAMP-GEFII protein level in the islets (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm the specificity of the antisense ODNs, we checked the level of other proteins (i.e. the PKA regulatory subunit IIα, small G-protein Rab3A, and VAMP-2 (vesicle-associatedmembrane protein-2)). There were no differences in expression of protein levels between control ODN-treated and antisense ODN-treated pancreatic islets (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the antisense ODNs are specific for cAMP-GEFII. We then examined the effect of antisense ODNs on the insulin secretory responses to GLP-1 and GIP. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was not affected by antisense ODNs treatment (Fig. 3 B). The GLP-1 (100 nm)-potentiated insulin secretion in the presence of 11.1 mm glucose from pancreatic islets treated with antisense ODNs decreased significantly, compared with that treated with control ODNs (control ODN-treated, 8.51 ± 0.63 ng/islet/30 min; antisense ODN-treated, 6.26 ± 0.57 ng/islet/30 min,n = 5, p < 0.0001) (Fig.3 C). The GIP (100 nm)-potentiated insulin secretion also decreased significantly (control ODN-treated, 7.01 ± 0.79 ng/islet/30 min; antisense ODN-treated, 5.10 ± 0.44 ng/islet/30 min, n = 6, p < 0.0005) (Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that cAMP-GEFII is involved in the potentiation of insulin secretion by both GLP-1 and GIP in pancreatic islets. We examined the effects of a combination of H-89 (41Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and antisense ODNs on GLP-1-, GIP-, or 8-Br-cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic islets. The insulin secretion potentiated by GLP-1 (100 nm) was measured in the presence of 11.1 mm glucose (Fig.4 A). H-89 significantly but only partially blocked GLP-1-potentiated insulin secretion (GLP-1 alone, 8.49 ± 0.23 ng/islet/30 min; GLP-1 plus H-89, 5.57 ± 0.20 ng/islet/30 min, n = 5, p < 0.0001). Combination treatment with H-89 and the antisense ODNs caused a further reduction in GLP-1-potentiated insulin secretion (4.27 ± 0.12 ng/islet/30 min, n = 5, p < 0.001). The insulin secretion potentiated by GIP (100 nm) also was measured in the presence of 11.1 mm glucose (Fig.4 B). Similarly, H-89 partially blocked GIP-potentiated insulin secretion (GIP alone, 7.27 ± 0.18 ng/islet/30 min; GIP plus H-89, 4.24 ± 0.13 ng/islet/30 min, n = 5,p < 0.0001), and combination treatment with H-89 and the antisense ODNs caused a further reduction in GIP-potentiated insulin secretion (2.99 ± 0.14 ng/islet/30 min, n= 5, p < 0.0005). To confirm the involvement of cAMP-GEFII in cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent insulin secretion, we used the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose. Similar results were obtained with 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest strongly that both GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions are mediated by PKA-independent as well as PKA-dependent mechanisms and that cAMP-GEFII participates in a PKA-independent mechanism. cAMP-GEFII has been shown to interact with Rim2, a target of the small G-protein Rab3 (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of cAMP-GEFII on cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion requires its direct interaction with Rim2, we used two mutants (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). We first examined the effect of Rim2ΔA on 8-Br-cAMP-potentiated exocytosis from MIN6 cells in which endogenous cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 are expressed. For this purpose, we utilized MIN6 cells transfected with human preproinsulin cDNA (25Skoglund G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Proinsulin is converted into insulin and C-peptide during the secretory process in pancreatic β-cells (43Steiner D.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1969; 280: 1106-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since antibodies against human insulin cross-react with endogenous mouse insulin, we monitored secretion by measuring the human C-peptide release from MIN6 cells transfected with human preproinsulin and Rim2ΔA (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rim2ΔA in MIN6 cells significantly inhibited the 8-Br-cAMP-induced C-peptide secretion in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 5 B). Coexpression of WT cAMP-GEFII with Rim2ΔA in MIN6 cells significantly restored inhibition of the C-peptide secretion by Rim2ΔA, suggesting that the effect of cAMP-GEFII on cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion requires interaction with Rim2. Similarly, we also assessed the effect of the mutant cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D). An in vivo binding experiment shows that overexpression of cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D) inhibits interaction between the WT cAMP-GEFII and WT Rim2 (Fig.5 C), indicating that the mutant acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the interaction. We reasoned that the double mutant (G114E,G422D), when overexpressed in MIN6 cells, might trap endogenous Rim2 to inhibit cAMP-potentiated C-peptide secretion. While overexpression of WT cAMP-GEFII did not alter 8-Br-cAMP-potentiated C-peptide secretion (data not shown), overexpression of the double mutant (G114E,G422D) significantly inhibited it (Fig. 5 D). This inhibition of the C-peptide secretion was mostly restored by coexpression of WT Rim2, due probably to its interaction with endogenous WT cAMP-GEFII. These results indicate that cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion is mediated by the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex. To determine whether the effect of cAMP-GEFII on cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion requires a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+] i), we examined the effects of 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), high K+ (60 mm), and their combination, in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose, on insulin secretion in pancreatic islets treated with control ODNs or antisense ODNs. There were no differences in the insulin secretions stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP alone or high K+ alone between control ODN- and antisense ODN-treated islets. In contrast, the insulin secretion stimulated by a combination of 8-Br-cAMP plus high K+ in antisense ODN-treated islets was significantly lower than that in control ODN-treated islets (control ODNs, 8.81 ± 0.60 ng/islet/30 min; antisense ODNs, 6.24 ± 0.40 ng/islet/30 min, n = 10,p < 0.005) (Fig.6 A). We also examined the effect of carbachol (50 μm) on insulin secretion in the islets treated with control ODNs or antisense ODNs. While there were no differences in insulin secretion stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP alone or carbachol alone, the insulin secretion stimulated by a combination of 8-Br-cAMP plus carbachol in the antisense ODN-treated islets was significantly lower than that in the control ODN-treated islets (control ODNs, 3.48 ± 0.17 ng/islet/30 min; antisense ODNs, 2.45 ± 0.08 ng/islet/30 min, n = 16,p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that the effects of cAMP-GEFII on insulin secretion depend on intracellular Ca2+ as well as cAMP in pancreatic β-cells. We examined the involvement of cAMP-GEFII in the insulin secretory phase using perifused mouse pancreatic islets. No significant difference was found between control ODN-treated islets and antisense ODN-treated islets in the absence of 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 7 A). When the islets were treated with antisense ODNs, both the first phase and second phase potentiations by 8-Br-cAMP were suppressed (Fig.7 B), clearly showing that cAMP-GEFII is involved in both phases of insulin secretion. Incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP play an important role in the potentiation of insulin secretion (44Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Mojsov S. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 45Scrocchi L.A. Brown T.J. Maclusky N. Brubaker P.L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Drucker D.J. Nat.

Molecular Basis of Pancreas Development and Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York2001: 109-141Google Scholar). It has generally been thought that both GLP-1 and GIP potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion primarily by cAMP/PKA signaling, which leads to phosphorylation of regulatory proteins associated with the secretory process in pancreatic β-cells (15Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 49Ding W.G. Gromada J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A study by capacitance measurements has suggested that cAMP also promotes exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells in a PKA-independent mechanism (32Renström E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that MDL 12330A, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, completely blocks both the GLP-1- and the GIP-stimulated cAMP production in pancreatic islets and that MDL 12330A remarkably inhibits both the GLP-1- and the GIP-induced insulin secretions. These results confirm that the effects of both GLP-1 and GIP on insulin secretion depend critically on the intracellular cAMP elevation due to activation of adenylyl cyclase. It is interesting that MDL 12330A did not completely inhibit either GLP-1- or GIP-potentiated insulin secretion under the conditions in which cAMP production was blocked. This suggests that the potentiating effects of the incretins on insulin secretion are mediated at least in part by a cAMP-independent mechanism, although the effects are small. We recently found that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII, by interacting with Rim2, a target of Rab3, participates in cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent exocytosis in a reconstituted system (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated in order to find whether the cAMP-GEFII in native pancreatic β-cells is involved in GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions and if such action is PKA-independent. Treatment of islets with antisense ODNs reduced both GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretion, clearly indicating that the effects of the incretins are mediated in part by cAMP-GEFII. Ten μm of H-89, a widely used specific inhibitor of PKA phosphorylation in intact cells (24Bode H.P. Moormann B. Dabew R. Göke B.

DeVos A. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Meda P. Porret A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8075-8081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to evaluate incretin-potentiated insulin secretion. Interestingly, although treatment of pancreatic islets with H-89 reduced (about 50%) both GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions, treatment of the islets with H-89 plus antisense ODNs further reduced the insulin secretions (80–90%), suggesting strongly that the potentiation of insulin secretion by both GLP-1 and GIP is mediated by PKA-independent as well as PKA-dependent mechanisms and that cAMP-GEFII is involved in the PKA-independent mechanism. We then determined whether or not the potentiating effects of cAMP on insulin secretion are mediated by Rim2. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant, Rim2 (Rim2ΔA) or cAMP-GEFII (G114E,G422D double mutant), inhibited the potentiating effect of 8-Br-cAMP on C-peptide secretion from human preproinsulin-transfected MIN6 cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Rim2ΔA or the cAMP-GEFII double mutant on C-peptide secretion was mostly restored by coexpression of WT cAMP-GEFII or WT Rim2, respectively, suggesting that the potentiating effects of the incretins are mediated by the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex. Because intracellular Ca2+ is essential in triggering insulin secretion, we investigated to find if the mechanism of potentiation by the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex is also Ca2+-dependent. The effects of high K+ and carbachol, which triggers Ca2+ influx and mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ (51Garcia M.C. Hermans M.P. Henquin J.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively, on insulin secretion were examined in islets treated with antisense ODNs. While there were no differences in the insulin secretions stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP alone, high K+ alone, or carbachol alone between control ODN-treated and antisense ODN-treated islets, insulin secretion stimulated by a combination of 8-Br-cAMP plus high K+ or 8-Br-cAMP plus carbachol was significantly reduced in antisense ODN-treated islets. These findings indicate that the potentiation of insulin secretion through the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 pathway depends on intracellular Ca2+ as well as cAMP. Since Rim2 has two C2 domains, Ca2+ might modulate interaction between cAMP-GEFII and Rim2. cAMP potentiates both phases of insulin secretion at high glucose concentrations in isolated perifused pancreas (2Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, GLP-1 and GIP are both known to potentiate both the first and second phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion (15Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown J.C. Dryburgh J.R. Ross S.A. Dupré J. Prog. Horm. Res. 1975; 31: 487-532PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of cAMP-GEFII in each phase of insulin secretion, we evaluated the potentiation of insulin secretion by 8-Br-cAMP in perifused pancreatic islets with antisense or control ODNs treatment. Both the first and second phase enhancement by 8-Br-cAMP was significantly suppressed in islets treated with antisense ODNs compared with control, showing that both the first and second phases are potentiated by cAMP in a PKA-independent mechanism. Considering these findings together, we propose that incretins potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion primarily by two mechanisms: the pathway involving phosphorylation of regulatory proteins by PKA activation (PKA-dependent) and the pathway involving the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex (PKA-independent). The affinity for cAMP is quite different in PKA and cAMP-GEFII, withK d of ∼100 nm (52Sugden M.C. Ashcroft S.J.H. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and ∼10 μm (26Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), respectively. cAMP at basal state in pancreatic islets has been reported in a range of micromolar concentrations (52Sugden M.C. Ashcroft S.J.H. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that many substrates for PKA already are maximally phosphorylated in pancreatic islets. This is the case with GLUT2 (28Thorens B. Dériaz N. Bosco D. DeVos A. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Meda P. Porret A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8075-8081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1, a subunit of the β-cell KATP channel (29Béguin P. Nagashima K. Nishimura M. Gonoi T. Seino S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4722-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PKA and cAMP-GEFII have distinct roles in cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion. The mechanism involving the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex might operate upon a rise in local cAMP concentrations by stimulation. The mechanism involving PKA phosphorylation might also be controlled by PKA-anchoring protein (44Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Mojsov S. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar,53Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since cAMP-GEFII has guanine exchange factor activity toward the small G-protein Rap1 (33Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), it is also tempting to speculate that Rap1, which is activated by cAMP-GEFII through incretins, might also be involved in insulin secretion. Further elucidation of the regulation of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex by incretins should both clarify the mechanism of the potentiation of insulin secretion and suggest novel anti-diabetic drug therapy."

The intensification of shrimp farming over the last few decades has been accompanied by the development of infectious diseases from viral, bacterial, and, in some cases, fungal origin (1Lightner D.V. McVey J.P. CRC Handbook of Mariculture. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983: 289-320Google Scholar, 2Crisp L.M. Bland C.E. Mycologia. 1989; 81: 709-716Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of penaeid shrimp immune response should help in the design of more efficient strategies for disease control. As for other invertebrates, cellular and humoral mechanisms contribute to the shrimp defense reaction by limiting microbial invasions or by helping the clearance/killing of the invading microbes from the blood and tissues (3Hoffmann J.A.

In particular, part of the innate immune response relies on the production of cationic antimicrobial peptides (6Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Widespread in the living kingdom, these effectors have been well studied in insects and vertebrates in terms of structure, mode of action, and gene expression (7Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). We have recently isolated from the hemolymph of the shrimp Penaeus vannamei such a family of antimicrobial peptides named penaeidins (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), active against fungi and bacteria (9Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.-M.

Synthesized in the hemocytes, they are partly released into the blood circulation in response to microbial stimulations (10Destoumieux D. Muñoz M. Cosseau C. Rodriguez J. Bulet P. Comps M. Bachère E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 461-469PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the immune capability of shrimp to fight microbial infections, we looked for other antimicrobial factors active against shrimp pathogens. This research was engaged on two shrimp species, P. vannamei and Penaeus stylirostris, with special interest in their plasma-soluble molecules. In this paper, we present the isolation and biochemical characterization of a set of strictly antifungal (poly)peptides. These molecules, which are shown to derive from the C-terminal sequence of hemocyanins, were identified in the plasma of both shrimp species. Their antimicrobial activity spectrum and the physiological significance of their generation during the immune response of shrimp were also investigated. Juvenile shrimp P. vannamei and P. stylirostris (Penaeidae, Decapoda) were obtained from an intensive shrimp farm in the province of Guayas, Ecuador, and from sea water tanks at the French Polynesia IFREMER laboratory, respectively. Hemolymph was collected from the ventral sinus located at the base of the first abdominal segment, under one-tenth volume of anticoagulant buffer (10% sodium citrate, pH 7) supplemented with 200 μm phenyl-thio-urea as a melanization inhibitor and 40 μg/ml aprotinin as a protease inhibitor. For both shrimp species, about 25 ml of hemolymph were collected. After blood cell removal (centrifugation at 800 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), the plasma (cell-free hemolymph) was frozen at −70 °C until use. The first three steps of purification for antimicrobial peptides were carried out using the protocol previously described (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and were identical for P. vannamei and P. stylirostris. The plasma was acidified to pH 4 by the addition of 1 m HCl under gentle stirring for 1 h in an ice-cold water bath and then centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The acidic supernatant was loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (2 g, Waters Associates) equilibrated in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). After washing with acidified water, three stepwise elutions were performed with 5, 40, and 80% acetonitrile in acidified water. The 40% Sep-Pak fraction was lyophilized and reconstituted in MilliQ water (Millipore, Corp.). The reconstituted Sep-Pak fraction was subjected to reversed-phase chromatography on an Aquapore RP300 C8 column (4.6 × 220 mm; Brownlee) equilibrated in acidified water. Separation was performed with a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water over 120 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were hand-collected, concentrated under vacuum (Speed-Vac; Savant), and reconstituted in MilliQ water. Antimicrobial activity was detected in the collected fractions using the procedure described below. The active fractions were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using two serially linked HPLC columns (Ultraspherogel SEC 3000 and SEC 2000 columns; 7.5 × 300 mm; Beckman) protected by a precolumn (Ultraspherogel SEC; 7.5 × 40 mm; Beckman). Elution was performed under isocratic conditions with 30% acetonitrile in acidified water, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were hand-collected and treated as above. The peptide from P. vannamei was purified to homogeneity by two additional purification steps by reversed-phase HPLC. The active fraction was successively loaded onto an Aquapore RP300 C8 column (4.6 × 220 mm; Brownlee) used at a controlled temperature of 35 °C with a gradient developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and on a microbore Aquapore RP300 C8 column (1 × 100 mm; Brownlee™), used at 40 °C with a flow rate of 80 μl/min. Separation was performed using a biphasic linear gradient of 2–25% acetonitrile in acidified water over 5 min and of 25–29% over 45 min for these two last steps. All HPLC purification steps performed at room temperature were carried out on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. For the HPLC purification under controlled temperature, a Waters HPLC system (Waters 626 pump) attached to a tunable absorbance detector (Waters 486) was used. Column effluent was monitored by its UV absorbance at 225 nm or at 214 nm when the microbore column was used. Peptide purity was ascertained on a 270A-HT electrophoresis system (PerkinElmer Life Science Products) equipped with a fused silica capillary (length, 72 cm; internal diameter, 50 μm). Electrophoresis was monitored at 30 °C in 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 2.5, at 20 kV. Capillary effluent was detected by its absorbance at 200 nm. Purified peptides (1 μl) were loaded on a thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid crystals made by fast evaporation of a saturated solution in acetone. The droplets were allowed to dry under gentle vacuum before introduction into the mass spectrometer. MALDI-TOF-MS was carried out on a Bruker BIFLEXTM mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) operating in a positive linear mode as described previously (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Native peptides were subjected to automatic Edman degradation on a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (Applied Biosystems, model 473A). The microbial strains were those used in previous studies (9Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.-M. Bachère E. Eur. J.

Fungal strains were Nectria hematococca, Trichophyton mentagrophites,Tricoderma viridae, Beauveria bassiana,Alternaria brassicola, Neurospora crassa,Aspergillus fumigatus, Botrytis cinera,Fusarium culmorum, and the shrimp pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Gram-positive bacteria were Micrococcus luteus, Aerococcus viridans, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Nocardia aster, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Pediococcus acidolactici, Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, S. saprophiticus, and Streptococcus pyrogenes. The Gram-negative strains included Escherichia coli 363, E. coli D31, Enterobacter cloacae, and three marine bacteria of the Vibrio genus: the probioticVibrio alginolyticus and two bacteria pathogenic for shrimp,Vibrio harveyi (CENAIM, Ecuador) and Vibrio penaeicida (IFREMER, French Polynesia) (13Song Y.L. Lee S.P. Bull. Inst. Zool. 1993; 32: 217-220Google Scholar, 14Ishimaru K. Akagawa-Matsushita M. Muroga K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1995; 45: 134-138Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After each step of purification, the eluted fractions reconstituted in MilliQ water were tested by the liquid growth inhibition assay already described (15Bulet P. Dimarcq J.-L. Hétru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μl aliquots from every test fraction were incubated in microtiter plates with 100 μl of a suspension of a midlogarithmic phase culture of bacteria at a starting OD of A 600 = 0.001 in poor broth nutrient medium (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% NaCl (w/v)) or in saline peptone water (1.5% peptone, 1.5% NaCl (w/v), pH 7.2) for the marine bacteria. Bacterial growth was performed for 24 h under shaking at 30 °C (25 °C for marine strains) and assayed by OD reading at 600 nm. An identical procedure was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the HPLC-purified peptides on the previously described bacterial strains. The MIC values are expressed (μm) as an interval of concentrations (a − b), where a represents the highest concentration at which bacteria are growing and b is the lowest concentration that causes 100% inhibition of growth (16Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7044-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antifungal activity was monitored as described previously by the liquid growth inhibition assay (11Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hétru C. Hoffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 90 μl of fungal spores (final concentration, 104spores/ml) suspended in potato dextrose broth (Difco) at half-strength (½ PDB) supplemented with two antibiotics, tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cefotaxim (100 μg/ml), were added to 10 μl of fractions in microtiter plates. Growth inhibition was observed under a light microscope after 24 h of incubation at 30 °C in the dark and quantified by OD measurement at 600 nm after 48 h. The MIC values were determined as described for the antibacterial assays. A 100-μl spore suspension of F. oxysporum (104 spores/ml) in ½ PDB supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cefotaxim (100 μg/ml) was incubated with the peptide at 200 μm (16 times the MIC value). Incubation was performed in the dark, in a moist chamber at 30 °C. After 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h, the spores were diluted in 1 ml of fresh medium, centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min), washed two additional times, and resuspended in 100 μl of fresh medium before incubation in microtiter plates for fungal growth measurement. In control experiments, the peptide was substituted by water. Fungal growth was observed as reported for the antifungal assay (see above). A peptide corresponding to PvHCt, the C-terminal fragment of hemocyanin isolated from P. vannamei, was synthesized by the classical Fmoc methodology as described previously (17Neimark J. Briand J.-P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide was first subjected to solid-phase extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (10 g; Waters Associates) equilibrated in acidified water. Elution was performed with 10 and 50% of acetonitrile in acidified water. The 50% eluate, containing the peptide, was purified on a reversed-phase column (preparative Aquapore C18; 250 × 10 mm; Brownlee) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile in acidified water. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of 2–55% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. Finally, the peptide-containing fraction was lyophilized to remove the organic solvent and trifluoroacetic acid and reconstituted in MilliQ water. Peptide purity and identity were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS, capillary zone electrophoresis, and biological activity. A polyclonal antiserum was raised by rabbit immunization using a purified synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of P. vannamei hemocyanin, PvHCt. Immunization was performed by four successive subcutaneous injections of synthetic peptide (0.5 mg each). The polyserum was purified on a Hitrap protein-G Sepharose column according to the procedure described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Shrimp microbial challenge was performed by injecting 50 μl of a suspension of heat-killed (100 °C, 105 Pa, 20 min) bacteria,A. viridans and V. alginolyticus, and spores of the fungus F. oxysporum (108 cells/shrimp). At different times postinjection (3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h), hemolymph was collected from 10 or 15 animals. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation (800 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the plasma was pooled for further peptide extraction. Plasma from naive and challenged shrimp was analyzed according to the procedure previously described (10Destoumieux D. Muñoz M. Cosseau C. Rodriguez J. Bulet P. Comps M. Bachère E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 461-469PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after acidification to pH 4, plasma was subjected to solid phase extraction on Sep-Pak C18cartridges (500 mg; Waters Associates). The fractions eluted by 40% acetonitrile were lyophilized and reconstituted in MilliQ water, and the protein concentration was determined by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Total proteins (20 μg) were loaded onto a narrow bore reversed-phase column (Delta-Pak HPI C18; 2 × 150 mm; Waters Associates) and eluted with a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water, over 90 min, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 225 nm. The fraction in which the C-terminal fragment of hemocyanin was known to be eluted and a control fraction eluted at a lower acetonitrile percentage were analyzed for peptide immunodetection. Lyophilized HPLC fractions or synthetic PvHCt (0–200 ng) used for standard curves were resuspended in 50 mm carbonate buffer at pH 9.6. Microtiter plates (Falcon 3912) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of the reconstituted fractions. Plates were incubated (1 h at 37 °C) successively with (i) the blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS at pH 7.4 (PBS-T) containing 20% gelatin hydrolysate; (ii) anti-PvHCt IgG (4 μg/ml), anti-PvHCt IgG preincubated with PvHCt (4 μg/ml each), or preimmune serum (1:10,000 dilution); and (iii) goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Biosys) at a 1:4000 dilution. Washing steps (3 × 3 min) with PBS-T were systematically performed between the successive incubations. Antibodies were diluted in the same buffer supplemented with 5% gelatin hydrolysate. Detection was performed for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.2 m Tris-HCl at pH 9.8. The resulting absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a Multiscan microplate colorimeter (Labsystem). HPLC fractions or synthetic PvHCt were incubated in a 1:1 mixture of 1× Laemmli buffer (25 mm Tris base, 0.19 m glycine, 0.1% SDS) and 3× denaturing sample buffer (0.17 m Tris, pH 8.8, 6% SDS, 21% glycerol, 0.15 m dithiothreitol) for 5 min. Denatured samples were then separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 16.5% acrylamide according to the protocol described by Schagger et al. (18Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). After migration, gels were transferred (30 min, 10 V) to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Trans-blot SD; Bio-Rad). The membranes fixed in 2.5% gluraldehyde and washed in PBS were then incubated with either a 4 μg/ml anti-PvHCt IgG or a 1:10,000 dilution of preimmune serum for 2 h at room temperature. After several washes in PBS-T, membranes were incubated with a 1:50,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Baltimore, MD). All antibody dilutions were performed in PBS-T containing 0.5% skim milk. The membranes were then developed by using SigmaFastTM nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate tablets as a chromogenic substrate. In an attempt to identify and characterize antimicrobial peptides involved in P. stylirostris immune response, we used the procedure already described for the identification of P. vannamei penaeidins (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides were searched in the shrimp plasma. The antimicrobial activity screening was oriented toward (i) two test bacteria (M. luteus (Gram-positive) and E. coli D31 (Gram-negative)) and (ii) three marine micro organisms (a probiotic bacterium, V. alginolyticus, 2I. Morales, personal communication. and two shrimp pathogens, the bacterium V. penaeicida (14Ishimaru K. Akagawa-Matsushita M. Muroga K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1995; 45: 134-138Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the filamentous fungus F. oxysporum. No activity was found in the 5 and 80% eluates obtained from the fractionation of P. stylirostris acidified plasma by solid phase extraction on Sep-Pak cartridges (data not shown). However, similarly to our previous work onP. vannamei (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the 40% Sep-Pak eluate displayed antimicrobial activities in a series of fractions eluted around 26% acetonitrile after the first reversed-phase HPLC purification step (Fig. 1, peaks 1–3). Among the five microorganisms tested, only the fungal strain could be inhibited by the HPLC fractions (Fig. 1). This contrasts with the data obtained for penaeidins from P. vannamei that are eluted at an identical acetonitrile percentage and that also display activity against M. luteus andE. coli D31 (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The P. stylirostris active fractions were next subjected to gel permeation chromatography. However, only the two more hydrophilic ones (Fig. 1, peaks 1 and 2) retained antifungal activity againstF. oxysporum. The positive fractions issued from gel permeation chromatography were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS for molecular mass measurement and purity control. From the two mass spectra obtained, no cross-contamination could be observed (data not shown). This indicates that two different molecules are responsible for the activity detected in peaks 1 and 2. The positive fraction issued from peak 1 was heterogeneous with major molecular masses at 5484.41, 6350.15, and 7985.20 MH+ (inset in Fig. 1). The low amounts of remaining material did not allow further purification on this sample. In contrast, mass spectrometry results on the gel permeation analysis of peak 2 established that the active compound displayed a molecular mass at 8363.83 MH+ (Fig. 1) and was pure enough for sequencing by Edman degradation. A partial 32-residue NH2-terminal sequence was obtained (LVVAVTDGDADSAVPNLHENTEYNHYGSHGVY) that revealed a perfect homology with the C-terminal region of Penaeus hemocyanin published in Ref. 19Sellos D. Lemoine S. Van Wormhoudt A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 1353-1358Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar. This indicates that the isolated antifungal molecule corresponds to the C terminus of hemocyanin. This observation led us to control the other fraction with antifungal properties (Fig. 1, peak 1) for the presence of a truncated form of the shrimp hemocyanin C terminus. Interestingly, among the molecular masses measured (inset in Fig. 1), the compound at 7985.20 MH+ could correspond to the previously established sequence lacking the first four residues, LVVA (see above). In order to gain structural information on this 7985.20 MH+molecule, a new plasma extract was prepared and treated as above. After purification, the active fraction was successively subjected to mass spectrometry for purity control and to Edman degradation. A single molecular mass at 7983.46 MH+ was measured (data not shown), and the following 31-residue N-terminal sequence was obtained: VTDGDADSAVPNLHENTEYNHYGSHGVYPDK. This shows that the compound at a molecular mass of 7985.20 MH+ found in peak 1 corresponds to the 8363.83 MH+ polypeptide from peak 2 truncated at the N terminus. Both antifungal substances are therefore C-terminal fragments of shrimp hemocyanin that we named PsHCt1 (7985.20 MH+) and PsHCt2 (8363.83 MH+) for P. stylirostris hemocyanin C-terminal fragment 1 and 2, respectively. Our findings on P. stylirostrisconnected to the previous detection of a strictly antifungal fraction in plasma extracts from P. vannamei 3D. Destoumieux-Garzón, P. Bulet, and E. Bachere, unpublished data. prompted us to isolate this last active compound. The antifungal fraction from P. vannamei, originally detected during penaeidin purification (8Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), was eluted close to these antimicrobial peptides by reversed-phase chromatography of plasma extracts. However, the structure of the antifungal molecule was not investigated at the time of the penaeidin characterization because of the low quantities available. A new acid extract from P. vannamei plasma was therefore made in the present study and treated as above. After a three-step purification procedure (see “Materials and Methods”), the fraction eluted at 26% acetonitrile by reversed-phase HPLC was finally purified to homogeneity on a microbore reversed-phase column (see “Materials and Methods”). Two active fractions were obtained, with the more hydrophilic one active exclusively against the fungal strain F. oxysporum (Fig. 2 A, peak 1). In contrast, the second compound (Fig. 2 A,peak 2) was active against M. luteusand F. oxysporum. From MALDI-TOF-MS measurements, peak 2 contained a molecule with a molecular mass at 6617.45 MH+(data not shown) corresponding to that of penaeidin-3a (theoretical molecular mass at 6620 Da), while peak 1 had a molecular mass measured at 2754.21 MH+ (Fig. 2 B). Edman degradation was further performed on this small size compound. The following 23-amino acid sequence was obtained: FEDLPNFGHIQVKVFNHGEHIHH. The absence of signal during the five next Edman degradation cycles clearly established that this peptide was composed of 23 residues. The calculated average molecular mass (2753.02 MH+) from this primary sequence is in agreement with the average molecular mass measured by MALDI-TOF-MS (2754.21 MH+). Searches in the Swiss-Prot data base demonstrated that this peptide corresponds to the C terminus of a new variant of hemocyanin characterized in P. vannamei (amino acid sequence derived from a cDNA clone, GenBankTM PVA250830), with the exception of a glutamine at position 11 instead of the histidine present in the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence (Fig. 3). Thus, the 23-residue peptide isolated from P. vannamei plasma (PvHCt), which co-elutes with penaeidin-3a in the first purification steps, corresponds to a peptide fragment derived from shrimp hemocyanin. To investigate the antimicrobial properties of the C-terminal fragments of shrimp hemocyanin, PvHCt, the smallest variant (23 residues) isolated from P. vannamei was chemically synthesized using an Fmoc procedure. After purification, the activity of the synthetic molecule was determined by liquid growth-inhibition assays against various microorganisms (bacteria, filamentous fungi). No antibacterial activity could be observed up to 100 μmagainst the 14 Gram-positive and the five Gram-negative strains tested (see “Materials and Methods”). On the other hand, the synthetic peptide displayed broad antifungal activities with MIC values ranging from 3.15–6.25 μm against T. viridae,N. hematococca, and A. brassicola to 25–50 μm against N. crassa (Table I). Assays against the shrimp pathogenF. oxysporum showed that at concentrations above the MIC value, fungal growth was totally inhibited even after a 1-week incubation. This suggested that the hemocyanin C-terminal fragment had a fungicidal activity. To confirm this hypothesis and to overcome the effects of dose-dependent mechanisms, a fungicidal assay was performed at high peptide concentration (200 μm). At different times of incubation, the peptide-containing culture medium was replaced by fresh medium, and incubation was carried out over 48 h. Identical results were obtained at all times of the time course experiment with an irreversible inhibition of fungal spore germination observed by light microscopy (Fig. 4). A 30-min exposure to the synthetic peptide PvHCt was sufficient to obtain this total inhibition of growth. In contrast, normal growth was observed in control experiments where the peptide solution was replaced by water (Fig. 4). This clearly indicates that hemocyanin C terminus is fungicidal.Table IRange of activity of the synthetic C-terminal peptide of hemocyanin, PvHCtFungal strainMICμmA. brassicola3.15–6.25A. fumigatus>100B. bassiana>100B. cinerea>100F. culmorum6.25–12.5F. oxysporum6.25–12.5N. haematococca3.15–6.25N. crassa25–50T. mentagrophites>100T. viridae3.15–6.25MIC values are expressed as the interval a–b, wherea is the highest concentration tested at which fungal strains are growing and b is the lowest concentration that causes 100% inhibition.

To gain insight into the involvement of hemocyanin C-terminal fragments in the shrimp immune reaction, we analyzed P. vannamei plasma for the presence of PvHCt at different times following an experimental microbial challenge. Acid extracts from plasma prepared from 10 animals at 0, 3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after challenge were subjected to solid-phase extraction, and 20 μg of total proteins from every 40% Sep-Pak fraction were further subjected to reversed-phase HPLC.

https://openalex.org/W2074280810,"In a variety of cell types, insulin stimulation elicits the rapid production of H2O2, which causes the oxidative inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the early insulin action cascade (Mahadev, K., Zilbering, A., Zhu, L., and Goldstein, B. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21938–21942). In the present work, we explored the potential role of insulin-induced H2O2 generation on downstream insulin signaling using diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of cellular NADPH oxidase that blocks insulin-stimulated cellular H2O2production. DPI completely inhibited the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase activity by insulin and reduced the insulin-induced activation of the serine kinase Akt by up to 49%; these activities were restored when H2O2 was added back to cells that had been pretreated with DPI. Interestingly, the H2O2-induced activation of Akt was entirely mediated by upstream stimulation of PI 3′-kinase activity, since treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the PI 3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 completely blocked the subsequent activation of Akt by exogenous H2O2. Preventing oxidant generation with DPI also blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, providing further evidence for an oxidant signal in the regulation of the distal insulin-signaling cascade. Finally, in contrast to the cellular mechanism of H2O2 generation by other growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, we also found that insulin-stimulated cellular production of H2O2may occur through a unique pathway, independent of cellular PI 3′-kinase activity. Overall, these data provide insight into the physiological role of insulin-dependent H2O2 generation, which is not only involved in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation events in the early insulin signaling cascade but also has important effects on the regulation of downstream insulin signaling, involving the activation of PI 3′-kinase, Akt, and ultimately cellular glucose transport in response to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2028001397,"Apoptosis is meticulously controlled in living organisms. Its dysregulation has been shown to play a key role in a number of human diseases, including neoplastic, cardiovascular, and degenerative disorders. Bcl-2 family member proteins and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins are two major negative regulators of apoptosis. We report here the characterization of novel antiapoptotic protein, fortilin, which we identified through yeast two-hybrid library screening. Sequence analysis of fortilin revealed it to be a 172-amino acid polypeptide highly conserved from mammals to plants. Fortilin is structurally unrelated to either Bcl-2 family member proteins or inhibitors of apoptosis proteins. Northern blot analysis showed the fortilin message to be ubiquitous in normal tissue but especially abundant in the liver, kidney, and small intestine. Western blot analysis using anti-fortilin antibody showed more extensive expression in cancerous cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and A549) than in cell lines derived from normal tissue (HEK293). Immunocytochemistry using HeLa cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged fortilin and immunohistochemistry using human breast ductal carcinoma tissue and anti-fortilin antibody both showed that fortilin is predominantly localized in the nucleus. Functionally, the transient overexpression of fortilin in HeLa cells prevented them, in a dose-dependent fashion, from undergoing etoposide-induced apoptosis. Consistently, U2OS cells stably expressing fortilin protected the cells from cell death induced by etoposide over various concentrations and durations of exposure. In addition, fortilin overexpression inhibited caspase-3-like activity as assessed by the cleavage of fluorogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin. Furthermore, the antisense depletion of fortilin from breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was associated with massive cell death. These data suggest that fortilin represents a novel antiapoptotic protein involved in cell survival and apoptosis regulation. Apoptosis is meticulously controlled in living organisms.

Northern blot analysis showed the fortilin message to be ubiquitous in normal tissue but especially abundant in the liver, kidney, and small intestine. Western blot analysis using anti-fortilin antibody showed more extensive expression in cancerous cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and A549) than in cell lines derived from normal tissue (HEK293). Immunocytochemistry using HeLa cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged fortilin and immunohistochemistry using human breast ductal carcinoma tissue and anti-fortilin antibody both showed that fortilin is predominantly localized in the nucleus. Functionally, the transient overexpression of fortilin in HeLa cells prevented them, in a dose-dependent fashion, from undergoing etoposide-induced apoptosis. Consistently, U2OS cells stably expressing fortilin protected the cells from cell death induced by etoposide over various concentrations and durations of exposure. In addition, fortilin overexpression inhibited caspase-3-like activity as assessed by the cleavage of fluorogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin. Furthermore, the antisense depletion of fortilin from breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was associated with massive cell death. These data suggest that fortilin represents a novel antiapoptotic protein involved in cell survival and apoptosis regulation. inhibitor of apoptosis protein myeloid cell leukemia protein-1 β-galactosidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole lactate dehydrogenase 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate) 7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl) coumarin Apoptosis represents a highly efficient and extremely sophisticated system for removing cells from the surrounding microenvironment (1Kerr J.F.

As deadly as it may be, apoptosis is essential for the elimination of aberrant cells and the survival of the living organism as a whole. It is not surprising, therefore, that apoptosis is meticulously controlled. Among major regulatory cellular mechanisms described for other systems, ever increasing numbers of them are also being shown to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. These include (a) proteolytic processing and activation by co-factors (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 9Muzio M.

In addition, there exist molecules specifically designed to inhibit the various stages of apoptosis. Bcl-2 family member proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)1 represent two major negative regulators of apoptosis. First, Bcl-2 inhibits the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in the presence of various proapoptotic stimuli (19Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that Bcl-xL binds apoptotic protease activating factor-1, thereby interfering with its recruitment of caspase-9 (20Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 heterodimerizes with Bax, a proapoptotic protein, thereby preventing Bax from undergoing the conformational changes required for the formation of cytotoxic pores in the mitochondrial membrane (21Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-2 can associate with Raf-1, a protein kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the proapoptotic protein BAD (22Wang H.G. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Sato T. Torigoe T. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Hovey III, L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. et al.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), originally identified as a family of proteins in baculovirus that inhibited the apoptotic response of insect cells to viral infection (23Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), represent a group of antiapoptotic proteins structurally distinct from Bcl-2 family proteins, consisting of two N-terminal repeats (baculovirus IAP repeats) and a C-terminal RING finger domain. Several human IAPs have been described, including survivin (24Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (25Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (26Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), and others. Antiapoptotic function of IAPs appears to be mediated through direct binding and inhibition of effector caspases (caspases 3, 7, and 9) (25Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In order to explore the apoptosis regulatory mechanism related to Bcl-2 family member proteins, we searched for proteins that interacted with myeloid cell leukemia protein-1 (MCL1), a Bcl-2 homologue, using the yeast two-hybrid system. The amino acid sequence of one positive clone that specifically interacted with MCL1 was identical to that of human translationally controlled tumor protein (31Chitpatima S.T. Makrides S. Bandyopadhyay R. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Gross B. Gaestel M. Bohm H. Bielka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Sanford K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1948; 9: 229-246PubMed Google Scholar), the function of which was unknown. Analysis of the promoter region of this gene has shown the presence of the binding sites for multiple transcription factors, implying that this gene, like other genes, is under transcriptional control (34Thiele H. Berger M. Lenzner C. Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We then discovered that this molecule is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissue. In addition, we found that it prevented cells from undergoing apoptosis. On the basis of these observations, it is now designated fortilin (fromfortis, meaning strong and robust in Latin). In the study reported here, we focused on characterizing the specific function of fortilin as an antiapoptotic protein. The data we present indicate that fortilin is a novel nuclear antiapoptotic protein, structurally distinct from both Bcl-2 and IAP family antiapoptotic proteins. The ML1a cell line was maintained in RMPI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and antibiotics. The A543, U2OS, HeLa, 293, MCF-7, and NIH 3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cDNA fragments of full-length fortilin, p21, β-galactosidase (LacZ), Bcl-xL, and MCL1 were obtained by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques, using appropriate primer sets, and were ligated in frame to the appropriate bacterial, yeast, and mammalian expression vectors. In all cases, the authenticity of cloned constructs was confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing (SeqWright Co., Houston, TX). Full-length MCL1 was cloned into pAS2.1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, California), a vector that encodes the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and used as bait. A human fetus liver library was screened, according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH) and as described previously (36Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The full-length human fortilin sequence was aligned to those of other species by the Omega nucleic acid and a protein analysis program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The hydrophilicity score was determined with the same program according to the methods of Goldman, Engelberg, and Steitz (GES) (38Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and von Heijne (39von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed using multiple-tissue Northern membranes (OriGene, Rockville, MD) and a32P-labeled fortilin probe generated by the random prime method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (40Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using a Bio-Rad Quantity-One phosphorimaging system. Antiserum specific for fortilin was prepared in rabbits with the synthetic peptide NH2-CKYIKDYMKSIKGKLEEQRPER-COOH, corresponding to amino acids 90–111 conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and an appropriate adjuvant. Generated antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on a peptide-Sepharose matrix and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against a control or the fortilin peptide. Full-length fortilin cDNA was cloned in frame to the pQE-30 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The plasmid was co-transfected into BL21Escherichia coli with the pREP4 plasmid (Qiagen). Polyhistidine-tagged fortilin (MRGS-His6-fortilin) was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified to near homogeneity under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The integrity of the purified MRGS-His6-fortilin was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining, with a single band appearing at around 30 kDa. To characterize the rabbit anti-fortilin antibody, serially diluted RGS-His6-fortilin (100 to 12.5 ng by weight) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot transfer. Transferred proteins were probed first with anti-RGS-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen), after which the membrane was stripped and reprobed with rabbit anti-fortilin antibody. To evaluate the specificity of the antibody, SDS-PAGE and Western blot transfer were performed in duplicate. Before the antibodies were added, the membranes were incubated with either a control peptide consisting of amino acids 210–230 of MCL1 (NH2-LETLRRVGDGVQRNHETVFQG-COOH) or the fortilin peptide (NH2-CKYIKDYMKSIKGKLEEQRPER-COOH) used to raise the antibody, both at the concentration of 100 ng/ml. The immunoprobing was performed as previously described (36Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were prepared as previously described (40Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, counted, centrifuged, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. SDS loading buffer (5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) was then added to the frozen pellet (150 μl/1 × 106cells), and the samples were incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. The genomic DNA in the lysates were sheared by passing the lysate through 27-gauge needles three times. Then, 7.5-μl samples, corresponding to 2.5 × 104 cells, were loaded in each well. SDS-PAGE, Western blot transfer, and immunoprobing were performed as described previously (40Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-fortilin, preimmune sera, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) were used at dilutions of 1:2000, 1:2000, and 1:5000, respectively. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad chemiluminescence screen and Quantity One software system, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The signal intensities of fortilin bands were divided by the signal intensity of actin band from the same cell line and expressed as the relative expression index. For the intracellular localization of fortilin, HeLa cells were seeded in four-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and transfected with pFLAG containing fortilin or other cDNAs by using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized at −20 °C with an acetone-methanol solution (1:1, v/v), blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and probed with anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma). Bound primary antibodies were detected with goat secondary antibody conjugated to rhodamine red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Slides were examined under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Herts, UK) equipped with a Zeiss image processing system and the appropriate filter sets. Human breast tissue specimens were obtained from the Novagen Human Disease Tissue Archive (Novagen, Madison, WI). First, the sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval with Citra Plus (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) using the microwave method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endogenous peroxidase was then quenched, and tissue avidin and biotin were blocked. Tissues were then incubated with an affinity-purified rabbit anti-fortilin antibody (9 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to avidin, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (BioGenex), and diaminobenzidine. Finally, tissues were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. A brown stain indicated positive fortilin immunoreactivity. HeLa cells were seeded in four-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) at 1 × 104 cells/well and transfected with pFLAG containing fortilin or other cDNAs by using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were challenged with 5 μg/ml etoposide. Cells were then stained for the FLAG epitope using anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and the cells were examined under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd.) equipped with the appropriate filter sets. Cells that emitted red fluorescence were evaluated for nuclear morphology. Condensed small nuclei or fragmented nuclei were counted as apoptotic. The apoptotic index was calculated as follows: (number of red-fluorescing cells with apoptotic nuclei)/(number of total red-fluorescing cells counted) × 100. All experiments were performed in duplicate. U2OS cells were transfected with empty pcDNA6, a mammalian expression vector containing a blasticidine resistance gene (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), or with pcDNA6 vector encoding wild-type fortilin, by using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected for ∼3 weeks and characterized by Western blot analysis. For the cytotoxicity assay, U2OS cells stably expressing wild-type fortilin (U2OS.F) and U2OS cells stably harboring empty pcDNA6 (U2OS.E) were seeded in a 96-well plate in quadruplicate. For the investigation of dose response, cells were challenged with various concentrations of etoposide (0–20 μg/ml) for 48 h. For the time course study, cells were challenged with 5 μg/ml of etoposide and harvested after various incubation periods (0–96 h). In both cases, the cell media were assayed for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity released from the cytosol of damaged cells, using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytotoxicity index was calculated as follows: (LDH activity in the media − background LDH activity)/(LDH activity in the medium of cells lysed by 1% Triton X-100 − background LDH activity) × 100. Approximately 2 × 106 U2OS stable transfectants, either expressing fortilin (U2OS.F) or harboring empty expression vector (U2OS.E), both of which have been characterized above, were challenged either with Me2SO (vehicle) or with etoposide at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 48 h. Caspase-3-like activity was then determined as previously described (13Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In brief, cytosolic proteins were extracted in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; all from Sigma) by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The protein concentration of samples was determined by using a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Ten micrograms of cytosolic extracts were added to caspase assay buffer (312.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 31.25% sucrose, 0.3125% CHAPS) with benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin as substrates (Calbiochem). Release of 7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (AFC) was quantified, after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C (or, in the case of time course experiment, every 10 min), using a Fluoroskan system (Thermo-Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) set to an excitation value of 355 nm and emission value of 525 nm. The results were expressed as relative fluorescence units/μg of protein. For the Western blot analysis to evaluate intracellular fortilin concentration with antisense treatment, 1 × 106 MCF-7 cells, a malignant breast ductal carcinoma cell line, were seeded on a six-well plate. The next day, benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fluoromethylketone (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA), a caspase-3 inhibitor, was added to the medium at the concentration of 100 μm. Twenty-four hours after the addition of the caspase inhibitor, cells were transfected with pFLAG-antisense fortilin by FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested immediately after the transfection and 8 h after the transfection by the direct addition of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aporotinin. Exactly 10 μg of protein extracts were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-actin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and anti-fortilin antibodies with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). The rest of the immunoprobing was performed as previously described (36Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the cell survival assay, MCF-7 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates in triplicate. The next day, cells were transfected by FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with either pFLAG-antisense fortilin or empty pFLAG vector, with pFLAG-LacZ used as a transfection survival marker. Cells were harvested 12, 24, 36, 48, or 72 h after the transfection and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with the Galacto-Light Plus Assay Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The loss of exogenous β-galactosidase activity in the assay reflected the death and loss of transfected cells, while the remaining exogenous β-galactosidase activity represented the survival and retention of transfected cells. The survival index of the antisense-treated cells was calculated as follows: (β-galactosidase activity of antisense-treated cells at a given time point)/(β-galactosidase activity of control cells at the same time point) × 100. Dunnett's or two-sample ttests were used to evaluate the difference in apoptotic and survival indices among cells transfected with different plasmids. To evaluate linear trends between the amount of plasmids used for the transfection and apoptotic indices, analysis of variance regression analysis was employed. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. For Dunnett's t test, the confidence intervals were 0.95, and the α value was 0.05. The fortilin cDNA encodes a 172-amino acid polypeptide with no significant homology to any known proteins, in whole or in part. Fortilin is highly conserved not only in mammalian species but also in nonmammalian species (Fig. 1 A). The degree of conservation is unusually high in fortilin; human and mouse Bcl-2 are 72% identical, while human and mouse fortilin are 95% identical. Fortilin does not contain typical nuclear localization signals (41Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), or a hydrophobic transmembrane anchor or signal sequence (Fig. 1,A and B). Overall, fortilin is a hydrophilic protein whose central portion (designated domain 2) is most hydrophilic (Fig. 1 B). In addition, fortilin contains two conserved cysteine residues, one in domain 1 (28th amino acid; Fig. 1 A) and the other at the very C-terminal end (172nd amino acid; Fig. 1 A). It has not been studied whether these cysteine residues are engaged in a disulfide bond formation. Fortilin also contains a potential glycosylation site at Asn51-X 52-Ser53, which is highly conserved. The glycosylation status of fortilin has not been previously investigated and awaits elucidation. Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled human fortilin cDNA as probe revealed the ubiquity of fortilin in normal human tissues (Fig. 2). Fortilin signals were especially abundant in the liver, kidney, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and testis (Fig. 2). The presence of a weaker band at 1.2 kilobase pairs, just above the fortilin 1.0-kilobase pair band, may represent the message of a fortilin-like molecule that remains unidentified. The wide tissue distribution of fortilin, taken together with strikingly high sequence conservation among species, suggests that fortilin plays an essential role in basic cellular function. Next, a polyclonal rabbit anti-fortilin antibody was raised against amino acids 99–113 of fortilin within domain 2 (Fig. 1 B) and was characterized for its ability to bind full-length fortilin (Fig. 3). The anti-fortilin antibody was capable of detecting at least 12.5 ng of His6-fortilin (Fig. 3 A). When blocked with a peptide consisting of amino acids 99–113 of fortilin used as antigen, the antibody no longer bound to the fortilin (Fig. 3 B). In summary, the rabbit anti-fortilin antibody recognized full-length recombinant fortilin with good sensitivity (Fig. 3 A) and specificity (Fig. 3 B).

Activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), exercise, or electrically stimulated contraction leads to increased glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Here we report the first evidence of a direct interaction between AMPK and the most upstream component of the insulin-signaling cascade, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We find that AMPK rapidly phosphorylates IRS-1 on Ser-789 in cell-free assays as well as in mouse C2C12 myotubes incubated with AICAR. In the C2C12 myotubes activation of AMPK by AICAR matched the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-789. This phosphorylation correlates with a 65% increase in insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in C2C12 myotubes preincubated with AICAR. The binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to IRS-1 was not affected by AICAR. These results demonstrate the existence of an interaction between AMPK and early insulin signaling that could be of importance to our understanding of the potentiating effects of exercise on insulin signaling.

Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, in vitro contraction of isolated skeletal muscle can increase glucose transport, suggesting that this stimulus uses a mechanism distinct from that of insulin (1Nesher R.

Ferrannini E. Sato Y. Felig P. Wahren J. J. Clin.

The question as to whether exercise mediates muscle glucose uptake completely independently of insulin or whether exercise and insulin have a common interaction pointin vivo is therefore still unresolved. Studies from several laboratories have suggested that AMPK is a major mediator of contraction-induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle based on the observation that AMPK activity is rapidly elevated by exercise or electrically stimulated contraction (7Winder W.W.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Initially AMPK was found to phosphorylate and inactivate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Later AMPK was demonstrated to modulate a number of key enzymes in energy-regulating metabolic processes including fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, another aspect of the cellular response to energy demand that is highly regulated by insulin (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). However, direct cross-talk between AMPK and the most central axis of insulin signaling has not yet been demonstrated. The insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 contains multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in consensus motifs recognized by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (13Shoelson S.E. Chatterjee S. Chaudhuri M. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A number of proteins including the PI 3-kinase can bind to these tyrosine phosphorylation sites via their respective Src homology 2 domains (14Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, IRS-1 contains a large number of potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites (15Sun X.J. Rothenberg P.

Relatively little is known about the protein-serine/threonine kinases that act on IRS-1, and the mechanisms by which insulin signaling is influenced by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are not yet well understood (16Tanasijevic M.J.

Here we provide the first evidence for a direct interaction between AMPK and the most immediate insulin-signaling events by identifying Ser-789 on IRS-1 as a specific phosphorylation site for AMPK. Our results from C2C12 myotubes stimulated with AICAR suggest the existence of a close interaction between AMPK and early insulin signaling that could be of importance to the potentiating effects of exercise on the metabolic effect of insulin. Human insulin was from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

A sheep was immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide, LRLSSSpSGRLR where Sp = phosphoserine, corresponding to amino acids 784–794 on rat IRS-1. The Ser(P)-789 phospho-specific antibodies were collected by affinity purification of the antiserum by sequential chromatographies on LRLSSSpSGRLR-CH-Sepharose and LRLSSSSGRLR-CH-Sepharose (CH-Sepharose from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing grade trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The peptide LRLSSSpSGRLR corresponding to amino acids 784–794 in rat IRS-1 was synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg, University of Bristol. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Confluent cells were differentiated in DMEM containing 2% horse serum and fused into myotubes after 4 days. Before experiments cells were starved for 3 h in serum-free DMEM and then incubated with 100 nmwortmannin (35 min), 0.5 mm AICAR (30 min), and 10 nm insulin (10 min) alone or in combinations. Wortmannin was included 5 min prior to AICAR and 25 min prior to insulin. AICAR was included 20 min prior to insulin stimulation. Cells were lysed on ice and either subjected to subcellular fractionation as described below or lysed as total cell lysate including 1% Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 270 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). C2C12 myotubes were fractionated following a procedure simplified from that described by Clark et al. (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer, without Triton X-100, by passing 12 times through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 38,000 ×g to remove plasma membranes and high-density microsomes. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged for 75 min at 170,000 ×g to give a pellet (dissolved in lysis buffer) designated high-speed pellet and a supernatant designated cytosol. Total cell lysate and high-speed pellet protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (1:1000 dilution) followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were routinely stripped and reblotted with a second primary antibody. Rat recombinant IRS-1 protein was phosphorylated in vitro by AMPK, purified from rat liver as described previously (26Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out on 0.4 μg of IRS-1 in AMPK assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm AMP, 0.02% Brij-35, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (1:50 dilution)), 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 106cpm/nmol) using 1 unit/ml AMPK (1 unit of AMPK phosphorylates 1 nmol of SAMS peptide/min at 30 °C) in a final volume of 30 μl at 30 °C for various times. Following SDS-PAGE the IRS-1 bands were cut out, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. TheK m and V max values for AMPK activity toward the IRS-1 peptide (LRLSSSSGRLR), its corresponding phosphopeptide (LRLSSSpSGRLR), and the SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) were determined with increasing concentrations of substrate peptide in a total volume of 20 μl under the above-described conditions After 20 min the reaction was stopped and spotted onto phosphocellulose Whatman P81 paper that was washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and counted by Cerenkov counting. Phosphorylated IRS-1 was separated from AMPK by SDS-PAGE, cut out from the dried gel, and washed sequentially in water; 50% acetonitrile, H2O; 100 mm NH4HCO3, and 50 mmNH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile followed by in-gel digestion with 0.2 μg/ml of sequencing grade trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C.32P-Radiolabeled tryptic peptides were recovered by extracting with 50% acetonitrile, 50 mmNH4HCO3 and subjected to two-dimensional TLE/TLC (27Boyle W.J. van der G.P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Radioactive phosphopeptides were detected by PhosphorImager technology. IRS-1-derived tryptic 32P-peptides were lyophilized, reconstituted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, loaded onto a C18 reverse phase peptide/protein column (Vydac C18 4.6 × 250 mm, catalog no. 218TP54), and separated against an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. 32P-Labeled phosphopeptides were detected by liquid scintillation counting of the 0.4-ml fractions collected (28Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled IRS-1 phosphopeptides isolated by HPLC fractionation were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (27Boyle W.J. van der G.P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The site of phosphorylation was determined by solid phase Edman degradation of the 32P-labeled tryptic IRS-1 phosphopeptides (29Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). IRS-1 digested with 0.2 μg/ml endopeptidase Glu-C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C was analyzed by the same procedure as for trypsin-digested IRS-1. IRS-1 and p85-associated IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (250 μg of protein) using 1.5 μg of anti-IRS-1 or anti-p85 antibodies, respectively, and collected with protein A-Sepharose beads. IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the immunocomplex was measured and detected as described previously (30Ridderstrale M. Degerman E. Tornqvist H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3471-3474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). From the screening of a number of purified kinases for their ability to phosphorylate IRS-1, purified AMPK from rat liver was found to rapidly phosphorylate recombinant rat IRS-1 in vitro with a stoichiometry of phosphorylation reaching 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of IRS-1 (Fig. 1 A). Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of IRS-1 established that the phosphate was primarily incorporated into one single tryptic peptide (Fig. 1 B, inset). For the identification of the site phosphorylated on IRS-1 by AMPK we resolved the tryptic digest of IRS-1 by reverse phase HPLC and detected a single peak of radioactivity (Fig. 1 B). This HPLC fraction was first subjected to solid phase Edman degradation with release of radioactivity during cycle 4 (Fig. 1 C). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed phosphorylation exclusively on serine (Fig. 1 D). Assuming no missed cleavages, trypsin would be expected to generate eight peptides from IRS-1 containing a serine residue 4 amino acids distal to the cleavage site. The consensus recognition motif for AMPK is Hyd-(X,Basic)XX(S/T)XXX-Hyd (where Hyd = M, L, I, F, or V and Basic = R > K > H (31Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)). A search of the rat IRS-1 sequence using this motif with the program Findpatterns (from the GCG suite (32Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar)) revealed a single fit to this motif, i.e. Ser-789. This sequence, which is conserved in the human, and the mouse IRS-1 sequence also contain a histidine 6 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylated serine. A basic residue at this position is an additional positive determinant for AMPK. 2D. G. Hardie and J. W. Scott, unpublished. This predicted phosphorylation site at Ser-789 was confirmed by digesting IRS-1 with endopeptidase Glu-C. The HPLC separation of AMPK-phosphorylated IRS-1 digested with endopeptidase Glu-C gave rise to two peaks containing phosphorylated serine that eluted at similar times. Both peaks gave release of phosphate on Edman degradation cycle 12 (data not shown). Ser-789 is the only serine in the rat IRS-1 sequence that is 4 amino acids distal to a trypsin protease cleavage site (residues 786–793) and 12 amino acids distal to an endopeptidase Glu-C cleavage site (residues 778–800/801). In addition AMPK readily phosphorylated the synthetic dephosphopeptide but not the phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 784–794 of rat IRS-1 (Fig. 1 E). The dephosphopeptide was a good substrate for AMPK with aK m of 33 ± 5 μm compared with aK m of 49 ± 4 μm for the SAMS peptide, the standard substrate for AMPK. AMPK had a similarV max toward both peptides. On the basis of these data we conclude that AMPK readily phosphorylates IRS-1 on Ser-789in vitro. To determine whether AMPK phosphorylates IRS-1 on Ser-789 in intact cells, we raised phospho-specific antibodies in sheep against the phosphopeptide LRLSSSpSGRLR. This antibody recognized rat recombinant IRS-1 that had been incubated with MgATP in the presence but not the absence of AMPK (not shown). Incubation of the Ser(P)-789 antibody with the LRLSSSpSGRLR peptide used to raise the antibody abolished its recognition of IRS-1 phosphorylated by AMPK (not shown). Whether IRS-1 is phosphorylated on Ser-789 in intact cells was investigated in mouse C2C12 myotubes stimulated with AICAR. IRS-1 in the high-speed pellet fraction of untreated C2C12 myotubes did not react with the Ser(P)-789 antibody by immunoblot analysis. However, after incubation of the cells with 0.5 mm AICAR for 5–120 min, IRS-1 from C2C12 myotubes was clearly detected using the Ser(P)-789-specific antibody for immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation on Ser-789 of IRS-1 was also found in primary rat hepatocytes and in primary rat adipocytes after stimulation with AICAR (data not shown). To estimate the extent of Ser-789 phosphorylation on IRS-1 in C2C12 myotubes we analyzed, by Western blot analysis using the anti-Ser(P)-789 antibody, samples from AICAR-treated C2C12 myotubes together with recombinant IRS-1 phosphorylated by purified AMPKin vitro. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-789 in C2C12 myotubes appeared comparable to or greater than the stoichiometry of phosphorylation achieved in vitro (Fig. 2 B). Insulin did not induce phosphorylation on Ser-789, and phosphorylation induced by AICAR could not be inhibited by wortmannin, demonstrating that the phosphorylation on Ser-789 does not occur through phosphorylation by Akt or other insulin-activated kinases (Fig. 3). AMPKα1 activation in C2C12 myotubes, judged by assessment of Thr-172 phosphorylation using an anti-Thr(P)-172 antibody, was induced by AICAR treatment and not by insulin stimulation (Fig. 3). AMPKα2 activation by AICAR was also detected but with a much weaker signal than AMPKα1 (data not shown). No modulation of insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 on tyrosine or activation of Akt as judged by phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 was seen in response to AICAR (Fig. 3). Total levels of IRS-1, p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, or Akt in the high-speed pellet were also unchanged in response to AICAR and/or insulin (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effects of Ser-789 phosphorylation on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with insulin (10 nm) and/or AICAR (0.5 mm) in the presence or absence of wortmannin as indicated, and cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. High-speed pellet fractions (15 μg of protein) or total cell lysate (25 μg of protein, AMPK only) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using selective Ser(P)-789-IRS-1, phosphoserine 473-Akt (pS473Akt), or phosphothreonine 172-AMPK (pT172-AMPK) antibodies as indicated. Blots were then stripped and reblotted as appropriate with anti-Tyr(P), anti-IRS-1, anti-p85, anti-Akt, and anti-AMPKα1 antibodies as indicated.pY, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate whether phosphorylation of Ser-789 on IRS-1 induces changes in the formation or activity of the IRS-1-Tyr(P)·p85-PI 3-kinase complex we measured the binding and activation of PI 3-kinase in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates of whole C2C12 cell extracts treated with insulin and/or AICAR. In the absence of insulin no change in p85 or PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 was seen. In the presence of insulin AICAR induced a significant 65% additional increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, whereas no change in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation or binding of p85 to IRS-1 (measured as IRS-1 in p85 immunoprecipitates) was detected (Fig. 4). This synergistic increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was sustained for up to 60 min (data not shown). AICAR on its own did not increase PI 3-kinase activity. By taking an in vitro based approach to screen for purified kinases that demonstrate activity toward IRS-1 we identified AMPK as a potential modifier of insulin signaling through phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-789. The in vitro activity of AMPK toward recombinant IRS-1 was directed toward a single peptide suggesting that AMPK had a high specificity toward this sequence that is conserved in human, rat, and mouse IRS-1. This was supported through determination of the K m for AMPK toward the IRS-1 peptide, which showed that this primary sequence is a good substrate compared with the SAMS peptide, a well characterized AMPK substrate. By producing an antibody that is specific for the detection of IRS-1 phosphorylated on Ser-789 we were able to investigate the occurrence of this phosphorylation in the intact cell by using the high-speed pellet fraction where IRS-1 is highly enriched (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The degree of phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-789 was rapid to a substantial stoichiometry with a time course consistent with previous studies of AMPK activation by AICAR in intact cells (9Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Given that AMPK phosphorylates recombinant IRS-1 exclusively on Ser-789 in vitro, that this site appears to be an excellent substrate for AMPK, and that the same site is phosphorylated in intact cells in response to AICAR, it is very likely that AMPK does indeed phosphorylate IRS-1 in the intact cell. We have no evidence that other protein kinases phosphorylate the same site. If a kinase other than AMPK is responsible, it does not appear to lie downstream of the insulin receptor. Previously serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been demonstrated to correlate with a reduced capacity of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we did not observe impaired insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes despite the observation that IRS-1 appears to be phosphorylated on Ser-789 to a high stoichiometry following AICAR treatment. Importantly and in contrast, we observed an increased activity of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase as seen in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. Since neither insulin-induced association between the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and IRS-1 nor cellular distribution of p85, IRS-1, or IRS-1-Tyr(P) is changed by AICAR stimulation it appears that the PI 3-kinase associated with Ser-789-phosphorylated IRS-1 is in a more active form than the PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1 not phosphorylated on Ser-789. The reason why we do not see altered insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the presence of AICAR is not known. One explanation could be given by previous findings suggesting that only a small amount of insulin is necessary to fully activate Akt (33Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J.

Recently it has been reported that expression of a dominant inhibitory mutant of AMPK in mouse muscle completely blocks the ability of AICAR to activate hexose uptake, whereas contraction-induced hexose uptake is only partially reduced indicating that there are at least partly divergent pathways responsible for the effects of AICARversus contraction on glucose uptake (35Mu J.

Partly divergent pathways for AICAR- versus contraction-induced effects on glucose uptake could possibly explain the divergence between our findings and the reported decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in insulin-stimulated muscle after contraction (36Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Aslesen R. O'Rahilly S. Jensen J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Wojtaszewski J.F. Hansen B.F. Kiens B. Richter E.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings that IRS-1 phosphorylation on Ser-789 also occurs in primary rat adipocytes and in hepatocytes exposed to AICAR imply that there has to be a stimulus for phosphorylation of Ser-789 other than contraction. It points to the existence of a more general mechanism for insulin-responsive cells to react to changes in ATP levels. Possibly this includes direction of signaling via IRS-1 toward intracellular energy-restoring processes, e.g. by increasing glucose uptake and reducing fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Several reports from studies on incubated muscles have shown that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but not contraction-stimulated glucose uptake (11Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 38Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, another report demonstrates that wortmannin does inhibit some of the contraction-stimulated glucose transport in rat skeletal muscle suggesting that the signaling pathways activated by insulin and exercise might also converge on a common effector (39Wojtaszewski J.F. Hansen B.F. Urso B. Richter E.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This would explain the circumstances where the combination of insulin and exercise show a synergistic effect on glucose transport (5Vranic M. Kawamori R. Pek S. Kovacevic N. Wrenshall G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Sato Y. Felig P. Wahren J. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In conclusion we suggest that phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-789 by AMPK might represent a novel mechanism for insulin-responsive cells to react to changes in cellular energy status. This could be by directing signaling through IRS-1 toward energy-restoring processes or via an overall potentiating effect on insulin signaling mediated by an increased activity of the PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1. Exercise could be the effect that initiates these mechanisms in muscle. We believe this is the first report that identifies a specific serine phosphorylation on IRS-1 that may positively affect insulin signaling.

Here, we investigated whether VLDL overproduction was associated with down-regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and insulin resistance. Hepatocytes isolated from fructose-fed hamsters exhibited significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity as well as insulin-stimulated Akt-Ser473 and Akt-Thr308 phosphorylation were also significantly reduced with fructose feeding. Interestingly, the protein mass and activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) were significantly higher in fructose-fed hamster hepatocytes. Chronic ex vivo exposure of control hamster hepatocytes to high insulin also appeared to attenuate insulin signaling and increase PTP-1B. Elevation in PTP-1B coincided with marked suppression of ER-60, a cysteine protease postulated to play a role in intracellular apoB degradation, and an increase in the synthesis and secretion of apoB. Sodium orthovanadate, a general phosphatase inhibitor, partially restored insulin receptor phosphorylation and significantly reduced apoB secretion. In summary, we hypothesize that fructose feeding induces hepatic insulin resistance at least in part via an increase in expression of PTP-1B. Induction of hepatic insulin resistance may then contribute to reduced apoB degradation and enhanced VLDL particle assembly and secretion.

The atherogenic dyslipidemia commonly associated with insulin-resistant states consists of hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL),1 low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (8Taskinen M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and elevated small, dense low density lipoprotein (9Reaven G.M. Chen Y.D. Jeppesen J. Maheux P. Krauss R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the most fundamental defect in these patients is resistance to the cellular actions of insulin, particularly resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, leading to hyperinsulinemia, enhanced VLDL secretion by the liver, and hypertriglyceridemia (10Reaven G.M. Metabolism. 1992; 41: 16-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Assembly and secretion of VLDL is a complex process involving the interaction of apolipoprotein B (apoB) with both core and surface lipids to form a lipoprotein particle (for reviews, see Refs. 11Davis R.A.

An important determinant of apoB secretion appears to be intracellular stability of the protein, and a substantial amount of newly synthesized apoB is known to be subjected to intracellular degradation (for a review, see Ref. 13Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the major mode of apoB degradation appears to involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system (14Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol.

Metabolism. 1994; 43: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) also found increased sensitivity to the inhibitory action of insulin on apoB secretion in hepatocytes derived from partial hepatectomy rats compared with that of normal rats. The inhibitory effect of insulin was attributed to reduced synthesis and increased degradation of apoB in cells incubated with the hormone (24Jackson T.K. Salhanick A.I. Elovson J. Deichman M.L. Amatruda J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1746-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,37Sparks J.D. Corsetti J.P. Sparks C.E.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9603-9606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that insulin exerted this effect through its receptor. Studies in our laboratory, using a cell-free system, have shown that insulin attenuates the rate of apoB mRNA translation (38Theriault A. Cheung R. Adeli K. Clin. Biochem. 1992; 25: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Adeli K. Theriault A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ApoB availability may thus be a limiting factor in VLDL assembly and secretion in insulin-treated hepatocytes (40Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sparks and co-workers (41Sparks J.D. Phung T.L. Bolognino M. Sparks C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in rat hepatocytes, insulin-mediated inhibition of apoB was a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-dependent process. They also reported (42Phung T.L. Roncone A. Jensen K.L. Sparks C.E. Sparks J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30693-30702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that in rat hepatocytes, PI 3-kinase activity was necessary for insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion and showed insulin-induced activation and localization of PI 3-kinase and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in an ER fraction containing apoB. Insulin can also affect the phosphorylation of apoB (24Jackson T.K. Salhanick A.I. Elovson J. Deichman M.L. Amatruda J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1746-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Insulin may also exert its suppressive effect on VLDL secretion through regulating microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). The promoter region of the MTP gene has an insulin response element, which is negatively regulated by the hormone (23Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast to acute effects, chronic exposure of primary rat hepatocytes (34Bjornsson O.G. Duerden J.M. Bartlett S.M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells (43Dashti N. Williams D.L. Alaupovic P. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1365-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to insulin increased apoB secretion. Inui et al. (44Inui Y. Keno Y. Fukuda K. Igura T. Makamura T. Tokunaga K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1997; 21: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported that in obese rats, hepatic fatty acid synthesis and apoB transcription increased compared with lean rats. The same group later showed that in obese rats fed a high sucrose diet, apoB mRNA levels remained constant, while hepatic fatty acid synthesis and apoA-IV gene expression were elevated (44Inui Y. Keno Y. Fukuda K. Igura T. Makamura T. Tokunaga K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1997; 21: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Bourgeois et al. (45Bourgeois C.S. Wiggins D. Hems R. Gibbons G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E208-E215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sparks and Sparks (46Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that hepatocytes prepared from obese Zuker rats were resistant to the inhibitory effects of insulin. Sparks et al. (32Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Miller L.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that in cultured hepatocytes from diabetic rats, insulin failed to inhibit apoB secretion. Thus, hepatic insulin resistance may contribute to insensitivity of apoB secretion to the inhibitory actions of insulin. There is a significant gap of knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms that lead to deregulation of VLDL/apoB secretion in insulin-resistant states. We have recently studied the molecular mechanisms of VLDL overproduction in an animal model of diet-induced insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster (47Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Van Iderstine S.C. Chen B. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). High fructose feeding induced whole body insulin resistance, which was associated with hyperinsulinemia, hepatic MTP overexpression, and enhanced intrahepatic stability and assembly of apoB containing lipoproteins, leading to VLDL oversecretion (47Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Van Iderstine S.C. Chen B. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have attempted to investigate the link between possible impairment of the insulin signaling pathway in the liver to VLDL-apoB overproduction in hepatocytes isolated from insulin-resistant hamsters. Using a combination of ex vivo and in vitroexperiments, we provide evidence for significant down-regulation of hepatic insulin signaling in the fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamster model as documented by attenuated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and IRS-2; decreased activity of phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase; reduced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB; and overexpression and overactivity of PTP-1B. The potential link between down-regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and factors involved in the synthesis and secretion of VLDL-apoB including MTP and ER-60 protease was also explored. Male Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) weighing 100–120 g were purchased from Charles River (Montréal, Canada). Fetal bovine serum (certified grade), liver perfusion medium, hepatocyte wash medium, liver digest medium, hepatocyte attachment medium, and Williams' medium E were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All surgical disposable materials were obtained from Johnson & Johnson Medical Inc. (Arlington, TX). Rabbit anti-human insulin receptor β-subunit, rabbit anti-human IRS-1, and rabbit anti-p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IRS-2 rabbit polyclonal IgG was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse anti-PTP-1B monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-total Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), and anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-hamster apoB antiserum was prepared by Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA) using hamster low density lipoprotein prepared in our laboratory. Specificity of this commercial preparation of anti-apoB polyclonal antibody and lack of any cross-reactivity to other hamster apolipoproteins (apoAI or apoE) was confirmed by immunblotting analysis of purified plasma lipoprotein fractions. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. pp60c-src C-terminal phosphoregulatory peptide (TSTEPQpYQPGENL; where pY represents phosphotyrosine) and Biomol Green reagent were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All animals were housed individually and given free access to food and water. Normal chow was given for 2 days before blood samples were drawn and animals were placed on either the control diet (normal chow) or fructose-enriched diet (pelleted hamster diet containing 60% fructose; Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA). The diet was continued for 3 weeks, and hamster weight was monitored every 2 days. At the end of the 3-week feeding period, hamsters were fasted overnight, and blood samples were collected from the orbital sinus for measurement of a number of analytes in plasma. Hamsters were then fed for another day and were anesthetized by isoflurane. After achieving complete general anesthesia, the liver was perfused as described (48Taghibiglou C. Rudy D. Van Iderstine S.C. Aiton A. Cavallo D. Cheung R. Adeli K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 499-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes released from digested liver tissue were washed three times in hepatocyte wash medium and transferred into culture medium (hepatocyte attachment medium containing 5% FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin) and seeded in collagen-coated plates (1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm plate). After 4 h, medium was changed to Williams' medium E containing 5% FBS, 0.0015 μg/ml insulin, and antibiotics, and these cells were used for experiments either immediately or after overnight incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In some experiments, the effects of chronic incubation with high insulin concentrations (1–10 μg/ml) were studied using hepatocytes isolated from control hamsters. Primary hamster hepatocytes were preincubated in methionine-free minimum essential medium at 37 °C for 1 h and labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 45–60 min. Following the labeling pulse, the cells were washed twice and chased in Williams' medium E or hepatocyte attachment medium supplemented with 10 mm unlabeled methionine. At various chase times, duplicate or triplicate dishes were harvested, and cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 2 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge (12,000 rpm), and supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. For the vanadate dose-response studies, primary hepatocytes isolated from fructose-fed hamsters were incubated with culture medium containing 5% FBS, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μm vanadate for 6 h, and then culture medium was replaced with methionine-free α-minimum essential medium (with insulin and 0–80 μm vanadate) for 1 h and labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 90 min. Media and cell lysates were then subjected to apoB immunoprecipitation. In order to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor β-subunit, IRS-1, and IRS-2, hepatocytes derived from control and fructose-fed hamsters were incubated for 5 h in a serum- and insulin-free medium. Half of the cells in each group were then stimulated with 100 nminsulin for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with a buffer containing a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P 40, 2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific polyclonal antibody against either insulin receptor β-subunit, IRS-1, or IRS-2 (1 μg of antibody/0.5 mg of total cell lysate) using 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose (for each sample). Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times at 4 °C using wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Nonidet P 40, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody αpY (1:1000 dilution) using enhanced chemiluminescence as described below. The PI 3-kinase assays were performed as described (49Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 50Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes isolated from control and fructose-fed hamsters were incubated in serum- and insulin-free medium for 5 h and then exposed to 100 nm insulin for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and lysed in solubilizing buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies at 4 °C. PI 3-kinase activity was measured on p85 or phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. All immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated for 5 min with 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm final concentration, 10 μCi/reaction) in 20 mm MgCl2 and then stopped after 10 min by the addition of 8 m HCl. The lipids were extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). 50 μl of the lower phase was applied to a silica gel 60 F254 thin layer chromatography plastic sheet (Merck), and lipids were separated in a chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:47:12:2) solvent system. Radiolabeled lipids were quantitated using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The in vitro PTP activity assay was conducted based on a protocol previously published by Choet al. (51Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Hepatocytes isolated from control and fructose-fed hamsters were lysed in solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 2 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. Prior to immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were subjected to preclearing with nonimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal quantities of each sample (750 μg of total protein) were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PTP-1B antibody (Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products) at 4 °C overnight. PTP-1B immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed in PTP assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The pp60c-src C-terminal phosphoregulatory peptide (TSTEPQpYQPGENL; Biomol) was added to a final concentration of 200 μm in a total reaction volume of 60 μl in PTP assay buffer, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C. At the end of the reaction, 40-μl aliquots were placed into a 96-well plate, 100 μl of Biomol Green reagent (Biomol) was added, and absorbance was measured at 630 nm. Cell samples either directly or after immunoprecipitation against a target protein were subjected to chemiluminescent immunoblotting for the insulin receptor β-subunit, IRS-1, IRS-2, and Akt/PKB, their phosphorylated forms, and other proteins such as ER-60 and PTP-1B. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 8 or 10% polyacrylamide minigels (8 × 5 cm). Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically overnight at 4 °C onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Rad Wet Transfer System. The membranes were blocked with a 5% solution of fat-free dry milk powder, incubated with relevant antiserum, washed, and then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase. Membranes were then incubated in an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 s and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. Hyperfilm. Films were developed, and quantitative analysis was performed using an Imaging Densitometer. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (48Taghibiglou C. Rudy D. Van Iderstine S.C. Aiton A. Cavallo D. Cheung R. Adeli K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 499-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and prepared for SDS-PAGE by resuspension and boiling in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed and saturated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before being dried and exposed to Dupont autoradiographic film at −80 °C for 1–4 days. ApoB bands were excised from the gel, digested in hydrogen peroxide/perchloric acid, and associated radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. To establish whether VLDL-apoB overproduction was induced by fructose feeding in the present study, we performed ex vivo steady state labeling experiments in which hepatocytes from control and fructose-fed hamsters were radiolabeled for a 2-h period. Radiolabeled apoB associated with VLDL particles secreted into the culture medium was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Fig. 1 shows the immunoprecipitable VLDL-apoB secreted by control and fructose-fed hepatocytes. There was a highly significant (∼3.6-fold) elevation in the amount of VLDL-apoB secreted into the medium by hepatocytes derived from fructose-fed hamsters. Increased VLDL-apoB levels suggest the secretion of a considerably higher number of VLDL particles by hepatocytes isolated from fructose-fed hamsters compared with control hepatocytes and confirm our previous observation (47Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Van Iderstine S.C. Chen B. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Fructose-fed hamsters exhibiting VLDL-apoB overproduction also showed evidence of whole body insulin resistance based on elevated plasma levels of insulin, triglyceride, and free fatty acids (data not shown). Although euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were not performed in the animals used in the present study, this technique was used previously to document the induction of whole body insulin resistance in the fructose-fed hamster model (47Taghibiglou C.

Phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and its substrate proteins was assessed in hepatocytes derived from control and fructose-fed hamsters. As depicted in Fig.2A, basal insulin receptor phosphorylation (in the absence of insulin) in hepatocytes isolated from control and fructose-fed hamsters was too weak to be detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting methods. However, in control hepatocytes, insulin-induced phosphorylation of its receptor was about 2-fold higher"

In plants, the existence of SO has not yet been demonstrated, while sulfite reductase as part of sulfur assimilation is well characterized. Here we report the cloning of a plant sulfite oxidase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein (At-SO). At-SO is a molybdenum enzyme with molybdopterin as an organic component of the molybdenum cofactor. In contrast to homologous animal enzymes, At-SO lacks the heme domain, which is evident both from the amino acid sequence and from its enzymological and spectral properties. Thus, among eukaryotes, At-SO is the only molybdenum enzyme yet described possessing no redox-active centers other than the molybdenum. UV-visible and EPR spectra as well as apparent K m values are presented and compared with the hepatic enzyme. Subcellular analysis of crude cell extracts showed that SO was mostly found in the peroxisomal fraction. In molybdenum cofactor mutants, the activity of SO was strongly reduced. Using antibodies directed against At-SO, we show that a cross-reacting protein of similar size occurs in a wide range of plant species, including both herbacious and woody plants.

Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Molybdenum enzymes are important for such diverse metabolic processes as sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), nitrate assimilation in autotrophs, and phytohormone synthesis in plants (3Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar). With the exception of nitrogenase, in all molybdenum enzymes studied so far, molybdenum is part of a so-called molybdenum cofactor (Moco).1 Sulfite oxidase (SO) from vertebrate sources is among the best studied molybdenum enzymes. Mammalian and avian SO (EC 1.8.3.1) is a homodimeric protein consisting of an N-terminal heme domain and a C-terminal Moco domain (4Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its crystal structure has been solved (6Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). SO catalyzes the reaction SO32− + H2O → SO42− + 2H+ + 2e−, which is the important terminal step in the oxidative degradation of cysteine, methionine, and membrane components such as the sulfatides. Deficiency of this enzyme in humans leads to major neurological abnormalities and early death (7Garrett R.M. Johnson J.L. Graf T.N. Feigenbaum A. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In mammals, SO is localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (8Cohen H.J. Betcher-Lange S. Kessler D.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7759-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where electrons derived from sulfite are passed on to cytochromec, the physiological electron acceptor. SO has been extensively studied by EPR (9Raitsimring A.M. Pacheco A. Enemark J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11263-11278Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and resonance Raman spectroscopy (10Johnson M.K. Garton S.D. Oku H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 797-803Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as rapid kinetic methods, and a detailed model for the reaction mechanism has been published (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Together with eukaryotic assimilatory nitrate reductase (NR), SO forms a family of molybdenum enzymes that contain a dioxomolybdenum center (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Like SO, NR is a homodimeric enzyme with a Moco domain, a heme domain, and a third FAD-binding domain that does not occur in SO (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In plants, during primary sulfate assimilation in the chloroplast, sulfate is reduced via sulfite to organic sulfide, which is essential for cysteine biosynthesis (11Leustek T. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, there are reports that sulfite can be reoxidized to sulfate (e.g. when plants are subjected to SO2 gas (as reviewed in Ref. 12Heber U. Hüve K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 177: 255-286Crossref Google Scholar) or when isolated chloroplasts are fed with radioactively labeled sulfite) (13Dittrich A.P.M. Pfanz H. Heber U. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sulfite oxidation in intact chloroplasts is enhanced by light and sensitive to inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport (13Dittrich A.P.M. Pfanz H. Heber U. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Zimierski A. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 9-14Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and thus was interpreted to be primarily due to nonenzymatic reactions during electron transport. Another sulfite-oxidizing activity has been found to be associated with thylakoid membranes (15Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 667-672Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although this enriched enzyme fraction exhibited properties that were different from the hepatic enzyme. Another report describes the purification of a SO activity from the plant Malva sylvestris (16Ganai B.A. Masood A. Baig M.A. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 879-880Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); however, the enzyme had a molecular mass of only 27 kDa. Here we report the cloning of the plant SO gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (At-SO) and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. Additionally, native SO was purified fromNicotiana tabacum (Nt-SO) leaves, and its properties were compared with At-SO. At-SO is a molybdenum enzyme with molybdenum-MPT as molybdenum cofactor. In contrast to animal SO, At-SO lacks the heme domain, which is evident both from the amino acid sequence and from its enzymological and spectral properties. Thus, among eukaryotes, At-SO is the only known molybdenum enzyme lacking other redox-active centers. Another difference from animal SO is that At-SO is localized mostly in the peroxisomal fraction. Finally, using antibodies directed against At-SO, we show that a cross-reacting protein of similar size occurs in a wide range of plant species belonging to herbacious and woody plants. The expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number AV 540461) was used to screen an A. thaliana cDNA library (λ YES), resulting in the isolation and identification of a cDNA encoding for A. thaliana SO (At-sox) which was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), yielding pBS-At-sox. Hybridizations and Southern blotting were performed according to standard molecular biology techniques. The full-length At-sox cDNA (1443 base pairs) showed a single open reading frame of 1182. For overexpression and purification of recombinantA. thaliana SO (rAt-SO), the QIAexpress kit (Qiagen) for metal ion chelating chromatography of His-tagged proteins was used. The His6 tag was fused to the C-terminal end of the protein separated by two additional amino acids. At-sox was PCR-cloned into NcoI- and BglII-digested pQE-60, resulting in pQE60-At-sox. Initial experiments were performed by using pQE60-At-sox to express recombinant At-SO (rAt-SO) in Escherichia coli M15 cells. However, in order to express large amounts of protein with a high saturation of Moco, the expression cassette of pQE60-At-sox(EcoRI-HindIII fragment) was subcloned into pQE80, yielding pQE80-At-sox, allowing a pREP4-independent expression. Recombinant At-SO (rAt-SO) was expressed from pQE80-At-sox in the E. coli strain TP1000 (genotype ΔmobAB), which was previously used for expression of recombinant human SO with a saturation of Moco (17Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TP1000/pQE80-At-sox was grown aerobically at 37 °C overnight in LB supplemented with antibiotics. This culture was diluted 1:50 into 2× YT medium containing 1 mm Na2MoO4 and 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactoside. Aerobic growth was continued for 24 h at 22 °C. Purification of soluble rAt-SO was performed at 4 °C by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow matrix (Quiagen). Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and pure fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM10 membrane (Amicon), sterile filtrated through 0.2-μm membranes, and stored at 4 °C or in aliquots at −70 °C. The protein preparation was stable at 4 °C for several weeks after dialyzing and concentrating to 2–10 mg/ml. Concentration of rAt-SO was determined by UV spectroscopy using the calculated extinction coefficient of ε = 69.820m−1 cm−1. Polyclonal antibodies were generated against purified rAt-SO protein (Eurogentec). Size exclusion chromatography was performed with an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the analytical Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 μl of purified rAt-SO was separated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The molecular weight was determined using a calibration curve obtained from the retention times of standard proteins (ovalbumin, 43 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; equine myoglobulin, 17 kDa; ribonuclease A, 14 kDa; vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa). Fresh N. tabacum leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 3–5 ml of extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES buffer, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mmNa2MoO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.3)/g of cell powder, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant designated as crude extract was directly applied to a Source Q30 anion exchange column that was previously equilibrated and washed with 5 bed volumes of extraction buffer. Subsequently, the enzyme was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in extraction buffer of 15 bed volumes. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-At-SO-antibody generated in this study. Positive fractions were concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography in 100-μl aliquots using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Finally, the positive fractions were concentrated, rebuffered in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and applied to a strong anion exchange MacroPrep Q10 μm support (Bioscale Q2; Bio-Rad). The enzyme was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 bed volumes of extraction buffer. SO was routinely assayed at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris buffer, adjusted to pH 8.0 with acetic acid, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction was monitored in a Hewlett-Packard 8452A single beam diode array spectrophotometer following reduction of ferricyanide (ε = 1020m−1 cm−1) at 420 nm. One unit of SO activity was defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of sulfite/min. Cytochrome c reductase activity was assayed as described (4Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content in crude protein extracts was determined as described (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed aerobically at 25 °C using a 1.0-cm light path cuvette and a final sample volume of 1.0 ml. All experiments were performed with assay buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0). All experiments were performed using buffers in which the pH was adjusted with acetic acid; in each case, less than 35 mm acetic acid was used. A full steady-state kinetic study was conducted at pH 8.0 with fresh enzyme, using a saturating concentration of ferricyanide, 395 μm(66-fold greater than K m), and varying the concentration of sulfite between 2.5 and 400 μm. The UV-visible absorption spectra of oxidized and reduced rAt-SO were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer and compared with the spectrum of oxidized and reduced sulfite oxidase from chicken liver (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) SO was reduced with sulfite or dithionite, and a wave scan was recorded between 300 and 550 nm. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded with a Brücker ER 300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 035 m gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352 B microwave frequency counter. Temperature control at 150 K was achieved using a Brücker ER 4111 VT continuous flow liquid nitrogen cryostat. MPT was detected and quantified by converting it to the stable oxidation product, FormA-dephospho, according to Johnson and Rajagopalan (20Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Oxidation, dephosphorylation, QAE chromatography, and HPLC analysis were performed as described in detail previously (21Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FormA-dephospho was quantified by comparison with a standard isolated from xanthine oxidase (Sigma) for which the absorptivity was ε380 = 13,200m−1 cm−1 (20Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Biologically active Moco was detected by the nit-1 assay in the absence of additional molybdate exactly as described earlier (22Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Nicotiana plumbaginifolia leaves were extracted and fractionated as described (23Neuburger M. Journet E.P. Bligny R. Carde J.P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE. For immunodetection, the polyclonal anti-rAt-SO antibody was affinity-purified against purified rAt-SO as described (24Yamaya T. Hayakawa T. Tanasawa K. Kamachi K. Mae T. Ojima K. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:500 prior to use. Using the amino acid sequence of human (XP_006727) or chicken SO (P07850), a TblastN search in GenBankTM identified an A. thaliana expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM AV 540461) that was sequenced and showed an open reading frame of 393 amino acids (43.3 kDa) with 47% identity to the primary sequence of the Moco domain of chicken SO (Fig. 1 A). However, the sequence for the heme domain known from animal SO was lacking in this clone. To exclude the possibility that the identified cDNA was truncated at the 5′-end, the genomic structure of this gene encoding for a putative SO was analyzed (GenBankTM BAC clone F28J7). The genomic sequence showed a single open reading frame with 11 introns, and it was located on chromosome III next to the RI marker mi74b at 5.8 centimorgans; however, no sequence encoding for a heme domain was found upstream or downstream of this gene. High stringency hybridization of Arabidopsis genomic DNA with the isolated cDNA clone as probe demonstrated that the gene encoding for the putative Arabidopsis SO (At-sox) was a single copy gene (data not shown). The cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF200972) as plant SO cDNA. The alignment of the protein sequences of Moco domains from animal SOs with sequences from plant SO and plant NR (Fig. 1 A) shows that the putative At-SO has higher homologies to mammalian SO than toArabidopsis NR. Since SO and NR belong to the same class of molybdenum enzymes, a significant conservation between the SO sequences shown and Arabidopsis NR can be seen (Fig. 1 A,dark shadings). However, there are several SO-specific residues exclusively conserved between the members of the SO family, and most of them are present in the plant homologue as well (Fig. 1 A; gray shadings). For comparison, the domain structures of animal and plant SO and of NR are shown (Fig. 1 B). In order to provide evidence that the isolated cDNA encodes for a functional SO, the enzymatic properties of the gene product have been determined. For recombinant expression, the isolated ArabidopsiscDNA was cloned into a bacterial expression vector, allowing the expression and purification as His-tagged protein from E. coli. rAt-SO was purified to more than 98% homogeneity, and N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein revealed the correct translational start. The protein exhibited a sulfite dependent SO activity when using ferricyanide as electron acceptor. No activity was found with cytochrome c as electron acceptor (data not shown), as expected, since the heme domain is known to mediate electron transfer between the Moco domain and cytochrome c in rat hepatic SO (5Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m value for sulfite in the ferricyanide assay (Fig. 2 A) was determined to be 33.8 ± 3.2 μm, which is in the same range as found for rat SO (33 μm (19Brody M.S. Hille R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Like hepatic SO (25Kessler D.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), rAt-SO could also be inhibited by increased ionic strength. The following buffers, salts, and the substrate analogue nitrate each caused a 50% inhibition at the given concentration: Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) at 90 mm, potassium phosphate (pH 8.5) at 30 mm, NaCl in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) at 70 mm, and potassium nitrate at 1 mm, respectively. rAt-SO was unable to reduce nitrate when using reduced methyl viologen as electron donor (data not shown). FPLC size exclusion chromatography of rAt-SO resulted in two distinct peaks. The major peak eluted at 14.30 ml, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 39.53 kDa, while the minor peak eluted at 12.61 ml, which corresponds to 109.37 kDa (Fig. 2 B), Based on the size of At-SO predicted from the amino acid sequence (43.3 kDa), it can be concluded that the majority of the protein is monomeric. In eukaryotic molybdenum enzymes, molybdenum is coordinated by an MPT-based cofactor. HPLC analysis of the MPT oxidation product FormA-dephospho confirmed the pterin nature of the Moco bound to rAt-SO (Fig. 2 C). The ratio of MPT to rAt-SO monomer was determined to be 1:0.83. Without Moco-releasing treatment, rAt-SO was positive in the nit-1 reconstitution assay; rAt-SO donated Moco to the NR apoprotein in crude extracts of the Moco-deficient Neurospora crassa mutant nit-1, thereby restoring NR activity (data not shown), demonstrating the previous successful incorporation of the metal-containing cofactor into rAt-SO. As will be shown below, also the spectroscopic properties of rAt-SO confirm that plant SO contains the same Moco as all other members of the SO family. The UV-visible absorption spectra of rAt-SO (Fig. 3 A) showed the absence of a prosthetic heme group. The spectrum of the oxidized enzyme, with an absorption maximum at 360 nm and a shoulder at ∼480 nm is very similar to the spectrum reported for the Moco domain of tryptically cleaved rat SO (5Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2017-2025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the recombinant Moco domain of human SO (26Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These absorption bands, attributable to cysteine-to-molybdenum and enedithiolate-to-molybdenum charge-transfer bands, respectively (27Garton S.D. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2590-2591Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), are lost in the reduced enzyme. The EPR spectra of rAt-SO at pH 10 and pH 6 upon partial reduction with sulfite are shown in Fig. 3 B. At high pH, the EPR signal, with g1,2,3 = 1.991, 1.965, 1.958, is essentially identical to the signal exhibited by the chicken liver enzyme under the same conditions (g1,2,3 = 1.987, 1.9641, 1.953) (28Lamy M.T. Gutteridge S. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At low pH, the chicken enzyme shows a characteristic shift in g value (g1,2,3 = 2.004, 1.972, 1.966) and the appearance of hyperfine splitting due to one strongly coupled proton (a1,2,3 = 8.5, 8.0, 13.0 G) (28Lamy M.T. Gutteridge S. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With rAt-SO, however, the observed EPR spectrum was clearly a composite due to at least two EPR-active species, although the doublet to low field resembled that observed at low pH with the chicken enzyme. Repeated attempts under a variety of experimental conditions did not give a pure signal analogous to the low pH signal seen with the vertebrate forms of the enzyme, due at least in part to the instability of the plant enzyme below pH 6.0 (data not shown). Furthermore, no EPR signal comparable with the phosphate-inhibited signal observed at more moderate pH with the chicken enzyme (28Lamy M.T. Gutteridge S. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) is seen with the Arabidopsis protein (data not shown), even in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. On the basis of the UV-visible absorption and EPR signal at high pH, however, it is evident that the molybdenum center of the At-SO is fundamentally similar to that of the vertebrate proteins. The lack of a phosphate-inhibited or pure low pH EPR signal is most likely due to differences in substrate binding and pK a values of active site residues, respectively. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against rAt-SO, a single band at 45 kDa was detected in immunoblots of crude protein extracts of A. thaliana leaves, the size of which is identical to the size of the protein as predicted from the primary sequence (Fig. 4 A,lane 1). A similar result was obtained when analyzing crude extracts of leaves from tobacco (N. tabacum), N. plumbaginifolia, pea, spinach, barley, carrot, and poplar trees (Fig. 4 A). Thus, in representative species of monocot and dicot plants and of herbacious and woody plants, a protein is expressed with a size similar to rAt-SO and with immunologically relevant epitopes that are conserved over a wide evolutionary range. Assuming that the polyclonal serum generated against rAt-SO exclusively recognizes SO proteins in all other plants analyzed, one can conclude that plant SOs contain only a single Moco domain and that they are widely expressed. In plants, previous studies showed that SO activities were detectable using ferricyanide as electron acceptor (15Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 667-672Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or utilizing radioactively labeled sulfur compounds (14Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Zimierski A. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 9-14Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If SO as a novel plant molybdenum enzyme is the only sulfite-oxidizing activity in plants, no SO activity should be measurable in Moco-deficient mutants. Plant Moco mutants are characterized by the loss of activity of all molybdenum enzymes (i.e. NR, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase) (29Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; 203: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, Moco mutants derived from five Moco-specific loci are known; however, all of these mutants are leaky and exhibit relatively high background activities of molybdenum enzymes (30Braaksma F.J. Feenstra W.J. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1982; 64: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31LaBrie S.T. Wilkinson J.Q. Tsay Y.F. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose the N. plumbaginifolia system, where nonleaky Moco mutants are available (32Gabard J. Pelsy F. Marion-Poll A.

Determination of SO activity in nongreen cell suspension cultures of mutants defective in the Moco loci cnxA, cnxC, and cnxE, respectively, showed that these cells still had SO activities of 39 ± 6% of wild type activity in the standard assay (Fig. 4 B). No NR, xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase activities were detected in these cells (Refs. 32Gabard J. Pelsy F. Marion-Poll A. Caboche M. Saalbach I. Grafe R. Müller A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 275-281Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 34Schwarz G. Schulze J. Bittner F. Eilers T. Kuper J. Bollmann G. Nerlich A. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2455-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; data not shown). Mutants in the cnxA locus are defective in the insertion of molybdenum into MPT and can be therefore partially repaired by growing them in the presence of high molybdate (34Schwarz G. Schulze J. Bittner F. Eilers T. Kuper J. Bollmann G. Nerlich A. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2455-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Mendel R.R. Alikulov Z.A. Lvov N.P. Müller A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 395-399Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SO activity in cnxA mutants grown in a medium containing 1 mm molybdate was found to be increased to 65 ± 8% of wild type activity (Fig. 4 B), which is a direct correlation between the availability of Moco and the SO activity in plants. We conclude, therefore, that in N. plumbaginifolia about 60% of the cellular capacity to oxidize sulfite is due to the novel molybdenum enzyme SO. The nature of the residual sulfite-oxidizing activities remains unclear. In higher plants, the enzymes for primary sulfate assimilation are localized in the chloroplasts, where sulfate is reduced via sulfite to organic sulfide (11Leustek T. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Because SO would principally counteract the function of sulfite reductase, we investigated whether SO is also localized in the chloroplasts. Crude extracts of N. plumbaginifolia leaves were separated into their subcellular fractions and SO was immunodetected after SDS-PAGE of these fractions. Fig. 5 A shows that SO could be found in the peroxisomal fraction but not in chloroplasts, which coincides with the presence of the peroxisome import motif SNL at the C terminus of the enzyme (see Fig. 1 A). Compared with animal SO, these three additional amino acids are an extension of the C terminus that was found to be solvent-exposed in the crystal structure of chicken SO (6Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated with leaves from different developmental stages and also with leaves from Arabidopsis (data not shown), and always the same results as shown in Fig. 5 A were obtained. So we conclude that SO is not localized in the chloroplast and therefore probably not interfering with primary sulfate assimilation. After showing that in plant crude extracts SO activity can be detected that is dependent on the biosynthesis of Moco, we wanted to demonstrate that this enzymatic activity is identical to the ArabidopsisSO that was identified, recombinantly expressed, and biochemically characterized above. Therefore, native Nt-SO was purified to more than 98% homogeneity by applying ion exchange chromatography followed by FPLC size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5 B), resulting in an ∼100-fold enrichment of the protein. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein (Fig. 5 C) revealed that out of 12 amino acids, 11 were identical to the N terminus of A. thaliana SO (Fig. 5 D). The K m value for sulfite was determined to be 51.4 μm (Fig. 5 E), which is in the same range as found for rAt-SO (33.8 μm). During our molecular studies of molybdenum metabolism in plants we isolated a cDNA from A. thaliana encoding for a protein with high homologies to animal SO. The plant sequence encodes for a SO-type Moco domain, but surprisingly the heme domain was lacking. Analysis of the genomic structure of this gene proved the absence of any sequence coding for a heme-like domain, which is consistent with 1) the absence of cytochrome c-dependent SO activity of both recombinantly expressed and native SO, 2) the absence of a heme-specific UV-visible absorption spectrum, and 3) the observed molecular mass (45 kDa) of the immunologically cross-reacting protein band in different plant species. Is it possible that such a single domain SO protein is functional in vivo? The crystal structure of chicken SO (6Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) suggests that the heme domain and the Moco domain need not necessarily be connected covalently. The disordered structure of the hinge region linking the molybdenum domain and the clearly separated heme domain indicates a high mobility for this part of the protein (36Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Together with the long distance between the molybdenum center and the electron acceptor (32 Å), alternative arrangements of the heme domain relative to the Moco domain may be possible, suggesting a very flexible positioning of the heme domain. It is therefore possible that in plants the function of the SO electron acceptor could be taken over by a separately expressed protein. Further, depending on the nature of the still unknown native electron acceptor for plant SO, it might well be that a heme-like protein mediating electron transport between SO and the native acceptor protein is unnecessary. This suggestion gains support from the purification experiments, where native SO purified from N. tabacumcontained only the single Moco domain. No evidence was found for the copurification of another heme-like protein, while in bacteria a separately expressed heme domain was copurified with the Moco domain of SO from Thiobacillus novellus (37Kappler U. Bennett B. Rethmeier J. Schwarz G. Deutzmann R. McEwan A.G. Dahl C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13202-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For functionality, however, it is very likely that plant SO needs an electron acceptor protein of a redox potential similar to a heme. Taking into account that our subcellular fractionation experiments indicated a peroxisomal localization for plant SO, the b-type cytochromes recently described for plant peroxisomes (38Lopez-Huertas E. Corpas F.J. Sandalio L.M. Del Rio L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are a likely candidate to fulfill the role of physiological electron acceptor for plant SO. Among eukaryotes, plant SO is the smallest molybdenum enzyme known up to now and the only one lacking other redox-active centers. The alignment of Moco domains of SOs from different sources withArabidopsis SO and NR (Fig. 1) demonstrates considerable overall homology, identifying these enzymes as members of a common family, the so-called SO family (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis is the first organism where within one organism both members (SO and NR) of this family are present, which makes it a unique system for studying structure-function relations of a molybdenum domain that can be part of an oxidase or of a reductase. The enzymatic and spectral properties of At-SO are so similar to the Moco domain of the animal counterpart that it is justified to assume that this enzyme functions also in vivo as an SO. This view is supported by measuring SO activity in Moco-deficient N. plumbaginifolia cnx mutants. In those mutants, SO activity is strongly decreased as compared with the wild type, indicating that the molybdenum enzyme SO functions also under in vivo conditions as SO. This enzyme is conserved among higher plants as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against rAt-SO detected a dominantly cross-reacting protein of about 45 kDa in a wide range of species belonging to a variety of both herbacious and woody plants. Although SO catalyzes more than half of the cellular sulfite oxidation, there is a residual activity detected in Moco-deficient N. plumbaginifolia cnx mutants. This activity may either be nonenzymatic as described by Dittrich et al. (13Dittrich A.P.M. Pfanz H. Heber U. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for electron transport in chloroplasts or due to the enzymatic fraction that was described in wheat chloroplasts (14Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Zimierski A. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 9-14Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Jolivet P. Bergeron E. Meunier J.-C. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 667-672Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, if sulfite oxidation also takes place in chloroplasts, it has to be strictly regulated in order to avoid conflicts with the sulfate assimilation pathway that is vital for the survival of the plant cell. We found At-SO in the peroxisomal fraction rather than in chloroplasts, which suggests that the function of SO is not related to the chloroplast-based sulfur assimilation pathway. Rather it may be that plant SO has a sulfite-detoxifying function. For example, it has been shown that peroxisomal catalase is inhibited already by low concentrations of sulfite (39Veljovic-Jovanovic S. Oniki T. Takahama U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1203-1208Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies are presently under way to further elucidate the physiological role of SO in plants, as well as their catalytic, spectroscopic, and structural properties. We thank T.

Martin (6, 7) suggested that it is the scarcity of biologically available iron in these high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions that makes it impossible for the phytoplankton to use the excess N and P. He also recognized that atmospheric dust from land is an important source of iron for the sea and that HNLC regions receive a relatively small dust flux. Furthermore, he noted that ice core records of atmospheric CO2 and dust concentrations over the past 180,000 years are anticorrelated: when dust was high, CO2 was low. This is consistent with the notion that during the arid glacial periods, dust transport was greater, more iron was available, and the biological pump delivered more CO2 to the deep sea.

Heme and iron-sulfur clusters are the two main iron-containing prosthetic groups that catalyze biochemical reactions. Mitochondria play a major role in assimilation of both forms of iron (1Lill R.

The focus of this study is heme synthesis, which occurs in all cells and is catalyzed by eight enzymatic reactions, four mitochondrial and four cytosolic. The first and the last three reactions of heme synthesis are mitochondrial. The last reaction in the pathway of heme synthesis is the assimilation of iron into protoporphyrin IX to give protoheme (5Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14714-14718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ferreira G.C. Franco R.

This reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase, an iron-sulfur-containing enzyme, present in the inner membrane of the mitochondria with its active site facing the matrix (8Lecerof D. Fodje M. Hansson A. Hansson M. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Taketani S. Adachi Y. Nakahashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4685-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, first the product (protoheme) is produced in the matrix and then is distributed to different locations in the mitochondria and in the cytosol to be assembled into heme-dependent proteins. Four types of heme are known in eukaryotes: protoheme and hemesa–c (4Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Protoheme is a pool of “free heme” that is not associated or is only loosely associated with proteins (i.e. tryptophan pyrrolase) (10Badawy A.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is the precursor for the other types of heme. Hemes b and c are essentially similar to protoheme, with minor modifications that take place as it is incorporated into each specific protein (4Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Catalase, cytochrome P450, hemoglobin, and mitochondrial complexes II and III have heme b, whereas heme c occurs in cytochromec and cytochrome c 1 of complex III. Heme a, on the other hand, is synthesized from protoheme by two modifications: farnesylation and addition of a formyl group to position 8 of the protoheme (11Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Weinstein J.D. Branchaud R. Beale S.I. Bement W.J. Sinclair P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two groups of heme a are in cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), which is an enzyme complex that contains 13 subunits. Hemes a and a 3 are associated with subunit I of complex IV (4Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Complex IV regulates mitochondrial respiration in vivo by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and nitric oxide (13Kadenbach B. Huttemann M. Arnold S. Lee I. Bender E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Villani G. Attardi G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).1 The ETC consists of four complexes (I–IV), all in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) oxidize mitochondrial NADH and succinate, respectively, to form ubiquinol. Ubiquinol is then oxidized to ubiquinone by complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), which reduces cytochrome c. Cytochromec then delivers electrons, one at the time, to complex IV to reduce molecular oxygen to water. The four complexes are essential for production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (4Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The ETC is considered the main source of free radicals (15Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 16Raha S. Robinson B.H.

Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the assembly of complex IV is assimilation of heme a with subunit I (forming subcomplex S1) and then incorporation of subunits II and IV (forming subcomplex S2) followed by the rest of the subunits until completion of the holocomplex (27Nijtmans L.G.

It is not clear if the synthesis of heme a or the process of assimilation into subunit I is rate-limiting in the assembly of complex IV. Unsuccessful folding of the polypeptide (due to lack of a prosthetic group, oxidative damage, or a mutated polypeptide) causes its degradation by proteolysis. Unfolded polypeptides tend to aggregate and compromise the normal function of the mitochondria (or cell); thus, their proteolysis is considered a protective mechanism that prevents unwanted aggregation of unfolded polypeptides (28Kaser M.

The activity of ferrochelatase declines in the livers of old rats, and little is known about the anabolism of heme in non-hematopoietic tissues, especially upon aging.

Neurol. 1999; 46: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Three of the 13 subunits that make complex IV are coded on mitochondrial DNA and translated on mitochondrial ribosomes. The remaining 10 subunits are expressed from nuclear genes, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and then imported to the mitochondrial matrix (41Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Since complex IV contains a unique type of heme (heme a), we investigated the effect of heme deficiency on complex IV and other heme-dependent proteins. Heme synthesis decreases in the livers of old rats compared with young rats (30Bitar M.S. Shapiro B.H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1987; 38: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in hematopoietic tissues in humans (33Freedman M.L. Blood Cells. 1987; 13: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar). The consequence of abnormal anabolism of heme in non-hematopeoitic tissues has been little studied. In this study, we established an in vitro model to evaluate the effect of heme deficiency on different hemeproteins. Heme deficiency was induced by inhibiting ferrochelatase with N-methyl protoporphyrin (NMP) (42Gamble J.T. Dailey H.A. Marks G.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 373-375PubMed Google Scholar). We used normal human lung fibroblasts (IMR90 cells). These cells are used as a model for senescence in vitro. At low population doublings (PDLs), they are considered young (in general, 20–30 PDLs); and at high PDLs, they are old or senescent (in general, >50 PDLs). We found that cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was selectively lost by heme deficiency and that its assembly was compromised in old cells compared with young cells. In addition, we found that the rate of proteolysis of unfolded and damaged proteins decreased in mitochondria of old cells compared with young cells. NMP and heme were from Porphyrin Products (Logan UT). Mouse anti-bovine cytochrome oxidase subunit IV monoclonal antibody (20E8-C12), mouse anti-human cytochrome oxidase subunit II monoclonal antibody (12c4-f12), mouse anti-human cytochrome oxidase subunit I monoclonal antibody (1D6-E1-A8), mouse anti-bovine NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 39-kDa subunit monoclonal antibody (20c11-B11), mouse anti-bovine ubiquinol:cytochromec oxidoreductase core I subunit monoclonal antibody (13G12-AF12-BB11), and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Neat rabbit anti-human ferrochelatase serum (catalog no. AB-FC-1) was from EnVirtue Biotechnologies (Walnut Creek, CA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), hydrogen peroxide, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, cytochromec, antimycin A, rotenone, KCN, ubiquinone-1, ascorbic acid, thapsigargin, and protease inhibitor mixture were from Sigma. Sephadex G-25 medium was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala Sweden). The ingredients for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were of the highest grade available. Primary human lung fibroblasts cells (IMR90) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research at a PDL of 10.85. The PDLs were calculated as log2(d /d o), whered and d o are defined as the density of cells at the time of harvesting and seeding, respectively. Stock cultures were grown in 100-mm Corning tissue culture dishes containing 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Stock cultures were split once a week when near confluence. Cells were harvested by trypsinization for 5 min at 37 °C, immediately collected in 5 ml of complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, washed once with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C or used immediately. Cells were left untreated (controls) or treated with NMP 12 h after seeding in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. After 1 week, the cells (20–30 × 106) were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (supplemented with a mixture of anti-proteases), and three cycles of 20 s of mild sonication were applied in the cold with 1-min intervals in ice. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase was measured by oxidation of reduced cytochrome c as described (43Birth-Machin M. Jackson S. Kler R.S. Tunbull D.M. Methods in Toxicology: Mitochondrial Dysfunction. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 51-68Google Scholar). The activity of succinate dehydrogenase was evaluated by reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol as described (43Birth-Machin M. Jackson S. Kler R.S. Tunbull D.M. Methods in Toxicology: Mitochondrial Dysfunction. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 51-68Google Scholar). Catalase activity was measured by degradation of hydrogen peroxide as followed at 240 nm using a millimolar excitation coefficient 0.071 (44Atamna H. Ginsburg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24876-24883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in 24-well plates at an initial density of 10,000/well for evaluation of toxicity and reactive oxygen species. After 12 h of seeding, the cells were treated with different doses of NMP; and 1 week later, the toxicity under different conditions was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (45Holt P.S. Buckley S. Deloach J.R. Toxicol. Lett. 1987; 39: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species were evaluated by DCFH. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (without fetal bovine serum) and supplemented with 100 μm DCFH (prepared in ethanol) for 15 min. After that, DCFH was washed out four times with 4 ml of Hanks’ buffer. Then, 500 μl of Hanks’ buffer were added, and the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 25; magnification × 400). A SPOT camera and Spotsoftware Version 3.0 (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) were used to capture the images. The effect of NMP on the different components of the mitochondrial electron transport complexes was evaluated by 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Western) using antibodies against selected subunits from complexes I, III, and IV and ferrochelatase. The experiments evaluating the rate of removal of complex IV used confluent cultures. The inhibitor for heme synthesis (NMP) was applied at different intervals, and the cultures were sampled for analysis of the different complexes. To evaluate the rate of assembly of complex IV, the cells were seeded and, after 12 h, treated for 1 week with NMP to eliminate complex IV. NMP was then washed out three times with 5 ml of complete medium and incubated in the same medium without NMP. At different intervals, the cells were harvested and evaluated by Western analysis for complex IV and other complexes. Lipid peroxidation was assayed using a sensitive and specific gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for detecting MDA (46Liu J. Yeo H.C. Doniger S.J. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 47Yeo H.C. Liu J. Helbock H.J. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay was carried out as reported previously (46Liu J. Yeo H.C. Doniger S.J. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,47Yeo H.C. Liu J. Helbock H.J. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph interfaced to a Model 5989 mass spectrometer equipped with a J & W Scientific DBWAX capillary column (0.25 mm (inner diameter) × 15 m, 0.25-μm film thickness). Briefly, the protein-bound MDA was hydrolyzed with H2SO4 and converted into a stable derivative using pentafluorophenylhydrazine at room temperature. The derivative was detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the negative chemical ionization mode. 2,6-tert-Butyl-4-methylphenol (67 μmol) was included at the beginning of the assay to prevent artifactual in vitro oxidation. Statistical analysis using Student’s two-tailed t test or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was performed with an Instat statistical analysis program. The difference between two sets of data was considered significant whenp < 0.05. Heme deficiency was established by treating young human lung fibroblasts with NMP, an inhibitor of ferrochelatase. Under these conditions (5–10 μm NMP), only 15% loss in viability was observed (p < 0.014) (also see Fig. 3), indicating that NMP is only mildly toxic in vitro. Heme deficiency (10 μm NMP) decreased cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) by 95% (p < 0.0004) (Fig. 1). Complex II was decreased less (by 30%), and catalase was decreased by 18% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). No direct inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase was seen with NMP as evaluated by including NMP in the assay buffer (data not shown). Of the hemeproteins assayed, complex IV was by far the most sensitive to heme deficiency.Figure 1Effect of heme deficiency on the activities of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), and catalase. The activities of complexes complex IV and II were measured by oxidation of reduced cytochrome c (Cyt c) or by reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCPIP), respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of catalase was measured by decomposition of H2O2 as measured by following the decrease at 240 nm. The data are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescence emitted from oxidized DCFH was higher in fibroblasts that were heme-deficient compared with control cells (Fig.2 A). No direct oxidation of DCFH by NMP was seen (data not shown). Thus, the steady-state level of oxidants was high in fibroblasts under conditions of heme deficiency. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by MDA. The steady-state level of MDA was doubled in fibroblasts maintained under conditions of heme deficiency (with NMP) compared with the control fibroblasts (p < 0.015) (Fig. 2 B). Heme-deficient cells were also sensitive to fluctuation in intracellular Ca2+ as induced by thapsigargin, which increases cytosolic Ca2+. When IMR90 cells were treated for 2 h with 200 nm thapsigargin, 50 and 85% killing was observed in heme-sufficient and heme-deficient cells, respectively (Fig. 3). All the previously described experiments were carried out with young to middle-aged cells. Monoclonal antibodies against proteins of subunits I, II, and IV of cytochrome c oxidase were used to evaluate assembly in both old and young cells. Under conditions of heme deficiency, a 40 ± 14% (n = 4) decrease in the cellular level of subunit I was observed (Fig.4 A). The levels of subunits II and IV were almost not detectable in heme-deficient cells and are compared with heme-sufficient cells (Fig. 4 A). The levels of cytochrome c and selected subunits of complexes I and III were also evaluated (Fig. 4 B). In two experiments, we found that cytochrome c decreased 23 and 38% in heme-deficient cells compared with control cells (Fig.4 B). Monoclonal antibodies for subunit ND39 (complex I) and subunit COR I (complex III) were also used. No difference in the levels of these subunits between heme-deficient and heme-sufficient cells was observed (Fig. 4 B). The results shown are from young cells. The selective susceptibility of complex IV to heme deficiency was used to compare old and young cells for the rate of loss of the complex from mitochondria (Fig. 5 A). The Level of subunit II, as representative for complex IV, was monitored at different intervals after applying NMP to the cells. All of the experiments were done in confluent cells. Extraction of the absorbance of each band shows that the rate of removal of complex IV was 0.503 ± 0.03 A units/band/h in old cells compared with 1.48 ± 0.37 A units/band/h in young cells (means ± S.E., n = 4; p < 0.028 by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test) (Fig. 5 A). Old cells were about three times slower than young cells in removing complex IV. Assembly of complex IV was evaluated in old and young cells during restoration of the complex after 1 week of treatment with NMP. NMP was then washed out, and the cells were maintained in fresh medium without NMP. At different intervals after washing out NMP, the level of subunit II was evaluated by Western blotting. In young cells, assembly of complex IV started after 24 h, whereas in old cells, it started after 48 h from washing out NMP (Fig. 5 B). Extraction of the absorbance of each of the bands from the different intervals clearly showed a lag of ∼24 h between the assembly of complex IV in old cells compared with young cells. Antibody against human ferrochelatase was used to evaluate the level of the enzyme in the mitochondria of old and young cells. Different batches of IMR90 cells were compared. The level of ferrochelatase in young cells was consistently lower than the level in old cells (p < 0.03) (Fig. 6). The level of ferrochelatase was up-regulated in both types of cells treated with NMP (Fig. 6). During ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, electrons from NADH or succinate are transferred through the ETC (complexes I–IV) and reduce molecular oxygen to water (4Tyler D.D. The Mitochondrion in Health and Disease. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar), a reaction catalyzed by complex IV. The age-related changes in mitochondria are characterized by a decrease in the activity of the ETC, in oxygen consumption, and in cardiolipin and an increase in the generation of free radicals (34Boffoli D.

Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar, 53Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the role of heme deficiency in the integrity of the mitochondrial ETC. The influence of heme deficiency on hemeproteins was studied in human lung fibroblasts from old and young cells. A known model for the study of heme deficiency uses inhibition of ferrochelatase, which catalyzes the last step of heme synthesis, the incorporation of iron (54Amuro N. Okada S. Goto Y. Shukuya R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 55Tangeras A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 56Nihei C. Nakayashiki T. Nakamura K. Inokuchi H. Gennis R.B. Kojima S. Kita K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Induction of heme deficiency in IMR90 cells has a profound effect on mitochondria, particularly the assembly of mitochondrial cytochromec oxidase (complex IV), the heme a-containing complex, which was selectively prevented (Fig. 1). Under conditions of long-term heme deficiency, the activity and level of subunits II and IV of cytochrome c oxidase were almost undetectable compared with those in control cells, regardless of age of the cells (Figs. 1and 4 A). Mitochondrial complexes I–III and catalase were much less affected by heme deficiency, suggesting that hemeb- or heme c-dependent proteins and iron-sulfur proteins are not affected by heme deficiency. Previous studies using NMP as an inhibitor of ferrochelatase show that the enzymatic activity decreases to 15% of the control (55Tangeras A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of ferrochelatase leaves the cell with a shortage of protoheme, the precursor for the different types of heme. The type of heme in catalase (which was only slightly affected by heme deficiency) and complex II is heme b, and complex III contains both hemes b and c, whereas complex IV contains hemea. Hemes b and c are essentially similar to protoheme and thus chemically are not modified before assimilation in the corresponding apoprotein. In contrast, heme a is modified by addition of farnesyl and formyl groups to protoheme. In this heme, the vinyl group on ring A of protoheme acquires a farnesyl group (a hydrocarbon chain of 15 carbons), and the methyl group at position 8 of protoheme is oxidized to a formyl (aldehyde) group (11Mogi T.

https://openalex.org/W2041114537,"Perhaps the most anticipated, yet experimentally elusive, macroscopic quantum phenomenon is spin tunnelling in a ferromagnet, which may be formulated in terms of domain wall tunnelling. One approach to identifying such a process is to focus on mesoscopic systems where the number of domain walls is finite and the motion of a single wall has measurable consequences. Research of this type includes magnetotransport measurements on thin ferromagnetic wires, and magnetization experiments on single particles, nanomagnet ensembles and rare-earth multilayers. A second method is to investigate macroscopic disordered ferromagnets, whose dynamics are dominated by domain wall motion, and search the associated relaxation-time distribution functions for the signature of quantum effects. But whereas the classical, thermal processes that operate in these experiments are easily regulated via temperature, the quantum processes have so far not been tunable, making difficult a definitive interpretation of the results in terms of tunnelling. Here we describe a disordered magnetic system for which it is possible to adjust the quantum tunnelling probabilities. For this material, we can model both the classical, thermally activated response at high temperatures and the athermal, tunnelling behaviour at low temperatures within a unified framework, where the domain wall is described as a particle with a fixed mass. We show that it is possible to tune the quantum tunnelling processes by adjusting the 'mass' of this particle with an external magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2004588239,"Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early genes. It regulates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation and is involved in tumor growth. In our experiments, the role of Cyr61 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was examined. Expression of Cyr61 mRNA was decreased markedly in four of five human lung tumor samples compared with their normal matched lung samples. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H520 and H460, which have no endogenous Cyr61, formed 60–90% fewer colonies after being transfected with a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector than cells transfected with the same amount of empty vector. After stable transfection of a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector, proliferation of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 sublines decreased remarkably compared with the cells stably transfected with empty vector. The addition of antibody against Cyr61 partially rescued the growth suppression of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells developed G1 arrest, prominently up-regulated expression of p53 and p21 WAF1, and had decreased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The increase of pocket protein pRB2/p130 was also detected in these cells. Notably, both of the Cyr61-stably transfected lung cancer cell lines developed smaller tumors than those formed by the wild-type cells in nude mice. Taken together, we conclude that Cyr61 may play a role as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early genes.

Mo F.E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). One of these families is called CCN1 (CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), Cyr61 (cysteine-rich protein 61), Nov (nephroblastoma overexpressed)). CCN proteins are secreted, extracellular matrix-associated proteins, which regulate cell adhesion, migration, mitogenesis, differentiation, and survival (2Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The proteins of this family are divided into two groups: one includes CTGF and Cyr61, which usually stimulates cell proliferation; the other cohort is the putative growth arrest/suppression genes, including nov, elm1, and HICP, which are often involved in the negative regulation of cell growth (3Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The first cloned member of the CCN family is Cyr61, which was identified by differential hybridization screening of a cDNA library from serum-stimulated murine fibroblasts (4Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Cyr61 shares with most members of CCN family a uniform modular architecture and 38 completely conserved cysteines. After secretion, Cyr61 is associated with the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces (1Kireeva M.L. Mo F.E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell.

During embryogenesis, Cyr61 exhibits tissue-specific distribution that closely associates with the development of cartilage and the circulatory system (16O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). It also promotes the differentiation of murine bud mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes (17Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cyr61 also plays a role in tumorigenesis. In breast cancer, it stimulates tumor progression (14Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J.

Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of Cyr61 is down-regulated in prostate cancer (19Pilarsky C.P.

Winneker R.C. Zhang Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which suggests that Cyr61 might under certain circumstances behave as a tumor suppressor in several tissue types. In this investigation, we examined for the first time the expression and behavior of Cyr61 in lung cancer cells, including its effect on the proliferation of two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Levels of Cyr61 were low in some lung cancer cells, and forced expression of Cyr61 in these cells suppressed cellular proliferationin vitro and in vivo, associated with enhanced expression of p53, p21 WAF1, and pRB2/p130, and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Total RNA was isolated from a variety of lung cancer cell lines and five matched normal and cancerous tissues by using Trizol reagent (Life Technology, Inc.) according to the standard protocol. The RNA was separated on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto Hybond-N+membrane, and fixed by cross-linking with U.V. Human multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH. Expression of Cyr61 was detected by 32P-labeled Cyr61 cDNA probe. NCI-H446, H460, H520, H125, H157, H1299, H187, and H526 lung cancer cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To make Cyr61 stably expressing lines, H520 (squamous lung cancer) and H460 (large cell lung cancer) were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with Cyr61 cDNA cloned into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector by using GenePorter transfection reagent (GTS, Inc.) according to the protocol provided by GTS. After 48 h, the cells were replated in the medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Two weeks later, well separated colonies were isolated and plated into 24-well plates. The expression of Cyr61 was detected by either Northern (H520 cells) or Western (H460 cells) blot. Neomycin-resistant cells (Neo cells) were obtained by transfecting them with empty pcDNA3.1 vector. The H520 or H460 cells were split evenly into two 100-mm dishes. After growing to ∼60% confluence, cells were transfected with 8 μg of either pcDNA3.1-Cyr61 or pcDNA3.1 empty vector. After 48 h, cells were resuspended in the medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 and replated into 12-well plates. After treatment with G418 for 2 weeks, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet to assess colony formation. Colonies containing more than 40 cells were counted. The cells, which had been stably transfected with either Cyr61 (H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61) or pcDNA3.1 empty vector, which contains the neomycin-resistant gene (H520-Neo and H460-Neo), were plated into 96-well plates at 3.0 × 103 cells/well. After culturing for various durations, cell numbers were measured by MTT assay according to the protocol provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. To examine the effect of Cyr61 antibody (14Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) on the growth of the cells, the antibody was added at a ratio of 1:50 (v/v) into the wells after the cells were plated as described above. Two days later, the growth of the cells was assessed by MTT assay, and the cell number was calculated according to the standard curve. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and trypsinized when they reached 60% confluence. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. After staining with propidium iodide, samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were harvested for total cell lysates with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was measured. The same amount of protein was added to each lane, resolved on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies against p21 WAF1 (Oncogene, OP64), p53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126), pRB2/P130 (Santa Cruz, sc-317), pRB (Santa Cruz, sc-102), cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz, sc-7533), and cyclin E (Santa Cruz, sc-247) were used for detecting these proteins. Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were made as described above. Endogenous CDK2 was precipitated from an equal amount of total protein using anti-CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-163) and protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz, sc-2003) at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with protease containing RIPA buffer. Kinase activity was assayed by using histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the substrate in a 10-μl mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 2 μg of histone H1, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and then stopped by adding 10 μl of 2× Laemmli loading buffer. Labeled substrate was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP by 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (20Gottschalk A.R. Basila D. Wong M. Dean N.M. Brandts C.H. Stokoe D. Haas-Kogan D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). H520-Cyr61 and H520-Neo cells (2 × 106) were injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank, respectively, of 5-week-old nude mice. Identical experiments were repeated using H460-Cyr61 and H460-Neo cells. Five weeks after injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were weighed. Expression of Cyr61 in various normal tissues and cell lines was examined by Northern blot (Fig. 1). Cyr61 was highly expressed in normal lung and heart; much lower levels were present in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney; and negligible levels were in brain and pancreas (Fig. 1 A). We also examined Cyr61 levels in five matched samples of normal lung and NSCLC from the same individuals. Compared with normal lung tissues, expression of Cyr61 was decreased markedly in four of the five NSCLC samples (Fig. 1 B). In lung cancer cell lines, expression of Cyr61 varied dramatically among the various lines (Fig. 1 C). It was totally absent in three small cell lung cancer lines (H446, H187, and H526) and in the NSCLC cell lines H520 (squamous) and H460 (large cell). Each of these lines has been reported to have a high potential to form tumors in nude mice (data from ATCC). In contrast, the NSCLC cell lines H157 (squamous), H125 (adenosquamous), and H1299 (large cell), which had low potential to form tumors (data not shown), had high expression of Cyr61 mRNA. Because H520 and H460 cells had very low expression of Cyr61, these two cell lines were transfected with a Cyr61 expression vector to examine the biological effects of this protein. Colony formation assay showed that H520 cells transfected with Cyr61-pcDNA3.1 formed fewer colonies (124 ± 4/well) compared with those transfected with the same amount of pcDNA3.1 empty vector (296 ± 14/well) (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, Cyr61 expression vector-transfected H460 cells also formed dramatically fewer colonies (69 ± 3.5/well) compared with those transfected with empty vector (650 ± 28/well) (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 A). After stably transfecting H520 and H460 NSCLC cell lines with Cyr61, we isolated two sublines for each cell line. Prominent expression of Cyr61 in these sublines was confirmed by Northern or Western blots (Fig. 2 B). Both of the Cyr61-transfected sublines of H520 and H460 had a markedly lower proliferative rate than the Neo-containing control cells in liquid culture as measured by MTT assay (Fig. 2 C). Antibody against Cyr61 was added to cultures containing H520 and H460 cells. Compared with the cells cultured in normal medium, the addition of the Cyr61 antibody had nearly no effect on the growth of the control Neo cells, but the proliferation of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells increased by 73.6% ± 1.8% (mean ± S.D.,p < 0.0001) and 48.1% ± 2.3% (p < 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 2 D). Because our proliferation assays indicated that the growth of the Cyr61-transfected cells slowed, cell cycle analysis was performed to clarify which phases of the cell cycle were blocked (Fig. 3 A). Both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells had a much higher percentage of cells in the G1 phase (82 and 70%, respectively) compared with the Neo cells (54 and 42%, respectively). As a consequence, the percentage of Cyr61-expressing cells in S phase decreased proportionally. The number of cells in G2/M did not change markedly (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, these Cyr61-stably transfected lung cancer cells became larger and flatter, with a greater amount of cytoplasm than the Neo cells (data not shown). Cell cycle arrest is often caused by up-regulation of CDK inhibitors. We examined several proteins related to the cell cycle (Fig. 3,B and C). p21 WAF1, a major CDK inhibitor, was up-regulated in both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells. Levels of the tumor suppressor proteins pRB and pRB2/p130 were also examined by Western blot (Fig. 3 B). Expression of pRB was not different between the Cyr61-transfected NSCLC cell lines and their Neo controls. However, pRB2/p130, another member of pRB family, was prominently up-regulated in H520-Cyr61 cells and modestly increased in the H460-Cyr61 cells. Levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 were also examined. Because p53 is frequently mutated in NSCLC cell lines, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was performed, and we confirmed that both H520 and H460 cells had the wild-type p53 gene (data not shown). A marked increase of expression of p53 was observed in Cyr61-stably transfected H520 cells, and a modest increase of p53 was found in H460-Cyr61 (Fig. 3 C). The H1299 NSCLC cell had no p53 protein as reported previously (21Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of CDK2 was reduced markedly in both H460-Cyr61 cells (2.5-fold) and H520-Cyr61 cells (14-fold) compared with the Neo cells (Fig. 3 C). To study whether this protein can inhibit tumor growth, the paired sublines, H520-Neo and H520-Cyr61, as well as H460-Neo and H460-Cyr61, were grown in nude mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each nude mouse was injected with the experimental cells on one flank and the control cells on the other flank. After 5 weeks, the tumors were removed and weighed. On each mouse, the Cyr61-transfected cells developed a smaller tumor than the Neo control cells (Fig. 4,A and B). Statistical analysis showed that the mean weight of the H520-Cyr61 tumors was 67 ± 17% (p = 0.0015) less than those formed by the H520-Neo cells (Fig. 4 D). Likewise, the mean weight of the tumors formed by H460-Cyr61 was 52 ± 11% (p = 0.0003) less than those formed by H460-Neo cells (Fig. 4 C). Cyr61 was the first member cloned in the CCN family. Its expression is induced within several minutes by many growth factors (2Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and by stimulation through the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (22Albrecht C. von Der Kammer H. Mayhaus M. Klaudiny J.

Several studies show that Cyr61 can enhance tumor growth of a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line RF-1 and breast cancer cell lines (14Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W.

A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of Cyr61 are highest in breast cancers that are at an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis (14Xie D. Miller C.W. O'Kelly J. Nakachi K. Sakashita A. Said J.W. Gornbein J. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, Cyr61 levels are not increased or are decreased in hepatomas, leiomyomas, and prostate cancers (13Sampath D. Zhu Y. Winneker R.C. Zhang Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Pilarsky C.P. Schmidt U. Eissrich C. Stade J. Froschermaier S.E. Haase M. Faller G. Kirchner T.W. Wirth M.P.

The role of Cyr61 in NSCLC was examined in our study. Expression of this CCN protein was higher in normal human lung tissue than in their matched NSCLC samples. Cyr61-transfected cells formed much fewer colonies than cells transfected with empty vector, which indicated that this protein inhibited clonal growth. Proliferation was also retarded in the H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells stably transfected with Cyr61 expression vector. The addition of Cyr61 antibody to the culture medium was able partially to rescue the growth repression. This would suggest that growth inhibition mediated by Cyr61 is at least in part a result of Cyr61 being secreted and then acting as a ligand for an integrin receptor that is associated with growth retardation. Tumorigenesis assays in mice revealed that Cyr61-transfected cells formed smaller tumors in nude mice compared with the control Neo cells. Taken together, the evidence suggests that Cyr61 is a tumor suppressor protein for lung tissue. Both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells had a higher percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a lower percent in the S phase of the cell cycle compared with matched control cells. To clarify the molecular mechanism of the G1 arrest, we examined the expression of cell cycle-related proteins. The up-regulation of both p53 and p21 WAF1 was detected in the Cyr61-transfected cells, especially H520-Cyr61, which also had the most prominent inhibition of cell growth. Increased expression of p21 is intimately related to G1 cell cycle arrest by inactivating the CDK (25Zi X. Feyes D.K. Agarwal R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1055-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 26Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ponzio G. Loubat A. Rochet N. Turchi L.

Cancer Lett. 1999; 136: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). CDK2 is one of the major target proteins of p21. The complex of cyclin E-CDK2 plays a pivotal role in the transition from G1 to S phase. High levels of p21 associate with cyclin E-CDK2 complex and inhibit the kinase activity, resulting in a G0/G1 phase block of the cell. In our study, in accordance with the up-regulation of p21, a remarkably decreased kinase activity of CDK2 was detected in both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells. Interestingly, the pocket protein pRB2/p130 was also up-regulated in Cyr61-transfected cells, especially in H520-Cyr61 cells. As a member of the pRB family, p130 can inhibit cell proliferation and tumor formation (30Taylor W.R. Schonthal A.H. Galante J. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38221-38229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 44Stiegler P. Giordano A. Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol. 1999; 21: 363-366PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of activated cyclin-CDK complex results in the accumulation of p130. The p130 is able to impose a G1 arrest by phosphorylation-regulated binding of E2F and phosphorylation-independent sequestration of cyclin E-CDK2 (45Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Together, pRB2/p130 and p21 WAF1 probably mediated the G1 block in Cyr61-stably transfected NSCLC cells. The mechanism of action of Cyr61 is still poorly understood. Several studies showed that Cyr61 was a ligand of integrins (8Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By binding to integrin, Cyr61 stimulated several cellular events including the enhanced cellular response to growth factors and serum (2Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 3Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, the secondary signal pathways triggered after Cyr61 binds to integrins are not clear. Cyr61 appeared to have different functions in various types of cells, tissues, and tumors. This could be caused by expression of select integrins in the target cells or various pathways that could be triggered by the same integrin in different types of cells. These are questions still requiring investigation. In our study, expression of Cyr61 resulted in a G0/G1 block in the cell cycle and up-regulation of both p53 and p21, but the linkage between Cyr61 and either p53 or p21 is unclear. Prior studies found that the integrin α6β4 was able to activate p53 and p21 and caused cell cycle arrest (46Bachelder R.E. Marchetti A. Falcioni R. Soddu S. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20733-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 47Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Further studies are required to determine whether Cyr61 can also bind to integrin α6β4 and stimulate p53 or p21. Interestingly, elm1 (also known as WISP1, another member of the CCN family), similar to Cyr61, can have opposing functions depending on the cell type that expresses it. For example, WISP1 can suppressin vivo tumor growth in a melanoma cell line (48Hashimoto Y. Shindo-Okada N. Tani M. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi K. Shiroishi T. Toma H. Yokota J. J. Exp.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These examples illustrate the complexity of function of the CCN family in cell growth and differentiation. Taken together, we have found that Cyr61 behaved as a tumor suppressor gene in NSCLC. Expression of Cyr61 in the NSCLC cell lines H520 and H460 resulted in their growth arrest and up-regulation of p53, p21 WAF1, and pRB2/p130. The Cyr61-transfected cells also formed markedly smaller tumors in nude mice compared with the control cells. We have provided the first direct evidence suggesting that Cyr61 can provide a negative regulation of cell growth."

As a testing model of the circadian clock system, we have used synchronized rat fibroblasts that are known to express at least six genes in a circadian fashion. We have determined the expression patterns of 9957 transcripts every 4 h over a total period of 76 h using high density oligonucleotide microarrays. The spectral analysis of our mRNA profiling data indicated that ∼2% (85 genes) of all expressed genes followed a robust circadian pattern. We have confirmed the circadian expression of previously known clock or clock-driven genes, and we identified 81 novel circadian genes. The majority of the circadian-regulated gene products are known and are involved in diverse cellular functions. We have classified these circadian genes in seven clusters according to their phase of cycling. Our pathway analysis of the mRNA profiling data strongly suggests a direct link between circadian rhythm and cell cycle.

Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Circadian oscillators are generated by a small number of clock proteins that are regulated by self-sustained transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which drive the rhythmic expression of “clock-controlled” output genes. In mammals, the central pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)1 of the hypothalamus and is adjusted and entrained to the 24-h environmental light/dark cycle by photic stimuli via the retina. Surprisingly, confluent cultured fibroblast cells show an identical (2Yagita K. Tamanini F. van Der Horst G.T. Okamura H. Science. 2001; 292: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) circadian clock mechanism following synchronization with a 50% v/v serum shock treatment (3Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) and can be used as a simple model to study circadian gene expression. The discovery of a circadian clock in peripheral cells strongly suggests that this rhythmic mechanism controls basic cellular functions. So far the extent of gene expression following a circadian rhythm in cultured fibroblasts is still unknown, as well as its overall nature. We report on fibroblast experiments using high density oligonucleotide microarray expression profiling (GeneChip®, Affymetrix) to determine the expression levels of 9957 rat genes over a 76-h period after synchronization. Rat 3Y1 embryonic fibroblasts (passage 30) (4Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% v/v fetal calf serum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 and were plated (in duplicate) on 15-cm dishes at 3 × 106 cells/plate and grown in the same medium for 7 days. The cells were confluent for 4 days before serum synchronization. At this time (t = 0 h), cells were treated with 50% v/v horse serum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h and then kept in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (3Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Every 4 h, the content of two plates was lysed in 10 ml of RNAzolBTM (AMS Biotechnology) and total RNA extracted following the manufacturer's protocol. Target preparation for chip hybridization was done as described (5Rogge L. Bianchi E. Biffi M. Bono E. Chang S.Y. Alexander H. Santini C. Ferrari G. Sinigaglia L. Seiler M. Neeb M. Mous J. Sinigaglia F. Certa U. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); briefly, 20 μg of total RNA was used as starting material, and 30 μg ofin vitro transcribed biotinylated target was fragmented, applied to the chip, and hybridized overnight at 45 °C. Four spiked controls were included in the hybridization mix (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre at 1.5, 5, 25, and 100 pm, respectively). We used Affymetrix high density arrays, custom made for Hoffmann-La Roche, testing a total of 12,204 rat sequences on 2 arrays: 2840 public sequences present in GenBankTM as of June, 1998, and 9364 proprietary ESTs (Incyte Pharmaceuticals). After washing at 45 °C and antibody amplification, the arrays were stained and scanned on a Hewlett-Packard scanner. The raw data were exported from the “GeneChip” software program (Affymetrix) and subsequently analyzed with ad hoc programs. To allow for comparisons between arrays, the total signal intensities (sum of signal intensities of all individual genes on each chip) were normalized to the mean signal intensity of all chips. To detect periodic variations in gene expression, we modeled the time series according to a second order autoregressive process (2Yagita K. Tamanini F. van Der Horst G.T. Okamura H. Science. 2001; 292: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 6Box G.E.P. Jenkins G.M. Reinsel C. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control. Prentice Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1994: 1-598Google Scholar), and because outliers may be present, a robust estimation procedure for the coefficients was used (7Martin R.D. Directions in Time Series. Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Hayward, CA1980: 228-254Google Scholar, 8Martin R.D. Applied Time Series Analysis II. Academic Press, New York1981: 683-759Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, before applying the spectral analysis method, a robust linear regression (“least trimmed squares robust regression”) (9Rousseeuw P.J. Leroy A.M. Robust Regression and Outlier Detection. Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 1-329Google Scholar) was employed to remove any linear trend from the data corresponding to a drift of the base line. The spectral analysis was then applied to the residuals. For each time series, we calculated the frequency V max where the spectrum f reaches its maximum; with this method non-cycling transcripts would have a frequency of 0. To select genes with a strong circadian expression pattern, the curves from the 4006 cycling time series identified by spectral analysis were plotted in Excel (Microsoft) (data not shown). The analysis was eased by the fact that it was a time course experiment. Changes in expression levels were regarded as significant, if they were present at successive time points in the same direction, followed by changes in the other direction over several subsequent time points. Genes were scored from 1 to 4 by four independent investigators. The highest mark (=4) went to genes with at least two peaks of maximal expression, a cycle period of 20–24 h, and high reproducibility between replicates. All the genes that got a mark between 2 and 4 ere selected for further analysis The rev-erbα probe corresponds to a 230-bp fragment (residues 553–783) of the rat cDNA (GenBank accession number M25804) (10Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The 36B4 control probe corresponds to a 119-bp fragment (residues 24–143) of the rat acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 cDNA (GenBank accession number X15096). RNase protection assay was performed as described (11Modjtahedi N. Haddada H. Lamonerie T. Lazar E. Lavialle C. Brison O. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For each time point, 10 μg of total RNA (also used for chip target preparation) was hybridized overnight at 58 °C with 150 and 300 pg of the rev-erbα- and 36B4-labeled probes, respectively. Signals were quantified with a STORM 860 bio-analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). For each sample, two cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of DNase treated total RNA previously used for microarray target preparation. Quantitative PCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7700 and TaqMan probe or a Lightcycler using SYBR green detection. Primer and TaqMan probe sequences were the following: A, for rev-erbα sense, CTCCACAGTGCTGGGAGAGTC, and reverse, CTGGCGTAGACCATTCAGTGC, probe ATGCCCGTCTACCCCCAACGACAA; B, for cry1 sense, AGTTCCCCTCCCCTTTCTCTT, and reverse, GGGTTCCCTTCCATTTTGTCA, probe TGGGCAACTCCTGTGGCGTGAAT; C, for dbp sense, CCGTGGAGGTGCTAATGACCT, and reverse, CCTCTGAGAAGCGGTGCCT, probe TGAACCTGATCCGGCTGATCTTGCC; D, for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense, TGCCAAGTATGATGACATCAAGAAG, and reverse, TGCTGTTGAAGTCACAGGAGACA, probe TGGTGAAGCAGGCGGCCGAG. Primers used in the light cycler were the following: for ID08649 sense TGAAATCCATTACAGAAAGAGGCTT, and reverse CACCTGTATGCAATTCTCTGGGT; for ID6960 sense, TGGCACACACTGAAATGTCGT, and reverse TCAAAGACTCAGGACACGGGT; for RING3 sense, GTACCACCCTTCCCCACTTT, and reverse, TCAAAACAGGGCCCTTAGAA; for ribosomal phosphoprotein sense CTCAGTGCCTCACTCCATCA, and reverse, GGGGCTTAGTCGAAGAGACC. Samples contained 1× TaqMan Buffer A, 4% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 400 μm dUTP, 0.05 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase, 0.01 units of AmpErase UNG, 200 nm primers, and 100 nm TaqMan probe in a 25-μl volume or Faststart DNA master SYBR green I mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), with 3 mmMgCl2, 500 nm primer each in a 20-μl volume. The PCR conditions were as follow: with the ABI Prism 7700, 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. With the light cycler 10 min at 95 °C, then 10 s 95 °C, 5 s 55 °C, 15 s 72 °C for 40 cycles, followed by a melting curve analysis. The expression levels were normalized either to the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or to the rat acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (GenBankTM accession number X15096). Relative mRNA abundance was calculated using the comparative Ct method or a standard curve method as described (12Anonymous User Bulletin Number 2 ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1997Google Scholar). Confluent, non-dividing 3Y1 fibroblasts, were synchronized for 2 h with 50% v/v horse serum. After removal of the medium, fibroblasts were harvested every 4 h (independent duplicates), and total RNA was extracted and cRNA target prepared for hybridization on the microarrays. The 12,204 probe sets present on the microarrays do not represent an equivalent number of genes, because some probe sets possibly test the same gene. Between June 1998 and April 2001 3418 ESTs could be matched to newly sequenced genes, and from these ESTs 24% were matching the same gene. If this percentage is extrapolated to all ESTs, our array included an estimated number of 9957 independent genes. The normalized mean intensity and standard deviation of hybridization signals for each gene was calculated for each time point. To perform expression-profiling analysis of the experimental data, we used a methodology based on spectral analysis of time series as follows: 4006 probe sets gave a periodic hybridization signal as analyzed by the autoregressive process; 5936 probe sets gave a constant hybridization signal over all time points; and 2263 had hybridization signals below the detection threshold indicative of non-expressed genes or undetectable transcripts. Because the above numerical analysis was based on the mean hybridization intensities (without considering standard deviations), a subsequent visual inspection of the data (see “Experimental Procedures”) was indispensable to further identify transcripts with robust circadian expression patterns. By using these combined data analysis approaches, we have identified 86 transcripts with clear rhythmic and circadian expression profiles as shown in Table I (see also the Supplemental Material containing median hybridization values, first peak, period, and quality and Table II or the raw data excel file supp_cycling_raw_data.xls).Table IClustered list of the 67 circadian gene transcripts with their known accession numbersGenec hip® IDAccession numberDescriptionCluster 1n = 602685Y07744Rattus norvegicusUDP-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-2-epimerase06657L11007Rat cell division protein kinase 4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4)4 ESTs: 03258, 04719, 04930, 09766Cluster 2 n = 1601429M98327Rat transfer RNA-valine synthetase02682Y00979R. norvegicus β,β-enolase03327AB014722rsalt-104760U01024Mouse phosphoribosylamine—glycine ligase04871AB012276Mouse ATFx05644AF233449Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 405727Y17393Prefoldin subunit 206391X76040Human mitochondrial ion protease homolog precursor08649CAB37992dj465n24.2.1 (putative novel protein)08919AB016930Cricetulus griscusphosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase09468AB012580Mouse translation initiation factor clF3 p6609966D16309Rat cyclin D310509X78683Mus musculus B cell receptor-associated protein (BAP) 3711561U89431M. musculus strain BALB/c unknown mRNA2 ESTs: 09542, 10887Cluster 3 n = 600604J03179Rat D-binding protein01084M25804Rat rev-crba-α protein01682U18729R. norvegicus cytochromeb 558 α-subunit06965AF039085Cellugyrin08023AF123653Homo sapiens FEZ109606J03179Rat D-binding proteinCluster 4n = 1400009AB000507R. norvegicusaquaporin 701171M36421Glutamate receptor 4 precursor (AMPA 4)01978U60063R. norvegicus aldehyde dehydrogenase05219AF036249Polymerase 1 and transcript release factor08025M37736Mouse replication-dependent histone H2A.110275AF181561R. norvegicus pro-SAAS11435AF224721Mouse secretory carrier membrane protein 47 ESTs: 03382, 04673, 05638, 06106, 07526, 10949, 12202Cluster 5 n = 1900555D88461Rat n-wasp00757L11587Rat leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase00885L28801Rat transcription factor iiic α-subunit02155U89282R. norvegicus telomerase protein component 1 (tip1)02787Z68145R. norvegicus immunoglobulin λ-5 chain03085U35022Ratcis-Golgi matrix protein03114AF227684Mouse intracellular hyaluronan-binding protein p5704528D89801Exon 12 of RING3, a nuclear serine-threonine kinase06495AF045458H. sapiens serine/threonine kinase ULK106672AF032872Potassium channel regulatory protein08011AAC47068Similar to K02E10.2 gene product (Caenorhabditis elegans)08897U08110Mouse ran GTPase-activating protein 109837AB028858M. musculus mRNA for mDj809954AB016532Rat PER211173AB024427M. musculus Sid1669p11290X52583Rat nuclear pore glycoprotein P3 ESTs: 05409, 06971, 09001Cluster 6 n = 800426D38101Rat l-type voltage-dependent calcium channel α1 subunit00746L10073R. norvegicus5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5ht5b)02692Y08616R. norvegicusfertilin-α05028D29683Rat endothelin-converting enzyme05235AF116523M. musculus periplakin (ppl)06834AB000777CRY1 mouse photolyase/blue-light receptor07847U09399Mouse glycine receptor β-subunit precursor (glrb)1 EST: 08863Cluster 7 n = 1301672U17607R. norvegicus ccast binding transcription factor cbf subunitc01996U62821R. norvegicus outer dense fiber protein (cdf2)03108AB030644Tudor repeat associator with pctaire 204804L06433R. norvegicus c-HA-ras05914X67241Rat guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (p140 ras-grf)06960AJ00634026 S proteasome subunit p11207510AF051561Rat Na-K-Cl cotransporter (Nkccl)08066M19967Rat annexin 1 (phospholipase a2 inhibitory protein)08242AF006086Human arp2/3 complex 21-kDa subunit (p21-arc)09818AB017026Mouse oxysterol-binding protein09935X79233Ews (fragment)10277U40188Human transcriptional activation factor TAF11321 EST: 03869Not clustered n = 400259AJ222691R. norvegicus dna polymerase δ (catalytic subunit)06312D63885Lysophospholipase07289U91538Similar to mouse vesicle trafficking protein scc22b1 EST: 08264 Open table in a new tab Among the 86 transcripts, 20 were known published sequences and 66 were ESTs from a private data base (Incyte). The EST sequences were used to search the public data base GenBankTM for further identification and updating: 22 ESTs were identical to sequences previously published in the data bases (BLAST E value = 0) and 25 were similar to sequences in the data bases (BLAST E value ranging from 1E-178 to 3E-37, median = 5E-142). Therefore, we could identify 67 cycling transcripts present in the public data base as follows: 61 coding for proteins with known function and 6 with unknown function. The 19 remaining sequences were ESTs without known sequence homology (Table I). Four genes known to have an ∼24-h cycle of expression both in vivo and in synchronized cell lines (3Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) are present on the microarray used here. In addition to rev-erbα anddbp, we identified cry1 and per2transcripts after EST identification against known sequences. These two genes were recently shown to be essential protein components of the circadian clock (13Miyamoto Y. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6097-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Zheng B. Larkin D.W. Albrecht U. Sun Z.S. Sage M. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 400: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 and2 A, the four transcripts were cycling in our experiment. Among other cycling transcripts, we found two independent ESTs encoding the same product, DBP. The hybridization signals for both probe sets were almost identical, showing a common cycling expression pattern (data not shown). dbp was therefore tested twice with two separate probe sets, hence our identification of 86 sequences with circadian expression corresponds to 85 independent genes. Our data on five known cycling transcripts demonstrated the validity of our experimental set-up and our expression data analysis and indicated a good reproducibility of the microarray methodology used here.Figure 2Qualitative assessment of the GeneChip® microarray technology by comparisons with well established approaches such as RNase protection and Q-PCR. A, good reproducibility between the different technologies is shown by the normalized expression profiles of rev-erbα expression as measured by RNase protection, microarrays, and Q-PCR. dbpand cry1 were also confirmed by Q-PCR. Note that the Q-PCR time points 4 and 12 h were not determined. B,comparison of the expression profile obtained by microarray and Q-PCR for RING3 (ID04528), the 26 S proteasome subunit (ID06960), and a putative protein (ID08649). The Q-PCR time points correspond to the first minimum and maximum expression level for a given gene determined by the microarray technology.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Are the microarray data comparable with those obtained using other techniques such as RNase protection assay or real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (Q-PCR)? By RNase protection assays and Q-PCR, the rev-erbα transcript was shown to cycle with a pattern very similar to the one obtained from the microarray analysis (Fig. 2 A), and the same was true for dbp andcry1 analyzed by Q-PCR (Fig. 2 A). By using Q-PCR, we further confirmed the cycling pattern of eight independent transcripts as shown in Fig. 2 B for RING3, ID06960, ID08649 and similar data not shown for per2, cyclin D3, ID01672, ID04871, and ID08242. This comparison clearly demonstrated that microarray data were comparable with those obtained with well established methodologies. The most striking observation from our experimental data analysis was that circadian patterns of expression were observed for numerous transcripts that encode proteins belonging to several distinct functional classes. We found proteins known to be involved in housekeeping functions, transcription, translation, protein degradation, signaling, cell cycle, transport, and trafficking. These cycling transcripts encoded proteins such as enzymes, structural proteins, transcription factors, receptors, or ion channels (Fig. 3 and Supplemental Material). Are there common features among these cycling gene transcripts such as their period or amplitude levels that could reflect direct interactions, common physiological responses, or specific pathway activations? Hierarchical clustering is widely used to extract patterns from gene expression profiles and to group genes accordingly to reduce the complexity of the data. We clustered the 85 cycling transcripts based on their expression profiles between t = 0 and 48 h by a hierarchical correlation method (15Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). In this experiment, genes displayed the most robust cyclic expression pattern during this time window, and we hypothesized that this would lead to the creation of the most biologically relevant clusters. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, seven main clusters accounting for 82 genes were identified. Four transcripts had expression patterns too different to belong to any cluster (Fig. 4 A and Table I). The individual expression profiles representative of each cluster are shown in Fig. 4 B, whereas the median values of the relative hybridization intensities of all transcripts in each cluster are shown in Fig. 4 C. This allows the visualization and comparison of the seven cycling patterns. Because clusters 4 and 5 are very similar except for a sharp peak at t = 4 h in cluster 4, probably due to the serum addition, they could be considered as a single profile. In this case the first peak appearing aftert = 8 h in each of the six different clusters is shifted from one to the next by a time lag of 4 h, representing all possible phases of a 24-h rhythm. As expected, gene transcripts known to cycle in phase like rev-erbα and dbpwere clustered together in cluster 3.Figure 4Clustering of cycling transcripts using hierarchical correlation. A, the hierarchical tree shows the clustering of the 85 transcripts based on their circadian expression profiles between t = 0 and 48 h (the complete time series are displayed in B and C). The vertical line in A indicates the cut-off correlation value (0.63) used to reveal seven clusters. B,expression profiles of representative members for 6 clusters. Normalized hybridization intensity in function of time (hour) is shown. Sample were measured every 4 h for a period of 76 h.C, for each time point, the median relative (100% set att = 0 h) expression level of all transcripts in a given cluster is shown, with n equal to the number of circadian transcripts in a given cluster. The 50% v/v serum shock was performed between t = 0 and 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although all genes found in a given cluster were roughly cycling according to a circadian rhythm, they did not belong to one particular protein functional class (Table I). On the other hand, a given cluster may contain functionally related genes or genes whose products may have a higher likelihood of interaction. Here are some examples of such cycling transcripts. Cluster 7 contained both the transcription factor CBF-C (ID01672) that binds to the common CCAAT motif present in several mammalian promoters (16Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the transcription activator TAFII32 (ID10277), part of TFIID, a transcription initiation factor that binds TATA regulatory sequences (17Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cluster 3 contains two previously known clock or clock-driven genes (rev-erbα, dbp), as well as the transcription factor FEZ1 (ID08023), a leucine-zipper protein. Other genes were also expressed in a circadian fashion. Cluster 4 includes the glutamate receptor 4 (ID01171) transcript, and cluster 6 contains the serotonin 5-HT5B receptor transcript (ID00746). The leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (ID00757 in cluster 5) is known to regulate the action of insulin by dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (18Ren J.M. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Sweet L.J. Cline G. Shulman G.I. Livingston J.N. Goldstein B.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The endothelin-converting enzyme (ID05028 in cluster 6) is known to produce active endothelin that serves as a potent vasoconstrictor and possesses mitogenic properties, causing proliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle, cardiac myocytes, bronchial smooth muscle, and fibroblasts (19Miyauchi T. Masaki T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 391-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that these functions might be circadian. Similarly, the recently identified granin-like neuroendocrine peptide precursor (proSAAS) (20Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), present as ID10275 in cluster 4, could be a circadian-regulated endogenous inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1, the protease responsible for the processing of many neuroendocrine peptides such as proopiomelanocortin, the precursor of several signaling substances. Moreover, we identified four cycling transcripts coding for proteins known to play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle. We found, in different clusters, the replication-dependent histone H2A1 (ID08025 in cluster 4), cyclin D3 (ID09966 in cluster 2), cell division protein kinase 4 CDK4 (ID06657 in cluster 1), and RING3 (ID04528 linked to cluster 5). Although the last three transcripts were not clustered together because of different profiles between t = 0 and 12 h, they clearly showed the same phase of expression for the first two peaks at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5). What is the overall percentage of all expressed genes showing a circadian pattern of expression? Accurate gene expression studies rely on the maximal sensitivity and reproducibility of the methodology used to detect mRNA levels. The microarray protocol used here allowed us, in principle, to detect mRNA transcripts present at a frequency of 1/150,000, or equivalent to 2–6 mRNA molecules/cell, as estimated by the hybridization intensity of spiked transcripts (data not shown). Therefore, it should be able to detect the vast majority of transcripts that are typically found at a concentration of 1–10 copies/cell. The presence or absence of a given transcript in a sample was calculated using the present call algorithm of the Affymetrix software. 5,815 sequences, representing 4,361 independent genes, were called present in at least half of the time points. Because 85 independent transcripts are found cycling, it represents a frequency of ∼2% of all present genes. By knowing how many genes are expressed in a single cell, one can extrapolate the total number of cycling transcripts. By using the SAGE technology, it has been previously estimated that a single cell expresses about 13,000 genes (21Velculescu V.E. Madden S.L. Zhang L. Lash A.E., Yu, J. Rago C. Lal A. Wang C.J. Beaudry G.A. Ciriello K.M. Cook B.P. Dufault M.R. Ferguson A.T. Gao Y. He T.C. Hermeking H. Hiraldo S.K. Hwang P.M. Lopez M.A. Luderer H.F. Mathews B. Petroziello J.M. Polyak K. Zawel L. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that one should expect a total of about 260 genes to follow a circadian rhythm of expression after synchronization. A recent paper (22Kornmann B. Preitner N. Rifat D. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (NAR methods online): e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported the identification of 51 circadian transcripts in liver cells in vivo by a differential display technique. 14 of these transcripts were present on our microarrays: four transcripts had hybridization signals below the detection threshold, and nine showed a transient expression peak between time 0 and 24 h as described by Kornmann et al. (22Kornmann B. Preitner N. Rifat D. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (NAR methods online): e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but in our experiment they remained stable for the remaining observation period. Only dbp displayed a cyclic expression pattern for more than one cycle. This may indicate that these genes have a circadian expression profile in vivo that is not maintained in cultured cells. The main difficulty we encountered in this study was to define statistically the cycling transcripts. We tested two methods to detect periodic signals, spectral analysis and autocorrelation. These methods were developed and are adequate to analyze electronic signals where at least 1000 time points can easily be sampled, but they show shortcomings in biological systems characterized by a higher variability, varying amplitude of the signal, and a small number of time points available for analysis. While detecting our positive controls, rev-erbα, dbp,cry, and per as periodically oscillating, these methods were unable to score them as statistically significant. Therefore, we used these mathematical methods as periodicity detector that had to be followed by a qualitative analysis to take into account the standard deviation of the measurement. This may have resulted in a conservative estimation of the number of cycling transcripts. As the clustering was obtained from a phenomenological data analysis, further molecular studies such as comparisons of gene promoter regulations will be necessary to reveal why those transcripts are co-regulated in a circadian manner. Although different levels of mRNA transcript do not always translate into equivalent changes in protein levels, our clustering data suggest that gene products with similar profiles might have a greater likelihood of interactions with each other than with those whose transcripts are cycling with a different phase. Also of interest is the circadian expression of the glutamate receptor 4 transcript in cluster 4, which is known to be expressed in the SCN (23Stamp J.A. Piggins H.D. Rusak B. Semba K. Brain Res. 1997; 756: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and of the serotonin 5-HT5Breceptor transcript in cluster 6. A circadian pattern of expression for the 5HT2C receptor could be shown in the hippocampus (24Holmes M.C. French K.L. Seckl J.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as well as for the GluR2/3 subunits of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor in the SCN at the protein level (25Chambille I. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glutamate and serotonin are thought to mediate and modulate light resetting of the mammalian clock, respectively (26Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T. Faiman L.E. Rea M.A. Gillette M.U. Science. 1994; 266: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 27Pickard G.E. Rea M.A. Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Circadian expression of these receptors may indicate that the input component of the clock is a target of the circadian oscillator. The most remarkable common physiological feature was observed with four genes implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle. Cyclin D3, CDK4 and RING3 showed the same pattern of expression between 12 and 56 h. Cyclin D3 and CDK4 are known to interact directly (cyclin-D3 activating CDK4) and to play an important role in the G1/S transition phase in the cell cycle (28Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The cyclin-D3 protein amount is regulated at the transcriptional level, and its half-life is 25 min (29Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1500-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Circadian rhythm and the cell cycle have been linked in vivo. In humans, circadian variation are observed in the number of progenitor cells detected in bone marrow (30Smaaland R. Laerum O.D. Sothern R.B. Sletvold O. Bjerknes R. Lote K. Blood. 1992; 79: 2281-2287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in the level of expression of cell cycle-associated proteins (cyclins) in biopsy samples of the oral mucosa (31Bjarnason G.A. Jordan R. Sothern R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A role for CDK4 on circadian rhythms was suggested previously (32Sankrithi N. Eskin A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but it could not be determined if the effect on phase shifts of the circadian rhythm by CDK inhibitors were due to the direct inhibition of CDK or due to a general inhibition of transcription. RING3 is a novel serine-threonine kinase located in the nucleus, which can transactivate cyclin (D11, A, and E) and dihydrofolate reductase genes (33Denis G.V. Vaziri C. Guo N. Faller D.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). RING3 is implicated in cell cycle, and its expression pattern is circadian and synchronous with those of cyclin D3 and CDK4 in our experiment. Together, these results indicate that transcripts of several proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle are regulated, in non-dividing confluent cells, according to a circadian rhythm. We conclude that, in synchronized fibroblasts, 2% of all gene transcripts show a circadian pattern of expression. The 85 independent cycling transcripts described and clustered here encode a surprisingly large number of functional protein classes, some representing potentially interesting drug targets for diseases involving the circadian clock such as depression, jetlag, insomnia, and other sleep disorders. Our data analysis also suggests a molecular link or pathway between the cell cycle and endogenous circadian cellular clock functions. We thank M. Hürzeler and C.

To have access to the target organs/cells, the parasite must cross the basal laminae and the extracellular matrix (ECM). We previously characterized an 80-kDa proteinase (Tc80) secreted by the infective trypomastigotes that hydrolyzes native collagens and might be involved in infection by degrading ECM components. Here, we present evidence indicating a role for Tc80 in the invasion of nonphagocytic cells. Tc80 was classified as a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) family of serine proteases and was also found to hydrolyze fibronectin. Selective inhibitors for POP Tc80 were synthesized that blocked parasite entry into cells. Blockage occurred when trypomastigotes were preincubated with irreversible inhibitors but not after host cell preincubation, and the blockage correlated with inhibition of POP Tc80 activity in treated parasites. These data and the enzyme location inside a vesicular compartment close to the flagellar pocket, a specialized domain in endocytosis/exocytosis, strongly suggest a role for POP Tc80 in the maturation of parasite protein(s) and/or, after secretion, in a local action on parasite or host cell/ECM components required for invasion.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 347-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In vertebrate hosts, T. cruzi transmission is carried out through reduviid bug feces contaminated with metacyclic trypomastigotes that infect cells via mucosa or skin wounds. The parasite can infect and multiply inside a broad range of mammalian tissues or cells. Trypomastigotes penetrate nonphagocytic cells by a nonconventional mechanism involving host cell lysosome recruitment and their fusion at the parasite attachment site to form a parasitophorous vacuole (2Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). An acid-active membrane pore-forming protein and a neuraminidase activity synergistically promote the escape from the parasitophorous vacuole to the host cell cytoplasm, where it differentiates into the dividing amastigote form (3Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After multiplying, the amastigotes differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are released into the extracellular medium. To have access to different cell types, the trypomastigote must cross the basal laminae (the barrier surrounding organs and blood vessels) and ECM.1 Specific interactions between trypomastigote surface molecules and basal laminae/ECM components, such as collagen (4Velge P.

T. cruzi proteases play important roles in the host-parasite relationship. They have been involved in nutritional functions, metacyclogenesis, and host cell invasion (8Avila J.L. Bretana A.

Parastol. 1993; 58: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A serine proteinase, called oligopeptidase B, plays a central role in host cell invasion by generating a Ca2+-signaling factor required for the host lysosome recruitment at the invasion site (12Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5172-5180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Burleigh B.A. Caler E.V. Webster P. Andrews N.W. J.

Burleigh B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Development of specific inhibitors of T. cruziproteases seems to be a promising approach to novel chemotherapy for Chagas' disease (15Engel J.C. Doyle P.S. Hsieh I. McKerrow J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We characterized a T. cruzi 80-kDa proteinase (Tc80), secreted by the infective trypomastigote form, that specifically hydrolyzes purified human collagens types I and IV and native collagen in rat mesentery at neutral pH (16Santana J.M. Grellier P. Schrével J. Teixeira A.R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 129-137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By its property of cleaving peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues, Tc80 proteinase could be classified as prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), a representative of a new serine peptidase family (EC 3.4.21.26) (17Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As POPs, Tc80 proteinase has an unusual inhibitor profile characterized by its inactivation by diisopropyl fluorophosphate but not by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and its susceptibility to p-chloromercuribenzoate, a cysteine protease inhibitor, indicating the presence of a cysteine residue at or near the active site (18Joyeau R. Maoulida C. Guillet C. Frappier F. Teixeira A.R.L. Schrével J. Santana J. Grellier P. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tc80 proteinase secretion by the trypomastigotes suggests that this enzyme could be involved in the host cell infection by facilitating the parasite migration through ECM or the host cell invasion per se (e.g. by cleaving collagens interacting with integrin receptors). Reversible inhibitors of Tc80 proteinase have been obtained based on 1) the substrate recognition sequence (Leu-Gly-Pro), whose C terminus was modified with the functional groups vinyl sulfone, 2-ketobenzothiazole, or nitrile likely to interact with the active site (18Joyeau R. Maoulida C. Guillet C. Frappier F. Teixeira A.R.L. Schrével J. Santana J. Grellier P. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); 2) the screening of combinatorial peptide libraries with phenylpropylcarbonyl-l-tetrahydroisoquinoline(Tic)-pyrrolidine (inhibitor 1; see Table II), which was highly efficient in inhibiting the enzyme with an IC50 of 7 nm(19Vendeville S.

In this study, we evaluated the specificity of these inhibitors toward Tc80 proteinase and other known T. cruziproteases as well as mammalian POP. Furthermore, irreversible inhibitors were synthesized based on the dipeptide 1, possessing an electrophilic group on pyrrolidine in the P1 position and a proline or a proline mimic (Tic) in the P2 position. The importance of Tc80 proteinase in host cell invasion by the trypomastigotes was investigated by using these inhibitors, and its biological role during this essential step of T. cruzi life cycle is discussed.Table IISummary of the inhibition data of POP Tc80 by the irreversible inhibitors 1–42-a In the presence of 11 μm Suc-GPLGP-AMC as substrate. nd, not determined.

Z-P-prolinal dimethylacetal and Boc-NFP-aldehyde were purchased from Bachem (Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, France).

Chem. 2000; 35: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibitor 1 was synthesized as previously reported (20Vendeville S. Bourel L. Davioud-Charvet E. Grellier P. Deprez B.

The fluorogenic substrates Suc-GPLGP-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), Z-GGR-AMC, Suc-LLVY-AMC, and Z-FR-AMC were from Sigma. Stock solutions of inhibitors and substrates were made in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Purified fibronectin from bovine plasma was purchased from Calbiochem. Inhibitors were prepared in solution phase from two starting materials, Boc-Tic-Pro-OCH3 and Boc-Pro-Pro-OCH3, obtained by condensing Boc-Tic and Boc-Pro with Pro-OCH3, respectively, using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents and dichloromethane/dimethylformamide as solvents. After trifluoroacetic acid deprotection, each amino-terminal group was substituted by 4-phenylbutyric acid or benzyl isocyanide. The resulting methyl esters were transformed to the chloromethylketones (lithium diisopropylamide/CH2ICl as reagents), which led to the corresponding acetyloxymethylketones, and then hydrolyzed into hydroxymethylketones.

Trypomastigotes were obtained and purified as previously described (2Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W.

Purified proteins resolved as one band on SDS-PAGE. Hydrolysis of AMC substrates were recorded up to 30 min at 440 nm upon excitation at 380 nm in a Hitachi 2000 spectrofluorimeter or at 460 nm upon excitation at 355 nm in 96-well microplate fluorescence readers (FL600; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.; Fluoroskan, Labsystems, Inc.) at 24 °C as previously described (16Santana J.M. Grellier P. Schrével J. Teixeira A.R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 129-137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reaction buffers were 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl for POP Tc80 and oligopeptidase B, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for Tc30 protease and the same buffer with 5 mmdithiothreitol for cruzipain. Eight 175-cm2 flasks of L-6 cells at 70% confluence were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3), and cells were allowed to detach in cold 5 mm EDTA in PBS. After centrifugation (600 × g, 5 min), cells were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and lysed by two cycles of freezing at −80 °C and thawing. POP activity was detected using 100 μm Suc-GPLGP-AMC. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) more than 90% of the proteolytic activity was found in the supernatant and precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 solution between 30 and 70% saturation. The precipitate was resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer for 12 h at 4 °C. The sample was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma), previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl for 40 min and then with 1.0m NaCl at 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The proteolytic activity eluted as a single peak between 0.20 and 0.25 m NaCl and was then concentrated on Centricon 30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 4 °C. The solution was then submitted to gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, at a 0.3 ml/min flow rate. Activity was eluted as a single peak with a molecular mass of 140 kDa according to the column calibration curve. Active fractions were concentrated on Centricon 30 and used for the enzymatic tests. The reaction buffer was 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl containing 100 μm leupeptin,trans-epoxysucciny-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), Bestatin, and 1 mm EDTA. These protease inhibitors did not affect the L-6 POP activity. Assays with different AMC substrates showed that the partially purified enzyme has a strict postproline activity (data not shown) and a K m of 243 ± 30 μm for Suc-GPLGP-AMC (25Cornish-Bowden A. Principles of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworths, London1976Google Scholar). Inhibition constants for reversible inhibitors were determined using the progress curve method, in which inhibitor is added to a steady-state enzyme-substrate reaction (26Salvesen G. Nagase H. Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). All of the measurements were performed in the corresponding enzyme reaction buffer. Enzyme was mixed with substrate for 5 min before adding inhibitor (<5% of the total assay volume) and incubated at 24 °C up to 30 min. The inhibitor was in at least 20-fold molar excess over enzyme. Reactions were conducted under experimental conditions where less than 5% substrate was hydrolyzed. Under these conditions, v 0/v i = 1 + [I]/K i(app), where v 0represents the enzyme activity without inhibitor andv i is the enzyme activity in presence of inhibitor.K i(app) was obtained for several concentrations of inhibitor. K i constants were calculated fromK i(app) by the following relationship:K i(app) = K i (1 + [S]/K m), where [S] denotes the substrate concentration, using K m values of 12.5 μm Suc-GPLGP-AMC for POP Tc80 (16Santana J.M.

For the partially purified L-6 POP, similarK i values were determined for different dilutions of enzyme, indicating that the inhibitors were in excess of the enzyme. Irreversible inhibitors 2–4 derived from the reversible inhibitor 1 (see Table II) were evaluated on the POP Tc80 activity in duplicate with final concentrations of inhibitor ranging from 0 to 50 nm and a final Me2SO concentration of 3.33%. For the assay, 30 μl of inhibitor solution were added to 30 μl of Suc-GPLGP-AMC (final concentration 11 μm). The reaction was started by adding 30 μl of the enzyme solution and stopped after 15 min of incubation at room temperature by the addition of 100 μl ethanol, and the fluorescence was measured. Concentration of inhibitor needed to reduce activity by 50% (IC50) was determined graphically from the curve of the percentage of inhibitionversus the inhibitor concentration. Inactivation of POP Tc80 by inhibitors 2–4 was followed by preincubating at 24 °C an aliquot of inhibitor in a buffered enzyme solution in 200 μl. The inhibitor was in at least 20-fold molar excess over enzyme. Inhibitor concentrations (i) varied from 0 to 40 nm, depending on the molecule. Aliquots were removed at regular timed intervals, and residual activity (v i) was determined in duplicate by starting the reaction with the substrate Suc-GPLGP-AMC. Pseudo-first-order inhibition rate constants (k obs) were obtained from plots of ln v i/v 0 versus time (t), where v 0represents the activity prior to the addition of inhibitor. The data were fit to the equation, v i =v 0 × e − kit, by using a nonlinear regression analysis software (Kaleidagraph, Graphing and Data Analysis Program, Synergy Software). For the determination ofk and K I values (limiting rate constant for enzyme inactivation and dissociation constant for the binary enzyme-inactivator complex, respectively), the pseudo first-order inhibition rate constants (k obs) obtained were plotted versus the concentration of inhibitor (i), and the data were fitted to the equation,k obs = k ×i/(K I + i). The irreversibility of the inactivation of POP Tc80 by inhibitors2–4 was evaluated in quadruplicate after dialysis of the complexes. Inhibitors 4a, 2a, 2c (15 μm), 2b (30 μm), 3a,3b, or 3c (75 μm) were added to enzyme in assay buffer in the presence of 3.33% Me2SO as final concentration (500-μl total volume). The reversible inhibitor1 (15 μm) was used as a negative control. 250 μl of each reaction mixture was extensively dialyzed on Centricon 30 at 4 °C for 1 h against the reaction buffer containing 3.33% Me2SO, with three buffer exchanges. Recovery of enzyme activity was determined by adding the substrate under standard assay procedures and compared with the activities from corresponding nondialyzed reaction mixtures and from reaction mixtures in the absence of inhibitor (dialyzed and nondialyzed). POP Tc80 was purified by SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie Blue staining, the band of interest was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolysis (28Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Beckman ultrasphere ODS column (2 × 200 mm), eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Isolated peptides were sequenced in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise 492. Sequences were compared against nonredundant data bases: GenBankTM CDS translations + Protein Data Bank + SwissProt + PIR + PRF using BLAST 2.0 (NCBI; available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Parasite genome project data bases (www2.ebi.ac.uk/blast2/parasites.html). Multiple alignments were performed using the ClustalV program with default parameters (29Higgins D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Purified fibronectin from bovine plasma was radiolabeled with [14C]formaldehyde (37 MBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (16Santana J.M. Grellier P. Schrével J. Teixeira A.R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 129-137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed by incubating 50 μg of fibronectin with 0.25 μg of purified POP Tc80 in 100 μl of 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl for up to 12 h at 37 °C. Controls consisted of fibronectin incubated under the same conditions with the proteinase inactivated by previous treatment with 30 μm Tos-Lys-CH2Cl (TLCK). Aliquots were taken at the time of the enzyme addition and after 1, 2, 5, and 12 h of incubation and submitted to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were prepared for autoradiography. Trypomastigotes (5·105 to 2·106/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in culture medium containing different concentrations of inhibitors and then transferred to L-6, NIH-3T3, or HeLa cell cultures plated 24 h before in 24-well plates (0.5·105 cells/well) or 96-well plates (0.5·104 cells/well) with a trypomastigotes/cell ratio of 20:1. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, wells were washed three times with culture medium without inhibitor, and cells were maintained for 72–96 h in the absence of inhibitor before methanol fixation and Giemsa staining. The percentage of infected cells was determined by counting 500 host cells under × 50 magnification. The percentage of inhibition of the host cell invasion was calculated by comparison with the percentage of infected cells in control wells. For the experiments performed with the β-galactosidase-expressing parasite Tulahuen lacZ clone 4, cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 after 96 h of incubation, and β-galactosidase activity was quantified using the chromogenic substrate red β-d-galactopyranoside as described (22Buckner F.S. Verlinde C.L. La Flamme A.C. Van Voorhis W.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of inhibition of host cell invasion was determined by comparison of the activity measured in the treated cultures with that of control cultures processed in the same way but receiving equivalent amount of Me2SO instead of inhibitor. Concentration inhibiting 50% (IC50) of the invasion was determined from dose-response curves from at least three independent experiments. For the experiments with the irreversible inhibitors, two procedures were followed. 1) L-6 cells were preincubated in culture medium containing different concentrations of irreversible inhibitor for 2 h at 37 °C, washed three times with culture medium, and incubated with β-galactosidase-expressing trypomastigotes (20:1 trypomastigotes/L-6 cell ratio) for 1 h in the absence of inhibitor. 2) Trypomastigotes were incubated for 2 h in medium containing the irreversible inhibitor, washed three times (10,000 × g, 3 min), and maintained for 1 h with L-6 cells (20:1 ratio) in the absence of inhibitor. In both cases, after three final washes, cells were maintained for 72–96 h before the β-galactosidase assay (22Buckner F.S. Verlinde C.L. La Flamme A.C. Van Voorhis W.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5.5·106 trypomastigotes (Y strain, 1.5·106 parasites/ml) were maintained for 2 h at 37 °C in culture medium in the absence or in the presence of the inhibitor 4a (10 μm) and washed four times (10,000 × g, 3 min) with an excess of PBS, and the cell pellets were lysed in 400 μl of distilled water by freezing/thawing. Protease activities were measured as described above using 20 μm Suc-GPLGP-AMC for POP Tc80; 25 μm Z-GGR-AMC, 100 μm E-64 for oligopeptidase B; and 25 μm Z-FR-AMC for cruzipain. Percentages of inhibition of the protease activities were determined by comparison with that measured in controls maintained with equivalent amounts of Me2SO instead of inhibitor. Antiserum against POP Tc80 was produced by direct injection of the purified protease into lymph nodes of a rabbit under anesthesia and two subsequent subcutaneous immunizations in the back. Parasites were washed twice in PBS (2000 × g, 5 min) before fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After a subsequent wash in PBS, cells were centrifuged (2000 ×g, 20 min) onto 10-mm diameter glass coverslides, air-dried, and permeabilized in 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Coverslides were saturated in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed (2 × 10 min) in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with POP Tc80 antiserum or preimmune antiserum diluted in 1% nonfat milk-PBS. Coverslides were washed three times, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins for 2 h at room temperature and then with 2 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min. After three washes, coverslides were mounted in FluoroGuard antifade reagent (Bio-Rad) and observed under a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 DV inverted microscope using appropriate fluorescence emission filters. Image acquisition was performed with a back-illuminated cooled detector (CCD EEV; NTE/CCD-1024-EB; Roper Scientific). Data acquisition and processing were performed with Metaview and Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Roper Scientific). Trypomastigote invasion assays were performed as described above except that experiments were performed in Lab-Tek chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). Immediately after parasite removal, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with serum from a patient with chronic Chagas' disease diluted to 1:100 in PBS at room temperature. After several washes, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulins were added for 1 h. DNA of host cells and parasites were stained for 5 min with 2 μg/ml DAPI. After three washes in PBS, slides were mounted in antifade reagent and observed under epifluorescence microscope. DAPI-positive parasites with a negative immunolabeling staining were counted as intracellular parasites, whereas parasites labeled with the anti-T. cruzi antibodies were considered as attached or invading parasites (2Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The number of internalized parasites per L-6 cells was determined by observation of at least 500 cells. To evaluate the effects of inhibitors on the trypomastigote differentiation into amastigotes, L-6 cells were maintained with parasites for 1 h in the absence of inhibitor, washed twice, and incubated for another 1 h to obtain a complete parasite internalization. Inhibitor was then added for 24 h. Cells were fixed for 5 min with acetone/methanol mixture (7:3) at −20 °C, and parasite morphology was examined by IFA using serum from patients with chronic Chagas' disease. Trypomastigotes were incubated with mammalian cells (ratio 10:1, respectively) in 24- or 96-well plates for 24 h as described above. Cells were then washed three times and incubated for 48 h with culture medium containing different concentrations of inhibitor before fixation and Giemsa staining. The number of infected cells was evaluated by examining 20 microscopic fields under × 20 magnification. The number of amastigotes per cell was determined by counting 100 infected cells under × 100 magnification. For host cell proliferation assays, 104cells/well in 96-well plates were maintained in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors for up to 5 days. Cell proliferation was determined by using the XTT-based colorimetric assay (Cell proliferation"

Structural and experimental evidence suggests that CCN family member activities are modulated by their interaction with sulfated glycoconjugates. To elucidate the mechanism of action for WISP-1, we characterized the specificity of its tissue and cellular interaction and identified binding factors. WISP-1 binding was restricted to the stroma of colon tumors and to cells with a fibroblastic phenotype. By using a solid phase assay, we showed that human skin fibroblast conditioned media contained WISP-1 binding factors. Competitive inhibition with different glycosaminoglycans and treatment with glycosaminoglycan lyases and proteases demonstrated that binding to the conditioned media was mediated by dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. Mass spectrometric analysis identified the isolated binding factors as decorin and biglycan. Decorin and biglycan interacted directly with WISP-1 and inhibited its binding to components in the conditioned media. Similarly, WISP-1 interaction with human skin fibroblasts was inhibited by dermatan sulfate, decorin, and biglycan or by treatment of the cell surface with dermatan sulfate-specific lyases. Together these results demonstrate that decorin and biglycan are WISP-1 binding factors that can mediate and modulate its interaction with the surface of fibroblasts. We propose that this specific interaction plays a role in the regulation of WISP-1 function.

Wnt-1 induced secreted protein WISP-1 human IgG1 Fc region fusion protein connective tissue growth factor cysteine-rich 61 nephroblastoma overexpressed bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline mass spectroscopy WISP-11 is a member of the CCN family of growth factors (1Bork P.

WISP-1 was originally cloned based on its induced expression in the C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cell line transformed by the oncogeneWnt-1 (4Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although Wnt-1 is not present in the normal mammary gland, its expression in transgenic mice induces mammary tumors (5Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Hively W.P. Varmus H.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because its induction is associated with the expression of Wnt-1, WISP-1 is a putative downstream effector of the Wnt/Frizzled pathway (4Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recently, WISP-1was identified as a β-catenin-regulated gene that might contribute to Wnt-1-mediated tumorigenesis (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its link to tumorigenesis was also demonstrated by amplification of its genomic DNA and overexpression of its RNA in human colon tumors compared with patient-matched normal mucosa (4Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). WISP-1 is thought to act in an autocrine fashion because its overexpression in normal fibroblasts induces morphological transformation, accelerates cell growth, enhances saturation density, and induces tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high level of expression in peritumoral stroma suggests that WISP-1 might also act in a paracrine fashion to support tumorigenesis (4Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although WISP-1 appears to be implicated in tumor development, its mechanism of action remains uncertain. Members of the CCN family demonstrate high structural homology (2Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 3Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) sharing four conserved cysteine-rich modular domains with sequence similarity to insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, and growth factor cysteine knots (1Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The thrombospondin domain contains a conserved WSXCSXXCG motif thought to be involved in binding to both soluble and matrix-associated macromolecules, in particular to sulfated glycoconjugates (1Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 8Holt G.D. Pangburn M.K. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2852-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CTGF, NOV, and Cyr61 contain amino acid sequences that conform to the proposed heparin-binding consensus sequenceXBBXBX, where B represents an amino acid with a basic charge and X an uncharged or hydrophobic amino acid (9Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of CTGF, NOV, and Cyr61 to heparin was demonstrated by affinity chromatography (10Frazier K. Williams S.

In addition, this consensus sequence is involved in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan interaction required for Cyr61-mediated human skin fibroblast adhesion (14Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Because the CCN family members can be modulated by glycoconjugates, it is important to determine their glycosaminoglycan specificity and proteoglycan binding counterparts to better understand their mechanism of action. The proteoglycan superfamily contains more than 30 members demonstrating a variety of biological functions including tissue organization, cell growth, maturation of specialized tissues, and tumor cell growth and invasion (16Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans show a wide range of structures and are related only by the ability of the proteins to serve as acceptors for the xylosyltransferase, responsible for the synthesis of most types of glycosaminoglycans. Proteoglycans interact with the extracellular matrix, cell surface, growth factors, and cytokines (17Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix-associated proteoglycans play a key role in the recruitment, storage, and modulation of growth factors and cytokines (18Iozzo R.V. Iozzo P.V. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 1-4Google Scholar). In this report we investigate the tissue, cell surface, and glycosaminoglycan binding specificity of WISP-1. We show that WISP-1 binding is restricted to tumor stroma and to cells with a fibroblastic phenotype. This binding is mediated by the soluble and matrix-associated dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan. Chondroitin sulfate A from bovine trachea, chondroitin sulfate C from shark cartilage, hyaluronidase (EC3.2.1.35) from bovine testes, and chondroitinase AC II (EC 4.2.2.5) from Arthrobacter aurescens were purchased from Calbiochem. Chondroitin sulfate B, heparin, and heparan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa, decorin and biglycan from bovine articular cartilage, chondroitinase C, chondroitinase B, and heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7) from Flavobacterium heparinum were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitin sulfate D from shark cartilage, chondroitin sulfate E from squid cartilage, and sheep anti-human decorin (proteoglycan II) antibody were purchased from U. S. Biological Corp. (Swampscott, MA). Neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18) fromVibrio cholerae, chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), protease-free from Proteus vulgaris, fatty acid ultra-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V, and the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Chondroitin-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9) and chondroitin-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10) from P. vulgaris were from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, the biotinylated goat anti-human IgG, Fc fragment-specific, and the biotinylated anti-sheep IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Costa Mesa, CA). Proteinase K (EC3.4.21.14) ready-to-use, Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin, and anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (clone Vim 3B4) were from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). 5-Chloromethylfluorescein diacetate and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The Renaissance TSA indirect amplification kit was bought from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Vectashield mounting media and biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Vector (Burlingame, CA). Full-length mouse WISP-1 (GenBank accession number NM_018865) was cloned into an expression vector encoding the human IgG1 Fc region downstream of the WISP-1 sequence as described previously for tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (19Ashkenazi A. Marsters S.A. Capon D.J. Chamow S.M. Figari I.S. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Palladino M.A. Smith D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10535-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant fusion protein (WISP-1-Fc) was synthesized in a baculovirus expression system using Sf9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity from serum-free conditioned medium by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. Unadsorbed proteins were washed out with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl. WISP-1-Fc was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and the pH was neutralized with 0.1 volume of 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. After dialysis (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm) the purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and the purity estimated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Monoclonal anti-WISP-1 antibodies were generated using the WISP-1-Fc fusion protein as antigen. The antibody was raised in mice and purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A-agarose column. The experiments described were repeated at least three times with three different batches of protein expressed and purified at different times, and similar results were obtained. Binding of WISP-1 to human colon tumor sections was evaluated using the in situ ligand binding procedure previously described with modifications (20Vacherot F. Delbe J. Heroult M. Barritault D. Fernig D.G. Courty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7741-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Slide-mounted human colon tumor sections were brought to room temperature and immediately incubated for 4 min in 35 mmacetic acid, pH 3.5, containing 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, and 1m NaCl. The slides were then washed in HBS-C (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 NaCl, 3 mmCaCl2, 3 mm MgSO4, 5 mmKCl, Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture) containing 32 mmsucrose and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 20 min in HBS-C containing 3% BSA and 32 mm sucrose. The binding sites for avidin and biotin were blocked using the avidin/biotin blocking kit from Vector (Burlingame, CA). The slides were incubated for 1 h in HBS-C buffer containing 3% BSA and 1 nmWISP-1-Fc, washed three times for 1 min each time with cold (4 °C) HBS-C buffer containing 1% BSA, and fixed for 10 min in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde. The slides were incubated with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-WISP-1 antibody in HBS-C, 3% BSA containing 1.5% normal horse serum for 1 h, washed, and fixed in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The sections were washed and incubated for 30 min with 1:200 biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG in HBS-C, 3% BSA. The slides were washed, fixed, and the signal amplified using the TSA indirect amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped by three washes of 4 min in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% BSA. The slides were incubated for 30 min with streptavidin-conjugated FITC (1:1000) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% BSA and washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The sections were mounted using Vectashield mounting media containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and visualized under a Nikon Eclipse 800 fluorescent microscope. No signal was detected when WISP-1-Fc was omitted or the anti-WISP-1 antibody replaced by an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (anti-gp120). Normal rat kidney fibroblasts, Hs 597.Sk (normal human skin fibroblasts), Hs 839.T, and Hs 908.Sk (human skin melanoma fibroblasts), COLO 320DM (human colon adenocarcinoma cells), RAG (mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells), 293 (human kidney epithelial cells), human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and WM-266-4 (human skin melanoma epithelial cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Conditions for the use of glycosaminoglycan lyases were as described previously with modifications (20Vacherot F. Delbe J. Heroult M. Barritault D. Fernig D.G. Courty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7741-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, where indicated, cells were washed and incubated 2 h at 37 °C with 0.1 unit of the different lyases. The cells were then washed twice with HBS-C and used for binding. Cells (8–10 × 103) were plated in 8-well plastic chamber slides and maintained overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The next day the cells were washed with PBS, and the nonspecific binding sites were saturated for 30 min at room temperature with HBS-C, 3% BSA. The cells were incubated with 1 nm WISP-1-Fc for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated anti-human IgG Fc′ in HBS-C, 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. The signal was amplified using the TSA indirect kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 30-min incubation with 1:200 FITC-conjugated streptavidin, the slides were mounted using Vectashield containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and visualized under a Nikon Eclipse 800 fluorescent microscope. Images were acquired with a Photometrics 300 CCD camera operated at −40 °C interfaced with an Apple G3 computer and the Metamorph imaging software from Universal Imaging Corporation (Downingtown, PA). Measurement of the fluorescence intensity of cells was as described previously with modifications (21Szurdoki F. Michael K.L. Walt D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, images of a minimum of three separate fields containing an average of 90 cells were acquired and stored as electronic files. The threshold was defined as the lowest intensity of the 1% brightest pixels in a negative control executed without WISP-1-Fc. The fluorescence signal for a cell population was defined as the total pixel intensity over the threshold divided by the cell number. Proteins were diluted in PBS (total volume 50 μl), applied to polystyrene microtiter wells, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The next day the wells were washed three times with 300 μl of HBS-C, 0.3% BSA, and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of HBS-C, 3% BSA. The buffer was aspirated, and 50 μl of 0.5 nm WISP-1-Fc in HBS-C, 3% BSA was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed and incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc′ in HBS-C, 3% BSA. At the end of the incubation, the wells were washed 6 times with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the signal was visualized using 100 μl of the horseradish peroxidase chromogenic substrate TMB (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m phosphoric acid, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Nonspecific WISP-1-Fc binding was determined in parallel incubations by omitting microtiter well coating. No signal was generated when WISP-1-Fc was omitted or replaced by an irrelevant Fc fusion protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-Fc. Human skin fibroblasts were cycled between serum-containing and serum-free culture media every 3 days. The serum-free conditioned medium was concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore, Bedford MA). The buffer was then changed by sequentially adding 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl and reconcentrating. The concentrate (150 μg of protein/ml) was snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until used. The concentrated conditioned medium was thawed, filtered, and applied on a Mono Q anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl. The column was washed, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl (300 mm to 2 m) in the same buffer. Fractions of 500 μl were analyzed for WISP-1 binding activity. The fractions containing the WISP-1 binding activity were pooled, denatured, reduced, and applied to a 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel with or without a previous incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC. The gels were silver-stained, and the protein bands demonstrating a mobility change upon chondroitinase ABC digestion were excised and digested in situ with trypsin as described previously (22Arnott D. Henzel W.J. Stults J.T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 100-μm inner diameter, 10-cm-long fused silica capillary columns packed with 5-μm C18 beads (238MSB5; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient directly into the microelectrospray ionization source of an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ; Thermoquest, San Jose, CA). A flow rate of 500 nl/min was obtained by a pre-column split from 25 μl/min delivered by high pressure liquid chromatography (Ultra PlusII; Microtech Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA (22Arnott D. Henzel W.J. Stults J.T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Automated, data-dependent acquisition of mass spectra provided molecular mass and sequence data (MS/MS) for peptides as they eluted from the column. Proteins were identified by correlation of MS/MS data with entries in a non-redundant protein sequence data base using the Sequest program (23Gatlin C.L. Eng J.K. Cross S.T. Detter J.C. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Protein matches were confirmed by manual interpretation of the spectra. Slide-mounted human colon tumor sections were brought to room temperature and fixed with 70% ethanol for 10 min, and the nonspecific binding sites were saturated with PBS, 3% BSA containing 1.5% horse serum for 20 min. The sections were incubated for 1 h with 0.125 μg/ml anti-vimentin antibody, washed with PBS, and further incubated for 30 min with 2 μg/ml biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody. The signal was amplified using the TSA indirect kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 30-min incubation with 1:1000 Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin, the slides were mounted using Vectashield containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and visualized under a Nikon Eclipse 800 fluorescent microscope. Images were acquired using a Photometrics 300 CCD Cooled Camera. The negative control executed in the absence of primary antibody did not reveal any fluorescent staining. The immunofluorescent detection of decorin on human skin fibroblasts was executed using a similar protocol. Briefly, 8 × 103 cells were plated in chamber slides and cultured overnight. The next day, the cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml 5-chloromethylfluoroscein diacetate. After washing, the nonspecific binding sites were saturated with HBS-C, 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:4000 sheep anti-human decorin antibody in HBS-C, 0.1% BSA. The cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, washed, and further incubated for 30 min with 2 μg/ml biotinylated anti-sheep IgG. The signal was amplified using the TSA indirect kit. After a 30-min incubation with 1:1000 Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin, the slides were mounted using Vectashield containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and visualized under a Nikon Eclipse 800 fluorescent microscope. Images were acquired using a Photometrics 300 CCD Cooled Camera. The negative control executed in absence of primary antibody did not reveal any fluorescent staining. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II vertical slab gel electrophoresis apparatus, and the proteins were stained using the Silver stain plus kit from Bio-Rad. The apparent molecular mass was determined using the broad range molecular weight standards from Bio-Rad. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent and bovine serum albumin standard. A model in which the autocrine and paracrine signals of WISP-1 contribute to tumor development was recently proposed (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the role of WISP-1 in tumorigenesis, we generated a WISP-1-Fc fusion protein and analyzed its in situ binding to sections of human colon adenocarcinoma. Although vimentin staining revealed the presence of mesenchymal cells in both the tumor and the normal mucosa (Fig. 1, C and D),in situ WISP-1 binding was restricted to the peritumoral stroma (Fig. 1 A). No binding was found to the tumor epithelial cells or to the normal mucosa (Fig. 1, A andB). To verify the specificity of WISP-1 interaction with fibroblasts, we examined its binding to various cell types. The binding revealed an irregular pattern associated with patches and fibrillar structures and was restricted to the surface of cells with fibroblastic character (Fig. 2). WISP-1 bound to normal rat kidney fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A), normal human skin fibroblasts (Hs 597.Sk), and human skin melanoma fibroblasts (Hs 839.T and Hs 908.Sk) but did not bind to human colon adenocarcinoma cells (COLO 320DM), mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (RAG), human kidney epithelial cells (293), human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or human skin melanoma epithelial cells (WM-266-4) (data not shown). No signal was detected when WISP-1-Fc was omitted or replaced by human IgG or when an unrelated biotinylated antibody was used (Fig. 2 B). The pattern of WISP-1 binding suggested that it might interact with extracellular components. To assess this possibility, we investigated the presence of WISP-1 binding factors in culture media from human skin fibroblasts. Microtiter plates were coated with concentrated conditioned medium, and the specific WISP-1 interaction was measured. Binding was proportional to the amount of media coated and to the concentration of WISP-1 added (Fig. 3,A and B) indicating that human skin fibroblasts produce soluble WISP-1 binding factors. To characterize the nature of the interaction, the assay was performed under various conditions. The binding was abolished by 1 mNaCl, reduced by 25% with 100 mm EDTA, whereas 0.05% Tween 20 had no effect (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest a cation-independent ionic interaction between WISP-1 and human skin fibroblast secreted factors. The nature of the secreted factors was investigated by treating coated wells with various lyases before assessing the binding. Treatment with chondroitinase C, chondroitin-6-sulfatase, heparinase, or neuraminidase did not alter WISP-1 interaction, whereas digestion with chondroitinase AC II and hyaluronidase resulted in a 40% and 35% reduction in binding, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Treatment with chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase B, chondroitin-4-sulfatase, or proteinase K abolished WISP-1 binding. The specificity of chondroitinase B and chondroitin-4-sulfatase indicates that dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan is required for WISP-1 interaction. Moreover, proteinase K sensitivity suggests that the binding factors also contain a protein component. Taken together these results indicate that WISP-1 binds to a secreted dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. The specificity of WISP-1 interaction with skin fibroblast conditioned media was further analyzed by solid phase competition assay. The binding was proportionally reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of various glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 5). IC50 was reached at 3 μg/ml dermatan sulfate, 10.5 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate D or heparin, 30 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate E, 75 μg/ml heparan sulfate, or 105 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate A. The presence of chondroitin sulfate C did not reduce WISP-1 binding. To identify WISP-1-binding proteins, serum-free human skin fibroblast conditioned medium was collected, concentrated, and fractionated using a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. WISP-1 binding activity of all fractions was estimated by solid phase assay. As shown in Fig. 6 A, 94% of the adsorbed WISP-1 binding activity was eluted at 0.8-2 mNaCl, whereas only a minor fraction eluted earlier. Because the binding factors were putative dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, we analyzed fractions 14–16 containing the WISP-1 binding activity for electrophoretic mobility changes upon chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 6 A).

During the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, APCCdc20 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the securin protein, leading to the activation of the separase, dissolution of the cohesin complex, and chromatid separation (3Nasmyth K. Peters J.-M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In late anaphase, APCCdh1 is turned on and ubiquitinates cyclin B, thus inactivating the cyclin B-Cdc2 mitotic kinase and triggering the exit from mitosis (2Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 3Nasmyth K. Peters J.-M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.O.

The substrates of APCCdc20 contain the destruction box (D box) motif, whereas APCCdh1 has a broader substrate specificity (8Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitinating D box-containing substrates, APCCdh1 promotes the ubiquitination of additional mitotic regulatory proteins containing the KEN box motif, thus resetting the cell cycle (11Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the APCCdh1 substrates are degraded after chromatid separation, APCCdh1 has to be activated at a later time as compared with APCCdc20 (10Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conversion from the APCCdc20 complex to APCCdh1 is tightly regulated during mitosis (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 10Zachariae W. Curr. Opin.

Mutations of a set of yeast genes, including TEM1, LTE1,DBF2, DBF20, CDC5,CDC14, CDC15, and MOB1, stabilize mitotic cyclin Clb2p and cause late anaphase arrest, indicating that they are required for the exit from mitosis (4Morgan D.O.

These genes are collectively referred to as the mitotic exit network (MEN) (13Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Among the MEN genes, Tem1 is a small GTP-binding protein that belongs to the Rab subfamily (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 15Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-E A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7476-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Lte1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Tem1 and presumably regulates its activity positively (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,16Keng T. Clark M.W. Storms R.K. Fortin N. Zhong W. Ouellette B.F. Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. Bussey H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Lte1 and Tem1 remain spatially segregated until late anaphase, at which time Lte1 and Tem1 co-localize to the bud (17Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The activation of Tem1 then triggers the dissociation of the Cdc14 dual specificity protein phosphatase from the RENT (for regulator ofnucleolar silencing and telophase) complex, resulting in the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus (13Shou W.

In early mitosis, the yeast Cdh1 is phosphorylated by the Clb2-Cdc28 mitotic kinase, and phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its interaction with APC (19Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In late anaphase, the Cdc14 protein liberated from the nucleolus dephosphorylates Cdh1 and activates APCCdh1 (20Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc14 may be the most downstream component of the MEN proteins.Homologues of several yeast MEN proteins, such as Cdc14, Cdc5, and Mob1 have been identified in vertebrates (21Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24253-24260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, the polo-like kinases, the vertebrate homologs of Cdc5, have been implicated in the activation and maintenance of APC activity (24Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of human Cdh1 (hCdh1) blocks its ability to activate APC (25Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 26Lukas C. Sorensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that similar mechanisms for the regulation of APCCdh1 and the exit from mitosis may exist in mammalian cells. However, little is known about whether and how the MEN genes might regulate APCCdh1 in organisms other than the budding yeast.Here we report the biochemical characterization of a human homologue of Cdc14, hCdc14a. Phosphorylation of hCdh1 by cyclin B1-Cdc2 alters the conformation of hCdh1 and blocks its ability to stimulate the ligase activity of APC. The purified hCdc14a protein dephosphorylates hCdh1 and restores its ability to activate APC. Expectedly, hCdc14a does not affect the activity of APCCdc20. Moreover, hCdc14a exists as part of a 500-kDa complex and is a major phosphatase of hCdh1 in HeLa cells. Finally, hCdc14a localizes to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Because several yeast MEN proteins have been shown to localize to spindle pole bodies, the centrosome localization of hCdc14a is consistent with it playing an important role in the regulation of APC in mammalian cells. Therefore, our data suggest that hCdc14a activates APCCdh1 in late anaphase and is a member of the MEN family of proteins in mammals. Orderly progression through the cell cycle relies on the activity of a large ubiquitin protein ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)1 or cyclosome (1King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M.

Peters J.-M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In late anaphase, APCCdh1 is turned on and ubiquitinates cyclin B, thus inactivating the cyclin B-Cdc2 mitotic kinase and triggering the exit from mitosis (2Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 3Nasmyth K. Peters J.-M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.O.

The substrates of APCCdc20 contain the destruction box (D box) motif, whereas APCCdh1 has a broader substrate specificity (8Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitinating D box-containing substrates, APCCdh1 promotes the ubiquitination of additional mitotic regulatory proteins containing the KEN box motif, thus resetting the cell cycle (11Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the APCCdh1 substrates are degraded after chromatid separation, APCCdh1 has to be activated at a later time as compared with APCCdc20 (10Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conversion from the APCCdc20 complex to APCCdh1 is tightly regulated during mitosis (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 10Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the activation of APCCdh1 and exit from mitosis is best characterized in budding yeast (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Mutations of a set of yeast genes, including TEM1, LTE1,DBF2, DBF20, CDC5,CDC14, CDC15, and MOB1, stabilize mitotic cyclin Clb2p and cause late anaphase arrest, indicating that they are required for the exit from mitosis (4Morgan D.O.

These genes are collectively referred to as the mitotic exit network (MEN) (13Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Among the MEN genes, Tem1 is a small GTP-binding protein that belongs to the Rab subfamily (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 15Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-E A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7476-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Lte1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Tem1 and presumably regulates its activity positively (4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,16Keng T. Clark M.W. Storms R.K. Fortin N. Zhong W. Ouellette B.F. Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. Bussey H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Lte1 and Tem1 remain spatially segregated until late anaphase, at which time Lte1 and Tem1 co-localize to the bud (17Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The activation of Tem1 then triggers the dissociation of the Cdc14 dual specificity protein phosphatase from the RENT (for regulator ofnucleolar silencing and telophase) complex, resulting in the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus (13Shou W.

Cell. 1999; 97: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In early mitosis, the yeast Cdh1 is phosphorylated by the Clb2-Cdc28 mitotic kinase, and phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its interaction with APC (19Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In late anaphase, the Cdc14 protein liberated from the nucleolus dephosphorylates Cdh1 and activates APCCdh1 (20Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc14 may be the most downstream component of the MEN proteins. Homologues of several yeast MEN proteins, such as Cdc14, Cdc5, and Mob1 have been identified in vertebrates (21Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24253-24260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, the polo-like kinases, the vertebrate homologs of Cdc5, have been implicated in the activation and maintenance of APC activity (24Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of human Cdh1 (hCdh1) blocks its ability to activate APC (25Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 26Lukas C. Sorensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that similar mechanisms for the regulation of APCCdh1 and the exit from mitosis may exist in mammalian cells. However, little is known about whether and how the MEN genes might regulate APCCdh1 in organisms other than the budding yeast. Here we report the biochemical characterization of a human homologue of Cdc14, hCdc14a. Phosphorylation of hCdh1 by cyclin B1-Cdc2 alters the conformation of hCdh1 and blocks its ability to stimulate the ligase activity of APC. The purified hCdc14a protein dephosphorylates hCdh1 and restores its ability to activate APC. Expectedly, hCdc14a does not affect the activity of APCCdc20. Moreover, hCdc14a exists as part of a 500-kDa complex and is a major phosphatase of hCdh1 in HeLa cells. Finally, hCdc14a localizes to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Because several yeast MEN proteins have been shown to localize to spindle pole bodies, the centrosome localization of hCdc14a is consistent with it playing an important role in the regulation of APC in mammalian cells. Therefore, our data suggest that hCdc14a activates APCCdh1 in late anaphase and is a member of the MEN family of proteins in mammals.

Russell G.E. Bio/Technology and Genetic Engineering Reviews. 3. Intercept, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK1985: 39-109Google Scholar). The target substrate for these enzymes, the plant cell wall, is a composite structure that consists primarily of polysaccharides and is highly recalcitrant to biological degradation. Microbial plant cell wall hydrolases are often modular proteins comprising a catalytic module linked via a highly flexible sequence to one or more carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs; Ref. 2Tomme P.

CBMs have been grouped into approximately 30 families based on amino acid sequence similarities (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/db.html; see Ref. 9Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of representatives of approximately half of the CBM families have now been solved. These proteins are predominantly β-stranded, with the topography of their ligand-binding sites reflecting the structure of the target polysaccharide. Thus, CBMs that bind crystalline cellulose have a planar hydrophobic ligand-binding site (10Xu G.-Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harris-Brandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and modules that interact with single polysaccharide chains accommodate their ligands in an extended cleft (11Johnson P.E.

Boraston A.B. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6248-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or multiple shallow pockets, respectively (14Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Kusakable I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although there has been extensive structural investigation into the mechanism by which lectins and periplasmic sugar-binding proteins recognize their ligands (15Toone E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which CBMs bind to plant cell wall polysaccharides has remained elusive, and models for polysaccharide interaction remain highly speculative (5Simpson P.J.

Furthermore, many CBMs bind to adjacent sugars in a polysaccharide chain that, in the case of hemicellulose, may be highly decorated. The mechanism by which the proteins accommodate these side chains substituents is unknown. It is also unclear whether polysaccharides adopt their normal conformation when bound to CBMs or whether these proteins cause a change in the structure of the sugar chain on binding, possibly disrupting internal hydrogen bonding and thus preventing its reassociation with the bulk of the plant cell wall. To start to unravel the mechanism by which CBMs recognize their target ligands the crystal structure of a xylan-binding CBM (CBM15), which we demonstrate binds xylan, including decorated xylans and xylooligosaccharides, was solved in complex with xylopentaose. The three-dimensional structure reveals a β-jelly roll structure of two β-sheets displaying an extended groove that runs along the face of the protein. Within this deep-walled canyon two tryptophan residues, whose rings are orientated at 240° to one another, form hydrophobic stacking interactions with two xylopyranose units at n andn+2, reflecting the approximate 3-fold helical conformation of bound xylan. The location of the polysaccharide 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls reveals for the first time how these binding modules may accommodate both decorated and naked xylans. TheEscherichia coli strain used in this study was BL21(DE3):pLysS (Novagen) that harbored a recombinant of the expression vector pET16b (Novagen), designated pLS1, which encoded CBM15 fused to a C-terminal His6 tag. The cells were cultured in Luria broth (400 ml in 2-liter conical flasks) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C and 200 rpm until theA600 reached 0.6, at which point gene expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were grown for a further 3–4 h before being harvested by centrifugation (4500 ×g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 140th volume 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl before being lysed by sonication and centrifuged (25,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C to produce cell-free extract. To express CBM15, the region of the gene encoding Pseudomonas cellulosaxylanase 10C (Pc xyn10C; Ref. 19Millward-Sadler S.J. Davidson K. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Clarke J.H. Biochem.

The amplified DNA (nucleotides 254–728 of xyn10C) was cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET16b to generate pLS1. CBM15 was purified from cell-free extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described previously (20Xie H. Gilbert H.J. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J.

The protein eluted from the matrix was dialyzed against 3 × 500 volumes of 10 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (buffer A), applied to a 3-ml DEAE TrisAcryl column (15 × 50 mm), and the CBM eluted with a linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. The recovered protein was then applied to a High LoadTM SuperdexTM 75 column (16 × 600 mm; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The columns were run at 1 ml/min using the Bio-Rad biologic system. The purity of the protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficient of CBM15 at 280 nm (18400m−1 cm−1). Affinity gel electrophoresis was used as a qualitative assessment of the capacity of CBM15 to bind to various polysaccharides. Affinity gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (17Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabo L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with polysaccharides added to the polyacrylamide gels at a final concentration of 0.1%. Rye arabinoxylan (Ara:Xyl, 49:51), wheat arabinoxylan (Ara:Xyl, 41:59), and xylooligosaccharides were purchased from Megazyme International Ireland Ltd. Oat spelt xylan (Ara:Xyl, 10:90), 4-O-methyl glucuronoxylan, and hydroxyethyl cellulose were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cellohexaose was purchased from AMS Biotechnology Ltd. Acid-swollen cellulose and soluble and insoluble oat spelt xylan were prepared by standard protocols (21Abou Hachem M. Nordberg Karlsson E. Bartonek-Roxå E. Raghothama S. Simpson P.J. Gilbert H.J.

Assessment of CBM15 binding to insoluble cellulose and xylan was carried out by determining the amount of bound and free protein using SDS-PAGE (23Simpson P.J. Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41137-41142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were made at 25 °C following standard procedures using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the ligand was dissolved in the same buffer to minimize heats of dilution. During a titration experiment, the protein sample (200–300 μm) stirred at 400 rpm in a 1.3586-ml reaction cell was injected with 25 successive 10-μl aliquots of ligand (6–40 mm) at 200-s intervals. The molar concentration of binding sites on the polysaccharides was determined by altering the concentration of ligand used for the fit and then fitting the data until the number of binding sites on the protein (n) was equal to one. This method was deemed valid because: (i) accurate determination of the protein concentration was possible using the molar extinction coefficient at A280 and (ii) the crystal structure of CBM15 in complex with xylohexaose clearly shows only a single binding site on the protein. Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a single site binding model (Microcal Origin, version 2.9). The fitted data yield the association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation: -RTlnKa = ΔG = ΔH −TΔS Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor phase diffusion method from 0.2 mNH4OAc, 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 10 mm xylohexaose with 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 as the precipitant. A single crystal was transferred to a cryo-protectant solution comprised of the growth buffer supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol. The data to 1.63 Å resolution were collected from a single crystal at the CLRC Daresbury SRS on beam line pX 9.6 using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD as a detector. The crystals of CBM15 belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensionsa = 92.62 Å, b = 60.39 Å,c = 33.28 Å, and β = 102.61°. The data were processed and reduced using the HKL suite of programs (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38251) Google Scholar), and all further computing used the CCP4 (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

This structure revealed a short three-stranded β-sheet corresponding to a small portion of the CBM15 structure. This sheet region was successfully used as a search model for molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

San Diego, CA). The structure was refined using maximum likelihood methods with the program REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Xylanase 10C from P. cellulosa is comprised of a C-terminal xylanase GH10 catalytic module with an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module that belongs to family 15 (CBM15; Ref 19Millward-Sadler S.J. Davidson K. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Clarke J.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Previous preliminary qualitative characterization of CBM15 demonstrated that the protein bound weakly to Avicel but not to insoluble xylan (19Millward-Sadler S.J. Davidson K. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Clarke J.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An analysis of the ligand specificity of CBM15 using affinity gel electrophoresis revealed that the module bound to oat spelt xylan, arabinoxylans from wheat and rye, methylglucuronoxylan, and β-glucan. CBM15 interacted only weakly with hydroxyethyl cellulose and did not associate with arabinan, galactan, galactomannan, glucomannan, debranched arabinan, or potato galactan (data not shown). The affinity of CBM15 for both insoluble xylan and acid-swollen cellulose was only slightly above that of a nonspecific control comprising bovine serum albumin (data not shown), clearly demonstrating that the previous classification of CBM15 as a cellulose-binding module (19Millward-Sadler S.J. Davidson K. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Clarke J.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was incorrect. Quantitative assessment of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (Table I) showed that CBM15 bound to xylooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 or greater, exhibiting maximal affinity for xylohexaose. The protein bound to oat spelt xylan with similar affinity to xylopentaose. TheKa of CBM15 for the more substituted xylans (rye and wheat arabinoxylan and methylglucuronoxylan) was ∼2-fold lower than for oat spelt xylan. At saturation the number of xylose units that constitute a single CBM binding site is broadly similar for the different xylans (9–14 xylose moieties). These data indicate that the module can accommodate the various side chains present on the decorated xylans. The CBM also interacted with cellohexaose and β-glucan, but with an affinity ∼10-fold lower than for xylohexaose. ΔHand TΔS values for all the CBM15-ligand interactions are negative, thus enthalpic forces drive the binding event, which are partly negated by an unfavorable entropy. The thermodynamics of CBM15 binding to xylan and xylooligosaccharides is similar to other CBMs that interact with soluble polysaccharides (4Tomme P. Creagh A.L. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A.

Open table in a new tab To gain more detailed insight into the mechanism by which CBM15 recognizes xylooligosaccharides, the crystal structure of the protein in complex with xylohexaose was solved by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.63 Å. The data for CBM15 extended from 30.0 to 1.63 Å resolution (outer resolution shell, 1.69–1.63 Å in parentheses). They have a merging R value of 0.043 (0.330), are 98% (80%) complete with a mean I/ςI of 29 (3.0), and were collected with a multiplicity of 3.6 (2.8) observations/reflection. The final model consists of residues 91–243 (based upon the full-length Xyn10C sequence; accession code Q59675) a single metal ion (modeled as Na+), 231 solvent water molecules, and 46 ligand atoms corresponding to a single xylopentaose moiety. The crystallographicR value is 0.15 with an Rfree of 0.18, and the model displays deviations from stereochemical target values of 0.016 Å for bonds and 1.8° for angles. The model has been deposited with the Macromolecular Structures Data Base with accession code 1GNY.pdb. The structure of CBM15 forms a classic β-jelly roll, predominantly consisting of five major anti-parallel β-strands on the two faces (Fig. 1a), although primarily a β-stranded protein, CBM15 contains a short α-helical segment between Glu158 and Ser162 is evident; a structural feature that rarely occurs in this type of protein. Residues immediately below this helix are also involved in the coordination of what appears to be a single metal ion. The identity of the metal is difficult to determine unambiguously, but it has been modeled as Na+ (refining with a temperature factor of 30Å2 when refined with unitary occupancy), although the biological relevance of the metal is unknown. CBM15 displays a single disulfide bond between Cys183 and Cys200 on strands 9 and 10, respectively, linking the two β-sheets that form the jelly roll. A single cis-peptide linkage is found between Arg140 and Pro151. The topology of CBM15 is very similar to that observed in several CBM families. DALI (35Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J.

CBM15 also shows high structural similarity with catalytic modules of clan GH-B glycoside hydrolases such as the family 16 κ-carrageenase (32Michel G. Chantalat L. Duee E. Barbetron T. Henrissat B.

Joe K. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and CBM6 (35Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Ferreira L.M.A. Bornet O. Zamboni V. Darbon H. Smith N.L. Black G.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. October 22, 2001; (10.1074/jbc.M109142200)PubMed Google Scholar), has led some to propose that CBM4, CBM6, CBM22, and other CBMs should be grouped into a superfamily because the similarity of the overall fold and the location of an extended cleft suggest that proteins from these families are derived from a common ancestral sequence (7Sunna A Gibbs M.D. Bergquist P.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CBM15 contains a deep cleft that runs along the concave face of the β-sheet, ∼20–25 Å long, which forms the binding site for the target ligands. The protein was crystallized in the presence of xylohexaose, and the structure reveals five well ordered xylose rings, all in the 4C1 chair conformation in the cleft (labeled Xyl1 to Xyl5 from the reducing to the nonreducing) (Fig.1b). Extremely weak electron density extends beyond O-4 of Xyl5, indicative of a sixth highly disordered xylose unit, but it could not be appropriately refined as a xylopyranoside. Xylan chains are themselves pseudo-symmetrical and fit equally well into electron density in the two opposite orientations. The correct orientation in this case was determined on two grounds: the observation of hydrogen bonds to solvent and protein from O-5 atoms (whose equivalent would be C-5 in the reverse orientation) and the behavior of the crystallographic temperature factors after refinement, which showed large discrepancies at C-5 and O-5 in the reverse orientation. Furthermore, the C-1–O-1 bond at the reducing end shows disorder, consistent with mutarotation at this position. Indeed, because the specificity of the orientation of the xylooligosaccharide appears to be determined by a single hydrogen bond from the O-5 atom of Xyl3 to the side chain amide of Gln171, it is possible that undecorated xylans are able to bind in the two possible directions. Two solvent-exposed tryptophan residues, Trp176 and Trp181, lie in the binding groove and make hydrophobic stacking interactions with Xyl2 and Xyl4, respectively (Fig.2). The indole rings of the two tryptophans lie at an angle of exactly 240° with respect to each other and are ∼10.5 Å apart, consistent with the binding of xylan in its known 3-fold helix structure, described below. These two residues are invariant in the CBM15 family (9Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar), and in view of the pivotal role aromatic residues play in ligand binding in other CBM families (17Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. Nagy T.

Williamson M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Orosz L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), these amino acids are likely to be critical to the interaction of the protein with xylose polymers. Xylopentaose binds in an almost 3-fold helical orientation characterized by the internal hydrogen bond from O-3n to O-5n+1. This is especially valid for the central three sugars in the main cavity in which Xyl2 and Xyl4 interact with the two tryptophans as described. The chair ring planes (defined by C-2, C-3, C-5, and O-5) of the three sugars Xyl2–4, lie at angles of 117 and 99°, respectively. Xylan thus binds in its favored 3-fold helical conformation previously determined by x-ray fiber diffraction analysis of xylan (37Atkins E.D.T. Visser J. Beldman G. van Kusters S. Voragen A.G.L. Xylan and Xylanases: Progress in Biotechnology. 7. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 39-50Google Scholar). Such a conformation had previously been proposed for xylohexaose bound to CBM2b-1 from Cellulomonas fimi Xyn11A (5Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabo L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In CBM2b-1, two equivalent tryptophan residues, Trp259 and Trp291, were predicted to bind to xylose units in subsites n and n + 2 of a 3-fold xylan helix as observed here. Again the tryptophan ring planes sit 8–12 Å apart at an angle of ∼280°. In both CBM15 and CBM2b-1, the minimum length of polymer that binds strongly correlates with the length of an oligosaccharide required to span these tryptophan residues, in both cases a trisaccharide. It may be relevant then that in CBM22, in which two hydrophobic stacking groups are adjacent, the minimum sugar required for binding is the disaccharide (12Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The xylopentaose moiety bound to CBM15 makes surprisingly few direct hydrogen bonds to the protein. Only Xyl-2 and Xyl-3 interact directly with CBM15. Xyl-3 interacts with the protein via a single hydrogen bond from O-5 to the side chain amide of Gln171, whereas O-3 of Xyl-2 makes a direct hydrogen bond with the side chain carbonyl of Gln171. In addition, the O-2 of Xyl-2 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain amides of Asn106 and Gln217. The glycosidic oxygen between Xyl-2 and Xyl-3 also makes an hydrogen bond to the side chain amide of Gln171. Other than the direct interactions at these two subsites, all other interactions between the protein and ligand are water-mediated, whereas those at the peripheral subsites make just a few water-mediated interactions through extensive solvent networks with the protein. The xylose unit in subsite 4 makes, in addition to its van der Waals' interaction with Trp181, a very complex set of solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds via its O-2 hydroxyl to side chains of Ser108, Gln167, Gln221, and Lys223. The enthalpic driving force for binding of the xylopentaose moiety may therefore come from a combination of beneficial hydrophobic stacking with Trp176and Trp181 coupled to a small number of direct hydrogen bonds in subsites 2 and 3. Other interactions appear to be solely mediated by ordered solvent molecules. The interactions between protein and ligand, either directly or via water, will contribute both to the favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy of binding. It is difficult, from the crystal structure, to explain the greater affinity of CBM15 for pentasaccharide and hexasaccharide substrates. It may be significant that the xylooligosaccharide chain is stabilized, as in xylan itself, by a series of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the O-3 of one sugar and the O-5 of the adjacent unit. In such a way a longer oligosaccharide could contribute to binding efficiency by maintaining the ligand in its preferred conformation. Another possibility is that longer ligands must harness binding energy from all subsites, whereas shorter ligands display statistical occupancy of many suboptimal binding modes with the overall effect that the apparent affinity is reduced. One of the key unresolved issues with respect to xylan-binding CBMs is how these proteins interact with highly decorated polysaccharides; in xylans the side chains are connected to the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls of the backbone xylose moieties. Inspection of the CBM15-xylohexaose complex provides the first glimpses of how these side chains are accommodated by these xylan-binding modules. A feature of the CBM15 interaction is a scarcity of direct hydrogen bonds to the protein. Indeed, it is only xylose moiety 2 that makes any direct hydrogen bonds to the protein from its exocyclic hydroxyls, and one would predict that this site alone would display an absolute requirement for an unsubstituted xylose moiety. In all other subsites the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls are located such that substituents would be displaced away from the binding cleft and could be accommodated with no obvious energetic penalty and may even make additional adventitious interactions with the protein. It is apparent, therefore, that the interaction of CBM15 with relatively few xylose moieties, coupled with the orientation of the ligand in the binding cleft explains how this protein is capable of binding to the decorated xylans that are present in plant cell walls. The orientation of the hydroxyl groups of the xylose moieties toward the solvent also provides an explanation for the lack of an extensive hydrogen network between the ligand and the CBM, in contrast to most carbohydrate protein interactions that have been described previously. Such promiscuity is certainly desirable when considering the substituted nature ligand. Futhermore, the absence of any obvious steric problems is accomodating the exocyclic C-6–O-6 substituents of glucose explain the relatively high affinity of CBM15 for other plant-derived polysaccharides such as β-glucan and cellohexaose. This paper presents the structure of a nonlectin-like CBM bound to a plant structural polysaccharide. The data show that xylopentaose adopts a 3-fold helical structure in the binding cleft of CBM15, consistent with the known structure of xylan as had been predicted earlier for other families of xylan-binding CBMs (5Simpson P.J. Bolam D.N. Cooper A. Ciruela A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. Structure. 1999; 7: 853-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,17Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabo L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It would be premature, however, to suggest that the conformation of all xylose polymers bound to CBMs need be conserved, and it is entirely possible that xylose-derived substrates adopt different conformations when interacting with CBMs in which the orientation of the surface aromatic amino acids is different to CBM2b and CBM15. The cunning accommodation of the O-2 and O-3 hydroxyls in most of the subsites provides the first explanation for the capacity of CBM15, and by analogy other xylan-binding CBMs, to bind to highly decorated xylans."

The interface of the free protease dimer is stabilized through interactions between the two subunits at the active site and at the termini (1Weber I.T. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protease catalyzes its own release from the Gag-Pol polyprotein in addition to the maturation of the virally encoded structural proteins and replication enzymes required for the assembly and production of viable virions (3Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the protease has served as one of the primary targets for the development of drugs against AIDS. Structure-based design of drugs targeted against the wild-type mature protease has aided in the development of several potent inhibitors that are specific for binding to the active site (4Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although several of these drugs are in clinical use and have curtailed the progression of the disease, the effectiveness of long-term treatment has been restricted due to naturally selected protease variants exhibiting lower affinity for the drugs than the wild-type enzyme. Various drug-resistant mutants of the protease have been identified (5Parikh U. Hammond J. Calef C. Larder B. Schinazi R. Mellors J.W. The 2000 HIV Sequence Compendium: Mutations in Retroviral Genes Associated with Drug Resistance.2000: 125-138(www.hiv.lanl.gov)Google Scholar). Different resistance mechanisms based on the observed structural changes in drug-resistant mutants have been proposed. In general, the mutants modulate structure and interactions within the active site as well as inter- and intrasubunit flexibility (6Rose R.B. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2607-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Erickson J.W. Gulnik S.V. Markowitz M. AIDS. 1999; 13: S189-S204PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mahalingam B. Louis J.M.

Because of the difficulty in designing active-site inhibitors that avoid the problem of drug resistance, the target region for drug development has been extended to areas in which no drug-selected mutations have occurred to date (9Shultz M.D. Chmielewski J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Zutshi R. Chmielewski J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 1901-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These regions are generally well conserved and critical to the structure and function of the protease. Sequence alignment of retroviral proteases shows that the most conserved regions correspond to (i) the active site (amino acids 22–34), (ii) the flap (amino acids 47–52), and (iii) amino acids 84–94 encompassing a single α-helix (11Rao J.K. Erickson J.W. Wlodawer A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4663-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the active-site triad Asp25-Thr26-Gly27 is common to all aspartic acid proteases, Gly86-Arg87-(Asn/Asp88) in the α-helix is unique to retroviral proteases (12Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and its structural significance is not fully understood. We showed in earlier studies that a conservative substitution of Arg87 with Lys results in total loss of proteolytic activity, although binding to pepstatin A, a well known inhibitor of aspartic acid proteases, is not curtailed (13Louis J.M. Wondrak E.M. Copeland T.D. Smith C.A. Mora P.T. Oroszlan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, detailed structural investigations of this mutant were not feasible earlier due to lack of an expression system for producing large amounts of this protein and limited knowledge of optimized conditions for studies by solution NMR. Although NMR solution studies of free wild-type PR are not possible due to rapid self-degradation, they have become feasible using a stabilized protease variant that carries the following five mutations, Q7K, L33I, and L63I to restrict self-degradation and C65A and C95A to avoid cysteine-thiol oxidation (14Ishima R. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This protease variant (termed PR herein) exhibits essentially the same kinetic parameters and stability as the wild-type protein (15Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of Arg87 for protease structure and function, we introduced the R87K mutation into PR (termed PRR87K). NMR and sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that PRR87K forms a semi-stable folded monomer in solution. Our results further suggest that the R87K mutation exerts an effect on dimer formation of the protease, interfering with the correct positioning of the C-terminal β-strands (residues 96–99) at the interface. The contribution of the terminal β-sheet to folding and dimer formation was systematically analyzed using proteins that lack either the N-terminal (PR-(5–99)) or C-terminal (PR-(1–95)) 4 residues or both (PR-(5–95)). The enzymatic activities of these mutant proteins are reported and compared with those of PR and wild-type PR. The R87K mutation and a stop codon were introduced into the PR template (which encodes the five mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A) (15Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to generate the PRR87K and PR-(1–95) constructs, respectively, using the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PR-(5–99) construct (15Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used to generate the PR-(5–95) clone using the same mutagenesis protocol and the primers used for creating PR-(1–95). The mutant proteases used in the study are listed in Fig.1. PR and its derived mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in LB or minimal medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride and/or [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources at 37 °C (16Yamazaki T.

All proteins were isolated using a common protocol, which comprises isolation of inclusion bodies followed by fractionation of the protease by size-exclusion and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Proteins (2–3 mg) at a concentration of ≤0.33 mg/ml in 35% acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid were folded by dialysis against 2 liters of 30 mm formic acid (pH 2.8) for 1.5 h, followed by dilution of the protein with a 5-fold excess of 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 6.0) to shift the pH to 4, either with or without a saturating amount of DMP323 (Ki < 10 nm) (17Lam P.Y.

Proteins were concentrated to achieve a final concentration of ∼0.4 mm for NMR analysis and to a concentration of ∼0.05 mm for sedimentation equilibrium studies and enzyme kinetics. Concentrations of PR and its mutants are expressed for a dimer, unless otherwise noted. Although the amount of DMP323 added is equivalent to a 5 mm final concentration, the actual concentration is unknown due to the poor solubility of DMP323 in aqueous buffers. Protease assays were initiated by mixing 5 μl of freshly folded PRR87K (59 μm) or PR-(1–95) (52 μm), 10 μl of 2× incubation buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.6) and 0.2m (buffer A) or 2 m (buffer B) NaCl), and 5 μl of 0.2 mm substrate. PR-(5–99) was assayed in buffer B at a final enzyme concentration of 1 μm. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of guanidine HCl to a final concentration of 6 m. The solution was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid, and an aliquot was injected onto a Nova-Pak C18reversed-phase chromatography column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters Associates, Inc., Milford, MD) using an automatic injector. Substrates and the cleavage products were separated using a water/acetonitrile gradient (0–100%) in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. PR-(5–99) was assayed using the substrates listed in Table I. Substrates corresponding to the cleavage sites CA/p2, p6pol/PR, PR/RT, RT/IN (for the oligopeptide sequences, see Table I), MA/CA (VSQNY↓PIVQ), and p2/NC (TATIM↓MQRG) were used to assay PRR87K and PR-(1–95).Table IKinetic parameters for PR and PR-(5–99) protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of Gag-Pol substratesCleavage siteSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1mm−1s−1PR0.021 ± 0.0040.89 ± 0.0342.4CA/p2KARVL↓AEAMSPR-(5–99)0.192 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.020.6PR-(5–99)<0.010.09NDp6pol/PRVSFNF↓PQITLPR-(5–99)<0.020.002NDPR0.044 ± 0.0081.72 ± 0.0839.1PR/RTCTLNF↓PISPPR-(5–99)0.087 ± 0.0140.05 ± 0.010.6PR0.032 ± 0.0060.41 ± 0.0212.8In RTAETF↓YVDGAAPR-(5–99)0.041 ± 0.010.008 ± 0.0010.2PR0.016 ± 0.0051.20 ± 0.0675.0RT/INIRKIL↓FLDGPR-(5–99)0.046 ± 0.0060.08 ± 0.011.7Assays were performed in 250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 2 m NaCl at 37 °C in a final enzyme concentration of 0.01–0.1 μm PR and 1 μm PR-(5–99).

MA, CA, NC, RT, and IN denote matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid, reverse transcriptase, and integrase proteins, respectively. The mutant enzymes PRR87K and PR-(1–95) were also assayed using a spectrophotometric substrate, Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-(4-nitrophenylalanine)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2, in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at 25 °C in a final concentration of 0.96 μm PR-(1–95) or 2.9 μm PRR87K and 460 μm substrate as described previously (15Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for PR-(5–99)-catalyzed hydrolysis of the identical spectrophotometric substrate were reported previously (15Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 20 °C using four different rotor speeds (10,000, 12,000, 14,000, and 30,000 rpm) on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Data were acquired as an average of eight absorbance measurements at a nominal wavelength of 280 nm and a radial spacing of 0.001 cm. Equilibrium was achieved within 24 h. Protein samples (PR, PR-(1–95), PR-(5–99), and PRR87K), in the absence or presence of an ∼10-fold excess of the potent inhibitor DMP323 over the enzyme concentration, were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.8) and loaded into the ultracentrifuge cells at nominal loading concentrations of 0.80A280 units. Data were analyzed in terms of a single ideal solute by fitting to the following equation: Ar =Ao,r·exp(HM(r2− r2o)) + E, whereAo,r is the absorbance of the solute at a reference radius (ro) andAr is the absorbance at a given radial position (r). H represents ω2/2RT, where ω is the angular speed in radians/s, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The value of M represents the experimentally returned value of the buoyant molecular mass,M(1 − vρ). E is a small base-line correction determined experimentally at 30,000 rpm. Values for the experimental molecular mass were determined using tabulated values for the density (ρ), whereas the partial specific volume (v) was calculated based on the amino acid composition using the consensus data for the partial specific molar volumes of amino acids published by Perkins (18Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This value was corrected to account for the isotopic composition of the proteins studied. For PRR87K, PR-(1–95), and PR-(5–99), uniformly15N-labeled proteins were used; and for PR, 10%13C-labeled and uniformly 15N-labeled proteins were used. NMR experiments were carried out using protein concentrations of 0.4–0.5 mm in 20 mmphosphate buffer in 95% H2O and 5% D2O and a sample volume of ∼280 μl in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi, Inc., Allison Park, PA). NMR spectra were acquired on a DMX500 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA). All experiments were conducted at 20 °C unless noted otherwise. Data were processed and analyzed using nmrPipe, nmrDraw, and PIPP software (19Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Backbone signal assignments of PR and PRR87K, in the presence and absence of DMP323, were made using HNCA and CBCA(CO)NH experiments (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar, 22Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional experiments for the assignment of free PRR87K were carried out at pH 4.5 to slow aggregation of the sample. 15N longitudinal relaxation times (T1), 15N transverse relaxation times (T2), and15N-{H} NOEs for free PRR87K were measured in an interleaved manner (23Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with repetition delays of 2 s for T1 and T2determination and 3 s for NOE determination. Relaxation delays were 0.0016, 0.16, 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.8, and 0.96 s forT1 measurements and 6, 12, 24, 42, 60, 84, and 96 ms for T2 measurements. Diffusion experiments were carried out in D2O phosphate buffer using bipolar gradient pulses in a longitudinal-eddy-current delay pulse sequence (24Wu D.H. Chen A.D. Johnson C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 115: 260-264Crossref Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) for PRR87K, with and without DMP323, and for ubiquitin. PR folds from a denatured state into an enzymatically active stable dimer similar to wild-type PR when dialyzed from pH 2.8 to 4.2–5.8. The 1H-15N correlation spectrum recorded on a freshly prepared sample of PRR87K, folded under identical conditions as PR, displayed a set of well dispersed signals, indicating a folded conformation of the protein (Fig.2a). However, in contrast with PR, PRR87K aggregated at a concentration of 0.4 mm, resulting in an ∼50% loss in signal intensity within 1 day. The addition of the potent inhibitor DMP323 to PRR87K resulted in two sets of signals (Fig.2b), with the minor set belonging to free PRR87K. The C-α chemical shifts of the major set for PRR87K in the presence of DMP323 (Fig.3b) were nearly identical to those of the PR-DMP323 complex, suggesting that both dimer complexes exhibit very similar structures.Figure 3Differences in backbone C-α chemical shifts between PR and PRR87K in the absence (a) and presence (b) of DMP323 together with the secondary structure of PR. The single α-helix and the β-strands are depicted as a coil and white arrows, respectively. Residue 51, whose C-α was not assigned due to broadening of the signal in PRR87K, is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even in the absence of DMP323, the overall backbone C-α chemical shifts of PRR87K residues were similar to those of PR (Fig.3a). However, unlike the DMP323-bound forms of PR and PRR87K, significant differences in the chemical shifts of the free forms of PR and PRR87K were noted for residues at the dimer interface, i.e. near the active site (residues 24–29) and the N- and C-terminal regions (residues 1–10 and 90–99, respectively). In particular, the peaks for Ile3, Gln92, Ile93, Gly94, and Ala95 that significantly shifted in the dimer due to intermonomer and not DMP323 interaction were not observed in the corresponding positions in the free PRR87K spectrum (Figs.2a and 3a). Since Arg87 is located far from the N- and C-terminal residues (>15 Å), the observed chemical shift differences between PRR87K and PR corresponding to the terminal residues were not caused by changes in the local magnetic environment upon mutation, but rather by the structural changes of the protein. Overall, the similarity in chemical shifts for uncomplexed free PRR87K and PR, except for the dimer interface regions, suggests that the fold of PRR87Kis similar to that of PR. The dynamics of PRR87K in the absence of DMP323 were probed by carrying out 15N relaxation experiments (see Fig. 5). For the most part, the T1 and T2values of PRR87K were quite uniform (0.5–0.6 s and 90–100 ms, respectively), although different from those of PR (0.7–0.9 s and 60–70 ms, respectively). 2Freedburg, D. I., Ishima, R., Jocob, J., Wang, Y.-X., Kustanovich, I., Louis, J. M., and Torchia, D. A. (2001)Protein Sci., in press. The rotational correlation time estimated from theT1/T2 ratios was ∼7.5 ns. This correlation time is significantly smaller than that observed for PR (12.9 ns) under similar conditions (0.3 mm protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.8) at 20 °C) (14Ishima R. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) despite the noted tendency of PRR87K to aggregate. Using an NMR approach (24Wu D.H. Chen A.D. Johnson C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 115: 260-264Crossref Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), we determined the relative translational diffusion coefficient of PRR87K to be 1.5 × 10−10m2/s. This value lies between those measured for the PR-DMP323 complex (1.0 × 10−10 m2/s) and ubiquitin (2.1 × 10−10 m2/s), proteins with molecular masses of 22 and 8.5 kDa, respectively. This suggests that PRR87K has a mass close to that expected for the protease monomer (Fig. 4c). Sedimentation equilibrium data for the PRR87K mutant confirmed the monomeric state. The data fit well to a single solute model with a molecular mass equal to that of the monomer (Table II). All of the above results together suggest that PRR87K is a folded monomer in solution. The tendency for the PRR87K monomer to aggregate at a concentration of ∼0.5 mm suggests that it is less stable, unlike dimeric PR, which exhibits a stable fold and does not aggregate even at 1 mm.Figure 4Ribbon representations of the structure of mature HIV-1 protease (a), the terminal β-sheet interface (b), regions that exhibit pico/nanosecond time scale motions (NOE < 0.5) in the PRR87K monomer (shown in green) (c), and details of the structure surrounding Arg87 (d).

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the 15N relaxation experiments revealed significant motions on the subnanosecond time scale for both N- and C-terminal residues 2–10 and 93–99, respectively; the elbow residues 37–42, and the flap residues 48–53 in PRR87K as shown by the elevated T1 and T2values and reduced NOE values (Fig. 5). Although the mobilities of the flap and elbow regions have been shown for free PR, increased motion of the termini had not been observed (25Todd M.J. Semo N. Freire E. J. Mol.

Inspection of a model of monomeric protease (Fig. 4c) revealed that the areas identified as mobile correspond to solvent-exposed regions, assuming that the monomeric structure remains essentially identical to a single subunit of the dimer. Analysis of protease crystal structures revealed that the N-terminal (residues 1–4) and C-terminal (residues 96–99) residues contribute ∼50% of the dimer interface, critical for PR stability (1Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is organized such that the two C-terminal β-strands are sandwiched between the two N-terminal β-strands at the bottom of the protease structure (Fig.4b). The highly conserved Arg87 residue, residing on the sole α-helix (residues 87–91), forms a hydrogen bond with Asp29, a residue that is located near the active site (Fig. 4d) (27Wlodawer A. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Baldwin E. Weber I.T. Selk L.M. Clawson L. Schneider J. Kent S.B. Science. 1989; 245: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). In PRR87K, chemical shift perturbations and subnanosecond motions detected for the N-terminal residues of the α-helix increased further in the C-terminal β-strand. Taking into account the above NMR results together with information from crystal structures, we propose that disruption of the specific interactions involving the Arg87side chain could destabilize the terminal β-sheet and induce enhanced mobility at the dimer interface. As shown above, inhibitor DMP323 binding could induce dimerization of PRR87K, although a small fraction of the PRR87Kmonomer was still present as evidenced by the HSQC spectrum (Fig.2b). Since DMP323 has very poor solubility in aqueous buffers (see “Experimental Procedures”), complete saturation of PRR87K with inhibitor could not be achieved. The above result is consistent with the monomer/dimer-DMP323 complex ratio determined by sedimentation equilibrium studies (Table II). Under the same conditions of inhibitor saturation, we never observed free PR, indicating that the affinity of DMP323 for PR has to be significantly higher. It has been shown that the highly hydrophobic DMP323 interacts tightly with the methyl groups of aliphatic residues that line the substrate-binding pocket (28Ala P.J. Huston E.E. Klabe R.M. McCabe D.D. Duke J.L. Rizzo C.J. Korant B.D. DeLoskey R.J. Lam P.Y. Hodge C.N. Chang C.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This binding site is composed of residues residing in both monomeric subunits; thus, binding of DMP323 would favor the dimer over the monomer structure, i.e.binding induces dimerization. Indeed, DMP323 could be viewed as a staple keeping the monomers together, the molecular interactions alone of which are not sufficient for this purpose, as in the case of the PRR87K mutant. However, substrates are not expected to stabilize the PRR87K dimer to the same extent as DMP323, as the binding af"
https://openalex.org/W2027966370,"There is convincing evidence from studies in yeast that a functional ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is required to degrade misfolded or oxidatively damaged proteins but for technical reasons, it has been difficult to perform comparable studies in mammalian cells. To investigate the possibility that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is cytoprotective for mammalian cells, we have introduced epitope-tagged wild-type ubiquitin or dominant-negative mutant versions of ubiquitin into mouse HT4 neuroblastoma cells. Cells expressing mutant versions of ubiquitin were found to be sensitive to cadmium, an agent that causes oxidative damage to cellular components, and to canavanine, an amino acid analog that generates misfolded proteins. The greatest sensitivity to canavanine was observed in cells expressing a mutant version of ubiquitin unable to support the formation of Lys48 linkages. Substrates of the proteasome were found to accumulate in these cells, suggesting a general deficit in proteolysis. Our data suggest that defects in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic system predispose mammalian cells to the toxic effects of abnormal protein."

Recent evidence suggests that the full stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin also requires activation of GLUT4, possibly via a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-dependent pathway. Here we used L6 myotubes expressing Myc-tagged GLUT4 to examine at what level the signals regulating GLUT4 translocation and activation bifurcate. We compared the sensitivity of each process, as well as of signals leading to GLUT4 translocation (Akt and atypical protein kinase C) to PI 3-kinase inhibition. Wortmannin inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake with an IC50 of 3 nm. In contrast, GLUT4myc appearance at the cell surface was less sensitive to inhibition (IC50 = 43 nm). This dissociation between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4myc translocation was not observed with LY294002 (IC50 = 8 and 10 μm, respectively). The sensitivity of insulin-stimulated activation of PKCζ/λ, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 to wortmannin (IC50 = 24, 30, 35, and 60 nm, respectively) correlated closely with inhibition of GLUT4 translocation. In contrast, insulin-dependent p38 MAPK phosphorylation was efficiently reduced in cells pretreated with wortmannin, with an IC50of 7 nm. Insulin-dependent p38α and p38β MAPK activities were also markedly reduced by wortmannin (IC50 = 6 and 2 nm, respectively). LY294002 or transient expression of a dominant inhibitory PI 3-kinase construct (Δp85), however, did not affect p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These results uncover a striking correlation between PI 3-kinase, Akt, PKCζ/λ, and GLUT4 translocation on one hand and their segregation from glucose uptake and p38 MAPK activation on the other, based on their wortmannin sensitivity. We propose that a distinct, high affinity target of wortmannin, other than PI 3-kinase, may be necessary for activation of p38 MAPK and GLUT4 in response to insulin.

This disparity between the magnitude of GLUT4 translocation and the stimulation of glucose uptake has been observed in mature skeletal muscle (2Hansen P.A. Wang W. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O.

Recently, we developed a muscle cell line overexpressing GLUT4 fused to a Myc epitope that becomes exposed at the cell surface, allowing for the detection of GLUT4 translocation in intact cells (11Wang Q.

Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this system, we reported that GLUT4 translocation precedes the stimulation of glucose uptake by at least 2 min (13Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified conditions in which insulin-dependent stimulation of glucose uptake can be reduced in the face of intact GLUT4 translocation (9Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T.

These conditions include diverse inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) (9Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4806-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Conversely, other studies have shown that glucose uptake can be augmented in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by insulin, while GLUT4 translocation is completely inhibited (16Van Epps-Fung M. Gupta K. Hardy R.W. Wells A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5170-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, protein synthesis inhibitors elevate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without any significant gain in cell surface GLUT4 content (17Harrison S.A. Clancy B.M. Pessino A. Czech M.P. J.

Taken together, these studies have suggested that at least two events culminate in the stimulation of glucose uptake: translocation and activation of GLUT4. We have further proposed that p38 MAPK may be an integral component of the signaling pathway regulating GLUT4 activity (9Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol.

It is well established that the activity of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol (PI)1kinase is necessary for GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in muscle and fat tissues and cells, based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors (20Lund S.

Two downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase, the serine/threonine kinases Akt and atypical protein kinase C, appear to relay the signals required for GLUT4 translocation (28Hill M.M. Clark S.F.

It was recently demonstrated that glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was reduced by concentrations of wortmannin that do not affect GLUT4 translocation (10Hausdorff S.F. Fingar D.C. Morioka K. Garza L.A. Whiteman E.L. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24677-24684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of where the signals regulating GLUT4 translocation and activation bifurcate. Answering this question was the objective of the present study. Using L6 myotubes expressing GLUT4myc, we determined the sensitivity of glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, and the signals thought to regulate these two parameters to wortmannin and LY294002. Strikingly, we found that very low concentrations of wortmannin, but not LY294002 or dominant negative PI 3-kinase (Δp85), prevented p38α and p38β MAPK activation by insulin. The stimulation of glucose uptake was also exquisitely susceptible to inhibition by wortmannin. In contrast, inhibition of Akt or PKCζ/λ activity by LY294002 and/or wortmannin correlated more closely with GLUT4 translocation. Activating transcription factor 2 fusion protein, phosphospecific antibodies to Akt (Thr308 or Ser473), and p38 MAPK (Thr180 and Tyr182) monoclonal phosphospecific anti-p38 MAPK antibody conjugated to agarose beads and antibodies to p38α MAPK (used to measured kinase activity) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to Akt1 (D-17), phosphotyrosine (PY99), p38α and p38β MAPK, c-Myc (9E10), and PKCζ/λ (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Akt2, Akt3, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, Crosstide (9-amino acid Akt substrate derived from GSK-3), and myelin basic protein were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was obtained from Sigma. GLUT4myc cDNA was constructed by inserting the human c-Myc epitope (14 amino acids) into the first ectodomain of GLUT4 and subcloned into the pCXN2 vector (31Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was stably transfected into L6 myoblasts (32Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were maintained in minimal essential medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Myoblasts were differentiated in medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. Glucose uptake and GLUT4myc translocation were determined in cells grown in 24-well plates (1-cm diameter). Cells were grown in 6- and 12-well (2.5-cm diameter) plates for determination of kinase activities and protein phosphorylation, respectively. Cells were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well on glass coverslips for immunofluorescence. Transfection was performed according to the Effectene product manual (Qiagen) and is described in detail elsewhere (25Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The construct pSG5p85αΔSH2, referred to as Δp85, the dominant negative mutant of type I PI 3-kinase (33Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Julian Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, United Kingdom). The cDNA insert was subcloned into pcDNA3, and 0.45 μg was cotransfected with 0.45 μg of pEGFP into L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts. Cells were deprived of serum for 4 h prior to all experimental manipulations. Inhibitors were administered in Me2SO, and the maximum concentration of the vehicle did not exceed 0.05% (v/v). This concentration of the vehicle was without effect on any of the parameters measured. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described (34Somwar R. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Clin. Ther. 1998; 20: 125-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After all stimulation and incubations with wortmannin, LY294002 (20-min pretreatment), and 100 nm insulin (20 min), cell monolayers were washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-Na, 2.5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated for 5 min in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 μm 2-deoxyglucose (1 μCi/ml). Uptake was terminated by washing three times with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B and was subtracted from all values. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by lysing the cells with 0.05 n NaOH, followed by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular protein was determined by the Bradford method. GLUT4myc levels at the cell surface was measured by an antibody-coupled colorimetric assay as described (11Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were washed once with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for 3 min at room temperature, and then neutralized with 1% (w/v) glycine in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell monolayers were blocked with 10% goat serum and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C for at least 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, 1:100) for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, 4 °C). Secondary antibody was washed away, and 1 ml of OPD reagent (0.4 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.4 mg/ml urea hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m phosphate-citrate buffer) was added to each well for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 ml of 3 m HCl. Optical absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 492 nm. Lysates were prepared as described previously with modifications (35Lee-Kwon W. Park D. Baskar P.V. Kole S. Bernier M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15747-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with wortmannin or LY294002 for 20 min prior to insulin treatment for 10 min in the continued presence of the drugs. Following all appropriate incubations, cells were lysed on ice with 150 μm 2× Laemmli sample buffer per well supplemented with 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 1 mmNa2VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid, and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm leupeptin). Lysates were passed five times through a 25-gauge syringe and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. 50 μg of total protein was resolved by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE to detect phosphorylation of Akt and p38 MAPK, respectively, using phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphospecific primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Anti-p38 MAPK antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibody at a 1:15,000 dilution. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were exposed to x-ray film to produce bands within the linear range and then quantitated using the National Institutes of Health software, NIH Image. PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-IRS-1 or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was determined as previously described (36Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 300 μg of total cellular protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with 2 μg of anti-IRS-1 or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with LY294002 or wortmannin for 5 min prior to the initiation of kinase assay and were kept in the presence of the drugs for the duration of the assay. Lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using Silica gel 60 TLC plates that were pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate. Detection and quantitation of [32P]PI 3-phosphate on TLC plates was accomplished using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system (Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitation of Akt isoforms and PKCλ/ζ andin vitro kinase assays were performed as previously described (25Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells grown in six-well plates were treated with wortmannin for 30 min, and insulin was added during the final 10 min of this incubation. The cells were lysed, and 200 μg of total cellular protein was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with 2 μg of antibody that was adsorbed to a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose beads. Crosstide (150 μm per assay) and myelin basic protein (5 μg per assay) were used as Akt and PKC substrates, respectively. Nonspecific activity, determined as activity associated with an irrelevant IgG, was subtracted from all values. Protein kinase activity was measured as described (9Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T.

Anti-p38α MAPK (rabbit polyclonal) or anti-p38β MAPK (goat polyclonal) antibodies (2 μg/condition) were adsorbed to protein A- or G-Sepharose beads, respectively, by incubating for 2 h at 4 °C. Preadsorbed beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and once with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa2VO4, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm leupeptin). Lysates were vortexed for 1 min, passed five times through a 25-gauge syringe, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g(4 °C). Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated by incubating 250 μg of total protein for 2–3 h with the preadsorbed Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were isolated and washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), and 1m NaCl) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na2VO4 and 10 nm okadaic acid) and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mmMgCl2 supplemented with 1 mmNa2VO4, and 10 nm okadaic acid. Immunocomplexes were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 2 μg activating transcription factor 2, 150 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per condition) on a platform shaker. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min (12,000 × g), and then 40 μl of the supernatant was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The amount of radiolabeled phosphate transferred onto the substrate was determined by exposing the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to a PhosphorImager cassette and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Equal protein loading was confirmed by immunoblotting the polyvinylidene difluoride for the respective p38 MAPK isoform following quantitation. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in single cells was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal phosphospecific antibody that recognizes p38 MAPK when phosphorylated on Tyr182 (1:200 dilution). Indirect immunofluorescence was measured as described previously (25Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). GLUT4myc at the cell surface was detected in unpermeablized cells using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10; 2 μg/ml). Transfected cells were identified by expression of green fluorescent protein. Secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse) was used in a 1:1000 dilution. We first determined if there was a differential sensitivity of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to wortmannin in muscle cells in culture. To accurately and quantitatively detect GLUT4 molecules that are fully inserted into the plasma membrane of intact cells, we used L6 muscle cells stably expressing GLUT4 tagged with an exofacial Myc epitope (L6-GLUT4myc cells). By incubating the monolayer of intact cells with an anti-Myc antibody, we were able to quantitate the change in cell surface GLUT4 without the need for subcellular fractionation. L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of wortmannin for 20 min, prior to insulin stimulation for an additional 20 min, in the continued presence of the drug. The relative amount of GLUT4myc at the cell surface and 2-deoxyglucose uptake are shown in Fig. 1 A. Insulin increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 2.3-fold (basal, 8.2 ± 0.4; insulin, 18.6 ± 1.2 pmol/min/mg of protein) and GLUT4myc at the cell surface by 2.4 ± 0.1-fold. Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake or GLUT4myc translocation in the absence of wortmannin is expressed as 100% in Fig. 1 A. Wortmannin treatment abolished the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin with an IC50 of 3 nm. In contrast to the stimulation of glucose uptake, the gain in GLUT4myc at the plasma membrane was less sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin (IC50 = 43, Fig.1 A). Translocation of GLUT4 was unaffected by concentrations of wortmannin that reduced glucose uptake by more than 60%. These results suggest that GLUT4 activity and GLUT4 translocation are regulated by signaling pathways with high and low sensitivities to wortmannin, respectively. LY294002 is a PI 3-kinase inhibitor that acts by binding within the ATP binding pocket of the enzyme (37Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the translocation and activation of GLUT4 are mediated by PI 3-kinases with different affinities for wortmannin, then these two phenomena might also display different sensitivities to LY294002. Cell surface GLUT4myc levels and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were determined in cells that were treated for 20 min with LY294002 prior to insulin treatment. The results illustrated in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that both insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation were inhibited by LY294002 with superimposable dose dependences. The calculated IC50 values for inhibition of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by LY294002 were 8 and 10 μm, respectively (see Table I). Interestingly, 50 μm LY294002 inhibited GLUT4 translocation completely but reduced glucose uptake by only 70%, whereas wortmannin fully inhibited both insulin responses.Table IIC 50 values for the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, GLUT4myc translocation, and kinase activities by wortmanning and LY294002WortmanninLY294002nmμm2-Deoxyglucose uptake38GLUT4myc tránslocation4310PI 3-kinase activity IRS-1-associated0.3 (in vitro)0.9 (in vitro) Tyr(P)-associated0.5 (in vitro)0.7 (in vitro)Akt Akt phosphorylation (Thr308)2914 Akt phosphorylation (Ser473)2518 Akt1 kinase activity35ND Akt2 kinase activity30ND Akt3 kinase activity60ND PKCζ/λ kinase activity24NDp38 MAPK p38 MAPK phosphorylation7Small reduction, only at >25 μm p38α MAPK activity6ND p38β MAPK activity2NDThese values were calculated from the data presented under “Results” and in Figs.

PI 3-kinase activity associated with these immunoprecipitates was measured in the presence of wortmannin or LY294002, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 2. Insulin increased IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity by 13 ± 2-fold. This PI 3-kinase activity was inhibited in vitro by wortmannin (Fig. 2 A) and LY294002 (Fig. 2 C) with IC50 values of 0.3 nm and 0.9 μm, respectively (Table I). PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was increased 24 ± 3-fold by insulin treatment. This activity was also inhibited in vitro by wortmannin (Fig. 2 B) and LY294002 (Fig.2 D) with IC50 values of 0.5 nm and 0.7 μm, respectively (Table I). We next performed a detailed analysis of the effect of wortmannin and LY294002 on the signals leading to GLUT4 transloca"

The adaptor complexes interact with sorting signals in the cytosolic domains of membrane proteins as well as structural components of the coat (clathrin for AP-1 and AP-2), thereby gathering appropriate cargo into the budding vesicle (1Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins mediate the fusion of these vesicles with acceptor membranes. This is achieved through interactions between vesicle-associated SNAREs (v-SNAREs or VAMPs) and SNAREs associated with target membranes (t-SNAREs or syntaxins) (2Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A combination of cargo selection and targeted fusion would provide selectivity to vesicular transport, thus it is important that both systems function together. Adaptor complexes may interact with or be involved in the trafficking of SNAREs, it is still not known whether there are direct interactions between these molecules (3Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 4Darsow T. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such an interaction has been proposed from the analysis of SNARE protein sequences, because several of the syntaxins (syntaxins 4, 6, 7, and 13) contain di-leucine or tyrosine-based motifs that have been shown in other membrane proteins to directly interact with adaptor complexes (6Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that VAMPs may interact with adaptor complexes (7Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Steegmaier M. Klumperman J. Foletti D.L. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol.

However, only VAMP4 and VAMP7 contain recognizable di-leucine motifs, suggesting that alternative or additional motifs may regulate adaptor binding to SNAREs or cargo molecules. In this study, we show that VAMP4 is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles, AP-1 specifically binds to VAMP4, and this binding is dependent on the di-leucine motif of VAMP4. Transfection of cells with VAMP4 constructs lacking the di-leucine motif results in the mislocalization of VAMP4 into peripheral structures, which overlap with AP-1. γ-Adaptin hinge in pGEX3X and δ-adaptin in pBluescript were generous gifts from Dr. Margaret S.

PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed as directed in the Stratagene manual. Anti-γ-adaptin hinge (amino acids 596–702) and δ-adaptin hinge (amino acids 608–800) polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins.

NRK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. NRK cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as previously described (17Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) using 10–15 μg of VAMP4-GFP DNA. After electroporation, the cells were plated onto multiwell microscope slides and allowed to recover overnight. The next day the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 h before paraformaldehyde or methanol fixation. Fixation and antibody staining were performed as described previously (14Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The cells were viewed using an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) fitted with a Micro Max CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Images for quantification were captured using a MultiProbe 2010 laser confocal imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) set at 30% laser power for each channel. Micrographs were quantified using the Molecular Dynamics software. The percentage overlap with the TGN was determined by measuring the intensity of signal in the TGN (identified using anti-TGN38 antibody) versus the rest of the cell. Rat brain detergent extract was prepared by homogenizing 4–5 rat brains in 12 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. 10 μg of recombinant SNARE or GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (100 μl of 50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C. The washed beads were incubated with extract for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed five times using the extraction buffer before being boiled for 5 min in sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted overnight. The blots were probed with various antibodies. If SNARE proteins interact with AP-1 or AP-2 adaptor complexes, they should be present in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV). Therefore, we purified CCV from rat liver and Western blotted them with antibodies against several SNAREs. The purification of rat liver CCV was successful, because there was a significant enrichment of clathrin and adaptors compared with the starting material microsomes (Fig. 1,A and B). Fig. 1B shows that post-Golgi SNAREs syntaxins 6, 8, and 13 and VAMPs 4 and 7 were enriched in the CCV, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate compartment SNAREs syntaxin 17 and msec22 were not. This data indicate that post-Golgi SNAREs are present in adaptor-coated vesicles, but it does not allow us to determine whether or not the SNAREs directly interact with the adaptors. In addition, it is not clear whether VAMP7 would only interact with AP-2 or whether it would also interact with AP-1. To overcome this limitation, an in vitro binding assay was established. SNAREs fused to GST were bound to glutathione beads, incubated with rat brain extracts, and washed to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with adaptor-specific antibodies. Fig.2A shows an example of one of these experiments. Under these conditions, AP-1 bound specifically to VAMP4. No adaptor binding was detected with the other SNAREs. Similar experiments with syntaxins 6 and 13 also showed no adaptor binding, despite their enrichment in CCV (data not shown). An analysis of the VAMP4 protein sequence revealed that VAMP4 has a di-leucine motif, which might mediate the binding of AP-1 (Fig. 2B). To ascertain whether this sequence is required, site-directed mutagenisis was performed on the GST-VAMP4 construct, and the mutated fusion proteins were used in binding experiments (Fig. 2C). The mutation of the acidic residue (Glu-21) or the di-leucine (Leu-25) to alanine resulted in the complete inhibition of AP-1 binding to VAMP4. The mutation of a leucine residue further downstream (Leu-38) had no effect on AP-1 binding (data not shown). These data indicate that the upstream acidic residue and the di-leucine motif of VAMP4 are required for AP-1 binding in vitro. To determine the role of AP-1 binding in the trafficking of VAMP4, cells were transiently transfected with wild type VAMP4-GFP, VAMP4-(E21A)-GFP, VAMP4-(L25A)-GFP, and immunostained for TGN38 (Fig. 3). The steady state distribution of wild type VAMP4-GFP was compared with cells stained with a VAMP4 antibody to check that the construct was localized correctly (Fig. 3, panels A–F). Cells expressing low to moderate levels of wild type VAMP4-GFP gave a similar staining pattern to that of endogenous VAMP4. Both VAMP4 (endogenous) and wild type VAMP4-GFP showed a high level of colocalization with the TGN marker TGN38. The mutant constructs VAMP4-(E21A)-GFP and VAMP4-(L25A)-GFP overlapped with TGN38 but were also found in peripheral structures. Interestingly, the overexpression of wild type VAMP4-GFP also gave a similar staining pattern to that observed with the mutants (data not shown). Cells such as those displayed in Fig. 3 were imaged at constant exposure time to allow quantification of the overlap between TGN38 and the various VAMP4 constructs (Fig. 4). This revealed that wild type VAMP4-GFP is tightly localized to the TGN (99% overlap with TGN), whereas VAMP4-(E21A)-GFP and VAMP4-(L25A)-GFP are not so tightly restricted to the TGN when expressed at equivalent levels to the wild type construct (E21A 78% and L25A 59% overlap with TGN) (*, p = 0.0187 and **, p = 0.000175). In cells expressing low levels of the E21A mutant, there was significant overlap with the TGN (see Fig. 3, panel G–I), suggesting that this mutant only partially inhibits adaptor bindingin vivo. In contrast, the mislocalization of the L25A mutant was independent of expression level (all L25A cells analyzed showed mislocalization). Stable cell lines were also generated with these constructs and gave similar results (data not shown). These results indicate that AP-1 binding is important for the steady state distribution of VAMP4.Figure 4Quantification of VAMP4 constructs localization. NRK cells were either stained for VAMP4 and TGN38 or transiently transfected with VAMP4-GFP(wt), VAMP4-GFP(EA), and VAMP4-GFP(LA) constructs and stained for TGN38 (see Fig. 3 for examples of the various construct localizations). Images to be quantified were analyzed using Molecular Dynamics software. The intensity of fluorescence at the TGN (determined by TGN38 staining) was measured and compared with the signal measured for the whole cell (any background or endoplasmic reticulum staining was subtracted from the images before analysis). Quantification of the micrographs indicates that wild-type VAMP4 is predominantly localized to the TGN (99% overlap with TGN38). However the overlap is greatly reduced in the mutants (E21A 78% and L25A 59% overlap with TGN38), and in some cases the majority of the labeling is in the periphery of the cell (the data points are the mean of eight randomly imaged transfected cells ± S.D. *,p = 0.0187; **, p = 0.000175.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the nature of the peripheral structures in which VAMP4-GFP mutants accumulate, transfected cells were stained for several post-Golgi markers (transferrin receptor, EEA1, and AP-1). The peripheral structures did not overlap with the transferrin receptor or early endosome antigen 1 (data not shown). Wild type VAMP-GFP colocalized with AP-1 only at the TGN (Fig.5, panels A–C), but the VAMP4-GFP mutants also partially colocalized with AP-1 in the periphery of the cell (Fig. 5, panels D–I). To determine which SNAREs interact with which adaptor complexes, CCVs were purified and probed with anti-SNARE antibodies. As expected, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated SNAREs syntaxin 17 and msec22 were not enriched in CCV but rather were depleted. However, the post-Golgi SNAREs syntaxins 6, 8, 13, VAMPs 4, and VAMP7 were all enriched. Syntaxin 6, syntaxin 13, and VAMP4 have previously been localized to CCV by electron microscopy (3Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 5Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Steegmaier M. Klumperman J. Foletti D.L. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1957-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), in agreement with this data. However, anti-syntaxin 8 and VAMP7 antibodies did not significantly label CCV by electron microscopy (7Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Prekeris R. Yang B. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3891-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this difference, the most likely being that there are small amounts of syntaxin 8 and VAMP7 cycle via the plasma membrane and are therefore enriched in AP-2 vesicles, although below detectable levels by electron microscopy. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the trafficking of syntaxin 8 or VAMP7 may be slightly different in a rat liver compared with tissue culture cells. To determine the specificity of adaptor-SNARE interactions, an in vitro binding assay was established. Under the conditions used, AP-1 binds specifically to VAMP4 in a di-leucine-dependent manner. It was surprising that no other adaptor complex binding to SNAREs was observed, because VAMP2, VAMP7, VAMP8, syntaxin 6, and syntaxin 13 are all present in CCV. However, the conditions used in these binding experiments were very stringent (i.e. 0.5% Triton X-100). Because the affinity of adaptor complexes for potential cargo molecules was previously shown to be very weak in vitro, some binding may not have been detected in our experiments (18Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Yet the fact that no other SNARE-adaptor binding was detected emphasizes the significance of the AP-1-VAMP4 interaction. It has yet to be determined whether AP-1 interacts directly with VAMP4 or whether other factors are required. Further analysis of the protein sequence of VAMP4 revealed an acidic patch just following the di-leucine motif20SERRNLLEDDSDEEEDFFLRG40(the di-leucine motif is underlined). This type of patch is present in several molecules that cycle between the TGN and endosomes (e.g. furin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor) (19Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Similar sequences in furin and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor have been shown to bind PACS (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein), a protein that is thought to be involved in the retrieval of these molecules from endosomes (19Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the binding of PACS enhances the binding of AP-1 to the tail of furin (19Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that PACS might be involved in the binding of AP-1 to VAMP4. No significant PACS binding was observed in our experiments (data not shown). However, this observation does not rule out that PACS is involved in the trafficking of VAMP4, only that it is not involved in the AP-1 binding seen in our assay. Recently, three studies have indicated that GGAs (Golgi-associated, γ-adaptin homologous, ADP-ribosylation factor-interacting proteins) can also bind acidic patches in sortilin and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (20Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 21Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J.

Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). GGAs have been proposed to link cargo molecules to the budding machinery via their interaction with ARF and clathrin (23Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that GGAs might bind to VAMP4, which would ensure that this SNARE would be packaged into the newly budding vesicles at the TGN. VAMP4 is predominantly localized to the TGN with a notable portion found in endosomes. This labeling would suggest that VAMP4 cycles between the TGN and endosomes (8Steegmaier M. Klumperman J. Foletti D.L. Yoo J.S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1957-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The mutation of the acidic residue (Glu-21) or the di-leucine (Leu-25) motif in VAMP4 affects its steady state distribution with a large proportion of VAMP4 being found in peripheral structures in addition to the normal TGN staining. It is not clear why the Glu-21 mutation only gives a partial phenotype in vivo yet completely inhibits the binding of AP-1 in vitro. The most probable explanation is that the binding of AP-1 to VAMP4 in vivo is much stronger than the observed in vitro binding. Introducing the Glu-21 mutation reduces the affinity just enough so that no binding is detected in vitro, yet reduced binding could still be possible within the cell, resulting in a partial phenotype. Whereas the precise nature of these peripheral structures is still to be elucidated, a significant proportion of them colocalized with peripheral AP-1 staining. It is tempting to speculate that the mutation of the di-leucine motif affects the retrieval of VAMP4 from a subset of peripheral endosomes by AP-1, resulting in VAMP4 accumulation in these peripheral structures. Similar peripheral structures were also observed in cells overexpressing wild type VAMP4-GFP, probably because of the saturation of the trafficking machinery. We do not know whether accumulation of VAMP4 in these structures is because of an increase in forward transport or a decrease in cycling back to the TGN. Interestingly, a study has shown that in cells generated from AP-1-deficient embryos (μ1A knockout), the defect is not in the forward transport of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor but rather in its retrieval from endosomes (24Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The similarities between VAMP4 and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor make it appealing to speculate that VAMP4 is packaged at the TGN via an interaction with GGAs and possibly AP-1 from which it buds in a CCV, which then fuses with an acceptor endosome. VAMP4 would then be recycled to the TGN via its interaction with AP-1 and possibly PACS. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis. We thank M. Robinson and the Robinson laboratory for numerous reagents and stimulating discussions. We also thank members of the Scheller laboratory, especially R. Prekeris and S. J.

The segment-specific cells of the ASDN express a transcellular pathway for Na+ reabsorption that is composed of the luminal epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and the basolateral Na,K-ATPase (Na+ pump). The activity of this Na+reabsorptive pathway is controlled by aldosterone mostly viathe mineralocorticoid receptor and to some extent also viathe glucocorticoid receptor (5Geering K. Claire M.

To prevent these nuclear corticosteroid receptors from being activated by glucocorticoids, the ASDN cells express the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which metabolizes glucocorticoids (9Funder J.W. Pearce P.T. Smith R. Smith A.I. Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). The transcription- and translation-dependent action of aldosterone on Na+ transport starts progressively after a lag period of ∼30 min in adrenalectomized rats and amphibian model epithelia (10Horisberger J.D. Diezi J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F89-F99PubMed Google Scholar, 11El Mernissi G. Doucet A. Pflueger's Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 339: 139-146Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This action has been schematically divided into an early regulatory phase (lasting 2–4 h after the lag period) and a late anabolic phase (12Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The early, short term action of aldosterone is considered to be largely mediated by induced regulatory proteins, such as the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase, that are thought to act on the pre-existing Na+ transport machinery (13Chen S. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For instance, aldosterone is known to act on both major Na+ transport proteins, apical ENaC, and the basolateral Na,K-ATPase (1Verrey F. Hummler E. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Seldin D.W. Giebiesch G.

Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As regards the mechanism by which ENaC is regulated, a recent study has shown that a single aldosterone injection given to adrenalectomized (ADX) rats induces the synthesis of new ENaC α-subunits and, in the early ASDN, the translocation of α, β,γENaC to the apical cell surface as well (4Loffing J.

Concerning the effect of aldosterone on the Na,K-ATPase, measurements performed two decades ago on cortical collecting ducts (CCD) of adrenalectomized rats have shown that aldosterone restores within 1–3 h the Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic activity V maxand/or the number of ouabain binding sites (17Horster M. Schnid H. Schmidt U. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 384: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Petty K.J. Kokkoi J.P. Marver D. J. Clin.

A. 1988; 85: 1707-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The nature of this effect was not known because the data could not distinguish between the possibilities that additional Na+ pump units are synthesized, that Na+ pumps are activated in situ, or that Na+ pumps are recruited/translocated from an intracellular pool to the cell surface. The aim of the present study was to characterize the mechanism of the short term aldosterone effect on Na,K-ATPase activity in the mammalian ASDN. We first demonstrated in isolated CCDs of ADX rats that the regulatory effect of aldosterone on Na,K-ATPase activity could be accounted for by the regulation of the cell surface expression of the Na,K-ATPase. Because a qualitatively similar effect of aldosterone was detected in the mouse collecting duct principal cell line mpkCCDcl4 (22Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this cell line proved to be a usefulin vitro model for further investigations. Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Saint Germain de l'Arbresle, France) weighting 120–130 g were adrenalectomized under isoflurane anesthesia and had then free access to a 0.9% NaCl solution for 1 week. A single dose of aldosterone (10 μg/kg) was infused intravenously in 0.3 ml of 0.9% NaCl, whereas controls received diluent. 3 h later, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g of body weight, given intraperitoneally), the left kidney was infused with incubation solution, and single CCDs were isolated by microdissection in ice-cold oxygenated incubation solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mmNaH2PO4, 0.15 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm lactate, 1 mm pyruvate, 4 mmessential and nonessential amino acids, 0.03 mm vitamins, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.45) containing aprotinin (10 millitrypsin-inhibitor units/ml) and leupeptin (20 mg/ml) as described (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The length of tubular segments that served as reference for Na,K-ATPase activities and Western blot analysis was determined from the photographs of microdissected CCDs. mpkCCDcl4 cells (passages 18–40) were cultured as described in Ref. 22Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. For filter cultures, the cells were seeded at high density on Transwell filters (Costar) and kept for 6–8 days in standard medium. 24 h prior to the experiments, epithelia were placed into serum- and hormone-deprived medium. To obtain maximal effects that are mediated via the mineralocorticoid and the glucocorticoid receptors, aldosterone was used at 10−6m (5Geering K. Claire M. Gaeggeler H.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C102-C108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Laplace J.R. Husted R.F. Stokes J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1370-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Garty H.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1295-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic activity of the Na,K-ATPase was determined under V maxconditions by the release of Pi from [γ-32P]ATP on isolated rat CCDs permeabilized by freeze/thawing, as previously described (24Deschenes G. Doucet A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 604-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This permeabilization procedure has been shown to reveal a pool of Na,K-ATPase that correlates with the cell surface expressed Na+ pumps (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity was measured on quadruplicate samples of four to six CCDs and taken as the difference between the mean ATPase activities in the absence (150 mm choline chloride, 2 mm ouabain) or presence of Na+ and K+ (100 mm NaCl and 5 mm KCl). The results are expressed as pmol ATP × mm−1 × h−1. The cation transport activity of Na,K-ATPase was measured as ouabain-sensitive86Rb+ uptake under conditions of initial rate on mpkCCDcl4 epithelia grown on 12-mm diameter Transwell filters. Incubations with aldosterone and/or drugs were for the indicated times in serum- and hormone-deprived medium (see above). The transport activity of Na,K-ATPase was determined, as previously described (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in quadruplicate samples following a preincubation of 30 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm ouabain. Protein content was determined in parallel by using the BCA assay (Pierce). The ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was calculated as the difference between the mean values with or without 2 mm ouabain, and the results are expressed as pmol Rb+ × μg protein−1 × min−1. The equivalent short circuit current was calculated according to Ohm's law from the values of transepithelial potential difference and resistance measured with a Millicell (Millipore) device. Na+ pump current (I p) was measured as previously described (25Beron J. Mastroberardino L. Spillmann A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confluent mpkCCDcl4 cells grown on Transwell filters (24-mm diameter) were transferred for 3 h to HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and kept under air atmosphere at 37 °C. The cell layers were then permeabilized apically to monovalent ions with 35 μg/ml amphotericin B for 15 min at 37 °C in Na+-free buffer containing 116 mm K+ gluconate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmd-glucose, 12 mm essential amino acids, 2 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 3 mm Ba(OH)2 and adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris. The filters were then transferred to a Ussing chamber, and Na+ was added to the desired final concentration by mixing Na+ buffer (Na+ replacement of K+) with the Na+-free buffer. Measurements were done under short circuit conditions before and after the addition of 1 mm ouabain to the basolateral compartment, and theI p was calculated as the difference between the total and the ouabain-resistant current. For estimatingV max and the Na+ concentration required for half-maximal activation (K 0.5), theI p max of the control epithelia was estimated for each experiment by fitting a sigmoidal curve with a nonlinear regression analysis routine (Prism, GraphPad) to the data, using a Hill coefficient fixed at 2.3 (26Pfeiffer R. Beron J. Verrey F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 647-655Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After normalization with the I p max of the controls, the data were pooled, and the mean Ks 0.5 was determined. The solubilization of proteins from 100 microdissected isolated CCDs (0.2–0.5-mm length) and Western blotting were performed as previously described (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), incubated overnight with a polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:2500) raised against the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase (27Carranza M.L. Feraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then incubated with a second anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution, 1:10000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Detection was performed by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal substrate method (Pierce). Measurement of cell surface Na,K-ATPase was performed on isolated rat CCDs as described (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using EZ-Link sulfossuccinimidobiotin (Sulfo NHS-S-S-Biotin; Pierce) for labeling of cell surface proteins. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Immunopure immobilized streptavidin; Pierce). In the present case, the beads were then washed three times with anti-protease-containing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 millitrypsin-inhibitor units/ml aprotinin) and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Solubilization of the precipitated proteins, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were as described above. The amounts of proteins loaded on each lane corresponded to the same initial length of isolated CCDs (± 5%). The chemiluminescence signals were quantified by densitometry and expressed in each experiment as percentages of the control. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from several animals. For mpkCCDcl4 epithelia grown on Transwell filters (12-mm diameter), a similar procedure was used for cell surface biotinylation, streptavidin-agarose precipitation, and Western blotting (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the lysates was measured with the BCA protein assay (Pierce) to load equal amounts of proteins on each lane for Western blotting and to submit equal amounts of proteins to streptavidin-agarose precipitation. Statistical analysis of Na,K-ATPase activities,86Rb+ uptakes and Ip were done by unpaired Student t test or by analysis of variance for comparison of two or more than two groups, respectively. Statistical analysis of Na,K-ATPase α-subunit immunoreactivity was done using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of two or more than two groups, respectively. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from n independent experiments. Each experiment was performed with tubules from one animal or with cells from one passage. A p value less < 0.05 was considered significant. The effect of a single intravenous infusion of aldosterone on Na,K-ATPase activity and expression was investigated in CCDs of ADX rats. As reported earlier (17Horster M. Schnid H. Schmidt U. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 384: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Petty K.J. Kokkoi J.P. Marver D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19El Mernissi G. Doucet A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 399: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), short term aldosterone (3 h) increased the maximal hydrolytic activity of the Na,K-ATPase by ∼200% (ADX control, 323 ± 80; ADX aldosterone, 940 ± 150 pmol ATP × mm−1 × h−1;n = 9; p < 0.01). We performed Western blotting to test whether or not this increase in enzyme activity could be explained by an increase in the cellular pool of the Na,K-ATPase. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this did not appear to be the case because the α-subunit pool was increased only by 63 ± 7% (n = 8), and the β-subunit was increased similarly by 71 ± 21% (n = 8; data not shown). To test the hypothesis that it was mainly the cell surface pool of the Na,K-ATPase that was increased by the short aldosterone treatment, we performed cell surface biotinylation followed by precipitation with streptavidin-agarose beads and Western blotting. Fig. 1 C shows that aldosterone increased the amounts of cell surface Na,K-ATPase α-subunit by 497 ± 35% (n= 8). Thus, the increase in maximal Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic activity observed in CCDs of adrenalectomized rats 3 h after a single aldosterone injection appears to be entirely mediated by an increase in its cell surface expression. We used theex vivo CCD model of cultured mpkCCDcl4 cells grown on filter supports to characterize more extensively the mechanism underlying the short term effect of aldosterone. This cell line was derived from mouse CCD and was shown to express an aldosterone-inducible amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na+ transport (22Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, 1 μmaldosterone increased the transepithelial short circuit current (I sc) already within 1 h and further during the second hour of treatment (Fig. 2). The transport activity of the Na,K-ATPase (Na+ pump), measured as 86Rb+ uptake, increased in response to aldosterone with a time course close to theI sc (Fig. 2). Because the 86Rb+ uptake assay does not discriminate between kinetic activation of the Na+ pump by intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) versus regulatory changes in pump number or activity, ouabain-sensitive pump currents were measured. The apical membrane of the epithelia was selectively permeabilized to monovalent cations with amphotericin B, thus allowing the control of [Na+]i. Under these experimental conditions, aldosterone increased the current carried by the Na+ pump by ∼30%, following during the first 2 h a similar time course as the increase in transepithelial I sc (Fig. 2). Na+ activation experiments were then performed to determine whether this regulatory effect of aldosterone on Na,K-ATPase function corresponded to a change in Na+ affinity or to an increase in the maximal transport capacity of the basolateral Na+pumps. Fig. 3 shows that the apparent affinity for Na+ was not changed by aldosterone (K 0.5 control, 8.5 mm;K 0.5 aldosterone, 10.1 mm;n = 4; difference not significant). Similar to the observations made in rat CCDs (Fig. 1), these results suggested that the effect of aldosterone might correspond to an increase in the number of functional Na+ pumps at the basolateral membrane. In summary, the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 confirmed that short term aldosterone increases the electrogenic transepithelial sodium transport in cultured mpkCCDcl4 cells. Furthermore, they showed that this effect not only reflects an increase in apical Na+ influx via ENaC and a consecutive kinetic activation of the Na,K-ATPase but also reflects a regulatory change in the maximal Na,K-ATPase function. To test whether the effect of aldosterone on the pump function of mpkCCDcl4 cells was due to an increase in Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression, we performed cell surface biotinylations followed by streptavidin-agarose precipitation and Western blotting. Fig. 4 Ashows that 1 μm aldosterone time-dependently increased the cell surface amount of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. This effect was statistically significant after 2 h and, up to that time point, quantitatively similar to the increase inI p. The cell surface expression continued to increase at later time points and reached a maximum after 6 h (increase by 60 ± 5.2%; n = 6; p< 0.05), whereas the I P remained approximately at the same level (compare Figs. 2 and 4 A). Western blotting on total cell extracts showed that the total pool of Na,K-ATPase α-subunit increased as well but later than the surface expression and to a lesser extent, reaching a maximum at 24 h (increase by 38 ± 8.5; n = 8; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 B). The correlation of the early aldosterone-induced increase in cell surface Na,K-ATPase (≤2 h) (Fig. 4 A) with the increase inI p (Fig. 2) suggests that the latter effect onI p might result from the increase in Na+ pump cell surface expression. Although less pronounced, these results are qualitatively similar to those obtained in intact rat CCDs (Fig. 1). Thus, mpkCCDcl4 cells appear to be a suitable model to study the mechanism of collecting duct Na,K-ATPase regulation. Aldosterone stimulates the expression and activity of the ENaC and thus the apical influx of Na+in mkpCCDcl4 cells (22Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in Na+ pump function that appears to be mediated by an increase in Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression could have been secondary to an increase in [Na+]i. To test this possibility, we prevented the apical Na+ influx during the aldosterone treatment with the ENaC inhibitor amiloride. As shown by the 86Rb+ uptake experiments (performed after washout of amiloride for 5 min), the cellular transport response to aldosterone remained unchanged (Fig. 5). Importantly, the regulation of the Na,K-ATPase measured by theI p and the increase in Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression were maintained as well, indicating that the early effect of aldosterone at the level of the Na+ pump is not secondary to apical Na+ entry. We next tested whether the effect of aldosterone on Na+transport depends in cultured mpkCCDcl4 cells on ongoing transcription and translation, as previously reported for intact rat CCDs (21Barlet-Bas C. Khadoury C. Marsy S. Doucet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1707-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and amphibian epithelia (28Verrey F. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D (5 μm) or cycloheximide (20 μm) was added to prevent transcription or translation, respectively, during the aldosterone treatment. Both inhibitors blocked the effect of aldosterone on the 86Rb+ uptake and also slightly decreased the base-line transport in untreated mpkCCDcl4 cells (Fig. 6,A and C). This showed that the transepithelial Na+ transport and, in particular, its stimulation by aldosterone depend on ongoing transcription and translation in mpkCCDcl4 cells as well. Similarly, the aldosterone-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression and activation of the Na+ pump function measured as I pwere also fully prevented by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, respectively (Fig. 6, B and D). Thus, the increase in basolateral Na+ pump function induced by aldosterone requires, similar to the stimulation of transepithelial Na+ transport, a functional transcription and translation machinery. The present study shows that short term aldosterone increases the maximal activity of the Na,K-ATPase in mammalian cortical collecting duct cells by increasing its cell surface expression. This finding seemingly opposes the current understanding that the single rate-limiting site of Na+ transport regulation by aldosterone is ENaC, at least in the short term. Because the Na,K-ATPase activity (the actual pumping rate) strongly depends on [Na+]i (positive cooperativity with Hill coefficient between 2 and 3) (16Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 25Beron J. Mastroberardino L. Spillmann A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol.

Khadouri C. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F246-F250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because [Na+]i is generally below its half-maximal activation concentration (K 0.5) in CCD (30Blot-Chabaud M. Jaisser F. Gingold M. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F605-F613PubMed Google Scholar, 31Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Khadouri C. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F246-F250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the kinetic control of the pump function would suffice to match the basolateral efflux of Na+ to its luminal influx. However, a lack of Na,K-ATPase regulation would lead to fluctuations in [Na+]i that would tend to blunt the transport response because the Na+ flux through ENaC activity strongly depends on [Na+]i (32Schultz S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F579-F590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the electrochemical driving force for Na+ influxvia ENaC depends on [Na+]i (33Silver R.B. Frindt G. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F557-F564PubMed Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant in the collecting duct where luminal/urinary Na+ concentration can be quite low. Second, high [Na+]i exerts a strong negative feedback regulation on ENaC function (33Silver R.B. Frindt G. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F557-F564PubMed Google Scholar, 34Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a coordinated regulation of the Na+ pumps might also be important in the collecting duct, because this part of the nephron expresses Na+ pumps with a high apparent affinity for Na+(31Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Khadouri C. Marsy S. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F246-F250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Na+ pumps of the CCD have, at a given [Na+]i, less kinetic reserve than Na+pumps with a lower apparent affinity. Taken together, it is not surprising that the regulation of transepithelial Na+transport by aldosterone relies, besides on the regulation of ENaC, also on the regulation of the Na+ pumps, as demonstrated in this study. The extent by which aldosterone stimulates the maximal Na+pump current (independent of [Na+]i) in mpkCCDcl4 epithelia (20–50% after 2 h) represents approximately half of the effect aldosterone exerts on the ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake (40–100% after 2 h). Because this latter assay measures the actual pumping rate of the Na,K-ATPase and because the apparent Na+ affinity of the Na,K-ATPase is not altered by aldosterone (Fig. 3), this indicates that approximately half of the Na+ pump activation measured by 86Rb+ uptake must result from a kinetic activation of Na+ pumps, presumably in response to an increase in [Na+]i that is secondary to the increase in apical Na+ influx. Hence, it appears that in our experimental conditions the increase in transcellular Na+ transport observed in mpkCCDcl4 cells is supported, at the basolateral membrane, in part by an increase in the number of active pumps and that the other part relies on the kinetic activation of the Na+ pumps. Blocking ENaC function during the aldosterone treatment with a low amiloride concentration did not prevent the aldosterone-induced increase in Na+ pump surface expression and Na+ pump current. Thus, these effects are not secondary to an increase in apical Na+ influx. They may rather be mediated by (an) aldosterone-induced regulatory protein(s) that directly trigger(s) the redistribution of Na,K-ATPase toward the basolateral membrane. It remains to be investigated whether aldosterone-induced serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1, which appears to play a major role in the control of ENaC cell surface expression (4Loffing J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37834-37839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), also plays such a role for the control of Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression. Previous reports have suggested that aldosterone determines in rat CCD the existence of a pool of inactive Na+ pumps that can be recruited/activated in response to cAMP or cell volume increase (37Blot-Chabaud M. Wanstock F. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11676-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Barlet-Bas C. Khadouri C. Marsy S. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7799-7803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that aldosterone-deprived CCD cells (ADX rats) contain nonetheless a large pool of inactive Na+pumps that can be recruited by aldosterone. Thus, one can speculate that CCD cells lack, in the absence of aldosterone, (a) gene product(s) other than the Na+ pump that is(are) required to allow physiological stimuli such as cAMP and volume increase to recruit/activate Na+ pumps. Interestingly, the cAMP-induced recruitment/activation of Na+ pumps in CCDs has been recently shown to be mediated by the redistribution of Na+ pumps to the cell surface, similar to the short term effect of aldosterone described in the present study (23Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be interesting to clarify the relationship between the mechanisms involved in the aldosterone- and the cAMP-induced Na+ pump translocation events. The late effect of aldosterone that leads to an increase in the cellular Na+ pump pool of CCD (39Welling P.A. Caplan M. Sutters M. Giebisch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also observed in mpkCCDcl4 cells in the present study. This late increase in the Na+ pump pool is parallel to the late part of the increase in Na+ pump cell surface expression (later than 2 h after aldosterone addition) and can therefore fully account for it. Interestingly, the recently described effect of puromycin-induced nephrotic syndrome on Na,K-ATPase expression in the CCD resembles the late effect of aldosterone described here (40Deschenes, G., Gonin, S., Zolty, E., Cheval, L., Rousselot, M., Martin, P. Y., Verbavatz, J.-M., Feraille, E., and Doucet, A. (2001)J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., in press.Google Scholar). Unlike the Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression, theI p did not increase between 2 and 6 h after aldosterone addition. We hypothesize that this lack of correlation might be the result of other regulatory effects that modulated the activity of pumps expressed at the cell surface (16Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to mention that, similarly, the increase in Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression measured in CCDs (∼6-fold) was larger than the corresponding increase in Na,K-ATPase activity (3-fold), also suggesting the possibility of an in situcounterregulation. The short term effect of aldosterone on Na,K-ATPaseV max, i.e. on its cell surface expression, that we have observed in mammalian CCD and mpkCCDcl4 cells, is clearly different from the effect previously observed in amphibian A6 cells. In this latter model, short term aldosterone appeared to increase the Na+ affinity of a subpopulation of Na+ pumps and had no measurable effect on the Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression (25Beron J. Mastroberardino L. Spillmann A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Beron J. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1278-C1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent reports on the expression of CHIF and its interaction with the Na,K-ATPase suggest that aldosterone may act in the long term on the apparent Na+ affinity of Na+ pumps in mammalian collecting duct as well. Indeed, CHIF was shown to be expressed in the medullary collecting ducts of rats, to be up-regulated in the kidney by low salt diet (high aldosterone), and to associate with coexpressed Na,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes, thereby increasing its apparent affinity for [Na+]i (35Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 42Shi H. Levy-Holzman R. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F505-F512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a long term effect of aldosterone on the apparent intracellular Na+ affinity of Na+ pumps would increase the driving force for apical Na+ entry via ENaC. Thus, we can hypothesize that aldosterone increases the driving force for Na+ entry via synergistic mechanisms: 1) as shown in this study, by increasing the amount of cell surface expressed Na+ pumps, in the short term by a translocation mechanism and in the long term by increasing the Na+ pump cellular pool and 2) by increasing the apparent affinity of Na+pumps for [Na+]i. Some axial heterogeneity of this putative effect can be anticipated, because increasing the driving force for apical Na+ entry via ENaC is physiologically most relevant for distal portions of the ASDN where maximal Na+ retention leads to very low luminal Na+ concentrations. In conclusion, aldosterone exerts, already in the short term, a pleiotropic action on the transcellular Na+ reabsorption machinery of CCD cells. Besides regulating the luminal influx of Na+ at the level of ENaC, it also controls the surface expression of Na+ pumps. This mechanism should prevent an excessive increase in [Na+]i that otherwise would exert a negative feedback on the apical Na+ influxvia ENaC. Thus, Na,K-ATPase regulation contributes to the short term control of transepithelial Na+ transport by aldosterone.

By using proteolytic mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we pinpointed Val2322, located in the central modulatory domain of the RyR3, as a critical residue for the interaction of RyR3 with FKBPs. Substitution of Val2322for leucine (as in IP3R1) or isoleucine (as in RyR2) decreased the binding efficiency and shifted the selectivity to FKBP12.6; substitution of Val2322 for aspartate completely abolished the FKBP interaction.

RyR1 and RyR2 are highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, respectively, and play a crucial role in Ca2+ mobilization during excitation-contraction coupling (3Franzini-Armstrong C.

RyR3 is more ubiquitously expressed, but at much lower levels, and may exert a functional role in Jurkat T cells, the central nerve system, as well as in neonatal and adult skeletal muscle contraction (5Ogawa Y.

The different IP3R isoforms have a very broad expression pattern and occur in almost all cell types. They play a crucial role in many cellular processes, ranging from cell proliferation and apoptosis to gene regulation and secretion (8Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The function of these intracellular Ca2+-release channels is regulated by different cellular factors. One of these regulators is the group of the FK506-binding proteins (FKBP) belonging to the immunophilin family (9Marks A.R. Physiol.

Although the interaction of FKBP12 with RyR isoforms is generally accepted, the proposed interaction of FKBP12 with the different isoforms of the IP3R is controversial (26Bultynck G. Missiaen L. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Curr. Top. Biochem. Res. 1999; 1: 193-204Google Scholar). It has been postulated that FKBP12 was associated with the IP3R1 of rat cerebellum and functioned as a stabilizing protein as well as an adaptor protein for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (27Cameron A.M.

The core of the FKBP12-binding site in the IP3R1 was identified by the yeast two-hybrid technique and was limited to an 11-amino acid stretch (aa 1396–1406), containing the critical leucylprolyl residue 1400–1401 (29Cameron A.M.

The interaction between IP3R1 and FKBP12 as observed by a yeast two-hybrid assay is compatible with the fact that the primary sequence of the FKBP12-binding site on RyR and IP3R isoforms is quite well conserved (29Cameron A.M.

Recently, it has been reported that FK506 enhanced phosphorylation of the IP3R1 by protein kinase C via inhibition of calcineurin hereby suppressing intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, although no direct interaction between IP3R1 and FKBP12 was shown in this study (34Poirier S.N. Poitras M. Chorvatova A. Payet M.D. Guillemette G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6486-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of the binding of FKBP12 and of FKBP12.6 to the RyR3 and to clarify the seemingly contradictory results obtained for RyRs and IP3Rs, although both channel families contain a conserved sequence representing a putative FKBP-binding site. For this purpose we used HEK293 and COS-1 cells heterologously expressing either wild type RyR3, mutated forms of the RyR3, and a chimeric RyR3, containing the core of the proposed FKBP12-binding site of IP3R1. In addition, we analyzed mouse IP3R1 and human IP3R3, which respectively contain leucylprolyl or valylprolyl residues in the core of their putative FKBP12-binding site. The predicted secondary structure of the FKBP-binding site in the different RyR and IP3R isoforms was compared using several secondary structure prediction methods. Our data indicate that the primary sequence of the FKBP12-binding site, which is similar in RyR and IP3R isoforms, is by itself not sufficient to create a stable interaction between FKBP12 and the intracellular Ca2+-release channels. We have demonstrated that the local structural microenvironment plays a crucial role in targeting the FKBPs to their binding sites on RyRs and in establishing a high affinity interaction between both proteins. Furthermore, the differences in the predicted secondary structure between the FKBP12-binding site in the RyR isoforms and the IP3R isoforms could explain that in contrast to RyRs, IP3Rs have only a weak or transient interaction with FKBPs, which may not be functionally important for the mature protein.

For FKBP12, we have used 5′-GCCGGATCCATGGGAGTGCAGGTGGAAACC-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCAAGAATTCTCATTCCAGTTTTAGAAGCTCC-3′ as reverse primer, and for FKBP12.6, we have used 5′-GGGGGATCCATGGGCGTGGAGATCGAGACC-3′ as forward and 5′-CCTTCGAATTCATCACTCTAAGTTGAGCAGCTCCACG-3′ as reverse primer. Respective BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites are underlined. PCR products were digested withBamHI and EcoRI. These fragments were purified by PAGE and ligated into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T and transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli for large scale production of DNA. The cDNA of the full-size mink RyR3 was cloned in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (38Marziali G. Rossi D. Giannini G. Charlesworth A. Sorrentino V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A fragment (bp 5715–10,528) of the full-size cDNA, containing two NheI restriction sites, was subcloned in the pBlueScript II SK(+) vector. This construct was used as template for the insertion of point mutations at Val2322 of the RyR3. The sequence of the primers used for mutagenesis were as follows with indication of the mutated residues: V2322L, 5′-CTGCGCTCCCTGCTTCCCACAGAAGACCTGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACCAGGTCTTCTGTGGGAAGCAGGGAGCGCAG-3′; V2322I, 5′-CTGCGCTCCCTGATTCCCACAGAAGACCTGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACCAGGTCTTCTGTGGGAATCAGGGAGCGCAG-3′; V2322D, 5′-CTGCGCTCCCTGGATCCCACAGAAGACCTGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACC- AGGTCTTCTGTGGGATCCAGGGAGCGCGCAG-3′. The QuickChangeTM XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The insertion of the mutation was verified by sequence analysis. Construction of the chimeric RyR3 was done by overlap PCR of two PCR fragments, both amplified from the full-size RyR3 cDNA. Fragment A was amplified with 5′-GGTGCAGAGAAGTCTCAGATTGC-3′ as forward primer (primer A-1F) and 5′-TGTCATCGAGCGGGAGCAAGGAGTTGCAGATTGACCTGATCCGGATGGC-3′ as reverse primer, and fragment B was amplified with 5′-TCCTTGCTCCCGCTCGATGACATCGTTGGCATCATCAGCATCCCCTTG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-GAAGAGCTTCTCCGTCAGGTGC-3′ as reverse primer (primer B-2R). The inserted IP3R1 sequence and its reverse complement at the 5′-end of the primers are underlined. The overlap PCR was done with primer A-1F and primer B-2R, using fragments A and B as templates. All fragments containing mutations were cloned in theNheI-cut pcDNA3.1 (+)/RyR3 (eukaryotic expression vector) and analyzed by sequence analysis. COS-1 cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/plate (150 cm2) and were transfected 1 day later, using 15 μg of DNA and 45 μl of FugeneTM transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection by scraping the cells in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, centrifuging at 400 ×g for 5 min, and washing the cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The GST-FKBP12 and GST-FKBP12.6 affinity chromatography assay was done exactly as described previously (18Bultynck G. De Smet P. Rossi D. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Sorrentino V. De Smedt H.

Commun. 1995; 214: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quantification of the ratio between RyR3 and GST-FKBP12 or GST-FKBP12.6 immobilized on the column was performed after SDS-PAGE and staining with SyproTMOrange. For determining absolute amounts, values were compared with bovine serum albumin standards. Microsomes of RyR3-overexpressing HEK293 cells (2 mg of protein) were partially trypsinized as described previously (18Bultynck G. De Smet P. Rossi D. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Sorrentino V. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In short, microsomal fractions were washed twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl and subsequently treated with trypsin (1:24 w/w) for 6 min at room temperature. Trypsinization was stopped by the addition of a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The binding of the trypsinized fragments to GST-FKBP12 and GST-FKBP12.6 was analyzed as described previously (18Bultynck G. De Smet P. Rossi D. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Sorrentino V. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The hydropathicity of the generated polypeptide fragments was predicted following the Kyte and Doolittle model (40Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). Full-size RyRs and IP3Rs were analyzed by 3–12% SDS-PAGE followed by wet electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) performed for 16 h in transfer buffer (20 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine). After blocking the membranes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk powder, the membranes were subsequently incubated with the primary antibody and with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized after conversion of the VistraTM ECF substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified using ImageQuant 4.2 as described previously (41Vanlingen S.

Prediction of the secondary structure of peptide sequences originating from RyR and IP3R isoforms was performed with the PSIPRED version 2.0 method, available at insulin.brunel.ac.uk/psipred/. PSIPRED is a secondary structure prediction method, incorporating two separated feed-forward neural networks that perform an analysis on output obtained from PSI-BLAST (44Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). The method is based on position-specific scoring matrices and contains three stages as follows: generation of a sequence profile, prediction of initial secondary structure, and finally the filtering of the predicted structure. Additional analysis was also performed by other secondary structure prediction methods, including the SAM-T99 method, available at www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html (46Karplus K. Barrett C. Hughey R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), and the SSpro2 method, available at promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/ (47Baldi P. Brunak S. Frasconi P. Soda G. Pollastri G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We have developed a semi-quantitative affinity assay to investigate the FKBP-binding properties of the RyR3. After solubilization of microsomes from RyR3-overexpressing HEK293 cells, the supernatant was incubated with an excess of immobilized GST, GST-FKBP12, or GST-FKBP12.6 (∼1 nmol or ∼40 μg of protein per sample). Immunoblot analysis of the different fractions showed that the RyR3 was specifically retained with similar efficiency by GST-FKBP12 as well as by GST-FKBP12.6 (31 ± 6 and 33 ± 7%, respectively), but not by GST (Fig. 1 A). The binding between RyR3 and both FKBP isoforms was completely abolished by 20 μmFK506, indicating a specific interaction (Table I). In our experimental conditions, GST-FKBP12 (40 μg, 1000 pmol) was in large excess (more than 500-fold) as compared with the amount of RyR3 protein. Hence, the RyR3 signal increased proportionally to the amount of solubilized fraction applied to the GST-FKBP12 column (Fig. 1 B). The interaction between GST-FKBP12 and RyR3 represents specific (FK506-sensitive) and saturable (as shown in Fig. 1 C) binding. The binding efficiency for the different constructs and different conditions can therefore be reliably used for estimation of the relative FKBP12 binding affinity.Table IInfluence of different modulators of RyR3 on FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 bindingGST-FKBP12GST-FKBP12.6%Control10010020 μmFK5061 ± 11-ap < 0.01 was compared with the respective control conditions.1 ± 11-ap < 0.01 was compared with the respective control conditions.1 mmEGTA64 ± 111-bValue is from Ref.18.1-cp < 0.05.69 ± 141-cp < 0.05.10 mmMg2+152 ± 111-ap < 0.01 was compared with the respective control conditions.142 ± 191-ap < 0.01 was compared with the respective control conditions.10 μmcADPr94 ± 1290 ± 14The values were normalized to the amount of RyR3 bound under control conditions, set as 100%.

Open table in a new tab The values were normalized to the amount of RyR3 bound under control conditions, set as 100%. Each result is the mean ± S.D. of at least four independent experiments. Table I further indicates that the interaction between RyR3 and FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 was Ca2+-dependent, as 1 mm EGTA significantly decreased the binding efficiency (p < 0.05, n = 4). Moreover, the addition of 10 mm Mg2+, which inhibits RyR channel activity, significantly increased the binding efficiency by 1.5-fold (p < 0.01, n = 5). The addition of 10 μm cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr), a putative RyR3 agonist, did not affect the binding efficiency, indicating that neither FKBP12 nor FKBP12.6 dissociated from RyR3 upon activation by cADPr. To identify the smallest domain on RyR3 that is sufficient for stable binding of FKBP12 and (or) FKBP12.6, we performed the GST-FKBP affinity assay on partially trypsinized microsomes from RyR3-overexpressing HEK293 cells. RyR3-containing microsomes were first trypsinized (Fig. 2 A, Tryps) and solubilized (Fig. 2 A, Sol). The fragments were very similar to those obtained for RyR1 (18Bultynck G. De Smet P. Rossi D. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Sorrentino V. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 48Chen S.R. Airey J.A. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22642-22649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After GST-FKBP12 or after GST-FKBP12.6 affinity chromatography, an ∼40-kDa polypeptide, appearing as a double band, was retained (Fig. 2 A,GSTFKBP12 and GST-FKBP12.6). Binding of the proteolytic fragments to the GST-FKBP column was much less efficient than for the full-size RyR3 (∼2% versus ∼30% of the solubilized amount). A higher amount of material was therefore loaded on the gel, whereby some nonspecific binding of the 40-kDa polypeptide fragment to GST was observed, which, however, never exceeded 0.4% of the solubilized fraction. Furthermore, the association of these RyR3 fragments to the FKBP matrix was specifically disrupted by the addition of 20 μm FK506 (data not shown). The epitope of m34C (aa 2619–2665) was localized close to the putative FKBP12-binding site based on the analogy with the FKBP-binding site proposed for RyR1, RyR2, and IP3R1. Our immunoblots with m34C therefore indicate that the FKBP-binding site for RyR3 is within the same boundaries. The formation of this ∼40-kDa proteolytic fragment of RyR3, encompassing the FKBP12- and FKBP12.6-binding site and the m34C epitope, therefore allows the identification of the FKBP-binding pocket on the native RyR3 protein. The generation of a doublet can be explained by the prediction of two successive hyperhydrophilic regions (HHR2 and HHR3) at the C-terminal part of the polypeptide fragments (Fig. 2, B and C). Both hyperhydrophilic regions contain multiple potential trypsin cleavage sites (Arg-X and Lys-X). The lower molecular mass fragment therefore probably arose from cleavages at HHR1 and HHR2, leading to a polypeptide from aa ∼2265 to ∼2665, whereas the higher molecular mass fragment probably arose from cleavages at HHR1 and HHR3, leading to a polypeptide from aa ∼2265 to ∼2700. Finally, we identified the molecular determinants for the binding of FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 to the RyR3 channel by site-directed mutations. Furthermore, we analyzed the difference in FKBP-binding properties of RyRs and IP3Rs by the construction of"

In addition to CaN inhibition, however, CsA and FK506 have multiple biochemical effects because of their action in a gain-of-function model that requires prior binding to immunophilic proteins. We screened a small molecule library for direct inhibitors of CaN using CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of33P-labeled 19-residue phosphopeptide substrate (RII phosphopeptide) as an assay and found the polyphenolic aldehyde gossypol to be a novel CaN inhibitor. Unlike CsA and FK506, gossypol does not require a matchmaker protein for reversible CaN inhibition with an IC50 value of 15 μm. Gossypolone, a gossypol analog, showed improved inhibition of both RII phosphopeptide and p- nitrophenyl phosphate dephosphorylation with an IC50 of 9 and 6 μm, respectively. In contrast, apogossypol hexaacetate was inactive. Gossypol acts noncompetitively, interfering with the binding site for the cyclophilin 18·CsA complex in CaN. In contrast to CsA and FK506, gossypol does not inactivate the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans- isomerase activity of immunophilins. Similar to CsA and FK506, T cell receptor signaling induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin is inhibited by gossypol in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrated by the inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) c1 translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus and suppression of NFAT-luciferase reporter gene activity.

The functional discrimination with specific inhibitors of the four major protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),1protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B, calcineurin, CaN), and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), has proven to be successful (1Mackintosh C.R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid and microcystin are strong inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A, but they exhibit poor inhibition of the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated CaN and PP2C. It was difficult to identify CaN function in cell signaling until the membrane-penetrable cyclopeptide cyclosporin A (CsA) and the peptidomacrolide FK506 were found to inhibit CaN specifically under certain conditions (2Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Currently, most reports about CaN involvement in cellular processes are based on CsA and FK506 susceptibility of the appropriate bioassays. CaN inhibition by these drugs is characterized by their prior binding to the 18-kDa cyclophilin (Cyp18) and 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), respectively, indicating a gain-of-function mechanism (3Schreiber S.L. Albers M.W. Brown E.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 412-420Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These mammalian prototypes of two different families of the enzyme class of peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans- isomerases (EC 5.2.1.8; PPIases) function as molecular matchmakers because the drugs cannot bind to CaN on their own. The prototypic PPIases are themselves tightly inhibited in the course of formation of the CaN-inhibitory PPIase·drug complex (4Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is essential to recognize the uncertainties in the interpretation of the biological effects found for the application of CsA and FK506 in cellular assays. They include the above discussed multifunctional biochemical properties released through the PPIase-drug interaction and the often unknown cellular content and isoenzyme composition of the matchmaker proteins. Recent analyses of the human genome revealed the existence of 18 cyclophilins and 16 FKBPs, at least, most of which have the potential to be enzymatically active and to form PPIase·drug complexes with mostly unknown affinity for CaN (5Swanson S.K.

In fact, the CaN-inhibitory complexes of different affinity for CaN are formed from the matchmaker proteins in competition for the limiting amounts of the drug rendering inhibition less predictable. Other drug effects may result from the facilitated dissociation of receptor·PPIase complexes (8Wang T.W. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T.

In addition, the PPIase-mediated intracellular accumulation of the drugs prevents the reliable analysis of dose-response curves. Although the molarity of the administered dose is known, the variable intracellular PPIase concentration does not permit calculation of the biologically effective dose. It has now become apparent that the demonstration of an influence of CsA and FK506 on the signal of any biological assay does not by itself constitute final proof as to the involvement of CaN in cell signaling. Although the use of drug derivatives lacking the CaN effector domain has permitted the application of CaN-inactive PPIase inhibitors (12Nelson P.A. Akselband Y. Kawamura A. Su M. Tung R.D. Rich D.H.

The tyrphostin class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors possesses CaN inhibitory potency in the micromolar range but lacks CaN specificity. The CsA-like anti-HIV-1 replication inhibition of ring-substituted benzothiophen-2-carboxamide was attributed to its CaN-inactivating properties (19Gualberto A. Marquez G. Carballo M. Youngblood G.L.

To provide a more reliable tool for investigating the role of CaN in cellular processes, we screened a compound library for low molecular mass inhibitors of CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of RII phosphopeptide. The experimental approach is based on a scintillation proximity concept with streptavidin-coated scintillation wells. The polyphenolic aldehyde gossypol was identified as a reversible inhibitor that is specific for CaN among the Ser/Thr phosphatases and does not require prior binding to a molecular matchmaker. Furthermore, we have characterized the ability of gossypol to inhibit CaN-mediated cellular dephosphorylation of the cytoplasmic component of the transcription factor NFAT using Western blotting and the NFAT-luciferase reporter gene assay. Streptavidin-coated scintillation wells were purchased from Wallac (Turku, Finland). The biotinylated and nonbiotinylated 19-residue peptides of a partial sequence of the subunit of the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE-OH) were synthesized. The purity of the peptides was assessed by analytical reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides were characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Recombinant human Cyp18, human FKBP12, and human Pin1 were prepared as described elsewhere (27Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M.H. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) was obtained from Roche (Mannheim, Germany). PP1 (recombinant rabbit muscle α-isoform) was purchased from Calbiochem, and PP2C (recombinant human α-isoform) was from Upstate Biotechnology. Trimeric PP2A with a subunit composition of Cα/β Aα Bα was kindly provided by A. Werner (University Halle, Germany). Calmodulin, (+/−)-gossypol, (+/−)-gossypolone, (+/−)-apogossypol hexaacetate, buffers, and salts were purchased from Sigma. Expression and purification of the recombinant human CaN α (rhCaN) from the Escherichia coli strain BL21-(pLysS)/pETCNα/pBB131 was performed as described previously (29Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Natural Products Pool compound library (Hans-Knöll-Institute for Natural Products Research, Jena, Germany) at the time comprising ∼5,000 pure compounds was used (30Koch C. Neumann T. Grabley S. Thiericke R. Drug Discovery from Nature. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 263-268Google Scholar). The biotinylated and nonbiotinylated 19-residue peptides of a partial sequence of the subunit of the bovine protein kinase A were phosphorylated according to a procedure described previously (31Enz A. Shapiro G. Chappuis A. Dattler A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction mixture contained the following concentrations: 700 μm peptide, 100 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP with a specific activity of ∼3,000 Ci/mmol from a stock solution of 10 μCi/μl (ICN, Eschwege, Germany), and 125 μm ATP in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2). The phosphorylation of the peptides in the reaction mixture was performed with 10 milliunits of protein kinase A at 30 °C for 1 h. Then the peptides and ATP were separated by a 1-ml RP-C2 clean-up extraction column (Amchro, Sulzbach, Germany). The peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile and water, then freeze-dried and dissolved in water prior to use. The level of peptide phosphorylation was 24%. The calculation takes into account the total amount of radioactivity in the peptide fraction, the specific activity of incorporated 33P, and the ratio of radioactive and nonradioactive ATP in the reaction mixture. The scintillation proximity concept (32Sullivan E. Hemsley P. Pickard A. J. Biomol. Screen. 1997; 2: 19-23Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 33Nakayama G.R. Nova M.P. Parandoosh Z. J. Biomol. Screen. 1998; 3: 43-48Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has been applied to measure CaN activity using scintillation wells coated with streptavidin. Preincubation of 50 nm calmodulin, 1.32 nm CaN, and inhibitor at the required concentrations in assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was carried out at 22 °C for 30 min in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). 10 pmol of biotinylated33P-labeled RII phosphopeptide was added to each well in a total assay volume of 100 μl. After dephosphorylation of the modified RII phosphopeptide by CaN at 30 °C for 20 min, a 90-μl sample of the reaction mixture was transferred to a scintillation well coated with streptavidin. Biotinylated RII phosphopeptide was allowed to bind to streptavidin for 20 min at 22 °C. The well was washed once with water, and the RII phosphopeptide-associated 33P radioactivity was measured in a MicroBeta top counter (Wallac). PP1 and PP2A were assayed by using32P-labeled phosphorylase a as described by Pelech and Cohen (34Pelech S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For CaN and PP2C 32P-labeled casein was used as substrate (35Waelkens E. Goris J. Di Salvo J. Merlevede W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Procedures for 32P labeling are detailed in Refs. 36Krebs E.G. Kent A.B. Fischer E.H. J. Biol.

Phosphorylase b, phosphorylase kinase, and casein were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of substances from the product library (10 mg/ml dimethyl sulfoxide) tested for CaN inhibition were stored at −70 °C. Each substance was assayed at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml in the reaction mixture. CaN inhibition was measured in a concentration range of 0.5–200 μm gossypol and gossypol derivatives at optimal Ca2+ and calmodulin concentrations. The obtained data were fitted and computed with the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc., San Rafael, CA). For competition experiments, the CaN/gossypol mixture was equilibrated in the assay buffer at 22 °C for 30 min. Subsequent use of the incubation mixture in the RII phosphopeptide-based CaN assay yielded a final concentration of 1.3 nm CaN and 12 μmgossypol. Residual CaN activity was determined in the simultaneous presence of gossypol and 10 μm CsA at varying concentrations of rhCyp18 and under similar conditions for CsA and gossypol alone. CaN activity was referenced to the assay lacking additional compounds. For kinetic analyses, biotinylated 33P-labeled RII phosphopeptide and nonbiotinylated RII phosphopeptide were mixed at a concentration ratio of 1:200 in the assay buffer. A total RII phosphopeptide concentration of 5–10 μm was used for each concentration of gossypol (5–20 μm). Nitrophenyl Phosphate (pNPP)-based CaN Activity Assay—Phosphatase activity was measured at room temperature using pNPP as substrate in phosphatase assay buffer (see above). After preincubation of CaN and calmodulin with the inhibitor in the assay buffer at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of pNPP to final concentrations up to 25 mm. The release of p- nitrophenol was measured continuously on a Dynatec MR7000 micotiter plate reader at 410 nm for 30 min. PPIases activity was determined with oligopeptide substrates using protease-coupled assays as described elsewhere (38Fischer G. Liebold B.W. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 39Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.J. Shen M.H. Stoller G. Kullertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Typically, experiments were performed with the PPIase concentrations in the low nm range and 120 μm gossypol within the assay. The effect of gossypol on the PPIase activity was calculated from the remaining activity after preincubation of the enzyme and the inhibitor for 20 min. The equilibrated 120 μm gossypol and 13.2 nm CaN mixture (stock solution) in assay buffer containing 50 nm calmodulin was used to examine the reversibility of inhibition by dialysis experiments. The mixture was placed on a Pierce system microdialyzer equipped with a M r 3,000 cutoff dialysis membrane and dialyzed against the assay buffer at 4 °C. Reference activity was determined with a CaN sample treated similarly but lacking gossypol. Aliquots of 10 μl of dialyzed enzyme or gossypol-enzyme complex were assayed using RII phosphopeptide substrate. Ferrous ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 50–500 μm was used to study the ability to recover the activity of gossypol-inhibited CaN according to the procedure described previously (40Wang X.T. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CaN activity was assayed using the pNPP substrate. For preparation of the column, 500 μg of rhCyp18 was immobilized on 250 μg of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Remaining reactive groups of the gel were blocked by the addition of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Subsequently the column was preincubated with 300 nmol of CsA for 1 h. Before and after binding of 30 μg of CaN on the column the beads were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline. Elution of CaN was performed by incubation for 10 min with 100 μm apogossypol hexaacetate, following 100 μm gossypol and 15 μm preformed Cyp18·CsA complex. Eluates were analyzed by Western blotting using in-house rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibodies specific for CaN. The activities of the three protein phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and PP2C were measured with RII phosphopeptide, as described for CaN. For assaying PP2C a final concentration of 30 mmMgCl2 was also included. The protein phosphatase concentrations were adjusted to an activity level of ∼80% dephosphorylation of 10 pmol RII phosphopeptide within 20 min. Protein phosphatase inhibition was evaluated for gossypol at a concentration range of 1–100 μm. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy volunteers using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. CD4 and CD8 T cells (>97% pure) were purified by positive selection using magnetic Multisort-MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The selected cells were cultured at 3 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom, Berlin) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin overnight. Then, lymphocytes were split and preincubated with one of the following compounds at various concentrations as indicated: CsA (AWD, Dresden, Germany), apogossypol hexaacetate, or gossypol at 37 °C for 10 min. Stock solutions of the three compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in each cell sample. T cells were then stimulated with 40 nm PMA and 2 μmionomycin at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were lysed immediately in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, and 0.625% Nonidet P-40) freshly supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice for 20 min and cleared by centrifugation. The proteins were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies against NFATc1 and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or polyclonal antibodies against CaN followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sorted T cells transfected with the NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) by electroporation were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were incubated with CsA, gossypol, or apogossypol hexaacetate for 30 min and then stimulated with 40 nm PMA and 2 μm ionomycin for 5 h. The level of the extracted luciferase from these cells was determined by bioluminescence measurement using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Scintillation wells coated with streptavidin-bound biotinylated 33P-labeled RII phosphopeptide were used to determine human recombinant CaN activity. About 15 pmol/well biotinylated RII phosphopeptide saturated the binding capacity of the streptavidin wells. All experiments were performed at 10 pmol/well RII phosphopeptide. Fig.1 A shows the amount of dephosphorylated RII phosphopeptide for a constant incubation time at different CaN concentrations. The arrow depicts the CaN concentration of 1.32 nm, which was used in all other experiments. As could be inferred from Fig. 1 B the linear range of the dephosphorylation rate for RII phosphopeptide at 1.32 μm CaN covers the 15-min period of incubation. Although the time course of RII dephosphorylation deviates by 8% from linearity for the 20-min dephosphorylation time point, the IC50values determined agreed within experimental error with the IC50 values at lower incubation times. However, the larger amount of product produced after 20 min ensures a high signal-to-noise ratio throughout the experiments. A calmodulin concentration of 50 nm is enough to ensure sufficient CaN activation (data not shown). A standard deviation less than 7% was obtained for the data points of Fig. 1 when using the above assay protocol. The low CaN concentration of the scintillation proximity CaN assay is an essential prerequisite for the kinetic evaluation of effective inhibition as found for Cyp23·CsA (IC50 = 50 nm) or FKBP12·FK506 (IC50 = 50 nm) (5Swanson S.K. Born T. Zydowsky L.D. Cho H. Chang H.Y. Walsh C.T. Rusnak F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3741-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The advantage of this screening assay lies at its high sensitivity by using 33P-labeled RII phosphopeptide, and thus small amounts of CaN are needed. In contrast to the pNPP assay, colored natural compounds of the pool do not interfere in this test. In the library screened for CaN inhibition the cottonseed oil product gossypol turned out to be the only compound active in the lower micromolar range. Gossypol inhibits CaN with an IC50 value of 17 ± 1 μm with the RII phosphopeptide as a substrate and 14 ± 1 μm with pNPP as a substrate. Gossypolone displays a higher inhibitory potency (IC50 = 9±1 and 6 ± 1 μm, respectively), whereas apogossypol hexaacetate is less active in inhibiting CaN (Fig. 2). CaN recovery via dialysis from inhibition in the presence of 120 μm gossypol was obtained with a final yield of 72% of enzyme activity of a gossypol-free control treated similarly. This finding indicates that inhibition was reversible. After a prolonged preincubation (>2 h) of gossypolone and CaN, an addition irreversible term of inhibition of about 15% was observed. Therefore, all kinetic experiments have been performed with a preincubation time of 30 min. On the other hand, 500 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate did not reverse the degree of CaN inactivation in the presence of 20 μm gossypol, indicating that the inhibitor does not act via complexation of divalent metal ions. The alternative CaN substrate pNPP revealed a similar inhibitory potency for gossypol and, when assayed at different pNPP concentrations, gives the first indication of noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 3). To examine the type of CaN inhibition for peptide dephosphorylation, a series of kinetic experiments with a mixture of33P-labeled biotinylated and unlabeled RII phosphopeptides (1:200 concentration ratio) was performed. This mixture exhibits aKm value of 20 ± 3 μm when determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot (data not shown), which corresponds to the Km of 23 μm (41Chan C.P. Gallis B. Blumenthal D.K. Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9890-9895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25 μm (21Enz A. Zenke G. Pombovillar E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2513-2518Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported for nonbiotinylated RII phosphopeptide under similar reaction conditions. As in the pNPP-based assay, noncompetitive inhibition of CaN by gossypol was seen based on the Dixon plot (Fig.4). Because of the complexity of the reaction mixture deviations from the linear behaviors of the plot become visible, which are more prominent in the absence of gossypol. However, the Ki value of 17 μm estimated from the Dixon plot is similar to the aforementioned IC50 values of 17 and 14 μm (Fig.2). To determine whether or not gossypol and the Cyp18·CsA complex share common CaN binding sites, we assayed the residual RII phosphopeptide-dephosphorylating CaN activity at 12 μmgossypol in the presence of different concentrations of the Cyp18·CsA complex (Fig. 5). The concentration of the Cyp18·CsA complex was assumed to be identical to the Cyp18 concentration in the assay buffer at 10 μm CsA because of th"

Furthermore, two truncated DDR1 variants, lacking either the discoidin domain or the stalk region between the discoidin and transmembrane domain, were generated. We showed that (i) the discoidin domain was necessary and sufficient for collagen binding, (ii) only the region between discoidin and transmembrane domain was glycosylated, and (iii) the entire extracellular domain was essential for transmembrane signaling.

In their extracellular region, both receptors show a domain homologous to the Dictyostelium discoideum protein discoidin I. DDR1 and DDR2 are also functionally related by the observation that collagen acts as cognate ligand for both receptors. Whereas DDR1 activation is achieved by all collagens so far tested (types I–VI and VIII), DDR2 is only activated by fibrillar collagens, in particular by collagen type I and type III. In contrast to most other tyrosine kinase receptors, activation of DDRs can take several hours (1Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol.

Human DDR1 is located on chromosome 6p21.3 in close proximity to HLA genes, which belong to the telomeric region (class I) of the major histocompatibility complex (20The MHC Sequence Consortium Nature. 1999; 401: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane regions in DDR1 and DDR2 are much longer than in other receptor tyrosine kinases (176 and 147 amino acids, respectively). Furthermore, the extracellular domain of DDR1 is shed by an unidentified protease, resulting in a 63-kDa membrane-anchored β-subunit and a 54-kDa soluble α-subunit (7Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, five isoforms of DDR1 have been cloned as a result of alternative splicing, designated with the suffixes “a” to “e” (21Alves F. Saupe S. Ledwon M. Schaub F. Hiddemann W. Vogel W.F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The longest transcript codes for DDR1c and translates to a protein with 919 amino acids. Compared with the c isoform, the b isoform lacks 6 amino acids inserted in the kinase domain between exons 13 and 14 (7). The a, d, and e isoforms arise through alternative splicing in the juxtamembrane region. The deletion of exon 11 coding for 37 amino acids gives rise to DDR1a, and the deletion of exons 11 and 12 results in DDR1d. In DDR1e, the first half of exon 10 and all of exons 11 and 12 are missing (21Alves F. Saupe S. Ledwon M. Schaub F. Hiddemann W. Vogel W.F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas DDR1a retains the reading frame and is therefore an active kinase, the coding sequence of DDR1d and DDR1e goes out of frame and renders both isoforms kinase-dead. The 37-amino acid insert in DDR1b shows the motif LLXNPXY, which can interact with the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the Shc adapter protein upon collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (1Vogel W.

Binding of the protein FRS2 has been shown to a chimeric molecule containing the juxtamembrane region of DDR1a (22Foehr E.D. Tatavos A. Tanabe E. Raffioni S. Goetz S. Dimarco E. De Luca M. Bradshaw R.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data imply that the Wnt-5a pathway may overlap with DDR1 signaling (23Jonsson M. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2043-2053PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of DDR1 in the mouse germ line resulted in viable animals that are significantly smaller than their littermates (24Vogel W.F. Aszodi A. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2906-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Female DDR1-null mice show defects in blastocyst implantation and mammary gland development. Decreased proliferation, collagen attachment, and migration have been observed in primary vascular smooth muscle cells cultivated from DDR1-null mice (25Hou G. Vogel W. Bendeck M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). So far, about 20 other proteins with one or two discoidin homology regions have been described from lower invertebrates up to mammals (26Baumgartner S. Hofmann K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bucher P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). During the cell aggregation of Dictyostelium, discoidin I is secreted, functions as a lectin, and is thought to be important in maintenance of morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and the ability to align with other cells during aggregation (27Alexander S. Sydow L.M. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In mammals, discoidin-homologous regions are found in membrane-bound and -secreted proteins. Like the DDR, the neurexin receptor has a single N-terminal discoidin domain, whereas neuropilins have a tandem discoidin domain in the center of their extracellular domain. A C-terminally located tandem discoidin repeat is found in blood clotting factors V and VIII, in the milk proteins MFG-E8 and BA46, and in the endothelial cell-specific Del-1 (28Vogel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Retinoschisin (RS1) is the only protein with a discoidin homology repeat, where a relevance in human disease has been observed. The X-linked inherited disease retinoschisis results in degeneration of the retina, ultimately leading to early blindness in affected males. Retinoschisis is diagnosed as maculopathy, peripheral retinal lesions, and alterations of the vitreous body and has an incidence of 5,000–25,000 in newborns (29George N.D. Yates J.R. Moore A.T. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1996; 114: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The splitting of the inner layers of the retina is believed to be caused by aberrant development of the Müller glia cells in the retina. Recently, the retinoschisis locus was identified on chromosome Xp22 by positional cloning, and the responsible gene was named XLRS-1 (30Sauer C.G. Gehrig A. Warneke-Wittstock R. Marquardt A. Ewing C.C. Gibson A. Lorenz B. Jurklies B. Weber B.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). TheXLRS-1 gene consists of six exons coding for the 224-amino acid-long RS1 protein. A putative leader sequence (amino acids 1–23) is followed by the 157-amino acid-long discoidin repeat. No homology to other proteins is found in the 39- or 5-amino acid-long stretches flanking the discoidin domain N- or C-terminally. Sequence analysis of the XLRS-1 gene in the majority of patients with retinoschisis led to the identification of a variety of mutations in the coding region, mostly in the discoidin repeat. About 125 mutations in the XLRS-1 gene have been described so far, including point mutations as well as deletions of single or multiple nucleotides, leading to frame shifts or truncations (31The Retinoschisis Consortium Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Hiriyanna K.T. Bingham E.L. Yashar B.M. Ayyagari R. Fishman G. Small K.W. Weinberg D.V. Weleber R.G. Lewis R.A. Andreasson S. Richards J.E. Sieving P.A. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More than 80% of these mutations are located in the conserved discoidin repeat. Northern and Western blot analysis in mouse and human tissues found RS1 specifically and only expressed in the eye (33Reid S.N. Akhmedov N.B. Piriev N.I. Kozak C.A. Danciger M. Farber D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas XLRS-1 transcripts were found in the inner layer of the retina, the protein was detected further away in the photoreceptor layer and in bipolar cells. Therefore, RS1 seems to be secreted by underlying cells and then migrates to and potentially exerts its function in close proximity to the photoreceptors. Increased expression of RS1 is detected in human retinoblastoma Weri-Rb1 cells after stimulation with fibronectin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (35Grayson C. Reid S.N. Ellis J.A. Rutherford A. Sowden J.C. Yates J.R. Farber D.B. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that the discoidin domain fold of RS1 is structurally related to the discoidin domain of DDR1. We further show that the discoidin domain of DDR1 is essential for collagen-binding, receptor dimerization, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Single point mutations were introduced using 19-mers with the mutated nucleotide in the middle of the primer. Mutations were introduced into the DDR1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange Kit and isolated fromEscherichia coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The vectors pRK5, used for the expression of DDR1 in human cells, and pET30, used for the expression of recombinant DDR1 discoidin domain in bacteria, have been described earlier (1Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 7Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultivated under the recommended conditions. Rat type I collagen was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Antibodies to DDR1 (amino acids 894–913) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). E. coli BL 21 super codon plus competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with wild type and mutant DDR1 cDNA in the pET30 vector. A single colony from each plate was inoculated in LB medium. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) until A 600 = 0.8–1.0 was reached and stimulated with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (0,1m NaH2PO4, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm imidazole) on a rocker at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min. The Sepharose was washed three times with buffer A, and the bound material was eluted with 0.2m acetic acid, 6 m guanidine HCl. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and detected by Coomassie staining. CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (36Link T.A. Hatzfeld O.M. Unalkat P. Shergill J.K. Cammack R. Mason J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7546-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Semiconfluent 293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Sixteen hours later, cells were transferred to serum-free media for another 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 90 min (or 10, 30, and 90 min for the kinetic analysis) and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cellular lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted with antibodies diluted 1:1,000 (4G10) and 1:500 (DDR1) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% gelatin overnight. Western blots were incubated with mouse and rabbit peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, respectively (Bio-Rad), and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reprobing, the membrane was stripped in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 15 min. Transfected 293 cells were starved overnight. Total cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and incubated with collagen-agarose (Sigma) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were washed three times with HNTG buffer, and bound material was analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against the C terminus of DDR1 (α-DDR1). To analyze glycosylation, transfected 293 cells were starved for 12 h and treated overnight with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 90 min, and total cellular lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. To capture receptor dimers, transfected cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml collagen for 90 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 50 mm sodium bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate for 20 min. DDR1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with DDR1 antibody. Western blots were quantified using Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad). The S.D. value was calculated from three independent experiments. Assay were modified according to a previously published protocol (37Dervillez X. Oudin S. Libyh M.T. Tabary T. Reveil B. Philbert F. Bougy F. Pluot M. Cohen J.H. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tissue culture 96-well plates were coated with different concentrations of type I collagen or bovine serum albumin overnight. Plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. A range of concentrations (1 ng to 10 μg) of total lysate from 293 cells expressing DDR1 were applied. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, plates were washed three times and then incubated with 5 ng of DDR1 antibody/well for 1 h. Wells were washed three times, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution) was added for 1 h. Finally, wells were washed five times and developed using the chromogenic substance o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 12% H2O2. After incubation for 6 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with one volume of 0.5m H2SO4. The OD at 492 and 620 nm was determined, and the A 492 −A 620 value was calculated. All measurements were done in triplicate. One representative result from three independent measurements is shown. The sequence of the DDR1 discoidin domain shows 41% homology to the discoidin domain of RS1. An alignment of all known discoidin domains indicated that 18 amino acids of the ∼160-amino acid-long homology region were invariant in 17 out of 20 sequences (data not shown). From these 18 highly conserved residues, 13 were found to be mutated in patients with retinoschisis (Fig.1). From these 13 amino acids, we selected nine positions and introduced the respective point mutation found in RS1 into the full-length cDNA of DDR1b. To compare the folding of wild type and mutated DDR1 discoidin domains, the respective cDNAs coding for amino acids 28–186 of wild type and of the G36S mutant were cloned into the pET30 vector. Recombinant discoidin domains were expressed and purified from bacteria. The integrity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both proteins appeared as ∼25-kDa single bands (Fig.2 A). CD spectroscopy was used to determine the folding structure. In the wild type, the predicted β-sheet content was 44.7%, and the predicted α-helix content was 15.2% (Fig. 2 B). The G36S mutant had almost identical β-sheet content and a slightly higher percentage of α-helices. We concluded from this result that site-directed mutagenesis of a single residue in the discoidin domain of DDR1 most likely will not change the overall folding structure. The nine mutations shown in Fig. 1 were introduced into the full-length cDNA of DDR1 and transiently transfected into human embryonic fibroblast 293 cells. To activate the tyrosine kinase in DDR1, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml rat collagen type I for 90 min and lysed. Total cellular lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Probing the blot with an antibody against phosphotyrosine showed collagen-dependent phosphorylation of the wild type (Fig. 3 A). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an antibody against the C terminus of DDR1. Analysis of this blot indicated that all mutants were expressed in equal amounts compared with the wild type (Fig.3 B). The signal intensities of receptor phosphorylation were quantified from three independent experiments and normalized with the receptor expression. We found that four of the nine mutants (G36S, W73C, R179W, and E181Q) showed markedly reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type (Table I). A slight reduction of about 30% was observed with G104R, G143D, and P168L. In contrast, mutation of the residues R63W and P158L did not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation.Table IComparison of collagen activation and binding of various mutantsReceptor expressionReceptor activationCollagen binding%%%Wild type100100100G36S108.3 ± 5.954.4 ± 3.883.6 ± 9.9R63W94.9 ± 3.093.2 ± 7.798.1 ± 9.0W73C95.3 ± 1.543.4 ± 5.965.6 ± 5.8G104R112.2 ± 1.770.5 ± 5.074.1 ± 0.8G143D101.6 ± 5.668.2 ± 6.258.9 ± 7.0P158L91.4 ± 1.9114.7 ± 11.747.4 ± 4.3P168L109.7 ± 10.973.8 ± 9.873.2 ± 3.8R179W103.7 ± 5.934.1 ± 3.2187.6 ± 5.9E181Q112.7 ± 3.440.9 ± 6.3183.7 ± 2.9The signal intensity of the Western blots in Figs. 3, A andB, and 4 A was quantified from three independent experiments, and the S.D. was calculated.

Open table in a new tab The signal intensity of the Western blots in Figs. 3, A andB, and 4 A was quantified from three independent experiments, and the S.D. was calculated. The relative receptor activation was normalized with the receptor expression. Values are given as percentages relative to the wild type. Next, we asked if any of the point mutations result in an alteration of the activation kinetics. The mutants were expressed in 293 cells and stimulated for 10, 30, or 90 min (Fig. 3 C). The time course of two of the mutants tested (P158L and P168L) showed a similar pattern of activation compared with the wild type. Moreover, phosphorylation of the mutants G36S and R179W were significantly reduced but had no effect on the time course of activation. Finally, the mutant E181Q had no detectable increase of phosphorylation during the time period studied. Equal amounts of protein lysates obtained from 293 cells transfected with either wild type or mutant DDR1 were incubated with collagen covalently coupled to agarose beads. The beads were washed three times with HNTG buffer. Affinity-purified proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with the C-terminal antibody against DDR1. The signal intensities of three independent experiments were quantified and calculated relative to the wild type signal (Table I). Two of the nine mutants (G36S and R63W) bound equally well to collagen beads as the wild type (Fig. 4 A). Signals for the mutants W73C, G104R, and P168L were slightly lower compared with the wild type (Table I). However, the amounts of G143D and P158L retained on the beads were much lower, indicating a loss of collagen binding affinity. In contrast, the mutants R179W and E181Q showed about 2-fold higher binding to collagen (Fig. 4 A). In order to quantify the differences in collagen affinity between wild type and mutant DDR1, we established a receptor-ligand binding assay. First, specific binding of DDR1 was shown by incubating ELISA plates coated with various concentrations of type I collagen together with lysates from 293 cells overexpressing DDR1. Concentration-dependent binding of DDR1 was observed with collagen-coated plates but not with control plates and was observed with as little as 10 ng of collagen/well (Fig. 4 B). Next, we selected two mutants, R63W and P158L, for the receptor-ligand binding assay. Both mutants do not affect DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, but they vary in collagen binding. The mutant R63W showed no significant difference in collagen affinity compared with the wild type, whereas P158L had a drastically impaired collagen-binding capacity. Lysates from cells expressing either of these mutants, wild type DDR1, or control vector were subjected to the ELISA-based receptor-ligand binding assay (Fig. 4 C). Over a range of 4 orders of magnitude in protein concentration (1 ng to 10 μg), the R63W mutant showed only an approximately 10% reduction in collagen affinity, whereas the binding of P158L was about 3–4-fold lower than the wild type. The ELISA data strongly support the binding results obtained by the solid-phase collagen-binding assay shown in Fig.4 A. A summary of the responses by all mutants is given in Table I. The mutation in one of nine conserved residues (R63W) did not drastically alter ligand binding or activation. The two mutants G36S and P168L were still able to significantly bind to collagen, but they failed to be fully tyrosine-phosphorylated. Mutation of W73C, G104R, or G143D simultaneously affected collagen binding and receptor activation. Two mutants (R179W and E181Q) showed reduced kinase activation but increased collagen binding. The opposite seemed to be the case for P158L, which is equally strong activated by collagen but has significantly less affinity to collagen compared with the wild type. Next, we created two deletion mutants in the DDR1 extracellular domain. By joining amino acid 31 with 186, we generated a mutant lacking the discoidin domain, called Δ32–185 (Fig.5). The second mutant was a deletion of amino acids 199–412, which retains the discoidin domain but lacks the stalk region (Δ199–412). The mutants and wild type DDR1 were expressed in 293 cells and stimulated with collagen. Total lysates were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting (Fig.6 A). Whereas wild type DDR1 showed collagen-dependent phosphorylation, both mutants were not phosphorylated on tyrosine. Reprobing of the blot indicated that both deletion mutants were expressed at levels comparable with those seen in the wild type (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis of affinity-purified protein lysates was used to compare the ability of the mutants to bind to collagen agarose with that of the wild type. The results indicated that the wild type and the Δ199–412 mutant bound to collagen-agarose (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, the Δ32–185 mutant did not bind, suggesting that the discoidin domain is essential for collagen binding and that discoidin and stalk region are necessary for receptor activation.Figure 6The discoidin domain of DDR1 is essential for collagen binding. Wild type and deletion mutants were expressed in 293 cells and stimulated with collagen. Tyrosine phosphorylation was monitored by Western blotting of total cellular lysates (A). The blot was reprobed with an antibody against the C terminus of DDR1 (B). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with collagen-agarose.

On a high fat diet, male apoB/BATless mice became obese, hypercholesterolemic, hypertriglyceridemic, and hyperinsulinemic compared with control apoB mice. Fast performance liquid chromatography revealed increased triglyceride concentrations in intermediate density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Inhibition of lipolysis by the drug, tetrahydrolipostatin, demonstrated that very low density lipoprotein-sized particles were initially secreted. Metabolic studies employing Triton WR-1339 and either [3H]glycerol or [3H]palmitate showed that the hypertriglyceridemia in apoB/BATless mice was due to the increased synthesis and secretion of triglyceride. Furthermore, lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were not defective. ApoB was also secreted at increased rates in the apoB/BATless mice. Similar levels of apoB mRNA in apoB and apoB/BATless mice indicated that apoB secretion was regulated post-transcriptionally. LDL receptor mRNA was increased in the apoB/BATless mice, indicating that the observed increase in apoB-lipoprotein secretion was not due to their decreased reuptake. Finally, mRNA levels of the large subunit of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, a required component for very low density protein assembly, were not different between apoB and apoB/BATless mice.

As such, understanding the processes that regulate the secretion of apoB has been the subject of extensive clinical and molecular investigation. Cell culture experiments have provided convincing data that the primary regulation of apoB secretion occurs post-translationally and that the intracellular degradation of apoB is an important determinant of the amount of the protein that is ultimately secreted (7Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J.

In several cell systems, the availability of intracellular triglyceride has been shown to affect the rates of apoB degradation and thus secretion. Specifically, in HepG2 cells, incubation with oleate led to the increased secretion of apoB into the medium by preventing the intracellular degradation of the protein (10Wu X. Sakata N. Dixon J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1200-1210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This stimulatory effect of oleate on apoB secretion has also been demonstrated in McARH-7777 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line (11White A.L. Graham D.L. LeGros J. Pease R.J. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); perfused livers from fasted rats (12Salam W.H. Wilcox H.G. Heimberg M. Biochem.

Imposing insulin resistance on these mice was achieved by crossing them with mice selectively lacking brown adipose tissue as a result of genetic ablation (20Lowell B.B., V, S.S. Hamann A.

As a murine model of obesity and insulin resistance, mice lacking BAT exhibit peripheral insulin resistance, i.e. they have fewer insulin receptors and dampened insulin receptor kinase activity in fat and muscle as well as decreased expression of the glucose transporter, GLUT-4, in fat (21Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,22Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Z. Ernahrungswiss. 1998; 37 (Suppl. 1): 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that imposing insulin resistance onto a mouse with human-like levels of apoB100 leads to increased synthesis of TG and post-transcriptional increases in the secretion of apoB100. Congenic human apoB transgenic mice of the C57BL/6J background were generated as described (18Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BATless mice (20Lowell B.B., V, S.S. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice were created in the FVB/N strain by using the promoter from a BAT-specific protein, uncoupling protein-1, to drive the expression of the A chain of diphtheria toxin. BATless mice were identified by PCR using sequences specific to the diphtheria toxin gene. The breeding of heterozygous apoB mice with heterozygous BATless mice resulted in the generation of F1 mice with four possible genotypes: those that expressed no transgene (wild type controls), those that expressed either apoB or diptheria toxin, and those that had both transgenes (apoB/BATless). All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (light cycle was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and were weaned onto a Western-type diet (number 88137; Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI) containing 21% (w/w) fat (polyunsaturated/saturated = 0.07), 0.15% (w/w) cholesterol, and 19.5% casein. The Western-type diet was free of sodium cholate. Blood samples were obtained from the retroorbital plexus, plasma was isolated at 4 °C, and samples were immediately frozen at −70 °C. The ages of animals for any given experiment are specified under “Results.” Total plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations were measured using commercial kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on a Hitachi automated spectrophotometer (model 705). Plasma human apoB levels were measured using a Beckman Array 360 nephelometer with modifications made for the assessment of mouse plasma (23Maciejko J.J. Levinson S.S. Markyvech L. Smith M.P. Blevins R.D. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The antibody used in this assay does not measure mouse apoB. 2P. Siri, H. N. Ginsberg, and L.-S. Huang, unpublished data. Glucose levels were measured using an enzymatic kit (number 315-100; Sigma-Aldrich). FFA levels were measured by colorimetry using a commercial kit (number 994-75409) from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay using a commercial kit (number SRI-13K) obtained from Linco Research (St. Charles, MO). Glucose tolerance tests were conducted after an overnight fast. After a base-line blood collection, mice (n = 5–6 in each group) were injected intraperitoneally with 15% glucose in a 0.9% NaCl solution (1 g of glucose/kg of body weight). Subsequent blood samples were collected at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min for the determination of plasma glucose levels. Insulin tolerance tests were performed after a 4-h fast. Mice (n = 8 in each group) were injected intraperitoneally with human insulin (0.6 IU/kg of body weight). Glucose concentrations were determined at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. Pooled plasma samples from 4–6 mice (200 μl) fasted from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. were subjected to FPLC analysis using two Superose 6 columns in series (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Eighty 0.5-ml fractions were collected. TG and cholesterol determinations of each fraction were made using commercial kits (Sigma-Aldrich) adapted to 96-well microtiter plates. After a 4-h fast, apoB/BATless mice were injected via a tail vein with either THL (Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) at 0.1 mm/ml plasma volume in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. Mice were bled prior to and 2 h after injection. Plasma samples from the 2-h time point were pooled and subjected to FPLC analysis. Post-heparin plasma was obtained from apoB/BATless and apoB mice after an 8-h fast. The animals were injected via a tail vein with 10 units of heparin (Elkins-Sinn, Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ). This dose maximally stimulates lipase activity in plasma. Blood was collected by retroorbital phlebotomy 5 min later. Plasma samples were frozen at −70 °C within 30 min. Total post-heparin lipase activity was measured using the glycerol-based emulsion described by Hocquetteet al. (24Hocquette J.F. Graulet B. Olivecrona T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with heat-inactivated human serum as a source of apoC-II. HL activity was determined by incubating the reaction in 1m NaCl. LPL activity was calculated as the difference between total lipase activity and HL activity. In vivo secretion rates of TG and apoB in age-matched animals were determined as described previously (18Voyiaziakis E. Ko C. O'Rourke S.M. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2004-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of TG secretion rates, 4-h fasted mice were injected intravenously with 500 mg/kg Triton WR 1339 as a 15 g/dl solution in 0.9% NaCl. Plasma VLDL clearance is virtually completely inhibited in mice under these conditions, because Triton coats lipoprotein particles and prevents their lipolysis (25Scanu A.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1965; 3: 63-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected at base line (preinjection) and at 30, 60, and 90 min after injection for the determination of TG levels, with the rate of rise of TG in plasma indicative of the rate at which TG is being secreted from the liver (26Otway S., and D. S., R. (1967) J. Physiol.(Lond.) 190, 321–332Google Scholar). ApoB secretion rates were measured in 4-h fasted mice by intravenous injection of Triton WR 1339 together with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/mouse). Blood was taken at base line and at 60 and 120 min after injection. In three experiments, VLDL samples were isolated from 250 μl of plasma by ultracentrifugation (Beckman TL-100) at 100,000 rpm for 3.5 h with a density of d < 1.006 g/ml. Equal volumes of VLDL samples were subjected to 4% SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray films to visualize labeled apoB proteins. In six other experiments, whole plasma samples (10 μl), instead of VLDL samples, were used directly for SDS-PAGE. The intensity of apoB proteins was assessed by densitometry. To determine the rates of appearance of newly synthesized TG in VLDL, animals were injected with Triton WR 1339 and either 100 μCi of [3H]glycerol or 150 μCi of [3H]palmitate as a tracer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). [3H]Palmitate in ethanol was complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as described (27Coburn C.T. Knapp Jr., F.F. Febbraio M. Beets A.L. Silverstein R.L. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32523-32529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected preinjection and at 30, 60, and 90 min post-injection. VLDL samples were isolated from plasma as described above. TG was isolated from these VLDL samples by adsorption of phospholipids with Zeolite (Sigma-Aldrich) in isopropyl alcohol (21% w/v) (28Fletcher M.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1968; 22: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The organic layer was allowed to dry overnight, and sample counts (dpm) were taken to represent the amount of labeled glycerol or palmitate incorporated into VLDL-TG. To measure liver stores of TG, total liver lipids were extracted according to method modified from that of Folch et al. (29Folch J. Lees M. G. H. S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, snap frozen liver tissues (∼150 mg) were homogenized and extracted twice with a chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) solution. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen gas and resolubilized in chloroform. An aliquot of this Folch extraction was resuspended in an aqueous solution containing 2% Triton X-100 (30Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) for the determination of TG mass. [14C]Triolein was added to each sample before lipid extraction to account for the percentage of recovery, and final TG concentrations were adjusted accordingly. A second aliquot of the resolubulized sample was subjected to thin layer chromatography with hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1) as the solvent to determine tritium counts associated with TG. Liver TG specific activities (dpm/mg) were calculated by dividing the counts associated with TG by TG mass. The rate of secretion of newly synthesized TG from the liver was estimated by dividing the [3H]TG dpm (either from [3H]glycerol or [3H]palmitate) that accumulated in plasma between 30 and 90 min after Triton by hepatic [3H]TG specific activity at 90 min. Total cellular RNA samples were isolated from the livers using guanidinium thiocyanate. RNA (10 μg) was separated on 6% formaldehyde, 0.8% agarose gels and then transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridizations were carried out as described previously (31Heinemann T. Metzger S. Fisher E.A. Breslow J.L. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A human cDNA probe containing 6 kilobases of human apoB sequences in exon 26 (31) was used to detect human apoB mRNA. A mouse β-actin riboprobe (Ambion Co., Austin, TX) was used in each experiment to normalize for loading of RNA samples. For quantification, autoradiograms were scanned with a densitometer. The probe used for mouse LDL receptor has been described previously (32Jiang X.C. Masucci-Magoulas L. Mar J. Lin M. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA probe for mouse MTP was generated by amplification of the target gene from liver RNA from male C57BL/B6 mice by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-TGT TTG GAATTC AGC TTA GGC CTG TCA CAT −3′; antisense, 5′-AGA CTG AAT TCC ATT GAA CCA GAA ATA TCA-3′ (GenBankTM accession number, L47970). The size of the amplified product was 219 base pairs. Base substitutions made in the MTP sequence to engineer an EcoRI site in the sense strand are underlined. PCR products were cloned into a PCRII vector using a TA cloning kit obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). DNA sequences of each clone were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer). Antisense probes were synthesized using an in vitrotranscription kit obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and [32P]αCTP (800 Ci/mmol). Either mouse β-actin or cyclophilin (Ambion) was used as reference RNA to account for variations in total RNA used. RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously (32Jiang X.C. Masucci-Magoulas L. Mar J. Lin M. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA (10 μg) were hybridized to both a test and reference probe in hybridization buffer (30 μl) and incubated at 48 °C overnight. The next day, 20 units of RNase T2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the mix. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, RNase was removed by phenol extraction, and protected RNA fragments were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA). Protected fragments were separated in 5% or 8% PAGE, 7 m urea gels. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray films for 1–2 days at −80 °C. For quantitation, protected RNA fragments were cut and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The means and standard deviations are presented. Statistically significant differences (i.e. p < 0.05; two-tailed) in mean values among more than two groups were determined by analysis of variance. Differences in the mean values between two groups were assessed by Student's ttest. The response to glucose and insulin challenges was measured by determining the areas under the curve, and the significant differences between the apoB and apoB/BATless mice were tested by Student'st test. To generate an insulin-resistant mouse model with human-like dyslipidemia, we crossed transgenic mice overexpressing human apoB100 with mice selectively lacking brown adipose tissue by genetic ablation. This cross led to the generation of mice with neither (WT), either (apoB or BATless), or both transgenes (apoB/BATless). Based on data indicating that female apoB/BATless mice were not insulin-resistant,2 only results from male mice are presented. On the Western type diet, all four groups of mice gained weight steadily (n = 17–27 in each group) (Fig.1). By 10 weeks of age and at each time point thereafter, BATless and apoB/BATless mice were significantly heavier than apoB and WT mice (p < 0.0001). At 22 weeks, apoB/BATless and BATless mice averaged ∼60 g. ApoB and WT mice were ∼45 g. Plasma cholesterol and TG concentrations obtained after fasting the mice from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. were stable throughout the experimental period. Representative data at 19 weeks are shown in Fig.2 (n = 9–15 in each group). WT and BATless mice had similar cholesterol levels at 176 ± 21 and 152 ± 24 mg/dl, respectively. ApoB mice showed the expected response to the Western type diet (33Voyiaziakis E. Goldberg I.J. Plump A.S. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 313-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an increase in plasma cholesterol levels to 321 ± 35 mg/dl (p < 0.001 versus WT and BATless). In apoB/BATless mice, cholesterol concentrations were even greater (466 ± 98 mg/dl) (p < 0.001 versus the other three genotypes). A similar pattern was observed when we measured fasting plasma TG concentrations (Fig. 2 B). ApoB mice had elevated TG levels relative to both WT and BATless mice (137 ± 27 mg/dlversus 67 ± 30 and 34 ± 9 mg/dl, respectively;p < 0.001 for both comparisons). ApoB/BATless mice had even higher plasma TG levels (271 ± 61 mg/dl) (p< 0.001 versus the other three genotypes). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA levels were also determined (n = 9–14 in each group) (TableI). Plasma glucose levels were not consistently different among the four groups of mice, whereas plasma insulin levels were significantly higher in mice in which BAT was ablated. The hyperinsulinemia observed in the BATless and apoB/BATless mice relative to apoB and WT mice was indicative of insulin resistance. To confirm insulin resistance in our model of interest, apoB/BATless mice were subjected to glucose and insulin tolerance tests with apoB mice as controls. ApoB/BATless mice were significantly impaired in their ability to clear exogenously administered glucose compared with apoB mice (Fig. 3 A). Insulin tolerance tests further revealed a greater resistance to insulin in apoB/BATless mice compared with apoB mice (Fig. 3 B). Plasma FFA concentrations did not vary significantly among the four groups after an 8-h fast. Because fatty acids become a more important fuel source during starvation, we extended the fasting period to an overnight 16-h fast in an attempt to induce an increase in fatty acid concentrations and detect potential differences that could not be seen with the daytime 8-h fast. Although we observed the expected increase in plasma concentrations of FFA with a longer fast, there were no differences in FFA concentrations according to genotype.Table IPlasma glucose, insulin, and fatty acid concentrations in male miceGlucose (8-h fast)Insulin (8-h fast)FFA (8-h fast)FFA (16-h fast)mg/dlng/mlmEq/litermEq/literWT214 ± 1042.07 ± 1.800.46 ± 0.120.56 ± 0.11BATless225 ± 558.22 ± 9.041-aSubsequent t tests showed significantly higher insulin levels in BATless and apoB/BATless mice compared to apoB and WT mice. .0.34 ± 0.090.54 ± 0.13ApoB246 ± 941.90 ± 2.070.46 ± 0.110.58 ± 0.06ApoB/BATless224 ± 694.37 ± 2.041-aSubsequent t tests showed significantly higher insulin levels in BATless and apoB/BATless mice compared to apoB and WT mice. .0.46 ± 0.150.59 ± 0.15Each value represents the average fasting plasma concentration of 9–14 male mice at 16–22 weeks of age.

Insulin data were normalized by square root adjustment for statistical analyses. By analysis of variance, insulin concentrations were significantly different (p < 0.001) between the four groups of animals. The sizes and relative concentrations of lipoprotein particles secreted by apoB/BATless and apoB mice were determined by FPLC (n = 4–6 in each group). Compared with the apoB mice, apoB/BATless mice had a more heterogeneous distribution of cholesterol in the IDL/LDL region, with more cholesterol in a size range that was consistent with the presence of smaller LDL (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, apoB/BATless mice also showed a significant reduction of HDL cholesterol relative to apoB mice. The distribution of TG among lipoprotein subfractions was similar in both groups of mice (Fig.4 B), with quantitatively much more TG seen in the IDL/LDL region in apoB/BATless mice, a finding consistent with the differences observed in plasma TG levels. Despite the increased IDL/LDL TG in apoB/BATless mice as compared with apoB mice, VLDL-TG was not present. Because rapid rates of in vivo lipoprotein TG lipolysis in mice (34Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) may have limited our ability to detect nascent VLDL-TG by FPLC, we conducted experiments to determine whether VLDL-sized particles were initially secreted in the apoB/BATless mice. THL inhibits LPL and HL activities by binding to their active sites (35Lookene A. Skottova N. Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We injected apoB/BATless mice (n = 2) intravenously with THL and collected blood samples after 2 h. Plasma TG levels were increased to 596 and 627 mg/dl in these two mice. Fig. 5 shows the altered lipid distribution in pooled plasma from the apoB/BATless mice after the administration of THL. A peak of TG and cholesterol in the VLDL size range was clearly demonstrated (compare with Fig. 4). The lipid levels of apoB/BATless mice (n = 2) injected with Me2SO alone did not change, and the FPLC profiles showed no redistribution of either TG or cholesterol (data not shown). These results indicated that under normal conditions, nascent VLDL were initially secreted in apoB/BATless mice, but these particles were subjected to rapid lipolysis, resulting in the accumulation of TG in IDL/LDL particles. To better understand the basis of the increased plasma TG levels in apoB/BATless mice, TG secretion rates were determined at 22 weeks using Triton WR 1339, a surfactant that coats lipoprotein particles and inhibits their lipolysis. With lipoprotein catabolism suppressed, the increase in plasma TG over time is indicative of the rate at which TG is being secreted from the liver (26Otway S., and D. S., R. (1967) J. Physiol.(Lond.) 190, 321–332Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows the increase in TG concentrations over 90 min in apoB versus apoB/BATless mice after the intravenous administration of Triton (n = 21–22 in each group). The increase in TG between 30 and 90 min was found to be twice as high in apoB/BATless versus apoB mice (382 ± 76 versus 191 ± 103 mg/dl; p < 0.001). The calculation of TG secretion as a rate showed that apoB/BATless mice secreted 2.5 times the TG secreted by apoB mice (12.3 ± 2.6 versus 4.9 ± 2.9 mg/h for apoB/BATless and apoB mice, respectively; p < 0.001). Similar turnover studies in BATless and WT mice (n = 6 in each group) revealed TG secretion rates comparable with apoB/BATless and apoB mice, respectively (10.2 ± 4.6 and 4.9 ± 1.5 mg/hour for BATless and WT, respectively). These observations were noteworthy given the significantly lower plasma levels of TG in WT and BATless mice compared with their littermates carrying the human apoB transgene (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the greater TG secretion rate in apoB/BATless mice was due to increased de novo synthesis of TG, additional turnover experiments using either [3H]glycerol or [3H]palmitate in addition to Triton WR 1339 were conducted. Because increased liver TG stores in apoB/BATlessversus apoB mice could dilute th"

Kinetic studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed that TRO, RSG, and rottlerin shortened the half-life of p21Cip1 protein. TRO, RSG, and rottlerin inhibited PDGF-induced expression of p21Cip1, but they did not affect insulin-induced expression of p21Cip1.

Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PKCδ rescued the down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression both by TRO and RSG in PDGF-treated RASMC.

Mitogenic activation of cyclin D·CDK4, cyclin D·CDK6, and cyclin E·CDK2 during the G1 phase results in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene (Rb) proteins. In its hyperphosphorylated state, Rb functions as a gatekeeper for the G1 → S transition by binding and sequestering E2F, a transcription factor that induces the expression of a battery of genes that encode the enzymatic machinery for S phase DNA synthesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) can negatively regulate the mitogen-induced cascade of G1 events by inhibiting CDK activity and preventing Rb phosphorylation (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Consistent with the view that CDKIs are major negative regulators of the cell cycle, overexpression of Cip/Kip family members (p21Cip1, p27Kip1) blocks the G1exit in VSMC and other cell types (5Tanner F.C.

Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Data emerging from recent studies, however, suggest that CDKIs p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 can also function as positive regulators during the G1 phase as assembly factors to promote formation of cyclin·CDK holoenzyme complexes (3Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5157) Google Scholar, 7LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Such a role for CDKIs may explicate apparent paradoxical observations that p21Cip1 is frequently up-regulated after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells (8Rao G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). In rat VSMC cell lines, prevention of mitogen-induced p21Cip1 expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (10Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We recently reported that ligands for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) inhibited Rb phosphorylation and G1 → S transition in rat aortic VSMC (11Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the antiproliferative effects of PPARγ ligands were accompanied by an inhibition of the induction of p21Cip1 by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plus insulin. This inhibition of the mitogenic induction of p21Cip1 by PPARγ ligands may be a mechanism contributing to the arrest of VSMC in the G1 phase. The protein kinase C (PKC) pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating p21Cip1 expression, and it can be divided into three groups on structural and functional bases (12Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): the conventional (c)PKC isoenzymes α, β, and γ, which are dependent on calcium, diacylglycerol, and phospholipid for activity; the novel (n)PKC isoenzymes δ, ε, θ, and η, which are calcium-independent; and the atypical (a)PKC isoenzymes ζ and τ, which are independent of both calcium and diacylglycerol. Control of p21Cip1 levels by PKC signaling appears to be complex, involving transcriptional (13Zezula J. Sexl V. Hutter C. Karel A. Schutz W. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29967-29974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (14Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several previous studies have demonstrated that PPARγ ligands can inhibit signaling through PKC pathways (15Yasunari K. Kohno M. Kano H. Yokokawa K. Minami M. Yoshikawa J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Kanoh Y. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16690-16696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether PPARγ ligands inhibit the up-regulation of p21Cip1 during G1 in VSMC through effects on PKC. We report that PPARγ ligands attenuated mitogen-induced p21Cip1 expression at the post-translational level by enhancing protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (PTPase) activity and decreasing PKCδ phosphorylation and activity. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) were prepared from thoracic aorta of 2–3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats by using the explant technique. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 200 mml-glutamine. For all experiments, early passaged (passages 5–8) RASMC were grown to 60–70% confluence and made quiescent by serum starvation (0.4%, FBS) for at least 24 h. Unless specified otherwise, PPARγ ligands and pharmacologic inhibitors were added 30 min before the addition of mitogens, human recombinant PDGF-BB (Sigma), and/or insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis) at a final concentration of 0.67 nm (20 ng/ml) and 1 μm, respectively. For all data shown, each individual experiment was performed using an independent preparation of RASMC. Troglitazone (TRO) was kindly provided by Parke Davis (Ann Arbor, MI). Rosiglitazone (RSG) was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline (King of Prussia, PA). PKC inhibitors, GF 109203X, calphostin C, Gö 6976, and rottlerin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cycloheximide was from Sigma. The selective Src family protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2 (17Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), the inactive analog, PP3, as well as the PTPase inhibitors sodium orthovanadate and dephostatin were obtained from Calbiochem. Adenovirus encoding mouse PKCδ (Ax-PKCδ), driven by a modified chicken β-actin promoter was constructed as reported previously (18Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant type 5 adenovirus expressing the lacZ gene was generated using the Adeno-X Expression System (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. Palo Alto, CA). RASMC in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS were infected with Ax-PKCδ or Ax-LacZ at 20 pfu/cell. 48 h after infection, RASMC were made quiescent by serum starvation (0.4% FBS) for 24 h and stimulated with PDGF in the presence or absence of PPARγ ligands. 24 h after the stimulation with PDGF, total cell lysates were obtained and analyzed by Western blotting using antibody against nPKCδ (Santa Cruz). Infection efficiency (>90%) was established by staining for β-galactosidase activity using a β-galactosidase staining kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Western blotting was performed as described previously (11Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using specific antibodies against nPKCδ, p21Cip1 (6246, Santa Cruz) and phosphorylated Src (pY416, Upstate Biochemistry, Lake Placid, NY) at a 1:200 concentration. Immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). RASMC (in a 100-mm plate) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz), which recognized all phosphotyrosines nonspecifically. The immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 25 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blotting. The probe for p21Cip1 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were also probed with Chinese hamster ovary B cDNA to assess equal loading of samples. RASMC (in 100-mm plates) were harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer and homogenized by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After preclearing the lysate by adding 0.25 μg of normal rabbit IgG together with 20 μl of resuspended protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz), 1 μg of anti-PKCδ antibody was added to the supernatant. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-agarose was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. To measure the background activity of whole cell lysates, one sample omitted anti-PKCδ antibody from the incubation mixture. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed four times with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was suspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and stored in ice before kinase assay. PKCδ activity was measured using the protein kinase C enzyme assay (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described before (19Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 25 μl of assay mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% sodium azide, 2 mol%l-α-phosphatidylserine, 6 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 225 μmPKC substrate peptide) without calcium chloride, 25 μl of ATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% sodium azide, 150 mm ATP, 45 mm magnesium acetate), and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to each immunoprecipitated sample and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 100 μl of stop reagent. Peptide binding papers were used to separate phosphorylated peptide. The papers were washed with 5% acetic acid twice and then were transferred to scintillation vials for 32P counting. The presence of PKCδ in the immunoprecipitate was confirmed by Western blotting. RASMC were harvested at the indicated time after the stimulation of PDGF. Cells were lysed in phosphate-free buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) using a sonicator. The PTPase activity in the whole cell lysate was measured by a nonradioactive photometric enzyme immunoassay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis) as described previously (20Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F.B.G. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed directly in the wells of a microtiter plate with 100 mm biotin-labeled synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide substrate bound to the streptavidin matrix. After the addition of 100 μm vanadate to quench the reactions, the fractions of unmetabolized substrate in the reactions were determined immunochemically using peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The development of color was monitored at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Sigma). PPARγ ligands attenuated the induction of p21Cip1 in quiescent RASMC induced to enter the S phase by stimulation with the competence factor PDGF (0.67 nm) and the progression factor insulin (1 μm) (11Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Insulin at these supraphysiological concentrations likely also induces mitogenic signaling through the insulin-like growth factor I pathway. To investigate the mechanism of this regulation more precisely, we analyzed the kinetics of p21Cip1 induction by mitogens. In quiescent RASMC, p21Cip1 protein expression was almost undetectable but was induced as early as 2 h after mitogenic stimulation with PDGF plus insulin (P+I) (Fig. 1 Aa, P+I). Protein levels of p21Cip1 continued to increase up to 24 h after treatment. Pretreatment of PPARγ ligands TRO and RSG had no effect on the early phase induction of p21Cip1 (2–6 h). In marked contrast, accumulation of p21Cip1 protein at later stages of the mitogenic response (12–24 h) was attenuated significantly by these ligands (24 h; TRO, 67 ± 8.5% inhibition; RSG, 62 ± 6.2% inhibition; p < 0.05versus P+I, n = 3, Fig. 1, Aa andAb). To investigate whether these effects were exerted via regulation of p21Cip1 mRNA, we analyzed the kinetics of mRNA induction by Northern blotting. Consistent with the protein induction, p21Cip1 mRNA levels were induced as early as 1 h after mitogenic stimulation with P+I (Fig. 1 B, P+I). No further induction of p21Cip1 mRNA was observed between 12 and 24 h despite sustained protein induction during this period. TRO and RSG had no effect on p21Cip1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1 B, P+I+TRO and P+I+RSG). These data suggest that PPARγ ligands attenuated mitogenic induction of p21Cip1 at a post-transcriptional level by decreasing accumulation of p21Cip1 protein. One mechanism identified which regulates mitogenic induction of p21Cip1 involves the PKC pathway. We therefore explored the possible involvement of the PKC pathway in mitogen-induced p21Cip1 expression and its inhibition by PPARγ ligands. Pretreatment with the PKC specific inhibitors calphostin C and GF 109203X attenuated the mitogen-induced expression of p21Cip1 (24 h; calphostin C, 53.8 ± 9.6% inhibition; GF 109203X, 51.0 ± 8.7% inhibition; bothp < 0.01 versus P+I, n = 4, Fig. 2 A). Because GF 109203X and calphostin C can inhibit both conventional and novel PKCs, we attempted to identify which PKC isoform(s) was required for the mitogenic induction of p21Cip1. Inhibition of conventional PKC with Gö 6976 had no effect on mitogenic induction of p21Cip1 (Fig. 2 A). The PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin markedly suppressed p21Cip1 induction in a dose-dependent manner (2.5 μm; 61 ± 9.8% inhibition, p < 0.01 versus P+I,n = 4; Fig. 2, A and B). We also examined the effect of rottlerin on the kinetics of p21Cip1induction. Similar to the effects of PPARγ ligands, accumulation of p21Cip1 protein at later times after stimulation was attenuated by rottlerin. Rottlerin had no effect on p21Cip1mRNA expression (data not shown). The stability of p21Cip1 protein was examined in mitogen-stimulated RASMC. After treatment of cells with PDGF and insulin for 12 h, cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. At the indicated time, steady-state levels of p21Cip1 protein were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). The half-life of p21Cip1 protein in mitogen-stimulated cells was estimated at 3.6 h (n = 3, Fig. 3 B). In contrast, in cells treated with PPARγ ligands, the half-life of p21Cip1 was shortened to 1.5 h for TRO and 1.6 h for RSG (both n = 3). Rottlerin also enhanced the degradation of p21Cip1 protein with an estimated half-life of 2.1 h (n = 3). The effect of PDGF and insulin on the PKCδ-dependent induction of p21Cip1 was checked separately because they function as a competence factor and progression factor, respectively, for entry into the S phase. TRO and RSG inhibited the protein induction of p21Cip1 by PDGF, whereas the induction by insulin was small and not affected by either ligand (Fig. 4, A andB). TRO was more potent than RSG in inhibiting PDGF-induced p21Cip1 expression. Unlike RSG, TRO is a bifunctional ligand for PPARγ and contains an α-tocopherol moiety conferring a potential antioxidant activity that could contribute to its effect on p21Cip1. PDGF-induced expression of p21Cip1 was also potently inhibited by the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, although insulin-induced p21Cip1 expression was not affected (Fig. 4, A and B). Although TRO, RSG, and rottlerin inhibited PDGF-dependent induction of p21Cip1to a similar extent, this does not necessarily indicate a common mechanism of action. These results, however, do identify PKCδ as a potential target for the effects of PPARγ ligands on p21Cip1. To explore further the potential relationship among PPARγ ligands, PKCδ, and p21Cip1 expression, we examined the effects of PPARγ ligands on PKCδ activity after stimulation of VSMC with either PDGF or insulin. First, we checked the kinetics of activation of PKCδ in response to stimulation with PDGF because it was reported recently that PDGF initiated two distinct phases (acute and sustained) of PKC activity in HepG2 cells (21Balciunaite E. Jones S. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We measured specific activity for PKCδ by using anti-PKCδ antibody and by eliminating Ca2+ from the reaction solution in immunocomplex kinase assay. As early as 5 min after the stimulation with PDGF, PKCδ activity transiently increased by 3.6-fold. After this initial surge, we observed a smaller sustained peak 12–18 h after the stimulation (∼2.5-fold induction, Fig. 5 A). Because our data suggested that the regulation of p21Cip1 expression decreased at a post-transcriptional level 12 h and later after mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 1), we focused on late phase activity of PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 5 B, PPARγ ligands TRO and RSG attenuated PDGF-induced PKCδ activity (TRO, 97.2 ± 7.2% inhibition; RSG, 67.6 ± 7.9% inhibition; both p< 0.01 versus PDGF alone, n = 4). Importantly, insulin did not induce PKCδ activity at 12 h after stimulation, and PPARγ ligands had no effect on the PKCδ activity at this time point. This result is consistent with our data that the induction of p21Cip1 by insulin was not affected with either PPARγ ligand (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data identified the PDGF → PKCδ pathway as a putative target for PPARγ ligand regulation of p21Cip1 expression. To confirm that inhibition of PKCδ activity by PPARγ ligands results in the attenuation of the mitogenic induction of p21Cip1, we examined the effects of overexpressing PKCδ on their inhibitory effects. RASMC infected with 20 pfu/cell of adenovirus harboring wild-type PKCδ gene expressed high levels of PKCδ compared with control RASMC infected with 20 pfu/cell of an adenovirus harboring thelacZ gene as assayed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 A). RASMC overexpressing PKCδ exhibited an ∼5-fold increase in enzymatic activity in response to PDGF compared with cells infected with adenovirus expressing lacZ (Fig. 6 B). Overexpression of PKCδ prevented PPARγ ligand-mediated down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression (Fig. 6 C). Activation of the PDGF or epidermal growth factor receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (22Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

We therefore examined tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in PDGF-treated RASMC and the impact of PPARγ ligands on this process. To detect tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ antibody. Consistent with previous reports (24Blake R.A. Garcia P.P. Parker P.J. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), PDGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ with biphasic kinetics (5 min, 4.2-fold; 18 h, 2.1-fold induction) similar to that seen for PKCδ activity (Fig. 7 A). Because PPARγ ligands inhibited mitogen-induced p21Cip1 expression at 12–24 h, we focused on the late phase phosphorylation of PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 7 B, 18 h after the stimulation by PDGF, phosphorylation of PKCδ was enhanced, and this increased phosphorylation was attenuated by TRO and RSG. Phosphorylation of PKCδ was also blocked by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2, but not by the inactive analog PP3, consistent with the previous observation that PDGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ through the activation of Src kinase (24Blake R.A. Garcia P.P. Parker P.J. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). To assess the functional role of c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of PKCδ, we also examined the effects of PP2 on the activity of PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 7 C, PP2 but not PP3 inhibited the enzyme activity of PKCδ (PP2, 94.6 ± 10% inhibition; p < 0.01versus PDGF alone, n = 4). Similarly, PP2 but not PP3 attenuated the PDGF-induced p21Cip1 expression (PP2, 96.3 ± 7.2% inhibition; p < 0.01versus PDGF alone, n = 4, Fig. 7 D). Phosphorylation of c-Src at pY416 within the catalytic domain leads to its activation (26Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). PDGF induced c-Src phosphorylation at pY416 at 5 min. The Src inhibitor PP2 completely blocked this phosphorylation, whereas the inactive analog PP3 had no effect. Neither TRO nor RSG at 10 μm affected PDGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Src at pY416 (Fig. 7 E). Collectively, these results suggest that PDGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ via a Src-dependent pathway, which leads to the increased enzyme activity of PKCδ and the elevated expression of p21Cip1. Moreover, PPARγ ligands likely inhibit the activity of PKCδ by attenuating the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ downstream of c-Src phosphorylation and activation. Dephosphorylation of PKCδ by PPARγ ligands could result from PPARγ regulation of PTPase activity. To test this hypothesis, we first checked the effect of a PTPase inhibitor on the regulation of p21Cip1 by PPARγ ligands. Specific PTPase inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO5) and dephostatin, were administered 6 h after the stimulation of PDGF. The inhibitory effect of TRO and RSG on PDGF-induced expression of p21Cip1 was totally reversed by the addition of both PTPase inhibitors (Fig. 8 A). Neither inhibitor had any effect on p21Cip1 expression in quiescent RASMC (data not shown). To confirm this hypothesis further, we examined whether PTPase inhibitors could also reverse the inhibitory effects of PPARγ ligands on the PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and PKCδ activity. Both PTPase inhibitors blocked the effect of PPARγ ligands to decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (Fig. 8 B) and inhibit its activity (Fig. 8 C). PPARγ ligand-mediated activation of PTPase provides an attractive mechanism for their effect to attenuate PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of PKCδ, accelerate p21Cip1 turnover, and decrease cellular concentration of p21Cip1. Finally, we examined the effect of PPARγ ligands on PTPase activity in PDGF-stimulated RASMC. As shown in Fig. 8 B, PDGF had no significant effect on PTPase activity in RASMC total cell lysates. PPARγ ligands, however, significantly enhanced PTPase activity 12 and 18 h after stimulation with PDGF (12 h: TRO, 3.0 ± 0.3-fold,p < 0.01 versus PDGF alonen = 3; RSG, 1.9 ± 0.1-fold, p < 0.05 versus PDGF alone, n = 3. 18 h: TRO, 2.6 ± 0.1-fold; RSG, 2.1 ± 0.6-fold; bothp < 0.05 versus PDGF alone,n = 3) (Fig. 9). These data support a mechanism by which PPARγ ligands activate PTPase to attenuate tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of PKCδ, resulting in the destabilization and reduced expression of p21Cip1 protein. The CDKI p21Cip1 is a classical negative regulator of G1 → S progression through its well described activity to inhibit cyclin·CDK hol"
https://openalex.org/W1499595687,"Developmental gene regulation in trypanosomatids proceeds exclusively by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Stability and abundance of heat shock protein (HSP)70 and HSP83 transcripts in Leishmania increase at mammalian-like temperatures, and their translation is enhanced. Here we report that the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of HSP83 (886 nucleotides) confers the temperature-dependent pattern of regulation on a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter transcript. We also show that the majority of the 3′-UTR sequences are required for increasing mRNA stability during heat shock. Processing of the HSP70 and HSP83 primary transcripts to poly(A)+ mRNA was more efficient during heat shock; therefore, even when stability at 33 °C was reduced by deletions in the 3′-UTR, transcripts still accumulated to comparable and even higher levels. Translation of heat shock transcripts in Leishmania increases dramatically upon temperature elevation. Unlike in other eukaryotes in which the 5′-UTR confers preferential translation on heat shock transcripts, we show that translational control of HSP83 in Leishmania originates from its 3′-UTR. The 5′-UTR alone cannot induce translation during heat shock, but it has a minor contribution when combined with the HSP83 3′-UTR. We identified an element located between positions 201 and 472 of the 3′-UTR which is essential for increasing translation of the CAT-HSP83 reporter RNA at 33–37 °C. This region confers preferential translation during heat shock even in transcripts that were less stable. Thus, investigating the traditionally conserved heat shock response reveals that Leishmania parasites use unique pathways for translational control. Developmental gene regulation in trypanosomatids proceeds exclusively by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Stability and abundance of heat shock protein (HSP)70 and HSP83 transcripts in Leishmania increase at mammalian-like temperatures, and their translation is enhanced.

Unlike in other eukaryotes in which the 5′-UTR confers preferential translation on heat shock transcripts, we show that translational control of HSP83 in Leishmania originates from its 3′-UTR. The 5′-UTR alone cannot induce translation during heat shock, but it has a minor contribution when combined with the HSP83 3′-UTR. We identified an element located between positions 201 and 472 of the 3′-UTR which is essential for increasing translation of the CAT-HSP83 reporter RNA at 33–37 °C. This region confers preferential translation during heat shock even in transcripts that were less stable. Thus, investigating the traditionally conserved heat shock response reveals that Leishmania parasites use unique pathways for translational control. heat shock proteins of 70 and 83 kDa, respectively untranslated region intergenic region chloramphenicol acetyltransferase rapid amplification of cDNA ends last copy Unique and unusual features characterize the genomes of trypanosomatids that comprise an ancient group of eukaryotes. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are found in polycistronic transcription units, and gene clusters repeated in tandem frequently encode abundant proteins. There is no evidence for transcriptional activation of developmentally regulated genes, and mRNA abundance is determined exclusively by post-transcriptional mechanisms. These include differential RNA processing (1Muhich M.L. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7107-7110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and control of mRNA decay (2Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem.

Polycistronic transcripts mature by trans-splicing that adds a short capped leader (39-mer) to the 5′-end of mRNAs and by 3′ processing that includes cleavage and polyadenylation.Trans-splicing and polyadenylation are coupled mechanistically in trypanosomatids and share regulatory signals that consist of polypyrimidine tracks and potential AG splice sites (5LeBowitz J.H. Smith H. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 6Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated sequences lack the consensus eukaryote AAUAAA signal for cleavage and polyadenylation, and no other consensus element of that nature has been identified. Leishmania parasites exist in the alimentary canal of female sand flies as flagellated promastigotes. They develop into virulent metacyclics that are uniquely adapted for transmission by the fly into a mammalian host where they differentiate into amastigotes, an obligate intracellular life form that resides within macrophages. Developmental gene expression is induced by environmental changes that are inflicted by the switch of hosts, including alterations in temperature (26 to 33–37 °C) and extracellular pH (7 to 5.5) (4Charest H. Zhang W.-W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Garlapati S. Dahan E. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HSP701 and HSP83 are expressed constitutively throughout the life cycle ofLeishmania. However, despite the absence of transcriptional activation (2Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the abundance of these transcripts increased 3–4-fold in mammalian-like temperatures because of an increase in their stability. Moreover, translation of heat shock transcripts increases by at least 10-fold upon temperature elevation (8Shapira M. McEwen J.G. Jaffe C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Above a certain threshold of temperature which varies among differentLeishmania species, synthesis of cellular proteins ceases (7Garlapati S. Dahan E. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Expression of heat shock genes in eukaryotes is regulated at a variety of levels that include transcription (9Morimoto R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), RNA processing (10Yost H.J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) followed by export to the cytoplasm, RNA stability, and translation. In view of the conserved and universal nature of the stress response it serves as an ideal system for studying the unusual features of molecular mechanisms used by trypanosomatids and for comparing them with other eukaryotes. HSP70 transcripts in Drosophila and in yeast are degraded rapidly during recovery from heat shock at 26 °C (11Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Petersen R. Lindquist S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with deadenylation initiating this process (13Dellavalle R.P. Petersen R. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3646-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation of the human and Drosophila HSP70 increases dramatically during heat shock, and it is the 5′-UTR that confers this pattern of regulation in Drosophila (14Lindquist S. Nature. 1981; 293: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Vivinus S. Baulande S. van Zanten M. Campbell F. Topley P. Ellis J.H. Dessen P. Coste H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1908-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular components that control mRNA stability and its accumulation in trypanosomatids, although recent reports indicate the involvement of the 3′-UTR in the regulation of HSP70 inLeishmania (16Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in Trypanosoma brucei (17Lee M.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4025-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we show for HSP83 in Leishmania that regulated RNA processing combined with differential decay plays a key role in determining mRNA abundance at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the downstream intergenic region (IR) of HSP83 confers this pattern of regulation, and the 3′-UTR of HSP83 contains an element that induces preferential translation during heat shock. Leishmania amazonensis isolate MHOM/BR/77/LTB0016 was cultured in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamycin. Parasites were also grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.0001% biotin, 0.0005% hemin, 0.002 μg/ml biopterin, 40 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm adenine. The IRs within the genomic HSP83 cluster extend from the termination codon of one gene to the first translated ATG of the following gene. Plasmid pHC included the CAT coding gene in pBluescript fused with a complete upstream HSP83 IR that provided the signals for trans-splicing of the CAT primary transcript. An HSP83 IR was then ligated downstream to the CAT gene providing the signals for 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation, resulting in plasmid pHCH (formerly denoted pICI (2Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). This gave a CAT coding gene that was flanked by HSP83 IRs at both ends. A series of constructs with deletions spanning the 3′-UTR was created by digestion of the 2-kbBgl II-Sal I genomic fragment (pKS83BS) that encodes the HSP83 intergenic region with different restriction enzymes. This fragment contained the complete IR (1,471 bp) flanked by short coding sequences that extended from position 1692 of one coding gene (Sal I) to position 80 of the following coding gene in the cluster ((Bgl II; see Ref. 18Aly R. Argaman M. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the downstream IR extended beyond the first translated ATG codon of the subsequent gene it included the complete HSP83 endogenous signals for 3′ processing. The following sites were used to introduce the deletions described:Sma I (201), Nru I (472), Sph I (59, 655) and Nar I (873). Partial digests were performed forSph I. The modified IRs were cloned downstream of the CAT gene in plasmid pHC, and the complete fused gene (HCHΔ “deletion”) was cloned as a Bcl I-Bam HI insert into the Bam HI site of pX (5LeBowitz J.H. Smith H. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), at an orientation opposite that of the Neor gene. This ensured that only the HSP83 signals would direct processing of the CAT primary transcript. A parallel set of deletions was constructed by a similar cloning approach except that the 5′-UTR was derived from the α-tubulin gene. The modified HSP83 IR was cloned downstream of the CAT gene in pALT1 (19Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9119-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), resulting in the pTCH-based deletion plasmids. Plasmid DNA was electroporated into L. amazonensis parasites as described (19Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9119-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) except that a double electrical pulse of 5.5 kV/cm at 25 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus was applied. Stably transfected lines were selected in the presence of 60 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Sigma). Neomycin-resistant parasites appeared 10–14 days after transfection and were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml Geneticin. Total RNA was extracted from cells incubated at 26 °C and at different time points after their transfer to 33 °C with the TRI reagent (Scientific Research Laboratories). To measure the T1/2 of specific mRNAs 10 μg/ml actinomycin D was added to stop transcription, cells were distributed to 26 and 33 °C, and RNA levels were sampled at four different time points. RNA was fractionated over 1% denaturing agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized with specific probes. The intensity of hybridization was determined by analysis in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The probes used for hybridization were a 1.2-kbPst I fragment from the HSP83 coding gene of L. amazonensis (20Shapira M. Pedraza G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the CAT coding gene, and a rDNA probe ofLeishmania major, 2C. L. Jaffe, unpublished data. which was used to control RNA loads. The hybridization intensities of HSP83 and CAT were normalized according to the rRNA values. The T1/2 of CAT and HSP83 transcripts at 26 and 33 °C was calculated from the corresponding decay curves that were obtained by nonlinear regression, and the 33/26 ratio between the T1/2 at each temperature was determined. A 33/26 ratio of T1/2 > 1 indicated that the transcript was more stable at 33 °C. To determine the site of poly(A)+ addition in the HSP83 transcript, cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of total RNA using a (dT)18 primer attached to an adaptor sequence (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATT-3′). The cDNA was amplified by a set of primers derived from the adaptor sequence (reverse primer) and a gene-specific sequence (forward primer) that corresponded to positions 478–507 (5′-GTCGATGCTGCCCGAGCTCACCCCCACC-3′) in the HSP83 IR. The 3′-boundaries of the CAT transcripts were determined using the adaptor (reverse) primer and a forward primer corresponding to positions 595–615 of the CAT coding region (5′-CAGGTTCATCATGCCGTCTGT-3′). Amplification products were cloned into the TA cloning vector (Promega) and sequenced to determine the site of polyadenylation. Chromosomal DNA embedded in agarose blocks (107 parasites) was digested overnight with Nco I and separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis in a CHEF II DR system (Bio-Rad) on 1% agarose gels in 0.5 × TBE, along with blocks of nondigested chromosomes. Running conditions included a gradient of pulses ranging from 1 to 6 min for 11 h at 6 V/cm. The gels were soaked in 0.25 m HCl, blotted, and hybridized with the 3.5-kb HSP83 Sal I genomic fragment. A cosmid library of L. amazonensis was the generous gift of D. Smith from Imperial College, London. The library was subjected to a double screen with probes derived from positions −3/+80 in the HSP83 coding gene (5′-probe) and positions 1691 in the coding gene to 200 in the subsequent IR (3′-probe). A genomic clone that contained part of the last copy of the HSP83 cluster was expected to hybridize only with the 3′-probe and not with the corresponding 5′-probe. Clones that hybridized differentially with a 3′-probe and not with a 5′-probe were isolated. The first gene copy in the HSP83 genomic cluster was cloned previously using a similar approach (21Aly R. Argaman M. Pinelli E. Shapira M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Parasites were grown in RPMI with supplements to a cell density of 3 × 107/ml. Cells (1 ml) were preincubated at 26, 33, and 37 °C for 1 h and then labeled with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (1,175 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at the corresponding temperatures. After labeling, the cells were harvested at 4 °C, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer. Incorporation of the35S-labeled amino acids was measured by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Samples of proteins containing the same amount of incorporated radiolabel corresponded to a similar number of cells (22Pinelli E. Shapira M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and were separated over 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and processed further for fluorography. To evaluate the size of the HSP83 genomic cluster, L. amazonensis chromosome blocks were digested with an enzyme that does not cut within the genomic cluster but cleaves at sites located in the immediate flanking sequences. Nco I sites are found 1.2 and 0.8 kb upstream and downstream from the first and last gene copies, respectively. Southern analysis of L. amazonensis pulse field gel electrophoresis blots revealed a single 67-kb fragment that hybridized with the HSP83 probe (Fig. 1), confirming the presence of a single HSP83 genome cluster, mapped to chromosome 28 of L. major (23Samaras N. Spithill T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 25: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on the size of the repeat unit (3,580 bp (20Shapira M. Pedraza G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), the 67-kb fragment contains 18 tandem repeats of the HSP83 gene. The temperature-dependent abundance of the HSP83 transcript is controlled post-transcriptionally, with RNA stability playing an important regulatory role. mRNA Abundance at 26 °C and after incubation at 33 °C for 4 h is depicted as histograms. Decay curves were obtained from RNA samples of cells incubated with actinomycin D at ambient and elevated temperatures, and the corresponding T1/2 at 33 and 26 °C and the ratio between them were calculated. A 33/26 ratio > 1 indicated that the mRNA was more stable at 33 °C. The endogenous HSP83 mRNA level increased 3-fold at 33 °C, and the ratio between the T1/2 measured at both temperatures indicated that it was 3.4-fold more stable at elevated temperatures (Fig. 2 and Ref.2Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To show that the HSP83 IRs could confer a temperature-dependent pattern of regulation, the CAT gene was cloned between two HSP83 IRs, resulting in pHCH. To examine the individual role of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs in control of mRNA stability we placed the CAT reporter gene between IRs derived from either the HSP83 or α-tubulin gene clusters (24Landfear S. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This gave constructs in which the CAT gene was flanked by an upstream HSP83 IR and a downstream tubulin IR (pHCT) or by the upstream tubulin UTR and the downstream HSP83 UTR (pTCH). The IRs extended from the translational termination codon of one gene to the translational initiation of the downstream gene in the cluster, to maintain the 3′ processing signals. Each of the fused genes was stably introduced into L. amazonensis cells via the pX transfection vector (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and regulation of the CAT mRNA was investigated. When both the upstream and downstream IRs were derived from HSP83 (HCH), the pattern of regulation was similar to that of the endogenous gene. When the 3′-UTR was derived from HSP83 and the 5′-UTR was obtained from α-tubulin (TCH), the T1/2 increased 2.4-fold at 33 °C, and the steady-state level at 4 h was 1.8-fold higher. When the 3′-UTR was derived from α-tubulin and the 5′-UTR was obtained from HSP83 (HCT), the T1/2 of the resulting transcript and its steady-state level decreased by 2-fold at 33 °C (33/26 = 0.5; Fig. 2). The presence of the HSP83 3′-UTR was therefore required for increasing the T1/2 of HSP83 during heat shock. To map regions that may control the differential decay of HSP83 mRNA at different temperatures, we constructed a series of IRs with deletions that spanned the 3′-UTR and cloned them downstream of the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 3). The deletions did not interfere with sequences downstream to the 3′-UTR which contained the signals for 3′ processing. Initially we created small deletions that removed sequences 1–201, 201–473, 473–655, and 655–873 of the 3′-UTR. To examine whether the 5′-UTR was involved in some way in the regulation processes during heat shock, two parallel sets of the same deletions were generated using different 5′-IRs. In the TCH deletion plasmids the 5′-IR was obtained from α-tubulin, and in the HCH deletion plasmids the 5′-IR was obtained from HSP83. 3′-RACE was used to map the polyadenylation site of the wild type HSP83 and the fused CAT-HSP83 genes. This ensured that the 3′-UTRs retained their original site of polyadenylation and that the processing of the major CAT transcript occurred as expected 250 nucleotides upstream of the AG splice site of the successive gene. The poly(A)+addition site of the endogenous HSP83 transcript was mapped 886 nucleotides downstream from the translation termination codon and 250 nucleotides upstream from the AG splice site of the subsequent gene copy in the cluster. The poly(A)+ sites of the CAT-HSP83 deletion transcripts also occurred as expected 250 nucleotides upstream from the successive site for trans-splicing. To examine the effect of the deletions in the 3′-UTR on mRNA stability at ambient and elevated temperatures, decay curves were obtained as described above, and steady-state levels were monitored at 4 h (Fig. 3,A–C). Except for Δ1–201, each of the deletions in the HSP83 3′-UTR abolished differential stability of the CAT transcript at elevated temperatures, when the 5′-UTR was derived from HSP83 (Fig.3 A, HCH constructs). It is possible that all of the tested modifications could alter the structure of the 3′-UTR and therefore change the accessibility of regulatory determinants. If the 5′-UTR was derived from α-tubulin all of the deletions eliminated differential stability, including Δ1–201 (Fig. 3 B, TCH constructs). Furthermore, the destabilizing effect of deletions in the 3′-UTR as elucidated by the 33/26 ratio of T1/2 was more evident in combination with the α-tubulin 5′-UTR. This could indicate possible interactions between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of HSP83. In both sets of constructs, deletion 201–472 in the 3′-UTR had the most profound effect on eliminating differential stability. We noted that although the tested deletions (200–250 nucleotides) eliminated differential stability of the CAT RNA at elevated temperatures, the resulting transcripts accumulated to comparable or slightly higher levels at both temperatures (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggested that temperature-dependent degradation of mRNAs was not the only mechanism acting post-transcriptionally to control mRNA abundance inLeishmania. To increase the instability of the 3′-UTR at 33 °C and to examine the effect on accumulation of the CAT transcript, we introduced larger deletions into the 3′-UTR, spanning sequences Δ59–472, Δ472–873, Δ59–655, and Δ59–873. These deletions led to a marked destabilization of the CAT transcripts at elevated temperatures, decreasing the 33/26 T1/2 ratio to 0.3–0.5. However, despite this dramatic reduction in mRNA stability, the CAT transcripts accumulated to comparable (0.97, pHCHΔ59–873) or mildly reduced (0.67, pHCHΔ59–472; 0.79, pHCHΔ472–873; 0.74, pHCHΔ59–655) steady-state levels at 33 °C (Fig. 3 C). This could suggest that the abundance of the CAT transcripts was determined not only by differential mRNA stability. If 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation were more efficient at 33 °C, their influence could overcome the effect of reduced mRNA stability at elevated temperatures because of the deletions in the 3′-UTR. Thus, transcript abundance most probably resulted from the combination between the different regulatory processes. To investigate further the effect of specific 3′ processing signals on transcript abundance during heat shock we used the IR of the terminal HSP83 gene in the genomic cluster. This last gene copy and 3 kb of its nonhomologous flanking sequences were cloned from a cosmid library ofL. amazonensis. This was done by a differential screen using probes derived from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding region (Fig.2 A, scheme at the top describing the HSP83 cluster), as described previously for cloning of the first HSP83 repeat unit (21Aly R. Argaman M. Pinelli E. Shapira M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The terminal IR sequence is almost identical (99%) to that of an internal repeat unit (1,471 bp) until position 840, from which point the two sequences are totally divergent. Initially it was unclear whether the last copy (LC) was expressed because a putative polypyrimidine track and AG sites that could serve as signals for 3′ processing of the last transcript in the cluster were observed 500 bp downstream to position 840 in the terminal IR. The IR of the last gene copy and 0.5 kb of the flanking sequences were therefore fused downstream to the CAT coding gene (pHCH/LC, Fig.3 C) and stably introduced into L. amazonensis cells. The polyadenylation site of the corresponding CAT transcript was examined by 3′-RACE and quite surprisingly, was mapped 73 nucleotides after the translational termination codon. This indicated that the flanking genomic sequences located downstream from the LC failed to direct 3′ processing at the accurate site, and the resulting transcript was devoid of most of its 3′-UTR. Cleavage and polyadenylation that took place 73 nucleotides downstream from the translational termination codon were most probably directed by cryptic signals. The boundaries of the CAT transcripts produced by the pHCHΔ59–873 and pHCH/LC constructs were therefore similar, each containing a very short 3′-UTR of 73–84 nucleotides. However, despite the structural similarity between the two transcripts, their pattern of regulation varied (Fig.3 C). Both mRNAs were equally unstable at 33 °C with a 33/26 ratio for T1/2 of 0.3, but they differed in their ability to maintain high steady-state levels of RNA at elevated temperatures. Although the HCHΔ59–873 CAT transcript accumulated to a comparable steady-state level at both temperatures (33/26 ratio = 0.97 at 4 h), the abundance of the HCH/LC mRNA decreased after incubation at elevated temperatures (33/26 = 0.25). This could be explained by a reduction in the processing efficiency of 3′-ends in the HCH/LC transcript at elevated temperatures, which affected its RNA steady-state levels. Thus it appeared that the last gene copy in the HSP83 cluster lacks the endogenous signal for 3′ processing and is most probably not expressed at elevated temperatures. To examine the effect of temperature elevation on processing of heat shock transcripts, total RNA was isolated from cells grown at 26 °C and after exposure to 33 °C (4 h). The RNA was fractionated over a poly(dT)-cellulose column, and the poly(A)+ and poly(A)− fractions were blotted and hybridized with HSP70, HSP83, and α-tubulin probes. As expected, the mature HSP83 transcripts (3.1 and 3.3 kb, respectively), although present at both temperatures were more abundant at 33 °C (Fig.4). Hybridization with the poly(A)− fractions revealed the presence of larger faint bands only in RNA obtained from 26 °C. These bands were not observed in samples extracted from 33 °C and could correspond to unprocessed transcripts, possibly dimers and trimers. Their abundance at the lower temperature suggested that processing of heat shock transcripts under these conditions was less efficient. Processing of the tubulin transcripts did not seem to vary with temperature alteration. Heat shock transcripts in Leishmania are translated preferentially at temperatures typical of the mammalian host (8Shapira M. McEwen J.G. Jaffe C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previously we showed for L. amazonensis that the increase in translation of HSP70 and HSP83 was observed at 33 °C, whereas translation of tubulin and other cellular non-heat shock proteins ceased at 37 °C (7Garlapati S. Dahan E. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We observed a similar pattern of regulation for the CAT mRNA flanked by HSP83 3′- and 5′-UTRs (Fig. 5 and Ref.18Aly R. Argaman M. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and therefore determined the location of the regulatory elements. This was done by incorporation of radioactive amino acids into nascently synthesized proteins for 30 min in cells grown at 26 °C and after exposure to 33 and 37 °C for 1 h. We show forLeishmania that the 3′-UTR derived from the HSP83 gene regulates the efficiency of translation at different temperatures. Translation of CAT increased at 33 °C if it was fused to the HSP83 3′-UTR (pTCH). When the HSP83 3′-UTR was exchanged with the α-tubulin 3′-UTR preferential translation was lost, despite the presence of an HSP83 5′-UTR (pHCT, Fig. 5 A). Deletion analysis was used to map the 3′-UTR, indicating that preferential translation of the CAT transcripts was abolished by removal of the region 201–472, whereas deletion of other sequences, 1–201, 472–655, and 655–873, did not prevent the increase in translation at elevated temperatures (Fig.5 B). These results were obtained regardless of whether or not they were derived from HSP83 (pHCH) or α-tubulin (pTCH). However, although the HSP83 5′-UTR alone could not confer preferential translation, it had a synergistic effect of increasing translation at elevated temperature when combined with the HSP83 3′-UTR. The requirement for sequences within the 201–472 region was in line with the analysis of the larger deletions. Removal of the proximal half (59) but not the distal half (472) of the 3′-UTR abolished preferential translation of CAT, in correlation with the absence (Δ59–472) or presence (Δ472–873) of the 201–472 fragment (Fig.5 C). Sequences 201–472 were also absent from constructs carrying the large deletions (Δ59–472, Δ59–655, Δ59–873), and cells transfected with these plasmids could not preferentially translate their CAT transcript. We show that the 3′-UTR confers differential stability on the HSP83 mRNA in Leishmania because CAT transcripts fused to an HSP83 3′-UTR and an α-tubulin 5′-UTR followed the same pattern of temperature-dependent regulation observed for the endogenous HSP83 gene. These CAT transcripts were more stable and accumulated to a higher level at 33 °C than at 26 °C. Reciprocal constructs that contained an α-tubulin 3′-UTR and an HSP83 5′-UTR were degraded faster at 33 °C and were less abundant at that temperature compared with 26 °C. Decay curves at different temperatures revealed that the HSP83 5′-UTR had a limited synergistic effect on mRNA stability during heat shock when combined with the HSP83 3′-UTR. The HSP83 upstream IR may differentially acceleratetrans-splicing of the 5′-ends, as also described for the phosphoglycerate kinase genes in T. brucei (26Kapotas N. Bellofatto V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 3′-UTR was performed by introducing deletions of 200–250 nucleotides downstream from the CAT gene in constructs that contained a 5′-UTR derived from α-tubulin. This showed that there was no specific region involved in temperature-dependent control of HSP83 mRNA stability. All deletions examined generated mRNA molecules that were no longer stable at 33 °C, although removal of sequences 201–472 displayed the strongest effect. This could indicate that the 3′-UTR created secondary structures that were involved in regulation of mRNA stability and were disrupted by each of the deletions. Sequences 1–201, a region that is least conserved among Leishmania species (27Aly R. Argaman M. Shapira M. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), were dispensable only if the 5′-UTR was derived from HSP83. This observation could indicate possible interactions between the 3′- and 5′-UTRs, despite the inability of the 5′-UTR by itself to confer preferential mRNA stability at elevated temperatures. The larger deletions that eliminated half (either the proximal or the distal) or larger parts of the 3′-UTR had a more profound effect on differential stability of mRNA, and the T1/2 of the resulting CAT transcripts decreased by 2–3-fold upon heat shock. Although most of the deletions that removed 200–250 nucleotides from the 3′-UTR abolished the increased mRNA stability at elevated temperatures, they did not prevent the accumulation of the CAT-HSP83 transcript to higher levels. Only the more dramatic decrease in T1/2 at 33 °C which was observed with the larger deletions generated CAT transcripts that no longer accumulated to higher levels at 33 °C. We therefore examined whether a more efficient processing of HSP83 mRNAs at elevated temperatures could compensate for the reduction in stability. This was done by analysis of two mRNA molecules that had similar boundaries but varied in their 3′ processing signals. One was obtained from an internal HSP83 IR and the other from the last gene copy in this cluster. We found that processing signals of the internal HSP83 IR were effective and functioned at elevated temperatures, but they were absent from the last gene copy. Although putative signals for 3′ processing were observed within 0.5 kb of the sequences that flanked the terminal gene copy, they proved to be nonfunctional. Thus, CAT transcripts in cells transfected with either plasmid were polyadenylated very close to the translational termination site. Although both transcripts were devoid of a 3′-UTR and had similar stability values (33/26 ratio of 0.3 for T1/2), they varied in their ability to accumulate at 33 °C. Although the steady-state level of the CAT mRNA in HCHΔ59–873 cells was comparable at both temperatures, abundance of the HCH/LC transcript at 33 °C decreased to 25% of its level at 26 °C. This could be explained by variations in the efficiency of processing at the different temperatures. Indeed in L. amazonensis, nonprocessed heat shock RNAs detected in the poly(A)− fraction were more abundant at ambient temperatures than at elevated temperatures, suggesting thattrans-splicing and polyadenylation of heat shock genes were more efficient at 33–35 °C. Thus, the abundance of heat shock transcripts was determined by a combination between the increased stability and a more efficient RNA processing at elevated temperatures. Heat shock inhibits splicing in higher eukaryotes (10Yost H.J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Yost H.J. Lindquist S.

HSP70 genes inDrosophila are intronless, enabling their maturation during extreme conditions. The gene encoding HSP83 in Drosophila contains an intron, and its splicing is optimal under mild heat shock conditions. However, a severe temperature stress interferes with HSP83 splicing unless the cells are pretreated with a milder stress that prevents this inhibition (10Yost H.J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In trypanosomes, a severe heat shock (42 °C) impairs splicing of tubulin transcripts, although HSP70 and HSP83 RNAs are properly matured under these conditions (1Muhich M.L. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7107-7110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Muhich M.L. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3837-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Muhich M.L. Hsu M.P. Boothroyd J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We now show for L. amazonensis that processing of primary transcripts of HSP70 and HSP83 is more efficient during heat shock. Exposure of Leishmania parasites to temperatures typical of mammals causes a dramatic increase (10-fold) in translation of heat shock proteins. Although this pattern of regulation is conserved among all eukaryotes, it is not yet quite understood. InDrosophila translation of a reporter gene increases upon heat shock if it is fused to an HSP70 5′-UTR (33Klemenz R. Hultmark D. Gehring W.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2053-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34McGarry T.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 42: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, nocis- or trans-acting regulatory elements have been identified, and no differences were found for the pattern of RNA-protein interactions at alternating temperatures (35Hess M.A. Duncan R.D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10913-10922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the nonstructured AT-rich 5′-UTR of theDrosophila HSP70 mRNA enabled translation to proceed with no interruptions during heat shock. Unlike Drosophila, preferential translation at elevated temperatures occurred inLeishmania only if the CAT reporter gene was fused with an HSP83 3′-UTR. Replacing it with an α-tubulin 3′-UTR abolished preferential translation even if the 5′-UTR was derived from HSP83. We identified a regulatory element located between positions 201 and 472 in the 3′-UTR of HSP83 which enhanced translation inLeishmania during heat shock. Translation increased at 33 °C even if the distal half of the 3′-UTR (472) was removed but not when the proximal half of the 3′-UTR (59) was deleted, in correlation with the presence or absence of this element. Moreover, preferential translation occurred even in transcripts that were less stable at 33 °C because of mutations in the 3′-UTR as long as the 201–472 region was present. This was best exemplified by the CAT mRNA in pHCHΔ472–873 cells that translated more efficiently at elevated temperatures, despite being less stable. Thus, translational regulation and control of mRNA stability of HSP83 inLeishmania are independent processes. The dissociation between stability and translation efficiency of RNA is usually not common among eukaryotes; however, it has been observed in some cases. For example, an element within the 3′-UTR of c-fos links the translation and intracellular localization of this transcript but has no bearing on its stability (36Dalgleish G. Veyrune J.-N. Blanchard J.-M. Hesketh J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13593-13599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Elements that control translational regulation in eukaryotes are generally found in the 5′-UTR. However, there are several examples of transcript-specific factors that affect translational regulation via elements in the 3′-UTR. The mouse quaking proteins (QKI) involved in embryogenesis and myelination and a closely related protein inCaenorhabditis elegans (GLD-1) which is necessary for germ line development are members of the STAR family of RNA-binding proteins. Both proteins were found to serve as translational repressors that act through regulatory elements called TGEs (for tra-2 and GLI elements), present in the 3′-UTR of their target genes (37Jan E. Motzny C.K. Graves L.E. Goodwin E.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 38Saccomanno L. Loushin C. Jan E. Punkay E. Artzt K. Goodwin E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During axis formation in Drosophila, translation of hunchback is repressed by the gene products of nanos and pumilio via binding to defined elements in its 3′-UTR (39Murata Y. Wharton R.P.

Mol.Cell. 1998; 6: 863-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar). An element within the 3′-UTR of the lipoxygenase transcript is responsible for its silencing during erythroid differentiation (41Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In T. brucei, a 26-mer sequence in the 3′-UTR of the major surface antigen of procyclic trypanosomes controls the developmentally regulated abundance of the procyclic acidic repetitive antigen (PARP) transcript and the protein it encodes (42Hotz H.-R. Biebinger S. Flaspohler J. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 43Furger A. Schürch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although translational regulatory elements are occasionally found within 3′-UTRs, the 5′-UTR of heat shock genes in eukaryotes accounts for their traditionally conserved translational regulation. However, the evidence presented here suggests that a 3′-UTR determinant is responsible for preferential translation of HSP83 inLeishmania, illustrating another aspect of unique and unusual regulatory pathways employed by trypanosomatids.

The Arp2/3 complex exists in different structural/functional states: the inactive Arp2/3, the activated WA·Arp2/3 complex, the ternary G-actin·WA·Arp2/3 complex, which branches the filaments. This work addresses the role of ATP binding in Arp2/3 function. Using photo-cross-linking, hydrodynamic, and fluorescence techniques, we show that in the inactive Arp2/3 complex only one rapidly exchangeable ATP is tightly bound to Arp3 with an affinity of 108m−1. Upon activation of the Arp2/3 complex by WA, ATP binds to Arp2 with high affinity (107m−1), implying that a large structural change of Arp2 is linked to Arp2/3 activation. ATP is rapidly exchangeable on Arp2 and Arp3 in WA·Arp2/3 and G-actin·WA·Arp2/3 complexes. ATP is not hydrolyzed in inactive Arp2/3, in WA·Arp2/3, nor in G-actin·WA·Arp2/3. Arp2 has a greater specificity than Arp3 for ATP versus ATP analogs.

The Arp2/3 complex, which contains seven polypeptides including actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3, is the downstream target of a variety of signaling pathways, integrated by Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome family proteins. Signaling leads to the recruitment and activation of WASp1 proteins at the membrane. Activation of WASp proteins unmasks binding sites for Arp2/3 complex in the C-terminal domain (WA) (see Refs. 4Rohatgi R. et al.Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar and 5Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar for review). Upon interacting with WA, the Arp2/3 complex locally stimulates polymerization of actin into an arborescent array of branched filaments, with the Arp2/3 complex sitting at the branches (6Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1009-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar).In vitro polymerization and microscopy studies show that Arp2/3 complex multiplies filaments by branching, in an autocatalytic process involving interaction of the ternary G-actin·WA·Arp2/3 complex with a filament (see Refs. 7Wear M.A. Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R891-R893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 8Pantaloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.-F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar for reviews). The molecular mechanism for the generation of force by building a branched filament array and the nature of the elementary reactions that take place in Arp2/3 during this complex process are not known. Structural modeling indicates that Arp2 and Arp3 share the general fold of actin and must bind ATP or ADP (9Kelleher J.F. Atkinson S.J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As in actin and Arp1 (centractin), ATP binding and hydrolysis on Arp2 and/or Arp3 may play an important regulatory role in the reactions that lead to Arp2/3 activation, filament branching, debranching, and recycling of Arp2/3 complex. Here we quantitate the binding and hydrolysis of ATP on Arp2 and Arp3 in the inactive and activated Arp2/3 complex, and we determine the specificity of different nucleotides for Arp2 and Arp3 and their ability to support filament branching. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (10Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.-F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Arp2/3 complex from bovine brain and the C-terminal WA fragment of N-WASp were purified (11Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell. Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using values of extinction coefficients derived from their amino acid sequence (10Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.-F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,11Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.-F. J. Cell. Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Hence the molar ratios of bound ATP given in this work are underestimated by 3% (when one ATP is bound) and 6% (when two ATPs are bound). The binding of ATP to high affinity sites on Arp2/3 complex was measured using Dowex 1 to remove most of the free nucleotides. Arp2/3 complex (3–4 μm) was equilibrated in G0 buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmCaCl2) containing 10 μm ATP by gel filtration (NAP-5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and treated twice for 30 s at 0 °C with 15% (v/v) of a 50% Dowex 1 suspension in G0buffer. The concentration of Arp2/3 in the Dowex supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically. A control sample of 10 μm [3H]ATP in G0 buffer was treated identically. Only 0.2 μm free ATP was found in the Dowex 1 supernatant. Therefore only ATP that binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 20 nm or less, like actin (12Mockrin S. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5358-5363Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar), remains bound to the protein following Dowex 1 treatment. Following perchloric acid extraction of the bound nucleotides, the amount of total bound nucleotides was determined spectrophotometrically, and the amount of bound ATP was measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay (13De Luca M. McElroy W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 3-15Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar), using the kit CLS II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a Berthold luminometer (LB 9501). Standards were run in a range of 0–0.6 μm ATP, within which the samples were measured. The Hummel and Dreyer method (14Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) was used to measure binding of ATP at different concentrations of free ATP. Arp2/3 complex was gel-filtered on Sephadex G-25 columns pre-equilibrated in F0 buffer (G0 supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl) containing 3H-labeled ATP in the range 0.5–2.0 μm. The molar ratio of ATP bound to eluted Arp2/3 at saturation by ATP was derived. The change in fluorescence of etheno-ATP (ε-ATP) upon binding to Arp2/3 complex was used to quantitate binding of ATP, at 20 °C in a Spex spectrofluorimeter, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 410 nm, respectively. Arp2/3 complex (1 μm) was equilibrated in either G0 or F0 buffer containing 0.25 μm ATP by gel filtration (NAP-5 column) and was titrated by ε-ATP. Data were analyzed in terms of competitive binding of ε-ATP (X) and ATP (Y) to two independent sites on Arp2/3 (P). The equilibrium dissociation constants were K andJ for binding of ε-ATP to Arp3 and Arp2. They were notedK/m and J/m for binding of ATP. The fluorescence enhancements for binding of ε-ATP to Arp3 and Arp2 were F 1 and F 2, respectively. The following equations were used to describe the system, in which PX describes the complex of X with Arp3, and XP describes the complex of X with Arp2.

Hydrolysis of ATP by Arp2/3 complex was monitored using the acid extraction of 32P-labeled phosphomolybdate complex formed following hydrolysis of γ-32P-labeled ATP, at room temperature. Data were collected for up to 3 h (only 20 min if ATP·G-actin was present). Identical results were obtained in G0 or F0 buffer. Samples contained 1 μm Arp2/3 complex, 2.5 μmγ-32P-labeled ATP, with or without 15 μm WA or 15 μm WA and 1 μm ATP·G-actin 1:1 complex. To determine the number and the location of potential high affinity binding sites, the Arp2/3 complex was treated by Dowex 1 to remove free and low affinity bound ATP. Subsequent perchloric acid extraction of bound nucleotides showed that 0.7–0.9 mol of adenine nucleotide was bound per mol of Arp2/3 complex (four independent measurements). The same experiment was then done preincubating Arp2/3 complex for periods of 10 s up to 1 min with3H-labeled ATP in the presence or absence of 10 μm WA before Dowex treatment. Again 0.8 mol of [3H]ATP, which had the same specific radioactivity as the ATP in the preincubation solution, was found bound with high affinity per mol of Arp2/3 or WA·Arp2/3 complex. This result indicates that a single rapidly exchangeable high affinity site for ATP exists both on Arp2/3 and Arp2/3·WA complex, and that there is not a non-exchangeable site. The binding of ATP to Arp2/3 complex in the presence of controlled concentrations of free nucleotides was then examined. The Hummel and Dreyer method was first used (14Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). When Arp2/3 alone was loaded on the column, a single high affinity ATP binding site (0.8 mol of ATP per mol of Arp2/3 at saturation) was titrated. This site is identical to the one found after Dowex 1 treatment. When Arp2/3 in the presence of WA (15 μm) was loaded on the column, the molar ratio of bound ATP to Arp2/3 was twice higher, indicating that two binding sites were titrated. Saturation was reached at 1.0 μmfree ATP (Table I). WA in itself did not bind ATP. The bound nucleotides found in the absence as well as in the presence of WA were identified and quantified as 100% ATP using the luciferin/luciferase assay (Table I).Table IBinding of ATP to Arp2/3 (Hummel and Dreyer method)Experiment[ATP]free−WA+WAμmmol ATP bound/mol Arp2/310.530.4520.930.671.131.00.761.341.40.7051.860.841.361-aATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay.2.021-aATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay.0.751-aATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay.1.61-aATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay.Arp2/3 complex (2–5 μm) in F buffer containing 0.25 μm ATP was supplemented or not with 15 μmWA and gel-filtered (Sephadex G-25 fine, 0.7 × 10 cm column) in F buffer containing 3H-labeled ATP as indicated. The molar ratio of bound ATP per mol of Arp2/3 complex eluted at different concentrations of free ATP was derived.1-a ATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay. Open table in a new tab Arp2/3 complex (2–5 μm) in F buffer containing 0.25 μm ATP was supplemented or not with 15 μmWA and gel-filtered (Sephadex G-25 fine, 0.7 × 10 cm column) in F buffer containing 3H-labeled ATP as indicated. The molar ratio of bound ATP per mol of Arp2/3 complex eluted at different concentrations of free ATP was derived. To determine to which of Arp2 or Arp3 ATP is bound in the absence and in the presence of WA, Arp2/3 complex was equilibrated with 1 μm [α-32P]ATP, with or without 10 μm WA, and irradiated at 254 nm. Only the Arp3 subunit was covalently labeled by [α-32P]ATP in the absence of WA. Both Arp2 and Arp3 subunits were labeled in the presence of WA (Fig. 1 A). The efficiency of photo-cross-linking was more pronounced on Arp3 than on Arp2. The extent of Arp3 labeling was not affected by WA, suggesting that Arp3, in contrast to Arp2, binds ATP in a WA-independent fashion. In conclusion, activation of Arp2/3 complex by WA is linked to a structural change of the ATP site in Arp2 (Fig. 1 B). To understand whether ATP hydrolysis takes place in different structural states of Arp2/3 complex, we measured the hydrolysis of ATP in solutions of Arp2/3 complex alone, in the presence of WA, or in the presence of both WA and ATP·G-actin 1:1 complex, in G0 or F0 buffer. No hydrolysis was detected. After 3 h identical very low amounts of hydrolyzed ATP (30 nm) were found in samples and in controls without Arp2/3. No hydrolysis of ATP was detected at a 10-fold higher concentration of ATP. The change in fluorescence of ε-ATP upon binding to Arp2/3 complex was used as another probe of ATP binding (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of WA, exchange of ε-ATP for Arp3-bound ATP was rapid (reaction is over in 10 s at 20 °C) and led to a 5-fold enhancement of fluorescence. The data are consistent with binding of ε-ATP to one site with an equilibrium dissociation constant K of 0.01 ± 0.005 μm. This site is located on Arp3 according to the photo-cross-linking data. Binding to a second low affinity site (J = 40 ± 10 μm) was detected from a slight drift of fluorescence at the plateau. In the presence of WA, the change in fluorescence upon addition of ε-ATP to Arp2/3 was more than 2-fold greater. The fluorescence binding curves were analyzed in terms of binding of ε-ATP to two sites. The second site was attributed to Arp2, as indicated by the Hummel-Dreyer (14Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) and photo-cross-linking experiments. The data were satisfactorily accounted for assuming that the extent of fluorescence change (5-fold increase) and the binding constant of ε-ATP to Arp3 was not changed by WA, and the fluorescence of ε-ATP was enhanced 8-fold upon binding to Arp2. Hence in the presence of WA, 35% of the overall fluorescence change is linked to the binding of ε-ATP to Arp3 and 65% to its binding to Arp2. The value of J for ε-ATP binding to Arp2 in the presence of WA was 0.1 ± 0.03 μm. This value is high enough for the site to be emptied by Dowex treatment. Similar data (not shown) were obtained with ε-ADP instead of ε-ATP. Hence Arp3 and Arp2, in a WA-dependent fashion, can bind ADP. The addition of BeF3− did not increase the apparent affinity of ε-ADP, indicating that as for ADP-G-actin (18Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BeF3− did not bind to Arp2 or Arp3 in the ADP-bound form (data not shown). Overall, all data convey the view that in inactive Arp2/3 complex ATP is bound to Arp3 with high affinity and the ATP binding site on Arp2 is empty in the presence of micromolar amounts of free ATP. Binding of WA to Arp2/3 complex causes a structural change that enhances the affinity of ATP (or ADP) for Arp2 by about 400-fold. In contrast, the binding of ATP to Arp3 is not affected by WA. At saturating amounts of ε-ATP, binding of WA to Arp2/3 can be monitored by the increase in fluorescence of ε-ATP (Fig. 2 B). A value of 1.0 ± 0.2 μm was found for K WA, in agreement with Ref. 16Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar. The interaction of WA with Arp2/3 involves contacts with other subunits of the complex, in particular Arp3 and ARC41p (17Zalevsky J. Grigorova I. Mullins R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3468-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which are independent of ATP. 2C. Le Clainche, D. Didry, M.-F. Carlier, and D. Pantaloni, unpublished data. Detailed balance, however, implies that if the affinity of ATP for Arp2 is enhanced by WA, a structural change of the WA·Arp2 complex, linked to enhanced interaction of WA with Arp2, must accompany ATP binding to Arp2. Arp2/3 and G-actin associate with WA in a tight ternary complex that interacts with the filaments to make a branch (16Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Measuring the binding of ε-ATP to Arp2/3 in the ternary complex was feasible, because in our hands nucleotide exchange on G-actin is slowed down by WA, and nucleotide exchanges at a higher rate on Arp2 and Arp3 than on actin. Upon addition of ATP·G-actin to WA·Arp2/3 complex, the fluorescence increase linked to binding of ε-ATP was not affected. In conclusion, the enhanced binding of ATP to Arp2 depends on WA and is independent of G-actin binding. The relative affinities of ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP) for Arp3 and Arp2 subunits in the complex were determined by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence linked to their exchange for bound ε-ATP (Fig. 2, C and D). In the absence of WA, the competition curves show that ATP binds Arp3 with a 2.5-fold higher affinity than ε-ATP, and with a 2-fold and 6-fold higher affinity than ADP and AMPPNP, respectively. In the presence of WA, ATP or ADP competed with ε-ATP bound to both Arp3 and Arp2. The fluorescence measured at saturation by these nucleotides was equal to the fluorescence of free ε-ATP. In contrast, in the range 0–50 μm, AMPPNP failed to completely displace ε-ATP. The fluorescence reached a plateau corresponding to a 35% decrease. Both the change in fluorescence and the binding constant of AMPPNP are identical to those observed in the absence of WA (compareopen squares and calculated curves in Fig. 2,C and D). We conclude that it is with Arp3-bound ε-ATP that AMPPNP is competing in the presence as efficiently as in the absence of WA. In a one order of magnitude higher range of AMPPNP concentrations, however, AMPPNP could displace ε-ATP from Arp2, with an affinity two orders of magnitude lower than ATP (Table II). Other non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP, like AMPPCP and AMPCPP, behaved like AMPPNP, i.e.displaced ε-ATP bound to Arp3 and Arp2 in WA·Arp2/3 complex within a biphasic competition curve, indicating that the Arp2 subunit displays a stronger specificity than Arp3 for ATP versusnon-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP. Assuming that the binding of ATP and ADP to Arp3 is independent of WA, their binding to Arp2 in the presence of WA was derived by simple subtraction. Finally GTP and CTP bound weakly to Arp2/3 without WA. All binding data are summarized in Table II.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants for binding of different nucleotides to Arp3 and Arp2 in Arp2/3 complexNucleotideK dArp3Arp2μmATP0.01 ± 0.0050.1 ± 0.02ADP0.02 ± 0.0050.6 ± 0.2AMPPNP0.05 ± 0.0215 ± 5AMPPCP0.10 ± 0.0325 ± 5AMPCPP0.10 ± 0.0320 ± 5GTP0.3 ± 0.16 ± 2CTP0.8 ± 0.220 ± 5Values of K d were derived from fluorescence data (four independent experiments) as in Fig. 2 B. Arp2/3 complex (1 μm) was supplemented with ɛ-ATP (5 μm) in F0 buffer, in the absence or presence of 10 μmWA. Bound ɛ-ATP was displaced by different nucleotides. The fluorescence curve obtained in the absence of WA representing displacement of ɛ-ATP from Arp3 was subtracted from the curve obtained in the presence of WA to obtain a curve representing displacement of ɛ-ATP from Arp2. The concentration of nucleotide ([N50]) required for 50% displacement of bound ɛ-ATP from Arp3 and from Arp2 was determined. The value of the intrinsic dissociation constant K d was calculated as follows.K d = Kɛ · [N50]/[ɛ50], where [ɛ50] = 4.6 μm and Kɛ = 2.5 K ATP. Open table in a new tab Values of K d were derived from fluorescence data (four independent experiments) as in Fig. 2 B.

The value of the intrinsic dissociation constant K d was calculated as follows.K d = Kɛ · [N50]/[ɛ50], where [ɛ50] = 4.6 μm and Kɛ = 2.5 K ATP. Two conclusions emerge from the binding studies. First, Arp2 and Arp3 have a lower affinity for ATP than G-actin (K = 109m−1 in F0 buffer). Second, Arp2 is more similar to G-actin than Arp3 regarding its high specificity for ATP as compared with ATP analogs, which bind poorly. As a result, in solutions containing AMPPNP and ATP in a 25:1 molar ratio, ATP is bound to Arp2 whereas essentially AMPPNP is bound to Arp3. Using the information derived from the above binding studies, we examined the stimulation of actin assembly by Arp2/3 complex and WA in solutions containing ATP, ADP, ADP + BeF3−, AMPPNP, or mixed ATP and AMPPNP (or ATP and AMPPCP) (Fig. 3). When Dowex-treated Arp2/3 (containing one ATP bound to Arp3, no ATP bound to Arp2) was added to ATP·G-actin 1:1 complex in the absence of free ATP, no stimulation of actin polymerization was observed. Stimulation resumed upon addition of ATP (Fig. 3 A). At variance with Higgs et al. (19Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), Arp2/3 did not stimulate polymerization, hence did not branch filaments, in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3 B). In a medium containing ADP + BeF3−, ADP-BeF3− is bound to actin filaments, and ADP is bound to G-actin, Arp2, and Arp3. In these conditions actin filaments are susbtrates for Arp2/3-induced branching because BeF3− did not affect the branching when actin was polymerized in ATP (10Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.-F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); however Arp2/3 did not stimulate actin polymerization suggesting that the ADP-bound form of Arp2/3 is inactive. No stimulation of actin assembly was detected when ATP·G-actin 1:1 complex was polymerized in the presence of Arp2/3 with AMPPCP bound to both Arp2 and Arp3. Stimulation of actin assembly appeared in an ATP-dependent fashion consistent with saturation of a site that had a 30-fold higher affinity for ATP than for AMPPCP (Fig. 3 D). The binding data (Table II and Fig. 2) indicate that Arp3 has only a 5- to 10-fold higher affinity for ATP than for analogs. Hence this last result indicates that it is the binding of ATP to Arp2 that is required for filament branching. Similarly, no stimulation of polymerization of ATP·G-actin 1:1 complex was observed by Arp2/3 in the presence of 0.2 mmAMPPNP. Addition of only 10 μm ATP restored 80% maximum stimulation. Under these conditions, essentially AMPPNP is bound to Arp3 and ATP to Arp2 (Fig. 3 C). In summary, despite the similarity between actin, Arp2, and Arp3, ATP is bound less tightly to Arp2 and even to Arp3 than to G-actin. In the inactive state of the Arp2/3 complex, the affinity of ATP for Arp2 is low suggesting that the cleft separating the two domains that contains the ATP site must be largely open. However, even when the ATP site is empty, Arp2 does not denature, as actin would do under such conditions, suggesting that molecular interactions between Arp2 and neighboring subunits in Arp2/3 complex prevent denaturation of Arp2. The high affinity binding of ATP to Arp2 that is linked to activation of Arp2/3 by WASp proteins is expected to cause a large structural change of the complex. Branching of filaments occurs by association of the branching complex (G-actin·WA· Arp2/3) with a filament (8Pantaloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.-F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 10Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.-F. Nat.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11390-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Polymerization studies in the presence of ATP and analogs show that branching can occur if a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP is bound to Arp3, but ATP binding to Arp2 is required for branching. This result suggests, but does not prove, that ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is required for filament branching. The low affinity of the non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP for Arp2 may also indicate that they do not induce the functional structural state of Arp2/3 complex. Hence whether ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is required for branching remains an open issue."

However, the mechanism regulating its overexpression in senescent cells is unknown. We used the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter system to scan regulatory elements in the upstream region of p16INK4a. The results of 5′-deletion studies indicated that the transcription regulatory elements contributing to overexpression of p16INK4a in senescent cells were located in the region of the p16INK4a promoter from −622 to −280 bp.

Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 25: 585-621Crossref Scopus (5572) Google Scholar). A number of regulatory proteins have been proposed to transduce senescence-inducing signals or mediate entrance of the cell into the senescence stage. Prominent among these is the p16INK4atumor suppressor protein (2Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It inhibits CDK4/CDK6-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) and causes cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (4Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar). The p16INK4a gene is progressively up-regulated as fibroblasts undergo increasing numbers of cell divisions and approach senescence (2Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C.

Neilsen et al. (11Nielsen G.P. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Shaw J. Roy J.E. Koh J. Louis D.N. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1137-1143PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the immunohistochemical localization of p16INK4ain all human organs and demonstrated that cellular p16INK4aexpression is highly selective. In adults, p16INK4a is widely expressed in many tissues such as proliferative endometrium, breast ductal epithelium, squamous and tubal metaplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix, esophageal squamous epithelium, and salivary glands among others. In infants, p16INK4a staining was limited to thymic Hassall's corpuscles, occasional thymic lymphocytes, and only rare pancreatic epithelial cells. Therefore, restriction of p16INK4a expression in infants to the thymus, the only organ committed to early senescence and increased expression of p16INK4a in adult tissues, may reflect a role of p16INK4a in normal organ senescence. Consistent with the role of p16INK4a in senescence, inactivation of the p16INK4a/Rb pathway results in life span extension or immortalization. Mouse fibroblasts that have bypassed senescence have often lost expression of p16INK4a (12Serrano M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 237: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In certain human cell types, such as human keratinocytes or mammary epithelial cells, in which telomerase expression alone is insufficient to bypass senescence, the additional inactivation of p16INK4a by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms is required to bypass senescence and render the cells immortal (13Kiyono T.

Similarly, viral oncoproteins such as SV40 large T antigen, adenoviral E1a protein, or herpesvirus E7 protein inactivate the growth-suppressive functions of Rb and facilitate immortalization (15Jansen-Dürr P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 270-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Yeager T.R. Reddel R. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1999; 10: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread alterations of p16INK4a in senescence, immortalization and tumorgenesis, little is known about the transcription regulatory mechanism of this gene. Therefore, we have initiated a search for specific transcription regulatory elements whose function may contribute to up-regulation of p16INK4a in senescent fibroblasts. In this paper, we describe a novel negative transcription regulatory element, the INK4a transcription silence element (ITSE),1 within sequence −491 to −485 bp of the p16INK4a promoter. A 24-kDa protein that was highly expressed in young cells may inhibit the expression of p16INK4a by interacting with ITSE. A GC-abundant element located in the region from −466 to −451 bp was also involved with high expression of p16INK4a in senescent fibroblasts. 2BS cells were previously isolated from female fetal lung fibroblast tissue and have been fully characterized (17Tang Z. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Corbley M.J. Tong T. Mech. Aging Dev. 1994; 73: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 2BS cell line was originally established at the National Institute of Biological Products (Beijing, China). The current expected life span is ∼70 population doublings (PD). 2BS cells were considered to be young at PD 30 or below and to be fully senescent at PD 55 or above. RetroPackTM PT-67 cell line (CLONTECH) is a retrovirus packaging cell line. In conjunction with a retroviral vector, it allows production of infectious, replication-incompetent retrovirus that can be used to introduce a gene of interest into a wide variety of mammalian cell types in vitro or in vivo. 2BS and PT-67 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), which contained 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Self-inactivating retrovirus vector pSIR-EGFP was constructed in pSIR (CLONTECH) by inserting an EGFP-SV40poly(A) fragment derived from pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) into EcoRI andBamHI positions. A p16INK4a promoter fragment containing nucleotides −1 to −3017 relative to the ATG in pGL2-Basic vector was generously provided by Dr. Gorden Peters (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London, UK). A series of 5′ truncations were generated with different endonucleases listed in Fig.1. Various fragments were isolated from restriction digests and were ligated between the XhoI andHindIII sites in pSIR-EGFP. Transfections of plasmids containing p16 promoter 5′-deletions into PT67 retroviral packaging cells were performed with LipofectinTM (Life Technologies). Drug selection (500 μg of G418/ml) was started 2 days after transfection and continued for 10–14 days. Virus-producing cell clones were mixed and cultured to generate retroviral supernatants in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which were gathered by passing through a 0.45-μm pore size filter and stored at −80 °C until use. Young 2BS cells (PDL 22) plated 1 day earlier at ∼105cells/9-cm2 well were transduced by refeeding them for 10–12 h with retroviral supernatant plus polybrene (4 μg/ml; Sigma). The treated cells were subcultured the next day into 50-cm2flasks (Costar). Drug selection (200 μg of G418/ml) was started 2 days after transfection and continued for 14 days. Cell clones were mixed and cultured to their finite life span under the selection with 50 μg of G418/ml. Monolayer cell cultures were trypsinized and fixed with cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.2) containing 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed three times in sterile PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of sterile PBS for flow cytometry analysis. The cells were flow cytometrically analyzed (FACStar; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with excitation at 488 nm from an argon laser operating at a constant power output of 200 W. The enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fluorescence signals were collected with a total accumulation of 10,000 cells/run. Young (PD 25) and senescent 2BS cells (PD 62) were grown to 80% confluence before being washed three times with PBS and harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were pelleted, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in five packed cell volumes of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT (Buffer A). Following a 10 min incubation on ice, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in two packed cell volumes of buffer A. The cells were then lysed by Dounce homogenization and centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethlylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended cells were stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. The protein concentration of the dialyzed material was determined by Lowry assay. DNase I footprinting reactions were performed as described in the protocol of SureTrack Footprinting Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, young and senescent 2BS nuclear extracts were combined with binding buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10,000 cpm of the end-radiolabeled probe in a final volume of 50 μl at room temperature for 30 min. Fresh dilutions of DNase I were made in 4 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and an appropriate volume was added to each reaction. After 1 min, 150 μl of stop buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 250 mg/ml yeast RNA) was added, and reactions were subsequently extracted with phenol/chloroform, DNA-precipitated in ethanol, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in formamide buffer. Samples were resolved on 6% sequencing gel. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film for 48–72 h. G + A chemical sequence marker was electrophoresed with the sample to identify the size and location of the protected DNase I footprints. Nuclear extracts from young and senescent 2BS cells were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Probe (50,000 cpm) was added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. In competition experiments unlabeled oligonucleotides were added just prior to the addition of the probe. Reactions were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels in 0.5× TBE. The gels were electrophoresed at 300 V at 4 °C for ∼3 h. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed with an intensifier screen. 120 μg of young and senescent 2BS nuclear extracts were electrophoretically separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins from the gel were subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was incubated in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mmMgCl2, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 5 min. The filter was then blocked for 30 min in a 5% blotto solution. The blot was rinsed three times with binding buffer containing 0.25% blotto before the radiolabeled probe was added to the buffer. The blot was incubated with the probe for 16 h at 4 °C, washed five times with binding buffer, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 24–72 h. Site-directed mutagenesis of the −870 bp p16INK4a promoter was prepared by QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis methods. We designed a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GGAAGGTTGGATCCCGGAGGAAGGAAACG-3′) to create a new BamHI site at position −482. Then two double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-CTTTCCCTATGAGATCTAACACCCCGATTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGGGGCAGATCTCTTTTTAACAGAG-3′ were used to create a newBglII site at position −522 and −451 of the promoter, respectively. BglII and BamHI produce compatible overhangs. When digested with these two endonucleases and ligated with T4-ligase, the fragment between BglII and BamHI was deleted. The nucleotide sequences of the deleted mutants were confirmed by a DNA sequencer, model 3700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The wide type −870 bp p16INK4a promoter and two deletion mutants 5′-MUT (−522 to −482 region deletion) and 3′-MUT (−482 to −451 region deletion) were inserted into XhoI andHindIII sites in pSEAP-Basic vector. Transfection of the young (PD26) and senescent (PD62) 2BS cells were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and SEAP activity was assayed using the Great EscAPe SEAPTM chemiluminescence detection kit (CLONTECH). SEAP light output was measured in a luminometer and normalized against the transfection pSV-β-galactosidase control vector. Measurement of β-galactosidase was performed using a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). We used the EGFP reporter system to scan regulatory elements in the upstream region of p16INK4agene. On the base of self-inactivating retrovirus vector pSIR-EGFP, we constructed a series of plasmids in which various lengths of the p16INK4a promoter were placed upstream of the EGFP. Transfecting the recombinant vectors into retrovirus packaging cells, we got virus supernatants. The young human fibroblasts were infected with virus. Then the infected cells were cultured to their finite life span. EGFP activity was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The data in Fig. 2 showed that very low expression of EGFP was observed in young and senescent cells infected by pSIR-EGFP−280, which contained −280 bp upstream from ATG of the p16 promoter. The activities of the −622, −870, −1400, −2070, and −3017 bp of the p16 promoter increased in senescent cells 5–7 times relative to that in young cells. Deletion from −3017 to −622 had little effect on promoter activity. A marked loss of promoter activity was observed when the region between −622 and −280 was excised (pSIR-EGFP−280). Together, these results indicated that the main transcription-regulatory elements contributing to overexpression of p16 in senescent cells were located in the region from −622 to −280 of the promoter. We analyzed the DNA-protein interactions within the functionally important segment of the p16INK4a promoter as a means to identify putative cis-acting elements that mediate promoter function. In vitro DNase I footprinting was performed with nuclear extracts from young and senescent 2BS cells and single end-labeled probe spanning −622 to −280. As seen in Fig.3, three footprints were detected in this region. Two regions (region A, from −507 to −493, and region C, extended from −466 to −450) could be combined with nuclear proteins extracted from both young and senescent 2BS cells. Region B that extended from −491 to −485 was mainly detected in the presence of extract from young 2BS cells. The positions and sequences of footprinted regions A, B, and C are shown in Fig.4. Regions A and B were separated only by one nucleotide. Region C was rich in GC sequence and contained the conventional consensus Sp1 binding site, 5′-GGGCGG-3′.Figure 4The partial sequence of p16INK4apromoter. Regions A, B, and C are three nuclear protein binding regions identified in footprinting experiments. 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotide probes were used for competition in EMSA experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the nuclear factors that bind to the footprinted region A, B, and C, we performed EMSA with young and senescent fibroblasts extracts. A 32P-end-labeled segment from −622 to −374 of the p16 promoter was used for EMSA, and two double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (5′-oligo, whose sequence extended from −525 to −481 covering the footprinted region A and B, and 3′-oligo, whose sequence extended from −480 to −447 covering the footprinted region C; Fig. 4) were used for competition. Six retarded bands were detected as shown in Fig. 5. Band e, which was completely competed by 5′-oligo, could only be detected in the presence of extract from young 2BS cells. Bands a, b, c, and f could be competed by 3′-oligo probe. Among them, bands b and c could only be detected in the presence of extract from senescent 2BS cells. We next studied the molecular weight of DNA-binding proteins that could combine with the region from −622 to −280 of the p16 promoter with Southwestern blotting. As showed in Fig.6, a 24-kDa binding protein was observed only in young cells, and 15.5-kDa binding protein could be detected in both kinds of cells. In order to investigate the contribution of the protected regions acquired from the DNase I footprinting assay toward the promoter activity, we deleted the region from −522 to −482 (named 5′-MUT) and the region −482 to −451 (called 3′-MUT) from −870 bp of the p16 promoter, respectively. After inserting these two kinds of mutated promoters and the wild type −870 bp p16 promoter into the multiple clone sites of pSEAP-Basic vector, we generated three mutational reporter gene expression vectors, pSEAP−870, pSEAP-5′-MUT, and pSEAP-3′-MUT. Recombinant vectors were transfected into young and senescent 2BS cells. pSEAP-5′-MUT with the −522 to −482 deletion showed that promoter activity increased by 72% in young cells, while no significant change occurred in senescent cells. Deletion of the region from −482 to −451 showed a 91.4% loss of activity of p16INK4a promoter in senescent cells, and the promoter activity decreased by 41.2% in young cells comparably (Figs.7 and8).Figure 8SEAP activity in senescent 2BS cells.The pSEAP-5′-MUT construct with a −522 to −482 deletion showed no significant change of promoter activity. The pSEAP-3′-MUT construct with a −482 to −451 deletion showed a 91.2% loss of activity. The mean activity and S.D. values were relative to wide type promoter activity, which was arbitrarily set at 100% (**, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The vector pSIR used for 5′-deletion study is a self-inactivating retrovirus vector (19Schnell T. Foley P. Wirth M. Munch J. Uberla K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It contains a 176-bp deletion in the 3′-long terminal repeat that removes the enhancer sequence. Following reverse transcription, the 3′-long terminal repeat is copied and replaces 5′-long terminal repeat resulting in inactivation of the 5′-long terminal repeat promoter. It can be used for transcription regulatory research. The results of the 5′-deletion assay indicated that the activities of different length (−622 to −3017 bp) of the p16INK4a promoter were enhanced by 5–7-fold during the fibroblast aging process, which was much lower than the increment level of p16INK4a mRNA and protein in senescent cells. In many cultured cell lines, such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and urothelial cells, p16INK4a accumulates with increasing numbers of population doublings (2Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G.

Interestingly, the levels of p16INK4a continue to rise after the cells have effectively ceased to divide (2Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Since p16 RNA is extremely stable (3Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), many researchers hypothesize that accumulation of p16INK4a mRNA and proteins with each PD may lead to overexpression of this gene in senescent cells (3Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 20Stein C.H. Drullinger L.F. Soulard A. Dulic V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). However, the significant elevation of p16INK4a begins from the late stage of senescence, but not from early passage, gradually. There are no significant changes in p16INK4a RNA stability between early passage and late passage fibroblast cells (3Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). So we hypothesized that there are some negative regulatory mechanisms in young fibroblasts that inhibit the transcription of p16INK4a by negative feedback to prevent the accumulation of p16INK4a in young cells. In senescent cells, the negative regulatory mechanisms are turned off, which will lead to elevation of p16 promoter activity. On the other hand, the loss of negative regulation will initiate the accumulation of p16INK4a. Therefore, we suppose that the loss of negative regulatory mechanisms plays a primary role in overexpression of p16INK4a in senescent cells. We located the main regulatory elements contributing to the overexpression of p16INK4a in the region of the promoter from −622 to −280 through 5′-deletion assays. Then we studied the DNA-protein interactions with this fragment in vitro. The result of DNase I footprinting showed that the fragment spanning −491 to −485 relative to the ATG was specifically protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts from young 2BS cells. As mentioned above, the activity of the −622 bp promoter increased by 5-fold in the fibroblast aging process. We postulate that the region (−491 to −485) may be a silencer. In order to confirm this theory, we performed EMSA and site-directed deletion assays. The fragment (−622 to −374) was end-labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from young and senescent cells, respectively. The formation of DNA-protein complexes that could be competed by a 100-fold molar excess of the synthetic 5′-oligo oligonucleotides completely was only detected in young cells (Fig. 5, band e). The fragment (−522 to −482) was deleted from −870 bp of the p16 promoter. The deletion resulted in a drastic increase in promoter activity to about 170.2% compared with the wild type promoter (set arbitrarily at 100%) in young cells and no significant change in senescent cells. The results demonstrated that the region (−491 to −485) was a negative regulatory element, and it mediated transcriptional inhibition of p16INK4a by interacting with a protein factor highly expressed in young cells. This functional element did not contain consensus sequence of cis-acting transcription factors that have been reported. It was a novel silencer, ITSE. The sequence of ITSE is 5′-GAAGGTT-3′. A transcription inhibition factor that was highly expressed in young cells may inhibit the expression of p16 by interacting with ITSE. Up to now, it is known that the Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins can inhibit the transcription of p16INK4a. The loss of Id function has been linked to replicative senescence (21Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Id1-deficient mice express high levels of p16INK4a (22Lyden D. Young A.Z. Zagzag D. Yan W. Gerald W. O'Reilly R. Bader B.L. Hynes R.O. Zhuang Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Nature. 1999; 401: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Id1 interacts with Ets2 and blocks its transcriptional activation effect on p16INK4a (23Ohtani N Zebedee Z. Huot T.H. Stinson J.A. Sugimoto M. Ohashi Y. Sharrocks A.D. Peters G. Hara E. Nature. 2001; 409: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Unlike basic helix-loop-helix proteins, Ids lack a DNA-binding activity due to the absence of a basic domain (24Takai N. Miyazaki T. Fujisawa K. Nasu K. Miyakawa I. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein binding to ITSE did not belong to the Id family of transcription factors. We performed Southwestern blot to detect the molecular weight of the proteins that can bind to the fragment (−622 to −280) of the p16INK4apromoter. A 24-kDa protein could only be detected in young 2BS cells. We postulated that this protein was the transcription inhibition factor binding to and acting through ITSE, but it needs further confirmation. The GC-abundant region C (−466 to −450; Fig. 3) was another footprinted region. It could be protected by nuclear protein extracted from both young and senescent fibroblasts. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays with fragment −622 to −374 as the labeled probe and a 100-fold molar excess of the 3′-oligo unlabeled oligonucleotide as competitor indicated that the gel mobility-retarded DNA-protein complexes a, b, c, and f were competed by the 3′-oligo oligonucleotide. Moreover, complexes b and c were present in nuclear extracts from the senescent 2BS cells. This suggested that some new transcription factors bound to this region in senescent cells. The result of deletion mutation demonstrated that region C was a positive regulatory element related to the increase of expression of p16INK4a in senescent cells. Deletion of this region showed 91.4% loss of activity of the p16INK4a promoter in senescent cells, and the promoter activity decreased by 41.2% in young cells comparably. The sequence of region C was 5′-ACGGGGCGGGGGCGGA-3′. It contained two conventional consensus Sp family protein (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1998; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) binding sites, 5′-GGGCGG-3′. This GC-box element is an important and widely distributed promoter element (26Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). It is required for the appropriate expression of many ubiquitous, tissue-specific and viral genes. In addition, it occurs frequently in the regulatory region of genes that are under a specific mode of control such as cell cycle regulation, tumor genesis, hormonal activation, and developmental and senescent patterning. The transcription factors that can bind to and act though the GC-boxes are the Sp family of proteins (27Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 594: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This family consists of four proteins designated Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. All four human Sp family members have similar structures. The DNA binding domain close to the C terminus contains three zinc fingers. The zinc finger structure is highly conserved in Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 but not in Sp2. Consistently, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 recognize the classical GC-box element with identical affinity (28Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 29Fairall L. Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), while Sp2 does not bind to the GC-box but to a GT-rich element (30Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Both Sp1 and Sp4 are known to be strong transcriptional activators. Sp4 expression appears to be restricted to a few tissues. High levels of Sp4 are predominantly found in the brain (31Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The transcriptional role of Sp3 is complicated. In some experiments, Sp3 was shown to act as a transcriptional activator similar to Sp1 (32Zhao L. Chang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4869-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In other experiments, Sp3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of Sp1-mediated activation (34Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Sp family of proteins are involved in regulating the activities of senescence-regulated genes such as p21WAF1 (36Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Werner helicase genes (37Yamabe Y. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Yokota J. Sugawara M. Furuichi Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) investigated the binding of nuclear protein factors to the cyclin D1 gene promoter domain in young and senescent normal human fibroblasts to clarify the molecular mechanisms of cyclin D1 expression during in vitro cellular aging. They found that the binding of Sp1 to its promoter element occurred only in senescent cells, which may promote the increase of cyclin D1 expression during cellular aging. In humans, serum transferrin levels decrease during the aging process. A decrease in Sp1-like binding activity was shown to cause decreased transcription of the human transferrin gene (5Adrian G.S. Seto E. Fischbach K.S. Rivera E.V. Adrian E.K. Herbert D.C. Walter C.A. Weaker F.J. Bowman B.H. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1996; 51: B66-B75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our study, we found when the GC-box element located in −466 to −450 was deleted, the decrease of p16 promoter activity in senescent cells was much higher than in young cells, which suggested that the GC-box-binding proteins contributed to the increase of p16INK4a expression in senescent cells. We are very grateful to Dr. Danial L. Kilpatrick (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) for careful reading of the manuscript and Dr. Gorden Peters for the kind gift of the p16 promoter-Luc vector."

Despite a 100-year history of anthocyanin research, the widespread existence of acylated anthocyanins in plants has been recognized only during the past 2 decades, mainly because of their lability during the previously employed isolation processes of the pigments (1Strack D. Wray V. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D. C.1994: 1-22Google Scholar). Two major types of acyl substituents of anthocyanins exist (i.e. aromatic and aliphatic acyl groups), both of which are commonly linked to a hydroxy group of a glycosyl moiety of anthocyanins. It has been proposed that aromatic acylation makes anthocyanin bluer by intramolecular stacking of the anthocyanins with polyphenols (2Brouillard R. Dangles O. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D. C.1994: 565-588Google Scholar, 3Goto T. Kondo T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 17-33Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar), whereas aliphatic acylation has no such effect but is believed to be important for enhancing pigment solubility in water, protecting glycosides from enzymatic degradation, stabilizing anthocyanin structures, or facilitating the uptake of anthocyanins into the vacuoles (4Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D. C.1994: 499-535Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathways leading to anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides have been well characterized and are conserved in plant species. On the other hand, modification, including acylation, of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides is variable and has not been understood well (4Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D. C.1994: 499-535Google Scholar, 5Tanaka Y. Tsuda S. Kusumi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1119-1126Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Yamazaki M. Gong Z.

In the crude extracts of a variety of plant tissues, the acylation of anthocyanins has been shown to be catalyzed by flavonoid-specific acyltransferases, which use coenzyme A (CoA) esters as acyl donors (4Heller W. Forkmann G. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D. C.1994: 499-535Google Scholar). Recently, two aromatic acyltransferases (i.e. hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6“-O-acyltransferase from the petals of gentian (Gentiana triflora, Gt5AT) (7Fujiwara H. Tanaka Y.

Sequence comparison studies suggest that these aromatic acyltransferases belong to a versatile plant acyltransferase family, which is a large, recently identified protein family including numerous acyltransferase homologs of as yet unidentified biochemical functions in plants (8Yonekura-Sakakibara K.

Malonylation is probably the most common aliphatic acylation of flavonoids and is exemplified by salvianin (i.e.pelargonidin 3-(6“-O-caffeyl-β-glucopyranoside)-5-(4‴,6‴-O-dimalonyl-β-glucopyranoside)) of scarlet sage (Salvia splendens) flowers (Fig. 1, compound1a) (11Kondo T.

However, the identity of the anthocyanin malonyltransferases and aliphatic acyltransferases remains to be established, mainly due to the difficulty of their purification (6Yamazaki M. Gong Z.

To enhance knowledge of the enzymology of malonylation (or aliphatic acylation) of anthocyanins in plants and shed light on the structure/function relationship of anthocyanin acyltransferases, we have undertaken to study the anthocyanin malonyltransferase of S. splendens. We describe here the first isolation, characterization, and gene cloning of an anthocyanin malonyltransferase to show that it is a member of the versatile plant acyltransferase family with a divergent phylogenetic relationship in the family. Scarlet sage plants (S. splendens) were grown in a standard greenhouse at Suntory Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and recently opened flowers (including petals and sepals; less than 2 cm in length) were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Anthocyanins were isolated and purified at Minami-Kyushu University (Miyazaki, Japan) and were used as authentic samples after confirmation of their structures by instrumental analyses (see legend to Fig. 1S for details). The standard reaction mixture (a final volume, 100 μl) consisted of 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 120 μm anthocyanin substrate, 60 μmmalonyl-CoA (final concentrations), and enzyme. For routine assays, shisonin (Fig. 1, compound 2b) was used as an anthocyanin substrate. The mixture without enzyme was preincubated at 30 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Anthocyanins in the reaction mixture were routinely analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC1 using a RAININ Dynamax HPLC system (Rainin Instruments Co., Woburn, MA) equipped with a SHIMADZU SPD-10A VP UV-visible detector (column, Shodex Asahipak ODP-50 4E (4.6 × 250 mm); flow rate, 0.7 ml/min; solvent A, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile). After injection (100 μl) onto a column that was equilibrated with 45% B, the column was initially developed isocratically for 3 min, followed by linear gradients from 45% B to 55% B in 15 min and from 55% B to 100% B in 1 min. The column was then washed isocratically with 100% B for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient from 100% B to 45% B in 1 min. The chromatograms were obtained with detection at 520 nm, and anthocyanins were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic samples (bisdemalonylsalvianin, 9.6 min; monodemalonylsalvianin, 11.1 min; shisonin, 11.7 min; 6‴-malonylshisonin, 14.4 min). The amounts of anthocyanins were determined from peak integrals using authentic samples, which were used for calibration. Kinetic parameters and their S.E. values were estimated by fitting the initial velocity data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis (14Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All operations were performed at 4 °C. All buffers used throughout the enzyme purification contained 30 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and the buffer pH was set at 7.0. The flowers (less than 2 cm; petals and sepals, 2.7 kg) of S. splendens were suspended in 10,800 ml of 100 mm potassium Picontaining 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and were disrupted for 30 s in a Waring blender, followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the precipitate of a 20–50% saturation fraction was dissolved in 3,000 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To the enzyme solution, 280 ml of octyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer 1 (20 mm potassium Picontaining ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation) was added. Ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the mixture to a concentration of 30% saturation followed by gentle overnight stirring. Gel matrices were recovered by filtration and washed with Buffer 1. The enzyme was eluted with Buffer 2 (20 mm potassium Pi containing 50% ethylene glycol). The eluate was concentrated and equilibrated with Buffer 3 (10 mm potassium Pi containing 0.03% Triton X-100) by repeated concentrations and dilutions using a Pellicon ultrafiltration unit (Biomax 8K; Millipore Corp.). The enzyme solution (155 ml) was applied to a MIMETIC Yellow 2 (100 ml; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) column equilibrated with Buffer 3. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with 20 mm potassium Pi containing 0.05% CHAPS. The enzyme solution (32 ml) was applied to a MIMETIC Red 3 column (50 ml; Nacalai Tesque) equilibrated with Buffer 4 (5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, containing 0.03% Triton X-100). The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with Buffer 4 containing 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA and was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The enzyme solution (1.5 ml) was applied to a Mono Q 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer 4 containing 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min, using a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with Buffer 4. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (in 400 min) of 0–1 m NaCl in Buffer 4. The enzyme solution (0.8 ml) was applied to a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer 1 at a flow rate of 0.02 ml/min using an FPLC system. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (0–100% in 500 min) of Buffer 2. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gels were visualized by silver staining. Total RNA was isolated from the S. splendens petals as described previously (17McGookin R. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 2. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1984: 113-116Google Scholar) and was used for the isolation of poly(A)+-RNA using a kit (Oligotex™-dT30 Super Kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A cDNA library of S. splendenspetals was constructed using a ZAP Express cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme (termed Ss5MaT1) were determined essentially as described previously (7Fujiwara H. Tanaka Y. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Nakao M. Fukui Y. Yamaguchi M. Ashikari T. Kusumi T. Plant J. 1998; 16: 421-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequences determined, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized (see also Fig. 3): primer I (5′-TAYGCIGCIGGIGAYTCIGTICCIGT-3′), primer II (5′-GTICCIGTIACIATHGCIGC-3′), and primer III (5′-YTTICCCCAICCRAARTCIGC-3′), where I indicates inosine and R, H, and Y indicate degenerate sites (R, A/G; H, A/C/T; and Y, C/T). The cDNA library was then used as a template for PCR amplification of partial Ss5MaT1 cDNA using primers I and III, and an amplified fragment was further subjected to nested PCR using primers II and III. The PCR amplifications were completed using 1× TaKaRa PCR buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 μm each of primers, and 2.5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) with 100 ng of DNA template. Thermal cycling conditions were 96 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 1 min for denaturation, 42 °C for 2 min for annealing, and 72 °C for 3 min for extension and, finally, 72 °C for 7 min. The nested PCR was completed in the same way as above except that the annealing temperature was 50 °C. The cDNA library, ∼200,000 plaques, was screened using an amplified DNA fragment encoding determined partial amino acid sequences as a probe. The DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to label and detect DNA following the manufacturer's guidelines. Because the longest cDNA clone was found to lack a translation initiation codon, we further analyzed the genomic DNA clone containing the 5′-terminal region of theSs5MaT1 using an LA PCR in vitro Cloning Kit (TaKaRa) (18Isegawa Y. Sheng J. Sokowa Y. Yamanishi K. Nakagomi O. Shigeharu U. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1992; 6: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The BamHI-digested S. splendens genomic DNA, primer S1 (5′-AGGCAGTGGTGATTGGAGAAACCGATGCAG-3′), primer S2 (5′-TTCGGTGTTGGACGGGTAGAGGAGGTTGCC-3′), and primer S3 (5′-TGGAACGATTGTGTGGAGGAATTGGGATTTGGAGG-3′) were used for the analysis. The nucleotide sequences of complementary and genomic DNAs were determined using an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A; Applied Biosystems). Geneworks (IntelliGenetics) and GENETYX (Software Development) programs were used for analysis of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The Ss5MaT1 cDNA that was obtained lacked the 5′-terminal portion by 4 bp, as was revealed by sequencing of the genomic Ss5MaT1 DNA. The four bases were added by the PCR-based strategy, and the resultant full-length Ss5MaT1cDNA was ligated into the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen), as described in the following. The Ss5MaT1 cDNA excised into a pBK-CMV phagemid vector was termed pBK-CMV/Ss5MaT1. To inactivate BamHI and XmnI sites in theSs5MaT1 gene, a partial Ss5MaT1 cDNA (0.5 kb in length) was first amplified by PCR using pBK-CMV/Ss5MaT1 as a template and primers (5′-GGACCCGCCGATACCGGAAAATTACTTC and 5′-GGATCCTTAGAATGGTTCGACGAGCGCCGGAGA-3′), where the underlining indicates the BamHI site and the double underlining indicates the translation termination codon. Using a mixture of this 0.5-kb cDNA fragment and upstream primer (5′-GGATCCATCGAGGGACGCATGACAACAACAACAAC-3′; double underlining indicates the translation initiation codon), a full-length Ss5MaT1 DNA (1.4 kb in length) was amplified by PCR with pBK-CMV/Ss5MaT1 as a template. The upstream primer was designed on the basis of the genomic Ss5MaT1 sequence determined by the LA PCR strategy (see above) in order to add the lacking 5′-terminal portion (ATGA). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amplified DNA fragment (digested with BamHI) was ligated with aBamHI-digested pQE-30 vector to obtain the plasmid pSs5MaT1, which encodes an N-terminal in-frame fusion of Ss5MaT1 with a His6 tag. Escherichia coli JM109 was used as a host for the expression of pSs5MaT1. Transformant cells were cultivated at 30 °C in 600 ml of an LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin untilA600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by further cultivation for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were suspended in Buffer 5 (100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation of the mixture on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was sonicated for 3 min. Polyethyleneimine was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the mixture was gently stirred for 10 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min), the supernatant was applied to a column (1 ml) of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer 5. The column was washed with Buffer 6 (100 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.5, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mm imidazole, followed by elution with Buffer 6 containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was applied to a High-Q column (Bio-Rad), and the column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through and washing fractions were pooled and 20% saturated with ammonium sulfate. The enzyme solution was subjected to FPLC on phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 as described above. Salvianin (Fig. 1, compound 1a), which is the predominant anthocyanin responsible for the scarlet coloration of the S. splendensflowers, 2Relative contents (mol %) of anthocyanins in the S. splendens flowers were estimated by LC-MS analysis as follows: salvianin/monodemalonylsalvianin/pelargonidin 3-(p-coumaryl-β-glucopyranoside)-5-(dimalonyl-β-glucopyranoside)/pelargonidin 3-(p-coumaryl-β-glucopyranoside)-5-(malonyl-β-glucopyranoside) = 53:22:19:6 (for petals) and 50:17:27:6 (for sepals). has two malonyl groups linked to the 4‴- and 6‴-hydroxyl functions of the 5-glucosyl moiety. In the crude extracts of S. splendensflowers, we could identify two distinct malonyltransferase activities. One catalyzed the monomalonylation of bisdemalonylsalvianin (Fig.1, 1c) (termed first malonylation), whereas the other catalyzed the further malonylation of the product of the first malonylation reaction to produce salvianin (second malonylation). These activities could be easily separated from each other by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatographies (data not shown). An enzyme catalyzing the first malonylation could not catalyze the second malonylation and vice versa, indicating that the first and second malonylations of anthocyanin are catalyzed by distinct enzymes. In this study, we have purified the enzyme responsible for the first malonylation (termed Ss5MaT1). Preliminary studies showed that, during the development of S. splendens flowers, a high specific activity of Ss5MaT1 was found in recently opened flowers (less than 2 cm in length), and a large amount of such flowers (sepals and petals, 2.7 kg) was used as a starting material to purify the enzyme. The enzyme was extremely unstable to oxidation, and the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol in the buffer was essential for efficient purification of the enzyme. Furthermore, we found that the enzyme was specifically eluted from the MIMETIC Red 3 column with acetyl-CoA, allowing us to effectively eliminate contaminant proteins, which were difficult to remove by conventional procedures such as ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. Finally, the enzyme could be purified 685-fold with an activity yield of 0.3% after seven purification steps (Table I). Purified Ss5MaT1 showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2). The native molecular mass of the purified Ss5MaT1 was estimated to be 46 kDa by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200HR column, indicating that the enzyme was monomeric.Table IPurification of Ss5MaT1 from S. splendens flowersPurification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmgnanokatal/mg protein-fold%Crude extract14,0000.13110020–50% (NH4)2SO47,1200.211.785Octyl-Sepharose1,8300.383.140MIMETIC Yellow 22171.179.314MIMETIC Red 349.56.855519Mono Q0.6610.6840.4Phenyl-Superose0.07986.11-aThis specific activity corresponds to a molecular activity of 4.34 s−1.6850.31-a This specific activity corresponds to a molecular activity of 4.34 s−1. Open table in a new tab The enzyme catalyzed the malonylation of shisonin to exclusively produce a monomalonylated shisonin, as shown by MS analysis of the product (m/z 843[M]+); however, the enzyme did not catalyze further malonylation of the product. NMR analyses of the product unambiguously showed that it was cyanidin 3-(6“-O-p-coumaryl-β-glucopyranoside)-5-(6‴-O-malonyl-β-glucopyranoside) (see Fig. 1S), indicating that the purified enzyme catalyzes the regiospecific transfer of the malonyl group to the 6‴-hydroxyl group of the 5-glucosyl moiety of the substrate anthocyanins (Scheme I). We designed the PCR primers on the basis of the determined amino acid sequences and executed first-round PCR using the petal cDNA library of S. splendens as a template with primers I and III (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.3). The amplified fragment was further subjected to nested PCR using primers II and III, yielding a PCR product of 880 bp encoding partial amino acid sequences that were determined from the purified enzyme. Using this fragment as a probe, the cDNA library (∼200,000 plaques) was screened for Ss5MaT1 under high stringency conditions to obtain 10 positive clones. The cDNAs from these clones were sequenced from the 5′-end, and the longest cDNA was completely sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the clone contained all of the partial amino acid sequences determined from the purified enzyme (Fig. 3). However, it was found to lack the N-terminal region of an open reading frame. The lacking N-terminal region (4 bp in length) was revealed from the sequence of Ss5MaT1 genomic DNA, and the full-length cDNA, Ss5MaT1, was obtained with a PCR-based strategy (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The full-length Ss5MaT1 cDNA encoded a protein (calculated mass, 50,723) of 462 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ss5MaT1 showed similarity to those of Pf3AT (40% identity (8Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Tanaka Y. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Fujiwara H. Fukui Y. Ashikari T. Murakami Y.

Ss5MaT1 and these acyltransferases share the conserved sequences, -His-Xaa3-Asp- (motif 1) and -Asp-Phe-Gly-Trp-Gly- (motif 3; see Fig. 2S). Ss5MaT1 was expressed under the control of the T5 promoter in E. coli JM109 cells as a soluble, catalytically active protein at a level of 30 μg/liter of culture broth. The recombinant Ss5MaT1 could be easily purified to homogeneity from crude extracts of transformant cells with an activity yield of 8%. The recombinant Ss5MaT1 showed catalytic and molecular properties that were essentially identical to those of the native Ss5MaT1 (see below), allowing us to further confirm that the cloned cDNA codes for Ss5MaT1. We extensively analyzed the catalytic and molecular properties of the native and recombinant Ss5MaT1. In addition to shisonin (see above), the native and recombinant enzymes effectively acted on bisdemalonylsalvianin (Fig. 1, 1c) to produce monodemalonylsalvianin (Fig. 1, 1b); however, monodemalonylsalvianin, salvianin, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside (3a), and delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (3b) could not serve as substrates for either the native or recombinant Ss5MaT1.

Recently, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA, p115RhoGEF, was shown to interact with and act as a GTPase-activating protein for Gα12 (9Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M.

Another Gα12-interacting protein is cadherin, a protein that is involved in cell-cell adhesion (10Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D, D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Many cellular events depend on the regulated protein-protein interaction. Discovering novel protein interaction facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. The yeast two-hybrid system has been widely used for the identification of protein interaction (11Toby G.G. Golemis E.A. Methods. 2001; 24: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, using the yeast two-hybrid approach, we have determined that Gα12interacts with Hsp90 (heat shockprotein of 90 kDa), a molecular chaperone that interacts with multiple signal-transducing molecules and is often essential to a variety of signal transduction pathways (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 217: 420-434Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is a highly conserved protein that is ubiquitously expressed and is required for viability of eukaryotes (for review, see Ref. 13Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Hsp90 can act as a molecular chaperone to promote refolding of denatured protein, to hold denatured proteins in a folding-competent state for other chaperones, and to prevent protein unfolding and aggregation (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 217: 420-434Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Hsp90 modulates protein structure, thus increasing the half-life of proteins and facilitating their interactions. A remarkably large subset of known Hsp90 substrates are signaling molecules (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 217: 420-434Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin is a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 that interacts with its ATP-binding site, which is important in regulating Hsp90 functions (14Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin-bound Hsp90 cannot form heterocomplexes with proteins that require Hsp90. Therefore, geldanamycin has been successfully used both to identify proteins that might interact with Hsp90 and to determine the physiological significance of such interaction (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 217: 420-434Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Here, the interaction between Gα12 and Hsp90 found using the yeast two-hybrid system was further substantiated by a co-immunoprecipitation technique. We have determined that Hsp90 is not required for the interaction of Gα12 with its binding partners, p115RhoGEFand the Gβ subunit. Importantly, Hsp90 is required for Gα12-induced SRE activation, cytoskeletal changes, and mitogenic response. Anti-Myc, anti-Gα12, anti-Gβ common, and anti-Raf-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA antibody was purchased from BabCo. Anti-Hsp90 antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Protein A-agarose was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Paul Sternweis. HA-tagged Gα12 and Gα13 were kindly provided by Silvio Gutkind. Sources of HA-tagged Gαs and Raf-1 are described elsewhere (3Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M. Ahn N. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Gγ2 and Gβ1 subunits were kindly provided by Janet Robishaw. The yeast two-hybrid MATCHMAKER LexA system (CLONTECH) was employed to detect specific protein-protein interaction (16Finley R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). The Gα12two-hybrid bait was constructed by subcloning the cDNA for human mutationally activated Gα12 Q226L into the pLexA polylinker region. A human testis library in the vector pB42AD was screened; all colonies were assayed for lacZ andLEU2 reporter gene activities; double-positive clones were picked; and plasmids were isolated and sequenced. Transient transfections of NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfection of NIH3T3 cells with constitutively activated human Gα12 was performed as described earlier (2Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar). An immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described (17Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged wild-type Gα12 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for 48 h. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Lubrol. Where indicated, AlF4− (10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3) was included. Lysates were normalized for protein concentration, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by 8–10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Fluorescent microscopy was performed as described (17Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips, serum-starved for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 mm rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). The slides were additionally washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence was observed under a Nikon Model TE300 fluorescent microscope. SRE-mediated gene expression was determined by the SRE.L reporter system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells grown on 24-well plates to 90% confluency were transfected with the following plasmids (per well): 50 ng of pSRE.L (for SRE-dependent gene expression) with 50 ng of pCMV-βgal (transfection efficiency control plasmid) and 100 ng of the indicated plasmid, balanced with the pCMV vector alone. The day before the experiment, cells were serum-starved in 0.2% calf serum overnight. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in protein extraction reagent, and the cleared lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the corresponding assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). To account for differences in transfection efficiency, the luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity and is expressed as percent of the maximal response to Gα subunit stimulation. To further delineate components of signaling pathways that are important for apparently diverse cellular functions, we used yeast two-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library (3.5 × 106 clones) to search for proteins interacting with constitutively activated Gα12 Q229L. Using full-length Gα12 as “bait,” the screening yielded six positive clones, one of which was a fragment (amino acids 378–732) of the molecule chaperone Hsp90. The interaction between Gα12and the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 was specific since neither the Gα12 nor Hsp90 clones alone could activate transcription of LEU2 and lacZ in yeast (data not shown). To determine whether Gα12 can interact with endogenous Hsp90, HA-tagged Gα12 was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells, and immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Hsp90 (Fig. 1). In cells transfected with HA-tagged Gα12, antibody against HA specifically immunoprecipitated endogenous Hsp90, whereas in vector-transfected cells, anti-HA antibody did not precipitate Hsp90 (Fig. 1). We next examined whether other Gα subunits can also interact with Hsp90. For this purpose, we immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged constructs of Gα13 or Gαs transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Our results showed that Hsp90 displayed very little binding to Gα13 and did not bind to Gαs (Fig. 1). Importantly, the expression of both Gα13 and Gαs was much higher than that of Gα12 as determined by Western blotting of total cell lysates with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1). These data suggest that Gα12 exists in a specific complex with endogenous Hsp90 under physiological, non-stress conditions. The α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches and clocks, and these functions are impaired by conformational changes that result from binding and hydrolysis of GTP (18Bourne H.R. Nicoll R.A. Cell/Neuron. 1993; 72/10: 65-75Google Scholar, 19Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Gα subunits are inactive in a GDP-bound state because of reduced affinity for downstream effectors and enhanced affinity for Gβγ subunits. Binding of Gβγ subunits to GDP-bound Gα occupies sites for interaction with downstream effectors. In contrast, GTP-bound Gα subunits have increased affinity for the effectors and decreased affinity for Gβγ subunits. To understand the physiological significance of Gα12-Hsp90 interaction, it was essential to learn if Gα12 binding to Hsp90 is dependent on the activation state of Gα12. To determine whether Hsp90 interaction depends on the activation state of Gα12, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in the absence or presence of AlF4−, an activator of the Gα subunit that promotes a conformation similar to that of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (20Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The data showed that Hsp90 interacted with Gα12 in both the absence and presence of AlF4− (Fig.2 A), suggesting that Gα12 is constitutively bound to Hsp90 in both conformationally active and inactive states. Recently, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Rho, p115RhoGEF, was shown to interact with a conformationally active form of Gα12 (21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Strenweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether Hsp90 binding to Gα12 can be influenced by p115RhoGEF, another Gα12-binding partner. In these experiments, cells were transfected with HA-tagged Gα12 and Myc-tagged p115RhoGEF. The data showed that Gα12 interacted with p115RhoGEFonly in the presence of AlF4− (Fig.2 A); this is consistent with previous observations (21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Strenweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Importantly, the amount of Hsp90 bound to Gα12 was not changed by the p115RhoGEF binding (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that Hsp90 and p115RhoGEF may have non-overlapping binding sites on Gα12. To determine whether inhibition of Hsp90 binding can affect the Gα12 interaction with p115RhoGEF, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in the presence of geldanamycin, an inhibitor that disrupts Hsp90 interactions with target proteins (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 217: 420-434Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with HA-tagged Gα12 and Myc-tagged p115RhoGEF were pretreated with 1 μg/ml geldanamycin for 1 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Our data showed that pretreatment of the cells with geldanamycin disrupted the interaction of Gα12 with Hsp90; however, the interaction of p115RhoGEF with Gα12 was not affected (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that Hsp90 binding is not required for the interaction of Gα12 with p115RhoGEF, which further supports the notion that Hsp90 and p115RhoGEF may have non-overlapping binding sites on Gα12. As GDP-bound Gα subunits have higher affinity for Gβγ subunits, we examined whether Hsp90 binding to Gα12 could be influenced by Gβγ binding. In these experiments, cells were transfected with HA-tagged Gα12 and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody in the presence of either AlF4− or geldanamycin (Fig. 2,C and D). Immunoprecipitation of GDP-bound Gα12 showed the complex formation between Gα12 and the endogenous Gβ subunit (Fig.2 C). As expected, immunoprecipitation of Gα12in the presence of AlF4− resulted in the dissociation of the Gβ subunit from the complex (Fig.2 C). Consistently, Hsp90 was bound to Gα12 in both the presence and absence of AlF4−(Fig. 2 C). When Gα12 was precipitated from the cells pretreated with 1 μg/ml geldanamycin, the complex between endogenous Hsp90 and Gα12 was disrupted, whereas the complex between endogenous Gβ subunits and Gα12 was not affected (Fig. 2 D). Because Hsp90 was previously shown to copurify with Gβγ from the cytoplasmic fraction of rat liver (22Inanobe A. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and because the endogenous Gβ subunit could form a complex with exogenous HA-tagged Gα12, it was possible that Hsp90 detected in the immunocomplex formed after the interaction with anti-HA antibody could be a result of the Hsp90 interaction with the Gβ subunit. To test this possibility, Myc-tagged Gγ2 and Gβ1subunits were cotransfected into COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody showed that the Gβ subunit formed a complex with the Gγ subunit (Fig. 2 E). However, Hsp90 was not detected in this complex, suggesting that it is likely that Hsp90 interacts with the Gα12 subunit, but not with Gβγ subunits (Fig.2 E). Together, these data (i) suggest that Hsp90 binding is not required for the interaction of Gα12 with the endogenous Gβ subunit and (ii) further support the notion that Hsp90 and other Gα12-binding partners may have non-overlapping binding sites on Gα12. As our data clearly showed that geldanamycin disrupted the interaction between Gα12 and Hsp90, we used geldanamycin to determine the functional significance of Gα12-Hsp90 interaction. Mutationally activated Gα12 stimulates proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (2Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar, 6Xu N. Bradlet L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of Hsp90 in Gα12-dependent cell growth rate, NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with constitutively activated Gα12Q229L were plated in medium containing 0.5% calf serum, and cells were counted at 24 and 48 h after plating. The overexpression of Gα12 Q229L was 2-fold more compared with endogenously expressed Gα12 as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). In the presence of 0.5% calf serum, Gα12 Q229L-expressing cells continued to proliferate for an additional 48 h, whereas vector only-expressing cells did not proliferate at all (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the observed cell growth is exclusively dependent on the Gα12 function. Treatment of the cells with geldanamycin did not affect cell growth parameters of the vector-transfected cells; however, it significantly inhibited Gα12 Q229L-induced cell growth (Fig. 3 A). Another important cellular function of Gα12 is its ability to induce actin stress fiber formation. Therefore, we next examined whether geldanamycin can affect the Gα12Q229L-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization. NIH3T3 cells expressing activated Gα12 or the pcDNA3 vector were seeded onto coverslips and starved for 24 h. Polymerized actin was visualized by staining of the fixed cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Under these conditions, vector-transfected cells displayed staining of polymerized cortical actin; however, actin stress fibers were not detected (Fig. 3 B). Gα12Q229L-expressing cells clearly displayed pronounced actin stress fibers formation, consistent with previously reported observations (5Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with 1 μg/ml geldanamycin for 6 h did not affect the actin cytoskeleton in the vector-expressing cells, but abolished actin stress fibers in Gα12-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). The Gα12 subunit regulates gene expression by transcriptional activation of distinct transcriptional control elements such as the SRE (23Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We examined the role of Hsp90 in the regulation of SRE-dependent expression by Gα12. In SRE-mediated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene, an altered c-fos SRE, SRE.L, was placed in front of the luciferase gene (24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). SRE.L binds only to the transcriptional serum response factor, and not to the tertiary complex factor. Expression of constitutively activated mutants of Gα12, Gα13, and Rho induced pronounced SRE activation (Fig.3 C), consistent with previously reported data (23Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with geldanamycin significantly inhibited Gα12-induced SRE activation; however, it did not affect the SRE activation induced by Gα13 or by Rho proteins (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that Hsp90 is specifically involved in the Gα12 function. Geldanamycin disruption of the Hsp90 interaction with its client proteins, including Raf-1, results in protein destabilization and degradation (25Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the possibility that treatment with geldanamycin could result in Gα12degradation. As shown in Fig. 3 D, treatment of NIH3T3 cells with 1 μm geldanamycin for 1–12 h did not result in a measurable decrease in Gα12. In contrast, after a 12-h treatment, geldanamycin significantly reduced the amount of Raf-1, consistent with previously published data (25Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that thrombin receptors induce actin stress fiber formation via Gα12 protein (26Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26815-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using Gα minigenes expressing C-terminal peptides that can serve as specific inhibitors of G protein signal transduction events, we have recently shown that, in endothelial cells, thrombin mediates actin stress fiber formation via G12 and G13 proteins (28Gilchrist A. Vanhauwe J.F. Li A. Thomas T.O. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25672-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of Hsp90 in thrombin-induced actin stress fiber formation in human microvascular endothelial cells. These cells were treated with geldanamycin for 1 or 4 h and then challenged with thrombin for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were fixed and stained for F-actin with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Thrombin rapidly induced stress fiber formation and cell rounding, the phenotype that is consistent with previous reports (27Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26815-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin did not affect the actin cytoskeleton in non-stimulated cells; however, it blocked the thrombin-induced stress fiber formation (Fig.4). This study describes for the first time that the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G12 protein specifically interacts with Hsp90. This interaction does not depend on the conformational state of the Gα subunit and is required for the Gα12 functions. Based on amino acid sequence similarities, Gα12 and Gα13 proteins belong to a distinct class of Gα subunits, separate from the Gαs, Gαi, and Gαq classes, because they are <45% homologous to other Gα subunits (29Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although Gα12 and Gα13 share only 67% sequence identity, they were originally combined in one group of Gα subunits (29Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed, Gα12 and Gα13 often regulate similar intracellular and cellular responses, including neoplastic transformation, apoptosis, Na+/H+ exchange, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Involvement of the downstream small GTPases Ras, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 has been often reported. Regulatory molecules such as p115RhoGEF and Ras GTPase-activating protein-1 have been shown to directly interact with Gα12and Gα13 proteins (9Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Strenweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Strenweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 30Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most recent studies show that G12 proteins can also interact with and regulate the function of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of proteins (17Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ERM proteins function as cross-linkers between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane and regulate organization of the cortical actin (31Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Another novel and important protein partner of G12 proteins is cadherin, a protein that mediates cell-cell interactions (10Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D, D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). One united feature of all these G12partners is their ability to form multimolecular complexes with other signaling proteins. For example, ERM proteins interact with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (32Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 33Gautreau A. Poulett P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this study, we provided evidence that Gα12specifically interacted with another protein that is capable of forming complex protein modules, Hsp90. Using yeast two-hybrid screening with constitutively activated Gα12 as bait, we observed that Hsp90 was one of the Gα12-interacting proteins. This observation was supported by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Hsp90 is different from other chaperones in that many of its known substrates are signal transduction proteins such as Src kinase and Raf-1 kinase (for review, see Ref. 34Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 is essential for maintaining the activity of numerous signaling proteins, it plays a key role in cellular signal transduction networks. It is believed that because signaling molecules with multiple regulatory states often undergo a conformational switch, the structural flexibility needed for these steps may render them less stable and thus more likely to be recognized by Hsp90 (34Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This makes Gα subunits perfect candidates for interaction with Hsp90. Interestingly, only Gα12 could form a complex with endogenous Hsp90, and Hsp90 was required for Gα12 (but not Gα13 or Rho)-induced activation of gene transcription. The possible involvement of Hsp90 in G protein-mediated signaling has been suggested in several studies. 1) Hsp90 was shown to copurify with Gβγ from the cytoplasmic fraction of rat liver (22Inanobe A. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to detect co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 with Gβγ subunits, but consistently detected interaction between Hsp90 and Gα12 using a co-immunoprecipitation technique. Although these data do not disprove the ability of Gβγ subunits to interact with Hsp90, they suggest that Gα12 forms a constitutive and stable complex with Hsp90, whereas the apparent interaction of Gβγ with Hsp90 could be less stable or of lower affinity. 2) It was recently reported that geldanamycin can induce degradation of the heterotrimeric Gαo subunit via the proteasome pathway (35Busconi L. Guan J. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1565-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our data showed that geldanamycin disrupted the interaction of Gα12 and Hsp90, resulting in the inhibition of the Gα12 functional responses: actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell proliferation, and SRE activation. However, we did not detect a decrease in the amount of Gα12 protein after geldanamycin treatment, suggesting that protein degradation is not likely to be a reason for the geldanamycin-induced inhibition of the Gα12 responses. Importantly, although geldanamycin induced Gαodegradation, coprecipitation of these two proteins was not detected (35Busconi L. Guan J. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1565-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the apparent interaction of Gαowith Hsp90 could be less stable or of lower affinity than that of Gα12. 3) When this study was in progress, it was reported that thrombin receptor signaling to the cytoskeleton requires Hsp90 (36Pai K.S. Mahajan V.B. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32642-32647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was shown that Hsp90 forms a complex with the thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor-1 and that geldanamycin inhibits thrombin-induced cytoskeletal changes, but not calcium release (36Pai K.S. Mahajan V.B. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32642-32647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The future challenge will be understanding the molecular mechanism that underlies the interaction of Gα12 with Hsp90. The mechanism of Hsp90 functioning as a molecular chaperone is complex and not completely understood. The in vivo function of Hsp90 is believed to be dependent on ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis (37Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Thus, mutants defective in ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis are unable to replace wild-type Hsp90 in yeast in vivo (37Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Importantly, ATPase activity requires the complete Hsp90 protein because C-terminal deletions result in the loss of ATPase activity (37Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Thus, cellular effects of geldanamycin could be interpreted as the consequences of the interruption of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle because geldanamycin binds to the ATP-binding site with high affinity and inhibits ATP binding to Hsp90 (14Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be significant to analyze the interaction between Hsp90 mutants defective in ATP binding/hydrolysis and Gα12. Another important task would be to determine the Gα12-interacting domain of Hsp90. Our yeast two-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library showed that fragment 378–732 of the molecule chaperone Hsp90 interacted with Gα12. Using a pull-down assay, we then determined that purified Gα12 bound to purified glutathioneS-transferase-Hsp90 fusion protein (C-378); there was no detectable binding of Gα12 to control glutathioneS-transferase (data not shown). The C-terminal location of the binding may seem counterintuitive because we later determined that the interaction between Gα12 and endogenous Hsp90 could be abolished by geldanamycin, which in turn bound to the N-terminally located ATP-binding site of Hsp90. We are testing the possibility that both the N- and C-terminal domains of Hsp90 may interact with Gα12 based on the following observations. It was reported that Hsp90 contains two substrate-binding sites that are located in the N- and C-terminal domains (38Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), who reported that both N- and C-terminal fragments of Hsp90 interact with substrate proteins in vitro, although with different specificity and ATP dependence. Importantly, both the N- and C-terminal domains of Hsp90 display the dominant-negative phenotype in several yeast strains (40Scheibel T. Weiki T. Rimerman R. Smith D. Lindquist S. Buchner J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid screening determined that the cytoplasmic domain of the thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor-1 interacts with the C-terminal part (amino acids 369–721) of Hsp90 (36Pai K.S. Mahajan V.B. Lau A. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32642-32647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An additional intriguing goal would be to locate the Hsp90-interacting domain of Gα12. Our data clearly showed that the interaction of Hsp90 and Gα12 did not depend on the conformational state of Gα12. Moreover, Hsp90 binding to Gα12 was not affected by and was not required for the interaction of Gα12 with its binding partners, p115RhoGEF and the Gβ subunit. Therefore, it is likely that Hsp90, p115RhoGEF, and the Gβ subunit may have non-overlapping binding sites on Gα12. Recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of G protein action has been made by the solution of crystal structures of several Gα subunits in active GTP-bound, inactive GDP-bound, and transitional AlF4−-complexed conformations (41Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 42Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Three regions of Gα subunits called switches I–III change their conformation upon GTP-GDP exchange (42Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 43Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). One or more of these switches is likely to participate in effector interaction and/or Gβ interaction. Thus, the available crystal structures and sequence comparison of Gα subunits may help to predict the possible Hsp90-interacting domain of Gα12. In conclusion, we have characterized a novel signaling module of Gα12 and Hsp90. Because both of these proteins are ubiquitously expressed and are involved in the regulation of multiple intracellular and cellular events, understanding the fundamental molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of Gα12with Hsp90 is important, as it will provide basic knowledge required for the successful determination of Gα12 function in a specific tissue in vivo.

Sterols occur in nature as only one of the two possible enantiomers. Given this fact, enantiospecific interactions between sterols and other chiral molecules such as lipids and proteins are likely to occur and to be functionally important. Yet, surprisingly little evidence exists to support this fundamental hypothesis for cholesterol, a major structural component of cell membranes. Indeed with one exception (1Lalitha, S., Kumar, A. S., Stine, K. J., and Covey, D. F. (2001) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun.1192–1193.Google Scholar), investigations with model membranes have found that sterol-lipid interactions do not affect membrane properties in an enantiospecific manner (2Mickus D.E. Levitt D.G. Rychnovsky S.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 359-360Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Arnett E.M. Gold J.M. J. Am. Chem.

These results suggest that although the physical properties of cholesterol are important for its membrane effects, the absolute configuration of cholesterol is not. In a broader context, whether the functions of cholesterol in vivo are enantiospecific has never been explicitly investigated. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans requires exogenous sterols for viability. Several sterols satisfy this requirement; for example, cholesterol supports the growth, reproduction, and normal behavior of C. elegans (9Hieb W.F. Rothstein M. Science. 1968; 160: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Dutky S.R. Robbins W.E. Thompson J.V. Nematologica. 1967; 13: 140Google Scholar, 11Lu N.C. Newton C. Stokstad E.L.R.

C. 1984; 79: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, C. elegansprovides a good model to test the enantiospecificity of function of cholesterol in vivo. Toward this end, the non-naturally occurring enantiomer of cholesterol (ent-cholesterol)1was synthesized (Fig. 1) and substituted for nat-cholesterol in cultures of C. elegans. We find thatent-cholesterol is incorporated into C. elegansbut cannot perform the functions of nat-cholesterol. ent-Cholesterol was synthesized as described (14Kumar A.S. Covey D.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 823-826Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar).C. elegans were provided by the CaenorhabditisGenetics Center. Agarose was supplied by Sigma. Other reagents for the NGM culture plates and bacterial media including the natural cholesterol were supplied from Fisher Scientific. The C. elegans strain used in all experiments was the wild type strain N2, var. Bristol (15Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were cultured at 20 °C on plates seeded with bacteria as described by Brenner (15Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Agarose, extracted four times with a 10-fold volume of 1:2 chloroform:methanol, was used in place of agar for the NGM culture plates, and except where noted the cholesterol concentration (whether nat or ent) in the NGM media was 10 μg/ml rather than the standard 5 μg/ml. The OP50 strain of bacteria (15Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in a defined minimal medium containing Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, NaCl, MgSO4, NH4Cl, d-glucose, and uracil (16Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. 48. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 3-29Google Scholar), concentrated 20-fold, and seeded (50 μl) onto each NGM plate. C. elegans cultures were synchronized by transferring four adult animals to each plate for 5 h before removal so that ∼100 eggs were laid. The number of eggs, larvae, and adults were counted at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of culture; next generation progeny were not counted. Embryos were scored as dead if they did not hatch from their eggs by 72 h after being laid; larvae/adults were scored as dead if they did not move for >5 s after mechanical stimulation. Hatched animals were categorized as larvae or adults based on their size and presence/absence of vulvae and eggs. The speed of locomotion was measured by transferring 10 randomly chosen young adults for each condition to an agar plate without bacteria. After a 5-min quiescent period, 30-s digitized movies (1 frame/s) were taken of each animal's unstimulated movement, and the distance traveled each second was measured and averaged over the 30 frames to obtain a mean speed for each animal. An overview of the synthetic strategy for making deuterated ent-cholesterol is shown in Fig. 1 B and will be described in detail elsewhere. Deuterated ent-cholesterol was prepared by catalytic deuteration (5% Pt on C/D2) of the Δ24 double bond of a 3-silyl derivative of ent-desmosterol (compound1) followed by removal of the silyl protecting group. The deuterium distribution in the ent-cholesterol side chain wasd0, 38%; d1, 36%;d2, 16%; d3, 6%;d4, 2%. C. elegans was cultured as described above on agarose plates containing 10 μg/ml either nat-cholesterol or deuteratedent-cholesterol. A “blank” condition to assess the amount of cholesterol contamination coming from the plates and/or from adherence to the worms was generated by transferring 1000 adult animals grown on normal isotopic abundance nat-cholesterol to seeded deuterated ent-cholesterol plates and harvesting within 2 h. For all conditions including the blank, the adult animals were transferred to tubes with M9 buffer (17Sulston, J., and Hodgkin, J. (1988) in The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Wood, W. B., ed) Monograph 17, pp. 587–606, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar) and washed 5 times with M9 buffer to remove any cholesterol contamination not incorporated into the worms. About 1000–1500 late larval and adult animals were harvested for each condition in triplicate. To each of the worm samples was added 100 ng [26,26,26,27,27,27-2H6]cholesterol internal standard. The sterols were saponified, converted to pentafluorobenzoyl esters, and analyzed by negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry as described previously (18Ostlund R.E. Hsu F.-F. Bosner M.S. Stenson W.F. Hachey D.L. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Starting as synchronized embryos, the wild type C. elegans strain N2 was raised on agarose plates containingnat- or ent-cholesterol. The growth, viability, and behavior of ent-cholesterol cultured animals were compared with those of worms cultured with nat-cholesterol and no added cholesterol (no-cholesterol) (Fig.2). The growth and viability of first generation ent-cholesterol animals (progeny of parents grown on nat-cholesterol) were not significantly different from those of animals cultured onnat- or no-cholesterol plates (Fig. 2,A and B). By contrast, locomotion ofent-cholesterol first generation animals was significantly slower than that of nat-cholesterol adults (Fig.2 C). First generation no-cholesterol animals also moved significantly slower than nat-cholesterol animals but were not as severely affected as ent-cholesterol cultures. These results indicate that for the function of neurons and/or muscle in first generation adults, ent-cholesterol could not fully substitute for and may actually antagonize nat-cholesterol function. Whether neurons and muscle are actually more sensitive than other cell types to the absolute configuration of cholesterol or that behavior is simply a more sensitive measure of cellular dysfunction than growth and viability in C. elegans is unclear. Second generation animals were much more severely affected byent-cholesterol. All second generationent-cholesterol animals died or arrested as embryos or larvae (Fig. 2, A and B). The animals that did hatch were very sluggish, nearly paralyzed. No-cholesterol animals were similarly severely affected. In contrast, second and subsequent generations of nat-cholesterol animals continued to grow and behave normally (Fig. 2, A–C). A minority of the ent- and no-cholesterol second generation animals developed to later larval stages before arresting or dying; these later stage ent-cholesterol and less frequently theno-cholesterol larvae often separated from their cuticles before dying (Fig. 2 E). Similar cuticle defects have been observed in mutants that disrupt the gene coding for the megalin homolog, LRP-1, a putative cholesterol receptor in C. elegans hypodermal cells (19Yochem J. Tuck S. Greenwald I. Han M. Development. 1999; 126: 597-606PubMed Google Scholar). No other gross morphological defects were observed. The relatively small effect of ent-cholesterol on firstversus second generation animals could be explained if maternal stores of nat-cholesterol are transferred to the first generation progeny and suffice to sustain them but not their progeny. The fact that first generation no-cholesterol animals were viable suggests that maternal cholesterol is, in fact, passed to its progeny and is sufficient to support larval development to adulthood. Consistent with this hypothesis, mothers grown in the presence of dihydroergosterol (DHE), a fluorescent sterol and functional replacement for cholesterol, concentrate DHE in their oocytes, and DHE can be detected in their progeny grown on DHE-free plates (20Matyash V. Geier C. Henske A. Mukherjee S. Hirsh D. Thiele C. Grant B. Maxfield F.R. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1725-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility thatent-cholesterol can replace some of the somatic functionsof nat-cholesterol but not its reproductive functions required for embryogenesis and early larval development. Three general mechanisms might explain the enantiospecificity of cholesterol. First, ent-cholesterol might partially but by itself insufficiently substitute for the functions ofnat-cholesterol. Second, ent-cholesterol might antagonize the function of nat-cholesterol. Finally,ent-cholesterol could be biologically inert, perhaps not even getting incorporated into the animal. To directly address this last possibility, we extracted and measured the cholesterol content of first generation adult animals cultured on plates containing isotopically labeled ent-cholesterol, regularnat-cholesterol, or no-cholesterol.ent-Deuterocholesterol was incorporated into the first generation animals and replaced the majority of thenat-cholesterol (Table I).No-cholesterol animals had reduced levels of but still about half the amount of cholesterol as the nat-cholesterol animals. A blank control consisting of extraction of cholesterol fromnat-cholesterol animals transferred to deuteratedent-cholesterol plates and then removed after 2 h showed that at most 20% of the extracted cholesterol derives from plate contamination and adherence to the animals (perhaps less, depending on the rate of cholesterol incorporation). Thus, these results demonstrate that ent-cholesterol is actually incorporated into the animals and rules out the possibility that the deleterious effects of ent-cholesterol are simply due to total cholesterol deprivation. A corollary of this conclusion is that uptake of cholesterol into C. elegans is relatively insensitive to the absolute configuration of cholesterol. Finally, the presence of significant amounts of cholesterol in theno-cholesterol animals confirms that maternal cholesterol is transferred to first generation progeny and thereby allowsno-cholesterol and presumably ent-cholesterol animals to develop into viable adults.Table ICholesterol content in nat-, ent-, and no-cholesterol animalsCulture typeng Cholesterol/1000 wormsnat-Cholesterolent-CholesterolNatural cholesterol727 ± 181ent-Cholesterol91 ± 15244 ± 29No cholesterol375 ± 121Blank48 ± 34Animals were cultured in the presence of nat-cholesterol, deuterated ent-cholesterol, or no-cholesterol and then counted, harvested, and their cholesterol extracted and measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the blank condition, 1000 adult animals were transferred fromnat-cholesterol to deuterated ent-cholesterol plates and then harvested after 2 h to measure the amount of cholesterol derived from contamination from the plates and adherence to the animals.

Values are mean ± S.E. of triplicate sets of 10 plates with >1000 animals/set. To examine whether ent-cholesterol partially substitutes for or antagonizes the function of nat-cholesterol, we treated animals with mixtures of ent- and nat-cholesterol and assessed their growth, viability, and locomotion.Ent-cholesterol did in fact antagonizenat-cholesterol function (Fig.3). The antagonism was apparent at the 9:1 and 9.9:0.1 ratios, where ent-cholesterol significantly enhanced the deleterious effects of nat-cholesterol reduction. Under no conditions did ent-cholesterol appear to replace the function of nat-cholesterol, that is, ameliorate the effect of its reduction. Thus, ent-cholesterol is neither inert nor partially functional; rather, it antagonizes the function of nat-cholesterol. Although nat-cholesterol alone satisfies the C. elegans sterol requirement, C. elegans can transform cholesterol into other sterols, most notably 7-dehydrocholesterol (12Chitwood D.J. Lusby W.R. Lozano R. Thompson M.J. Svoboda J.A. Lipids. 1984; 19: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, a metabolite of cholesterol, even if structurally quite similar to cholesterol, may perform an unknown specific, critical function. Ent-cholesterol may not be metabolized likenat-cholesterol, as the enzyme-mediated processes involved are likely to be enantioselective if not enantiospecific. It is possible that our results reflect differences in the metabolism ofnat- and ent-cholesterol. Increasingly, cholesterol is being recognized as not only a structural membrane molecule but also as a key component in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways (21Incardona J.P. Eaton S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Given that most data in model membranes indicate that membrane physical properties are not influenced by enantiospecific sterol-lipid interactions (2Mickus D.E. Levitt D.G. Rychnovsky S.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 359-360Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Arnett E.M. Gold J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 636-639Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Agarwal K. Bali A. Gupta C.M.

Lipids. 1982; 31: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is plausible that alterations in the bulk properties of cell membranes are not responsible for the effects of ent-cholesterol. However,nat- and ent-cholesterol have recently been shown to interact differently with sphingolipids (1Lalitha, S., Kumar, A. S., Stine, K. J., and Covey, D. F. (2001) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun.1192–1193.Google Scholar, 22Lalitha S. Kumar S.A. Stine K.J. Covey D.F. J. Supramol. Chem. 2001; 1: 53-61Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ordered interactions between sphingolipids and cholesterol have been postulated to organize membrane microdomains called lipid rafts that concentrate a variety of signal transduction molecules into operational units (23Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar,24Hoekstra D. van, I. S.C. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the absolute configuration of cholesterol may influence the formation and function of lipid rafts through its enantiospecific interactions with sphingolipids. In C. elegans, mutations in several gene products that are proposed to signal through or alter lipid rafts have been isolated. For example, caveolins, cholesterol-binding proteins that form specialized lipid rafts called caveolae, are highly expressed in C. elegans gonad and embryos, and a reduction of expression by RNA-mediated interference of one of the C. eleganscaveolin genes, cav-1, advances meiotic progression, increases the rate of egg-laying, but has little effect on behavior or viability (25Scheel J. Srinivasan J. Honnert U. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ent-cholesterol has no gross effects on germ-line progression, actually reduces the rate of egg laying, and produces uncoordinated locomotion (data not shown and Figs.2 E and 3 C). Thus, the effects ofent-cholesterol are unlikely to be mediated through CAV-1, although ent-cholesterol could alter the function of otherC. elegans caveolins for which the mutant phenotype is unknown. Another example is the product of ptc-1, a C. elegans homolog of Patched, which may interact with cholesterol-linked Hedgehog in rafts to regulate morphogenesis (26Ingham P.W. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R180-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The primary loss-of-function phenotype of ptc-1 mutants is sterility and does not closely resemble ent-cholesterol defects (27Kuwabara P.E. Lee M.H. Schedl T. Jefferis G.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1933-1944PubMed Google Scholar). A third protein found in lipid rafts is Ras, which is coded for by the let-60 gene in C. elegans (28Han M. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 921-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in let-60 produce an early larval lethal phenotype similar to that produced by ent- andno-cholesterol (28Han M. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 921-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29Han M. Aroian R.V. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1990; 126: 899-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Beitel G.J. Clark S.G. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The lethal phenotype oflet-60(lf) is due to the lack of formation of the excretory duct cell (31Yochem J. Sundaram M. Han M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is known to contain high levels of cholesterol (20Matyash V. Geier C. Henske A. Mukherjee S. Hirsh D. Thiele C. Grant B. Maxfield F.R. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1725-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the lethality of ent-cholesterol could be explained by prevention of Ras mediated excretory duct cell formation or function. However, given the diversity of proposed functions of cholesterol, even if restricted to lipid raft-mediated signaling, the mechanisms of the ent-cholesterol effects are likely to be more complex. In summary, the absolute configuration of cholesterol is essential for its functions in vivo. It now remains to be determined which biologically relevant interactions of cholesterol are enantiospecific. We thank Laura B. Metz for excellent technical assistance."

These observations suggest that JPO1 participates in c-Myc-mediated transformation, supporting an emerging concept that c-Myc target genes constitute nodal points in a network of pathways that lead from c-Myc to various Myc-related phenotypes and ultimately to tumorigenesis. representational difference analysis Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium 4-OH-tamoxifen cycloheximide endoplasmic reticulum ornithine decarboxylase murine Moloney leukemia virus c-myc was first identified as the cellular homologue of the v-myc oncogene in the avian myelocytomatosis retrovirus, MC29 (1Bishop J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1982; 37: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, c-myc has been implicated in numerous human and animal tumors (2Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M.

In cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 is translocated to chromosome 2, 14, or 22 placing c-myc under the regulation of the immunoglobulin regulatory elements and leading to sustained elevated levels of c-Myc expression (4Battey J.

Elevated c-Myc expression also arises from genomic amplification of c-myc in breast cancer, lung, cervix, and colon carcinomas (6Little C.D. Nau M.M. Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D.

More recently, mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) pathway that lead to increased Myc levels have been identified in colon cancers (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H.

The N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Myc contains two highly conserved regions among the Myc family of proteins; these regions are termed Myc Box I (c-Myc residues 45–63) and Myc Box II (c-Myc residues 128–143) (16Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about c-Myc, the connection between elevated c-Myc levels and oncogenesis remains incompletely understood (18Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z.

Despite the long list of c-Myc-responsive genes, the biological effects of these genes in c-Myc related phenotypes are largely unknown. Initial work in our laboratory relied on representational difference analysis (RDA)1 to identify novel putative c-Myc target genes that could be involved in cellular transformation. The screen made use of Rat1a fibroblasts that can be transformed by c-Myc alone (43Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike parental cells, Rat1a-Myc cells have an increased growth rate, are capable of anchorage-independent growth, form colonies in a soft agar assay (44Hoang A.T. Lutterbach B. Lewis B.C. Yano T. Chou T.Y. Barrett J.F. Raffeld M. Hann S.R. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our original RDA screen identified 20 differentially expressed genes (36Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have named the most highly differentially expressed of these clones JPO1. Here we describe the cloning of human JPO1 and its characterization in the context of c-Myc-associated phenotypes. The role of JPO1 in transformation and anchorage-independent growth is underscored by its complementation with a transformation-defective c-Myc Box II mutant in Rat1a transformation assays. An oligo(dT)- and random hexamer-primed liver and spleen cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with human EST 59390 that contained 912 bp ofJPO1 cDNA. Of 4 × 105 colonies screened, three independent overlapping positive clones were identified and purified according to the manufacturer’s directions, with the exception that it was necessary to reduce the temperature of washes to 50 °C. The partial rat JPO1 and rat vimentin sequences cloned by RDA (36Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were used as templates for RNA riboprobes. Probes were transcribed from linearized DNA using the T7 promoters in the pCRII and pBluescript plasmids. Hybridization and RNase digestion were performed in accordance with an RPA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Digested samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel with Century Markers (Ambion) as size standards. JPO1 transcript levels were quantified relative to vimentin by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 15 μg of total RNA isolated by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% formaldehyde, 0.9% agarose gel and transferred to Nytran. Blots were hybridized with ≥106 counts/ml cDNA probes labeled with the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Rat JPO1 and rat vimentin probes were labeled from the partial clones identified by RDA. Human JPO1 probe was labeled from the partial cDNA clone contained in EST H59390. Rat c-myc was labeled from partial cDNAs. Hybridization was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein lysates were made by lysing cells in 10% SDS (∼107 cells/ml) and boiling lysates at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein content was assayed by a BCA kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Equal relative amounts of protein, ∼10 μg, were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Protein blots were blocked with 5% milk, TBST and probed with antibodies diluted in the same. Anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies were diluted 1:7,000. Anti-Myc antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in 5% milk/TBST. Purified polyclonal anti-human JPO1 antibodies, raised against RGRHPLPGSDSQSRRPR (amino acids 144–160) (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), were diluted 1:4000. Anti-JPO1 antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in 5% milk/TBST. Blots were treated with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents and exposed to film. Equal loading was confirmed with cross-reacting bands and by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. Rat1a cells were grown in low glucose DMEM. TGR (myc +/+) and HO15 (myc −/−) cells (47Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in high glucose DMEM. Rat1a-MycER cells (48Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 49Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) were grown in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. CB33 cells (gift of R. Dalla-Favera, Columbia University, New York), an Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B lymphoblast line, CB33-derived cells, and Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines (Ramos, Thomas, and Wynn) were grown in IMDM. COS7 cells and PG13 cells, a murine 3T3-based retroviral packaging cell line, were grown in high glucose DMEM. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were forced to grow non-adherently by seeding cells in liquid media onto a layer of media containing 0.7% agarose and growing them at 37 °C for 48 h prior to collection. Cells were then collected at discrete time points following reintroduction into serum. Rat1a-MT-Myc cells were induced by the addition of 100 μmzinc sulfate. The MycER fusion protein is induced by addition of 0.2 μm 4-OH-tamoxifen (4-OHT) to the media. Protein synthesis is blocked by addition of 10 μm cycloheximide (CHX) to the media 30 min prior to 4-OHT induction. COS7 cells were grown in high glucose DMEM to 50–70% confluence on glass coverslips and were transiently transfected with 2 μg/ml DNA and 100 μmchloroquine in DEAE-dextran/high glucose DMEM. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells were given fresh media and were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h prior to antibody staining. Cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 8 min and then permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Fixed cells were blocked for ≥20 min in 10% fetal calf serum/phosphate-buffered saline before staining with antibodies diluted in the same. Polyclonal peptide antibodies to JPO1 were diluted 1:200; the secondary antibody was a tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:200. Coverslips were then mounted onto glass microscope slides with glycerol-containing n-propyl gallate and fixed in place with clear fingernail polish. Slides were visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Full-length JPO1 cDNA was created by ligating the 5′ end from one clone identified in the library screen onto the 3′ end from another clone at the uniqueEco RI site internal to JPO1. This full-lengthJPO1 cDNA was subcloned into the Not I sites of a pSG5 expression plasmid (50Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) with a modified polylinker site. Expression of JPO1 in pSG5 is from the early SV40 promoter. The entire 1.2-kb JPO1 coding region was amplified with primers containing Sal I sites on the ends for ligation into the expression plasmid pBabePuro. PCR-amplified JPO1 sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Expression in pBabePuro is from the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter. Rat1a-derived cells were transfected by lipofection (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells transfected with pSG5 or MLV expression plasmids were co-transfected with an empty selection plasmid, pBabePuro or pSVneo, at a ratio of 1:10 (selection plasmid:expression plasmid). Cells were moved into selection antibiotics 48 h after transfection. CB33 B lymphoblast-derived cells were transduced 4–18 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene with control pBabePuro retrovirus or JPO1-expressing retrovirus produced from PG13 cells. Cells were moved into puromycin selection 1–2 days after retroviral transduction. Rat1a-transfected cells and CB33 transduced cells were selected in either 750 ng/ml puromycin or 400 μg/ml G418. Soft agar assays were performed by seeding 1.2 × 105 cells in a layer of 0.4% agarose/DMEM over a layer of 0.7% agarose/DMEM in a 100-mm2 plate. A top layer of liquid DMEM was added and changed every 3rd day. Colony formation was assayed at day 14 by light microscopy or by the use of an automated UVP imaging system that recognizes colonies and the UVP LabWorks colony counting program (UVP, Upland, CA). Methylcellulose assays were performed by adding 104 cells and 2.7-ml supplement (1× IMDM, 26.6% fetal calf serum) to 2.2 ml of a 3% methylcellulose/IMDM mixture and vortexing vigorously. Bubbles were allowed to settle for 5–10 min, and 1 ml of the mixture was added per 35-mm2 non-treated suspension plate (2000 cells/plate) from a syringe with a 16-guage needle. Individual 35-mm2 plates were placed in a larger dish with an extra 35-mm2 plate containing sterile water for the purpose of humidification. Plates were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator for 10 days prior to assaying colony formation. 5 × 106cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of male homozygous nude mice, 4–6 weeks of age (Taconic, Germantown, NY). Tumors were established and weighed at 6 weeks after injection or until tumor mass reaches 1500 mg. Experiments were approved by The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. JPO1 was identified as a differentially expressed gene in an RDA of non-adherent Rat1aversus Rat1a-Myc fibroblasts (36Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The differentially expressed rat clone had significant homology to human EST H59390. Full-length human JPO1 cDNA was cloned from a human spleen cDNA library using this EST as a probe. The longest of the clones identified in the library screen was 2.4 kb in length. Primer extension was performed from the 5′ end to determine that full-lengthJPO1 transcript is 2.5 kb (data not shown). Attempts to clone the additional sequence by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were unsuccessful, so the 5′ sequence was determined by sequencing a P1 clone that contained genomic JPO1 DNA. The composite sequence of full-length JPO1 cDNA is shown in Fig.1 A. Theoretical translation of the cDNA predicts a 371-amino acid protein that contains a putative leucine zipper and a cysteine-rich region (Fig. 1 B). A BLASTP search of the non-redundant data base revealed no known proteins with significant homology to JPO1. The JPO1 GenBank™ accession number is AY029179. Rat1a cells are an immortalized, non-transformed line. With enforced c-Myc expression, these cells are able to grow non-adherently in semi-solid media and cause tumor formation in immunocompromised mice. The effect of cellular adherence on JPO1 transcript levels was examined by Northern blot analysis of mRNA collected from both adherent and non-adherent Rat1a and Rat1a-Myc cell lines (Fig.2 A). We chose vimentin as an internal standard for mRNA sample loading, because we found that c-Myc does not affect vimentin levels in Rat1 fibroblasts (36Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).JPO1 transcript levels are higher in attached cells as compared with unattached cells. To confirm further the differences inJPO1 expression in non-adherent cells, we used the more sensitive RNase protection assay that revealed a 20-fold higherJPO1 transcript level in non-adherent Rat1a-Myc fibroblasts than in the non-adherent Rat1a fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B). Hence, enforced c-Myc expression increases the levels of JPO1 in both attached and unattached cells, although the differential expression is magnified in unattached cells. JPO1 transcript levels were compared with c-Myc levels in additional cell lines. The TGR (myc +/+) cell line is a derivative of the Rat1 cell line. HO15 (myc −/−) cells were created by targeted deletion of both c-myc gene copies from TGR (myc +/+) cells resulting in a severe cell cycle delay (47Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA analyses of the myc −/− cells have been hampered by a global change in transcript levels such that comparison with wild-type cells has been performed on the basis of total RNA as reflected by 28 S ribosomal RNA (47Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Hence for load control, we used 28 S ribosomal RNA. Logarithmically growing HO15 (myc −/−) cells have markedly lower levels of theJPO1 transcript than wild-type TGR (myc +/+) cells, but expression of exogenous c-Myc in HO15 cells is sufficient for restoration of JPO1 expression (Fig. 2 C). The correlation between c-Myc and JPO1 expression also extends to human lymphoid cell lines. Although we have observed a correlation between c-Myc levels and JPO1 mRNA levels in these cells (data not shown), we sought to determine whether there is a correlation at the protein level. We generated a specific polyclonal anti-human JPO1 peptide antibody that only recognizes the human form. As shown by Western blot analysis, we found the correlation between c-Myc and JPO1 protein levels in human lymphoblastoid CB33 cells, CB33 overexpressing c-Myc (CB33-Myc), three Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Fig.2 D), and in a series of breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). A Myc-inducible cell line was used to determine whether JPO1 levels were elevated directly as a consequence of c-Myc induction. Rat1a-MT-Myc cells, in which c-Myc is under the control of the metallothionein promoter, were induced with 150 μm zinc. The c-Myc protein is elevated within 1 h and peaks maximally from 2 to 6 h post-zinc induction (Fig.3 A). RNA collected from zinc-induced cells over the same time course shows that JPO1 expression, as assayed by RNase protection assay, is elevated 2.5-fold at 6 h (Fig. 3 A), adding additional support for the hypothesis that JPO1 is a c-Myc target. To determine whether JPO1 is a direct or an indirect target of c-Myc, the Rat1-MycER system was utilized. These Rat1 cells are stably transfected with a chimeric fusion protein composed of c-Myc and the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (49Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This MycER fusion protein remains sequestered in the cytoplasm by heat shock proteins except upon exposure to the estrogen analogue 4-OHT. 4-OHT binds the ER portion of the fusion protein, initiating its translocation into the nucleus where it then binds to and transactivates endogenous c-Myc target loci. Pretreatment of MycER cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, allows the identification of only those genes whose expression depends directly on c-Myc transactivation and not on an intermediate step that requires protein synthesis. Thus by measuring mRNA induction in cells treated with only 4-OHT and in cells treated with both 4-OHT and CHX, one can distinguish between direct and indirect targets. JPO1 transcript levels were measured in MycER cells over a 6-h time course after treatment with either CHX alone, 4-OHT alone, or both (Fig. 3 B). We chose HuPO (3B4) as a loading control, because we and others (46Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have found that HuPO mRNA levels do not vary with stimulation of MycER cells. In 4-OHT-treated cells,JPO1 levels rose steadily to 6 h, showing nearly a 3-fold induction. Cells treated with CHX alone show no JPO1 induction; instead JPO1 levels dropped by 6 h. Cells treated with both 4-OHT and CHX showed approximately a 1.7-fold induction in JPO1 transcript levels at 4 h that is not sustained at 6 h perhaps due to the inhibitory effect seen with CHX alone. These results indicate that JPO1 behaves as a direct c-Myc target gene. The expression levels ofJPO1 in various human tissues were assayed by probing a normalized human RNA Master Blot (CLONTECH).JPO1 levels were found to be highest in small intestine and thymus (Fig. 4). Additionally,JPO1 was highly expressed in fetal thymus, fetal lung, colon, stomach, appendix, and testis. In contrast to the high expression level seen in thymus, JPO1 levels were low in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and peripheral leukocytes. Two independent P1 clones containing JPO1 genomic DNA were used as probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization to map the chromosomal localization of JPO1. JPO1 maps to chromosome 2q31 as the center of the signals by proportional length (data not shown). Mapping data from the UniGene cluster (Hs. 333893; previously assigned to Hs. 47378) that corresponds to JPO1 has subsequently confirmed this map location. Western blot analysis of JPO1-transfected COS7 lysates indicates that JPO1 is a 47-kDa protein (data not shown). The subcellular localization of JPO1 was determined by immunofluorescent microscopy of transiently transfected COS7 cells. Polyclonal peptide antibodies to JPO1 detected strong nuclear staining in JPO1-transfected COS7 cells. Two patterns of nuclear staining are seen. The majority of JPO1-transfected cells showed diffuse nuclear staining exclusive of the nucleolus (Fig.5 F). Additional cells had a punctate nuclear pattern (Fig. 5 D) that did not co-localize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (data not shown). Empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 5 B) and untransfected cells showed punctate nucleolar staining, which is also seen with pre-immune sera (data not shown) and is dependent on the method of fixation used. Since JPO1 expression is highly elevated in Myc-transformed cells, we sought to determine whether JPO1 overexpression is sufficient to induce Myc-related phenotypes. Rat1a cells were transfected with humanJPO1 cDNA expressed from the early SV40 promoter in the pSG5 plasmid vector. CB33 human B lymphoid cells were transduced with pBabe-JPO1 retrovirus that expresses JPO1 from the retroviral long terminal repeat. Two independent pools of stable Rat1a-JPO1 cells were generated with high levels of exogenous JPO1 expression (Fig.6 A), and one stable CB33-JPO1 pooled cell line was identified that overexpresses JPO1 3-fold (Fig.6 D). Overexpression of JPO1 did not alter cellular growth rates in either Rat1a or CB33 cells (data not shown). Involvement of JPO1 in the predisposition of cells to apoptosis was studied in Rat1a-JPO1 cells. Neither growth in 0.1% serum nor growth in low glucose led to any change in levels of apoptosis as compared with the parental control (data not shown). The ability of Rat1a cells to grow anchorage-independently and the clonogenicity of CB33 lymphoid cells were tested in the soft agar colony growt"
https://openalex.org/W2081026737,"Experiments with mini-αA-crystallin (KFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK) showed that Phe71 in αA-crystallin could be essential for the chaperone-like action of the protein (Sharma, K. K., Kumar, R. S., Kumar, G. S., and Quinn, P. T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 3767–3771). In the present study we replaced Phe71 in rat αA-crystallin with Gly by site-directed mutagenesis and then compared the structural and functional properties of the mutant protein with the wild-type protein. There were no differences in molecular size or intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence between the proteins. However, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid interaction indicated a higher hydrophobicity for the mutant protein. Both wild-type and mutant proteins displayed similar secondary structure during far UV CD experiments. Near UV CD signal showed a slight difference in the tertiary structure around the 285–295 region for the two proteins. The mutant protein was totally inactive in suppressing the aggregation of reduced insulin, heat-denatured citrate synthase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. However, a marginal suppression of βL-crystallin aggregation was observed when mutant αA-crystallin was included. These results suggest that Phe71 contributes to the chaperone-like action of αA-crystallin. Therefore we conclude that the 70–88-region in αA-crystallin, identified by us earlier, is the functional chaperone site in αA-crystallin.

When isolated from the lens they exist as polydisperse aggregates having an average molecular mass of ≈800 kDa (1Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J. The Eye.

Like other small heat shock proteins, α-crystallin can sequester certain unfolding proteins in vitro, by preventing their aggregation and insolubilization (12Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier we were able to map the site in αA- and αB-crystallin responsible for chaperone-like action using photoactive cross-linkers and hydrophobic probes (25Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem.

Our studies with bis-ANS1 and the hydrophobic protein mellitin have shown that there is an overlapping of chaperone site and hydrophobic site in αA-crystallin. Further, using a synthetic peptide (mini-αA-crystallin), we were able to demonstrate the importance of sequence 70–88 in the chaperone-like action of αA-crystallin (28Sharma K.K. Kumar R.S. Kumar G.S. Quinn P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3767-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The experiments with truncated forms of mini-αA-crystallin had suggested that Phe71 in αA-crystallin might be critical for chaperone-like function. In the present study, we did a site-directed mutagenesis of Phe71to Gly in αA-crystallin and compared the structural and functional properties of this mutant protein with the wild-type protein. Recombinant αA- and αB-crystallins show similar structural and functional properties to crystallins isolated from lens tissues and are widely used in the characterization of the protein. Site-directed mutations of recombinant protein provide an excellent means of studying the role of constituent amino acids in the functional properties of the protein. Earlier, several site-directed mutations were conducted on α-crystallin either to identify the region responsible for chaperone-like function or to explain the role of α-crystallin in hereditary cataracts and certain other diseases (29Smulders R.H.

The majority of these studies report either no change in chaperone-like function or a partial loss of this function. We report here, for the first time, a complete loss in the functional property of a mutant αA-crystallin at and slightly above physiological temperatures. The results also indicate the presence of additional sites in α-crystallin that become available at elevated temperatures. We conclude here that the region identified by us earlier as chaperone site contributes to the chaperone-like activity of αA-crystallin. Rat αA-crystallin cDNA cloned in pET21b was kindly donated by Dr. Suraj Bhat (UCLA). αAF71G mutant was constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following set of primers were used: 5′-CTGACCGGGACAAGGGTGTCATCTTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGAAGATGACACCCTTGTCCCGGTCAG-3′. The mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) as described by Horwitz et al. (39Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The proteins were isolated from the cell pellet using Bugbuster protein extract reagent (Novagen). In brief, 1 g of cells was suspended in 5 ml of reagent at room temperature and vortexed gently. Protease inhibitor mixture set III (Novagen) was then added. The cell suspension was treated with 1 μl (25 units) of benzonase/ml of Bugbuster reagent and incubated at room temperature on a shaking platform for 30 min. The extract was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 2 h, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The filtrate was loaded onto a Bio-Rad High Q anion exchange column and eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing the recombinant crystallin (determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein was purified further on a C18 reverse phase HPLC using a water-acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peaks corresponding to wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin were pooled, dried on a Speedvac, resuspended in 6 m urea, and dialyzed extensively against 0.05 m phosphate (PO4) buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, with several changes, for a period of 2 days. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the mass was determined by mass spectrometry. Size determination was carried out using a Amersham Biosciences Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 0.05 m PO4buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4). The mass was calculated from the calibration curve generated by using Sigma molecular weight marker standards. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin were recorded using a Jasco spectrofluorometer FP-750. Protein samples of 200 μg/ml in 0.05 m PO4 buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl were used. The excitation was set to 295 nm, and the emission was recorded between 300 and 400 nm. To 100 μg of wild-type and mutant protein taken in 0.05 m PO4containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4) was added 20 μl of 10 mm bis-ANS dissolved in ethanol. The sample was excited at 365 nm, and the fluorescence spectrum was measured between 400 and 600 nm using a Jasco spectrofluorometer. Protein secondary and tertiary structural changes were investigated by far and near UV CD measurements using an AVIV circular dichroism spectrometer. The concentration of the proteins used was 1.5 and 0.35 mg/ml for near and far UV CD, respectively. The reported CD spectra are the averages of four scans. The ability of the wild-type and mutant proteins to prevent protein aggregation was determined using several substrates. The extent of aggregation was measured by monitoring the light scattering at 360 nm in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. The aggregation of insulin (0.4 mg/ml) (Sigma) in 0.05 m PO4 buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.2) was initialized by the addition of 25 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol in the presence of wild-type and mutant proteins. The aggregation was monitored at room temperature. CS (75 μg) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) was heated at 43 °C for 1 h in the presence of various amounts of mutant and wild-type proteins. The light scattering was measured as described above. ADH (250 μg) (Sigma) was heated at 45 °C in the presence of various amounts of mutant and wild-type αA-crystallin in 0.05 m PO4 buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4). The scattering of light was measured up to 100 min. Purified bovine βL-crystallin (250 μg) in 0.05 mPO4 buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4) was heated at 55 °C in the presence of different amounts of recombinant proteins. The aggregation was monitored up to 1 h. In the present study, the recombinant proteins were purified by a combination of ion exchange and reverse phase HPLC. The purified proteins were dissolved in urea and refolded by extensive dialysis. The proteins thus obtained were highly pure (Fig. 1). The ES mass spectrometry analysis revealed molecular masses of 19,799 and 19,709 daltons, which would be expected for the wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin respectively. Like the α-crystallin subunits isolated from eye lens, recombinant proteins exist in oligomeric form. For analysis of the molecular mass of the homoaggregates, the purified recombinant proteins were chromatographed on a Superdex-200 column. Both wild-type and αAF71G mutant proteins showed similar elution profiles, corresponding to an oligomeric mass of 7.1 × 105 daltons (Fig. 2). This is slightly higher than the earlier published values for rat αA-crystallin (37Shroff N.P. Cherian-Shaw M. Bera S. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The discrepancy can be attributed to the different buffer conditions used in analysis, because it is known that the mass of the purified protein varies depending on the buffer condition (40Augusteyn R.C. Parkhill E.M. Stevens A. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). During these studies we also observed a similar mass for reconstituted homopolymers of bovine lens αA-crystallin.Figure 2Gel permeation profiles of refolded wild-type and mutant protein on a Superdex 200 column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structural differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins were analyzed by spectroscopic methods. Tryptophans of the protein have a fixed solvent accessibility, and any change in their environment leads to an altered fluorescence emission pattern and intensity. Our results show no change in the tryptophan region of the recombinant proteins, as evidenced by the similar fluorescence emission maximum (340 nm) and intensity (Fig. 3). Unfolding of proteins increases the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that can be probed with bis-ANS fluorescence (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We see an increase in bis-ANS binding to the αAF71G mutant (Fig. 4), indicating an increased hydrophobicity compared with wild-type protein.Figure 4Interaction of bis-ANS with mutant and wild-type αA-crystallin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The secondary and tertiary structures of wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin were determined by far and near UV CD spectral analysis. The far UV profile showed a characteristic β-sheet conformation with a slight increase in the negative intensity of the mutant protein (Fig. 5). Both proteins showed similar amounts of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil (42Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Near UV CD spectra showed a slight increase in the negative intensity of the mutant protein (Fig. 6). Although significant portions of the near UV spectra for the two proteins were similar, only minor changes were seen in the 285–295 nm region of the spectra, suggesting some differences in the tyrosine and/or tryptophan microenvironments of the mutant protein compared with the wild-type αA-crystallin. Surprisingly enough, there was no alteration in the signal caused by phenylalanine in the 250–270-nm region. In summary, the data in Fig. 6 do not suggest a significant difference in the tertiary structure between wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin.Figure 6Near UV CD spectra of recombinant proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The consequence of mutation on recombinant crystallin chaperone-like activity was determined under different conditions. Reduction of insulin results in the separation of the subunits and precipitation of B chain that can be followed by measurement of light scattering. The presence of α-crystallin subunits in the assay prevents the aggregation of insulin B chain, and the solution remains clear. Fig. 7 shows the dithiothreitol-induced aggregation kinetics of insulin in the presence of both wild-type and mutant αA-crystallins. The wild-type protein showed suppression of insulin B chain aggregation that increased with the concentration of the protein in the assay tube. However, the mutant αA-crystallin completely failed to prevent the formation of light-scattering aggregates. In fact, a marginal increase in light scattering was observed in some assays. Higher concentrations of mutant protein had no effect on the aggregation of polypeptide. The chaperone-like activity of the recombinant proteins was also investigated at different temperatures. Fig. 8 shows the thermal aggregation of CS in the presence of wild-type and mutant proteins. Although the wild-type protein (50 μg) completely suppressed the aggregation of CS (75 μg), the mutant protein, as with insulin, failed to prevent the aggregation of denaturing CS. We also analyzed the ability of recombinant proteins to suppress the aggregation of ADH at 45 °C. The wild-type αA-crystallin showed increased suppression of denaturing protein aggregation with increasing concentration (Fig. 9 A). Although the mutant protein appeared to suppress the aggregation of ADH at initial time points, the aggregation at 80 min was comparable with ADH by itself (Fig. 9 B). Increasing the concentration of mutant protein had no effect on the aggregation of ADH. We also compared the abilities of mutant and wild-type αA-crystallin to prevent the heat-induced aggregation of βL-crystallin at 55 °C (Fig. 10). Unlike other substrates, mutant αA-crystallin showed a significant protection of βL-crystallin with increasing concentration. However, compared with the wild-type αA-crystallin, the mutant αA-crystallin was 6–10-fold less effective in suppressing βL-aggregation.Figure 8Aggregation of CS at 43 °C in the presence of wild-type and mutant αA-crystallin.

Clark J.I. Horwitz J. Hepburne-Scott H.W. de Jong W.W. Crabbe M.J. Harding J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, we produced an αA-crystallin mutant by substituting Phe71in the core region with a neutral amino acid Gly. This residue is highly conserved in αA-crystallin and is located in the region identified as the chaperone site of αA-crystallin (28Sharma K.K. Kumar R.S. Kumar G.S. Quinn P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3767-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Biophysical characterization of the recombinant protein revealed no change in the oligomer size or tryptophan fluorescence. Because the α-crystallin molecule has only one tryptophan at position 9, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence data may be of limited value to describe the structural changes in the central core or C-terminal domain as a consequence of the mutation. However, it will be a valuable tool for analyzing the stability of the N-terminal domain of the mutant protein. When the mutant protein was heated up to 60 °C, we did not observe any aggregation or shift in tryptophan fluorescence emission wavelength or intensity (data not shown), suggesting that the heat stability of the protein was not affected by the mutation. It has been hypothesized that hydrophobic sites in α-crystallin are responsible for chaperone-like activity (22Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, this is not free of controversy (29Smulders R.H. Merck K.B. Aendekerk J. Horwitz J. Takemoto L. Slingsby C. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 47van Rijk A.F. van den Hurk M.J. Renkema W. Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the present study we see a complete loss in the chaperone-like function of mutant αA-crystallin at and slightly above physiological temperatures despite an increase in hydrophobicity. Smulders et al. (29Smulders R.H. Merck K.B. Aendekerk J. Horwitz J. Takemoto L. Slingsby C. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) observed an increase in the chaperone-like activity of an αAF74N mutant with a slight decrease in ANS binding. They concluded that there is no correlation between surface hydrophobicity and chaperone-like activity. Experiments with super-αA-crystallin have indicated that the disappearance of chaperone-like activity may be independent of hydrophobicity (47van Rijk A.F. van den Hurk M.J. Renkema W. Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Further, Reddy et al. (18Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) have shown recently that hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant of chaperone-like activity in α-crystallin. Recently, the studies with mini-αA-crystallin showed that both hydrophobicity and β-sheet conformation of the functional element are essential for chaperone-like activity (48Bhattacharyya J. Sharma K.K. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 57: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although we see increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the mutant, it is quite unlikely that all exposed hydrophobic patches would be involved in suppressing the substrate protein aggregation. We, as well as others, have observed bis-ANS binding to residues other than those necessary for chaperone activity (27Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 49Smulders R.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taking these observations together, one can conclude that although hydrophobicity is important, the extent of hydrophobicity does not reflect the chaperone-like activity of the protein. The αAF71G mutant has similar secondary structure to that of the wild type. However, the tertiary structure shows some minor changes around the 285–295-nm region. The signal in this region is produced by tyrosine or tryptophan residues. Because we did not observe any change in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity, it is possible that the alteration is in the tyrosine region. Interestingly, two tyrosine residues in αA-crystallin are found near the bis-ANS-binding region 50–54 (27Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This may explain the increased bis-ANS binding of the mutant protein. However, it is unlikely that such a minor difference in the near UV CD signal would completely abolish the chaperone-like activity of the molecule. The αAR116C mutant, with structural alterations at many levels, showed only a 25% decrease in chaperone-like activity (37Shroff N.P. Cherian-Shaw M. Bera S. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Cobb B.A. Petrash J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that α-crystallin could preserve its chaperone function despite some irreversible structural changes (50Lee J.S. Satoh T. Shinoda H. Samejima T. Wu S.H. Chiou S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have measured the chaperone-like function of the αAF71G mutant under different conditions and observed a complete loss in the activity of the mutant up to 45 °C. However, at elevated temperatures the mutant showed some suppression of βL-crystallin aggregation. It has been shown that α-crystallin undergoes a structural transition around 55 °C, resulting in the exposure of more hydrophobic patches (23Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 24Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our study on the stabilization of restriction enzyme (51Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 172-177PubMed Google Scholar) as well as studies conducted by others (35Derham B.K. van Boekel M.A. Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Horwitz J. Hepburne-Scott H.W. de Jong W.W. Crabbe M.J.

Vis. 2001; 7: 114-119PubMed Google Scholar) indicates the presence of multiple sites in α-crystallin for chaperone function. Based on the experiments with mini-αA-crystallin (28Sharma K.K. Kumar R.S. Kumar G.S. Quinn P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3767-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the complete loss of chaperone-like function of the mutant protein at physiological temperatures in this study, we conclude that the region identified by us earlier (residues 71–88) contributes to the chaperone-like function. Plater et al. (30Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that the F27R mutation in the N-terminal domain of αB-crystallin completely abolishes its chaperone-like activity at higher temperatures, which led them to conclude that this conserved residue is vital for chaperone function. Their report is controversial because later studies have shown that the mutant F27R is fully active (34Horwitz J. Bova M. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Yaron O. Lowman S. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Derham B.K. van Boekel M.A. Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Horwitz J. Hepburne-Scott H.W. de Jong W.W. Crabbe M.J. Harding J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Earlier, work showed that proteins resulting from mutation of V72N and F74N in the core region of αA-crystallin had normal activity (29Smulders R.H. Merck K.B. Aendekerk J. Horwitz J. Takemoto L. Slingsby C. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, their conclusion was based on a single assay conducted at 58 °C. We also found some activity of the mutant with βL-crystallin around this temperature. Also, unlike Phe71, the Val72 and Phe74 residues show variations in different vertebrate lens species. The conserved Phe71 residue appears to be important for suppressing the aggregation of proteins. Other factors like charge, hydrophobicity, and structural integrity may influence the functional property to different extents. Recently, Kumar and Rao (53Kumar L.V. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22009-22013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) produced a chimeric α-crystallin by swapping the domains of αA- and αB-crystallin and tested its effect on the chaperone-like activity. Interestingly, the αANBC chimeric protein which contained residues 1–79 of αA-crystallin, including a part of the functional site in αA-crystallin, was completely inactive in suppressing the aggregation of insulin. However, the αBNAC chimeric protein containing the complete ADH binding sequence (25Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and a part of the functional site in αA-crystallin had enhanced chaperone-like activity. This suggests that other residues in the chaperone site of αA-crystallin are also important in suppressing the aggregation of proteins. Therefore it would be interesting to study the role of other conserved residues on chaperone-like action. We are grateful to Dr. P. D. Prasad for the help in site-directed mutagenesis and Jelena Kocergin in the expression and purification of recombinant proteins."

In mammals, creatine is either synthesized by sequential reactions occurring in the kidney and liver or obtained from the diet. A specific uptake system for creatine has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle (4Fitsch C.D. Shields R.P. Payne W.F. Dacus J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2024-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some cultured cell preparations (5Daly M.M. Seifter S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), human monocytes and macrophages (6Loike J.D. Somes M. Silverstein S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C128-C135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and astroglial-rich cultures from neonatal rats and mice (7Moller A. Hamprecht B. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have identified muscle and brain cDNAs encoding high affinity sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporters (8Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8418-8421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced sequence of the rabbit CreaT1 exhibits significant homology to the Na+ and Cl−-dependent GABA/norepinephrine (GAT-1/norepinephrine transporter) gene family of neurotransmitter transporters (9Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 10Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). All members of this family are predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning domains, to contain a large extracellular loop containing sites for N-linked glycosylation between the third and fourth transmembrane domains, and to have the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, indirect approaches have been used to gain insight into the structure and function of transporter proteins. The identification of residues required for substrate selectivity and specificity is particularly important. Chimeras were prepared by exchanging domains between the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters, two transporters that have high sequence similarity but differ in their inhibitor sensitivity. One group suggested that regions spanning TMs 1–3, 11, and 12 were required for substrate affinity (11Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), whereas another found that TMs 8–12 were dominant for substrate selectivity and specificity (12Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has also been useful in identifying amino acid residues involved in substrate binding. Tyr140 in TM3 of the GABA transporter (GAT-1) was found to be critical for substrate recognition and transport (13Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Replacement of the equivalent residue in the SerT (Tyr176) with cysteine resulted in a reduced affinity for serotonin and cocaine (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The tyrosine at a position equivalent to 140 of GAT-1 is conserved in all transporters, including the CreaT, and it has been suggested that this residue may be required for a common function (13Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents are useful tools to identify residues that may be important for substrate binding and the specificity of neurotransmitter transporters. If cysteine residues are exposed to the external medium or part of a water-accessible channel or binding site, then they will react with polar MTS reagents (15Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two MTS derivatives, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), are positively charged, whereas 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) is negatively charged. Mutants of the SerT in which the Ile at positions 172 and 179 in TM3 was replaced with cysteine were readily inactivated by MTSET (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The I172C mutant was protected from MTSET inactivation by substrate, suggesting that it was located in a permeation pathway close to the substrate-binding site (16Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This protection was not dependent on temperature or Na+, suggesting that it results from direct occlusion of I172C by serotonin and not secondary to a substrate-induced conformational change. In contrast, Ile179 of the SerT and the equivalent residue of the norepinephrine transporter, Ile155, were found to be in a conformationally sensitive region of TM3. A comparison of the protein sequence of transporters separated by a large phylogenetic distance may also help identify candidate amino acid residues required for substrate specificity. Guimbal and Kilimann (17Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) found that the CreaT from the electric ray, Torpedo marmorata, was 64% identical to the rabbit CreaT. Only three residues in predicted TMs were found to be better conserved between CreaTs than other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family. One of these was a cysteine residue in TM3 that is also conserved in rabbit, rat, human, and bovine CreaTs (8Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol.

We have investigated the importance of this residue (cysteine 144 in mammalian CreaTs) for the function of the creatine transporter. The subcloning of a 2280-bp cDNA fragment of the bovine CreaT (GenBankTM accession number AF027197) into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1+(Invitrogen) has been described previously (21Dodd J.R. Zheng T. Christie D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1472: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The CreaT cDNA was released from pcDNA3.1+-CreaT by digestion withBamHI and ClaI and cut with HincII. An 822-bp 5′-fragment was inserted into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) atBamHI and HincII sites. This plasmid was used as a template for PCR-based mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM; Stratagene). Parental wild-type DNA strands were removed byDpnI digestion, and the nicked circular DNA was used to transform competent Escherichia coli (DH5α) prepared as described in Ref. 22Ishii T.M. Zerr P. Xia X.M. Bond C.T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. The primers used to prepare CreaT mutants were as follows: C144S, 5′-GGTGATCGTCTTCTACTCCAACACCTATTACATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATGTAATAGGTGTTGGAGTAGAAGACGATCACC-3′ (reverse); C144A, 5′-TGGTGATCGTCTTCTACGCCAACACCTATTACATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATGTAATAGGTGTTGGCGTAGAAGACGATCACCA-3′ (reverse); and C144L, 5′-TCGTCTTCTACTTGAACACCTATTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTAATAGGTGTTCAAGT AGAAGACGA-3′ (reverse). All mutant pBluescript constructs were sequenced in both directions. Expression plasmids were obtained by removing BamHI/HincII CreaT fragments containing the desired mutations from pBluescript and ligating them with a 3′-BamHI/ClaI CreaT cDNA fragment from pcDNA3.1+-CreaT and BamHI/ClaI cut pcDNA3.1+ vector. HEK293 cells were grown in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin and plated out at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in 12-well (3.8-cm2 area) plastic culture dishes (Falcon) 42 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of plasmid and 3.2 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.4 ml of OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc./Invitrogen) per well as recommended by the manufacturer. After 5 h the DNA/LipofectAMINE suspension was removed from the cells and replaced with minimum essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. After another 19 h, this medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. For biotinylation experiments, the cells were plated out at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well (9.6-cm2area) plastic culture dishes. For immunofluorescence, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of OptiMEM/well. Cells expressing CreaT or its mutants were assayed for creatine uptake activity 48 h after transfection. The medium was removed from wells, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of prewarmed KRH uptake buffer. The KRH buffer contained 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The cells were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of KRH containing various concentrations of [4-14C]creatine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, ARC-176, 53 mCi/mmol, diluted to a specific activity of 6 mCi/mmol and a concentration of 2 mm). After the incubation the uptake medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. The cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting. Samples were also taken to determine protein concentration using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The assay was modified to determine the effect of MTS reagents on creatine uptake. Cells prepared as above were washed once with KRH before incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of MTSEA, MTSES, or MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals). Creatine uptake was then assessed as described above. In protection experiments, the cells were exposed to MTSEA in the presence of creatine or its analogues. The analogues guanidinopropionate, GABA, guanidinobutyric acid, guanidinoacetate, cyclocreatine, and arginine were used at a concentration of 1 mm. In experiments performed without Na+, KRH was prepared withN-methylglucamine in place of NaCl. To prepare KRH without Cl−, NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 were replaced with sodium glucuronate, K2HPO4, and CaSO4, respectively. A 417-bp fragment encoding a 56-residue segment of the predicted carboxyl-terminal region of the bovine CreaT (GenBankTMaccession number AF027197) was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using the bovine CreaT cDNA as a template. The forward 5′-CGGGATCCCTCCTCAGGGCCAAGGGGACC-3′ and the reverse 5′-GGAATTCCTAAAGCAGGGATGCTATGGC-3′ primers encoded sites for BamHI and EcoRI (underlined), respectively, to facilitate subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This positioned the CreaT sequence downstream and in-frame with the sequence of glutathione S-transferase. The fusion protein (GST-CreaTC) was expressed in E. coli (DH5α or BL21) and purified on glutathione-agarose. Material corresponding to the intact fusion protein was purified on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and recovered by electroelution (23Hunkapiller M.W. Lujan E. Ostrander F. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 100 μg of the fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted three times at monthly intervals with 100 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. One week after the final immunization the rabbits were deeply anesthetized and bled out by cardiac puncture. The serum was collected and stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, the antiserum was depleted of antibodies against GST. The serum (10 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and applied twice to a column containing 8 ml of GST linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4BCL (5.7 mg of GST/ml). Preliminary testing of the antiserum depleted of GST-reactive antibodies indicated that most of the specific antibodies were directed toward the carboxyl terminus of the fusion protein. Specific antibodies (αCreaTC) were purified using a second GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids of the CreaT. This was prepared and purified in an identical fashion to that described above except for the use of a new forward primer, 5′-CGGGATCCGGCCTGACCACCCTGACCCCA-3′, which also contained aBamHI site (underlined). This fusion protein showed no signs of degradation and could be isolated in high yield from E. coli and was therefore more suitable for affinity purification of the antibodies. Cell surface expression of the transporters was determined using a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent (Pierce) and a method based on that in Ref. 24Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Cells expressing CreaT or its mutants were labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin 48 h after transfection. The medium was removed from wells, and the cells were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. The PBS buffer contained 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl. The cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.5 ml of 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in biotinylation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5). The biotinylation step was repeated with a fresh aliquot of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. This reagent was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 100 mm glycine. The cells were quenched for 30 min on ice with this same buffer before washing again with PBS. Lysis buffer (0.25 ml) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 30 min on ice with gentle rocking. Lysis buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors (CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl. Lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. NeutrAvidinTM beads (Pierce) were prepared as a 50% suspension in lysis buffer, and 50 μl were added to 0.19 ml of each supernatant from the lysate samples. Biotinylated proteins were allowed to bind to the beads for 1 h at 4 °C with occasional mixing. The NeutrAvidinTM beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. After removing the unbound supernatant fraction, the pellet was washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, twice with 0.5 ml of a high salt lysis buffer (as above but with 0.5 m NaCl), and twice with 0.5 ml of a no-salt lysis buffer. The residual wash was completely removed, and the biotinylated proteins were extracted from the beads by adding 50 μl of 2× SDS reducing buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubating for 30 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Total, unbound, and biotinylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described previously (25Kippenberger A.G. Palmer D.J. Comer A.M. Lipski J. Burton L.D. Christie D.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified αCreaTC antibodies were used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The expression of CreaT mutants in HEK293 cells was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of PBS. The cells were fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice, and then quenched for 15 min with 15 mmglycine in PBS. The cells were washed again in PBS and permeabilized by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated with affinity-purified αCreaTC antibodies (10 μg/ml) in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation the cells were washed four times with PBS for 3 min each. The cells were then incubated with Cy3TM labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed as described above, and the coverslips were rinsed briefly in water and mounted onto microscope slides with 15 μl of Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories). Images were collected on a confocal microscope at the Biomedical Imaging Research Unit in the Department of Anatomy, University of Auckland. Creatine transporters contain a uniquely conserved cysteine (Cys144) in the third transmembrane domain, whereas other members of the Na+, Cl−-neurotransmitter transporter family have more bulky and hydrophobic side chains at this position (Fig. 1). In this study we have investigated the importance of Cys144 on the activity of the CreaT by both site-directed mutagenesis and reaction with MTS derivatives. Variants of the CreaT were prepared in which Cys144 was replaced by Ser, Ala, or Leu. The latter residue is found in an identical position in the homologous GABA transporter (GAT-1). The activity of the C144S, C144A, and C144L mutants were 75, 55, and 15% of the wt CreaT (Fig. 2). The activity of all mutants was significantly above the level of endogenous creatine uptake activity of HEK293 cells. Cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1+ vector showed ∼3% of the activity obtained by transfection with wt CreaT (0.75 nmol/min/mg protein). We compared the expression of CreaT proteins by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Similar levels and molecular forms of CreaT immunoreactivity were seen in cells expressing C144S, C144A, or C144L or wt CreaT. Treatment of transfected cells with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin followed by purification of biotinylated proteins on NeutrAvidinTM beads showed expression of the wt and all mutant transporters at the cell surface. The biotinylated fraction from the wt CreaT and all three Cys144 mutants contained a 90-kDa form (Fig. 3 A) that corresponds to the glycosylated form of the CreaT (data not shown). The results of immunofluorescence microscopy were also very similar for the Cys144 mutants and wt CreaT (Fig. 3 B). It appears that differences in expression or altered trafficking to the cell surface are not the reason for the changes seen in the activity of Cys144 CreaT variants. The saturation kinetics of creatine transport in cells expressing C144S, C144A, or C144L mutants or wt CreaT were compared (Fig. 4). The K m of the C144S mutant (0.21 mm) was very similar to the wt CreaT (0.20 mm). However, the K m values of the C144A (0.33 mm) and C144L (0.82 mm) variants were significantly higher than wt CreaT. The large increase in theK m seen for the C144L variant suggested that this mutant may have lost some specificity for substrate recognition. We compared the ability of GABA to compete with creatine uptake in cells expressing C144L and wt CreaT. In the presence of 1 and 10 mm GABA the activity of the C144L mutant was reduced by 26.3 and 62.8%, respectively. GABA at 1 mm had no effect on the wt CreaT, whereas 10 mm GABA decreased uptake activity by 6.2% (data not shown). It appears that the amino acid side chain at position 144 is an important determinant of the specificity of the CreaT for creatine. We tested the ability of three charged methanethiosulfonates, MTSEA (2.5 mm), MTSES (10 mm), and MESET (1 mm) to inhibit the CreaT (Fig. 5). These concentrations were chosen because they allow for the intrinsic reactivity of these MTS derivatives in solution (26Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). No effects were seen with MTSES and MTSET, but MTSEA inhibited creatine transport activity by ≥95%. It appears that the CreaT is very sensitive to MTSEA. Exposure of HEK293 cells expressing wt CreaT to 250 or 50 μm MTSEA for 1–2 min resulted in 92–95% and 85–95% inhibition, respectively (data not shown). To determine whether Cys144 was the target of MTSEA modification, cells expressing C144S and C144A mutants or wt CreaT were treated with MTSEA prior to determining creatine transport activity. The activity of the C144S and C144A variants was unaffected by MTSEA under conditions (incubation with 50 μm MTSEA for 5 min) that resulted in the loss of the majority of wt CreaT activity (Fig. 6). This identifies Cys144 as the site modified by MTSEA. The C144S variant retains ∼70% of wt CreaT activity and is resistant to MTSEA. Thus, the C144S variant will provide a valuable background to study the structure and function of CreaT by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. Cells expressing wt CreaT were treated with MTSEA in both the absence and presence of various concentrations of creatine. The presence of creatine was found to prevent inactivation by MTSEA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). The concentration giving ∼50% protection was similar to the known K m (∼0.2 mm) of the transporter. We also compared creatine and various creatine analogues for their ability to protect from MTSEA inactivation (Table I). Analogues that are known to be substrates of CreaT, guanidinopropionate, cyclocreatine, guanidinobutyric acid, and guanidinoacetate all reduced the inactivation by MTSEA. The degree of protection correlated with their known potency to competitively inhibit creatine transport. GABA and arginine, two molecules that are not substrates, did not protect the CreaT from inactivation by MTSEA.Table IEffect of creatine analogues on inactivation of CreaT by MTSEATreatmentActivityControlMTSEA-treated%None100.0 ± 2.44.2 ± 0.3GPA95.4 ± 3.985.6 ± 2.0Creatine96.9 ± 3.169.7 ± 4.4Cyclocreatine93.7 ± 2.143.4 ± 2.3GBA101.6 ± 3.134.5 ± 1.0GAA100.7 ± 1.714.7 ± 0.6GABA102.7 ± 5.95.1 ± 0.1Arginine104.6 ± 5.64.5 ± 0.2HEK293 cells were transfected with wt CreaT.

The cells were washed in KRH before determining creatine transport activity. Uptake activity was normalized with respect to the values for untreated transporter (1.766 nmol creatine/min/mg). The values represent the means ± S.D. of three determinations. A cysteine residue (Cys144) is found in the third transmembrane domain of all CreaTs but not other members of the Na+,Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. We have found that modification of this residue with MTSEA leads to rapid inactivation of the transporter and that substrates protect from this inactivation, whereas a C144S mutant retains ∼70% of transporter activity. Our results are consistent with the view that Cys144 is located in a substrate-binding site and that it is an important but not an essential determinant of creatine transport. There are parallels between the results we have obtained for Cys144 of the creatine transporter and those obtained by others for Cys148 of the E. coli lactose transporter (see Ref. 27Kaback H.R. Wu J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar for a review). Neither of these cysteine residues are required for creatine/Na+ or lactose/H+ symport. However, in each case the transporter is protected from inactivation from sulfhydryl modifying reagents by specific substrates. Replacement mutants of lac permease were used to distinguish between the possibilities that Cys148was either (i) a component of the substrate-binding site or (ii) far removed from the binding site with long range conformational effects providing substrate protection from inactivation. Evidence that the size and polarity of the side chains affected the activity and specificity of the lactose transporter led to the conclusion that Cys148 was part of a substrate-binding site (28Jung H. Jung K. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12160-12165Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found differences in both the initial rates and saturation kinetics of mutants in which the Cys144 of the CreaT was replaced with Ser, Ala, or Leu. Although C144S had aK m (0.21 mm) close to that of wt CreaT (0.20 mm), the Ala mutant had a higherK m (0.33 mm), indicating a lower affinity for substrate. Both Ser and Ala are smaller than Cys and are often used interchangeably to replace cysteine in scanning mutagenesis studies. However, Ser is more hydrophilic than Ala, and this may be important if the side chain of residue 144 is in a water-accessible site. The rapid inactivation of CreaT by low concentrations of MTSEA (50 μm) suggests that Cys144 may be present in an ionized, thiolate (RS−) form. A thiolate is more likely to be present in a water-accessible site and is reported to react a billion times faster with methanethiosulfonates than un-ionized thiols (15Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It also appears that size and hydrophobicity may decrease the affinity of the CreaT for substrate because theK m of the C144L mutant was approximately four times higher than that of the wt CreaT. This mutation also resulted in a decreased specificity of the transporter because high concentrations of GABA inhibited creatine uptake by the C144L mutant but not the wt CreaT. The Cys144 residue of the CreaT reacts only with MTSEA and not MTSET or MTSES derivatives. MTSET and MTSES are known to be membrane-impermeant, whereas MTSEA is a weak base and may cross the membrane (15Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MTSET and MTSES are also larger than MTSEA and contain bulky charged groups that may prevent them entering a substrate translocation pathway for creatine. The rapid reaction with low concentrations of MTSEA and the ability of creatine to protect from inactivation suggest Cys144 to be located in a water-accessible site. However, it is difficult to determine whether MTSEA enters this site from the extracellular or cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Creatine appears to protect from MTSEA inactivation by being transported, because protection is significantly reduced by the absence of Na+ or Cl−. We thus favor a view in which Cys144 is accessible from the extracellular side of the membrane. Na+ or Cl− are not required for MTSEA inactivation, so it appears unlikely that a conformational change is induced by these ions. A close correlation was found for the concentration of creatine required for 50% protection and the experimentally determinedK m for creatine transport (∼0.2 mm). Also, the rank order of potency of creatine analogues that protect from MTSEA (guanidinopropionate > creatine > cyclocreatine > guanidinobutyric acid > guanidinoacetate) is in accordance with known affinities of these substrates for the transporter. Furthermore, only substrates of the CreaT could protect from MTSEA inactivation. No protection was obtained with GABA or arginine, derivatives that contain functional groups present in creatine but are not competitive substrates of CreaT. These data are consistent with the view that Cys144 is close to or part of the creatine-binding site of the CreaT. The identification of a residue within the third transmembrane domain of the CreaT as part of a substrate binding site is consistent with research on other members of the Na+,Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. Tyr140 in TM3 of GAT-1 has been found to be critical for substrate recognition (13Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All members of this transporter superfamily contain a Tyr in an equivalent position, and Bismuth et al. (13Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested a role for this residue in binding an amino-group. A mutant form of the SerT in which this Tyr was replaced with a cysteine had reduced serotonin and cocaine binding (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Ile172 and Ile179of SerT are part of a serotonin- and cocaine-binding site. Further studies from this group led to the conclusion that TM3 constitutes part of a permeation pathway for both SerT and norepinephrine transporter (16Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cys144 of the CreaT and Ile172 of the SerT both occupy equivalent positions within the predicted helices of TM3 (Fig. 1 and Refs. 16Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 17Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cysteine residues in wild-type CreaT and the I172C SerT mutant react with MTS reagents, and in each case the substrate protects from inactivation. The present work with the naturally occurring cysteine at position 144 of the CreaT strengthens the importance of this region of TM3 for substrate binding by Na+,Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis is a powerful technique when combined with hydrophilic MTS reagents to study structure-function relationships and the topology of membrane proteins. The ideal starting point is a cysteine-less protein. This has been possible for only a few membrane proteins, the lactose permease, the Nha-Na+/H+transporter, and the glutamate transporter (17Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CreaT contains 22 cysteine residues, several of which are conserved in the related GABA and SerT and are likely to be involved in disulfide bonds. It appears that production of a cysteine-less CreaT that retains function would be very unlikely. We have found the C144S mutant of the creatine transporter to retain ∼70% of the activity of wt CreaT and be resistant to MTS reagents. This mutant will provide an excellent background for probing residues in TM3 and other interesting domains of the CreaT by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001591625,"Cyclic nucleotide ras GEF (CNrasGEF) is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor previously isolated in a screen for Nedd4-WW domain interacting proteins (Pham, N., Cheglakov, I., Koch, C. A., de Hoog, C. L., Moran, M. F., and Rotin, D. (2000) Curr. Biol. 10, 555–558). It activates Ras in a cAMP-dependent manner and Rap-1 independent of cAMP. Here we show that CNrasGEF is a likely substrate of the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4. CNrasGEF possesses two PY motifs at its C terminus that are responsible for binding to Nedd4 in vitro. Moreover, Nedd4 and CNrasGEF co-immunoprecipitate from 293T cells expressing ectopic CNrasGEF and endogenous Nedd4, and this co-immunoprecipitation is abrogated in PY motif-mutated CNrasGEF (CNrasGEFΔ2PY). CNrasGEF is ubiquitinated in cells, and this ubiquitination is augmented upon overexpression of wt-Nedd4 but is inhibited in cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive Nedd4 (Nedd4(CS)) or in cells expressing CNrasGEFΔ2PY, which cannot bind Nedd4. Moreover, pulse-chase experiments have demonstrated that the half-life of CNrasGEF is reduced 5-fold (from ∼10 to ∼2 h) in cells co-expressing Nedd4 with CNrasGEF but not with CNrasGEFΔ2PY (t 0.5 ∼ 14 h). CNrasGEF is also stabilized in cells co-expressing Nedd4(CS) or following treatment with lactacystin, indicating proteasomal degradation of this protein. Deletion/mutation of the CDC25 domain to abrogate Ras (or Rap-1) binding leads to impaired ubiquitination of CNrasGEF, suggesting that such binding is critical for ubiquitination. Treatment of cells with the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP does not affect the ability of CNrasGEF to bind Nedd4 nor its level of ubiquitination, suggesting that Ras binding per se and not its activation is the critical step in triggering ubiquitination of CNrasGEF. These results suggest that CNrasGEF is a substrate for Nedd4, which regulates its ubiquitination and stability in cells. Cyclic nucleotide ras GEF (CNrasGEF) is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor previously isolated in a screen for Nedd4-WW domain interacting proteins (Pham, N., Cheglakov, I., Koch, C.

Our earlier work has demonstrated that Nedd4 binds to the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)1 and regulates channel stability at the cell surface (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T.

The association between these two proteins is mediated by binding of the Nedd4-WW domains to conserved PY motifs (PPPxY) found in ENaC (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J.

In our search for such putative targets, we had performed an expression screen of 16-day-old mouse embryo library with the second Nedd4-WW domain as a probe.

Ras proteins play a key role in controlling many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin.

Rap proteins were originally identified by their ability to antagonize Ras signaling but have been shown recently to play overlapping roles with Ras and/or have their own signaling pathways (13Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our recent work has demonstrated that CNrasGEF can activate Ras in vitro and is able to bind cAMP via its cNMP-BD and to activate Ras in cells following treatment with the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP or following elevation of intracellular cAMP with forskolin plus IBMX. This activation is not dependent on protein kinase A (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr.

The PDZ domain of CNrasGEF is likely involved in targeting or retaining the protein at the plasma membrane (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because we identified CNrasGEF as a Nedd4-interacting protein, the present work was aimed at investigating the possibility that CNrasGEF is a substrate for Nedd4. Here we report that CNrasGEF binds via its PY motifs to Nedd4, that it is ubiquitinated in a Nedd4-dependent manner, that the stability of CNrasGEF in cells is regulated by Nedd4, and that ubiquitination is reduced in mutant CNrasGEF which can not bind Ras. This work, therefore, suggests that CNrasGEF is a novel substrate for Nedd4 and that Ras binding to CNrasGEF is likely necessary for ubiquitination of this exchange factor. Expression cloning of mouse CNrasGEF was previously detailed (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The corresponding full-length cDNA of human CNrasGEF (KIAA0313) was kindly provided by T. Nagase (Kazusa Institute, Japan) and was used in all subsequent studies. The FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF and GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm (amino acids 1348–1499) were constructed as previously described (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF was used as a template to generate FLAG-CNrasGEF(ΔPY) with a Y → A mutation at the first PY motif (PPGY → PPGA) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). FLAG-CNrasGEF(ΔPY) was then used as template to construct FLAG-CNrasGEF(Δ2PY) with a Y → A mutation in the second PY motif (PPDY → PPDA) (Fig. 1 A). CNrasGEF lacking its CDC25 domain (ΔCDC25) was constructed as previously described (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CNrasGEF bearing a mutation in the CDC25 domain, which inhibits Ras binding (R898D), was constructed using the QuikChange kit. HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin plus 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described, with a total of 20 μg of DNA per 10-cm dish (equal amounts of DNA per construct). Carrier DNA was added to make up to 20 μg of DNA when single transfections were used. The GST or GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm was produced in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical Co.) (Fig. 1 B). HEK 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm PMSF. Cleared lysate (∼1 mg) was incubated with ∼50 μg of immobilized GST or GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound proteins were washed (2×) with lysis buffer and (3×) with HNTG (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Nedd4 antibodies (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) at 1:1000 dilution, followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies and ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK 293T cells were transfected as above. Where indicated, transfected cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer as above. Protein concentrations of different lysates were determined using the Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay (Sigma). Equal amounts of different lysates (∼2 mg) were used in immunoprecipitations. FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-M2 agarose (Sigma) for 1.5 h. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer (2×) and HNTG (3×) and immunoblotted with anti-Nedd4 antibodies (as above) or with anti-Ras antibodies at 1:25,000 dilution (Quality Biotech). HEK 293T cells were transfected as above, and where indicated, were also co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) (14Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In some experiments, these cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 0.5 mm8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) for 15 min. Where indicated, transfected cells were treated (or not) with 10 μm lactacystin (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 50 μm LLnL (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, Sigma). Equal amounts of different lysates (∼2 mg) were used for the immunoprecipitations. FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-M2 agarose for 1.5 h. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer (2×) and HNTG (3×) and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect HA-ubiquitin conjugation, followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies and ECL detection. To ensure ubiquitination of CNrasGEF and not of associated proteins, in certain experiments the cell lysates were treated with 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. These boiled lysates were then diluted 11 times with lysis buffer to dilute the SDS prior to their use in the immunoprecipitation step described above. HEK 293T cells that had been transfected with the same plasmids were pooled and re-seeded in 10-cm dishes to normalize the variation in transfection efficiency. Cells were washed (3×) with Met/Cys-deficient medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) within 30 min and then incubated in that medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h. Cells were washed (3×) with chasing medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin plus 100 μg of streptomycin per ml, and 10 mm unlabeled Met and Cys) and then chased for the indicated times. They were then washed (2×) with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations of the different lysates were determined using the Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay, and equal amounts of total protein (∼1 mg) were incubated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose to immunoprecipitate CNrasGEF. Precipitated proteins were washed as described above and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Gels were then dried and exposed to an x-ray film. The amount of labeled CNrasGEF was determined by cutting the corresponding areas on the gel and counting radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Where indicated, 10 μm lactacystin was added (or not) during the 2-h pulse followed by 0- or 3-h chase in the absence or presence of the inhibitor. A 3-h chase period was chosen because prolonged incubation with lactacystin was toxic to the cells. GST fusion protein of H-Ras was generated as previously described (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (∼1 mg of protein/ml of resin). It was first rendered free of nucleotide by incubation for 20 min at 23 °C in nucleotide exchange buffer (NEB: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and then incubated in NEB containing 10 mm MgCl2 plus 200 μm GDP. Nucleotide-bound H-Ras was resuspended in 500 μl of NEB buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 plus 200 μm GDP and then combined with 2.5 mg of cell lysates, which were prepared as follows: HEK 293T cells were transfected as indicated above and lysed in Nonidet P-40-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm PMSF). Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, beads were washed (3×) with NEB containing 10 mm MgCl2 plus 200 μm GDP. Bound CNrasGEF were detected with anti-FLAG antibodies on a Western blot. HEK 293T cells were transfected as indicated, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP. They were then lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm PMSF), and the level of Ras-GTP in the lysates was determined using the activation-specific probe GST-Raf1(RBD), as described previously (6Pham N.

In search of proteins that bind to Nedd4, we performed an expression screen of a 16-day mouse embryo library using the second WW domain of rat Nedd4 as a probe. The screen identified a murine cDNA fragment encoding a 149-amino acid polypeptide that has 75% sequence identity (95% sequence similarity) to the C-terminal region of the human GenBankTM entry KIAA0313. We renamed KIAA0313 to CNrasGEF (cyclic nucleotide ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) and showed that CNrasGEF is a novel exchange factor that activates Ras in response to elevation of intracellular cAMP or cGMP (6Pham N.

Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Rap-1 independent of cAMP elevation (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D.

CNrasGEF contains two conserved PY motifs at its C terminus (Fig. 1 A), which we suspected were responsible for binding to the WW domain of Nedd4 in our screen. To confirm the binding, we generated a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of human CNrasGEF (GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm), which corresponds to the murine partial coding sequence isolated in the screen (Fig. 1 A). We tested the ability of GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm to bind to endogenous Nedd4 expressed in HEK 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GST-CNrasGEF-Cterm, but not GST alone, was able to precipitate Nedd4 from 293T cells. We next tested if CNrasGEF can interact with Nedd4 in cells using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Fig. 2 A shows that FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF, ectopically expressed in HEK 293T cells, was able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Nedd4 from these cells. However, this co-immunoprecipitation was abolished in cells expressing a mutant CNrasGEF, in which the tyrosines in the PY motifs were mutated to alanines (CNrasGEFΔ2PY) (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the interaction with Nedd4 is mediated via the PY motifs of CNrasGEF. Collectively, these and our previous results (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) show that Nedd4 can bind CNrasGEF in vitro and in cells, and that this interaction is mediated by binding of one or more Nedd4 WW domains to the PY motifs of CNrasGEF. To test whether the interaction of Nedd4 with CNrasGEF promotes ubiquitination of this exchange factor, we studied Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of CNrasGEF. We first tested if CNrasGEF becomes ubiquitinated in HEK 293T cells. FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF was co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) (14Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) into HEK 293T cells. CNrasGEF was then immunoprecipitated from transfected cells using anti-FLAG antibodies and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect conjugation of HA-Ub. As shown in Fig. 3 A (top panel), a high molecular weight smear representing ubiquitinated CNrasGEF (CNrasGEF-Ub) is clearly apparent in cells expressing CNrasGEF and HA-Ub (lane 3). The smear below the 172-kDa marker inlane 3 probably represents degradation products of ubiquitinated CNrasGEF, because the protein tends to become partially degraded in these cells (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel), particularly upon interaction with active Nedd4. Indeed, boiling of the samples in SDS prior to precipitation of CNrasGEF (to ensure these bands do not represent associated proteins of CNrasGEF) revealed the same pattern of ubiquitination as that of untreated samples (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the lower molecular weight ubiquitinated bands are indeed fragments of CNrasGEF that are covalently attached to ubiquitin. To test whether Nedd4 is the E3 involved or responsible for the ubiquitination of CNrasGEF, we overexpressed T7-tagged Nedd4, either wild-type (Nedd4(wt)) or catalytically inactive (Nedd4(CS)), bearing a Cys to Ser mutation at the Hect domain, with CNrasGEF and HA-Ub and analyzed the extent of CNrasGEF ubiquitination in these cells. As seen in Fig. 3 A(top), overexpression of Nedd4(wt) (lane 5) led to a marked increase in CNrasGEF ubiquitination. In contrast, overexpression of Nedd4(CS) almost completely abolished ubiquitination of CNrasGEF (lane 4). These results suggest that Nedd4 is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitination of CNrasGEF and that the Nedd4(CS) mutant is acting in a dominant negative fashion to block ubiquitination of CNrasGEF by endogenous Nedd4. To further confirm the involvement of Nedd4 in CNrasGEF ubiquitination, we repeated the ubiquitination experiments, only using CNrasGEF in which one (ΔPY) or both (Δ2PY) tyrosines in the PY motifs were mutated to alanines; the latter double-mutant is unable to bind Nedd4 (Fig. 2). As evident from Fig. 3 B (top panel), mutation of the first PY motif (lane 4) did not significantly block ubiquitination of CNrasGEF, but mutating both PY motifs led to an almost complete blockade of CNrasGEF ubiquitination (lane 5), similar to the effect of Nedd4(CS) (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that either the second or both PY motifs is/are required for Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ubiquitination of CNrasGEF requires binding to Nedd4, further confirming our conclusion that Nedd4 is the E3 responsible for the ubiquitination of CNrasGEF in cells. Because our results above demonstrate that Nedd4 is responsible for CNrasGEF ubiquitination, and because ubiquitination of proteins usually results in their subsequent degradation, we proceeded to test whether Nedd4 regulates the stability of CNrasGEF using pulse-chase experiments. To this end, transfected CNrasGEF was pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys for 2 h and chased for 0–18 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Our results show that CNrasGEF expressed in HEK 293T cells has a half-life of ∼10 h. This half-life was drastically reduced to ∼2 h upon co-expression of wt-Nedd4 together with CNrasGEF. In contrast, co-expression of Nedd4 with CNrasGEF with mutated PY motifs (CNrasGEFΔ2PY) led to stabilization of the mutant protein, with a half-life of ∼14 h (Fig. 4 B). In accord, CNrasGEF stabilization was also observed in cells co-expressing Nedd4(CS) relative to those co-expressing wt-Nedd4 (Fig. 4 A,bottom). Thus, Nedd4 appears to regulate protein stability of CNrasGEF. Several Nedd4 substrates appear to be transmembrane proteins that are targeted for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation following ubiquitination (e.g. ENaC, numerous yeast amino acid permeases (17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), whereas other, cytoplasmic proteins, appear to be targeted to the proteasome (e.g. Ref. 18Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether ubiquitination of CNrasGEF, which is not a transmembrane protein, is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Fig. 5 shows that treatment of cells with lactacystin for 30 min enhanced the accumulation of ubiquitinated CNrasGEF (Fig. 5 A) and stabilized the protein due to inhibition of the proteasome (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that ubiquitinated CNrasGEF is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Wild-type CNrasGEF is able to co-immunoprecipitate Ras and Nedd4 (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that the three proteins may form a complex in cells. Interestingly, CNrasGEF lacking its CDC25 (ΔCDC25) domain is unable to bind Ras (Fig. 6 B). To test whether Ras binding is involved in CNrasGEF ubiquitination, we analyzed ubiquitination of the ΔCDC25 mutant of CNrasGEF in cells. As seen in Fig. 6 A, ubiquitination of the ΔCDC25 mutant was severely impaired. Because the CDC25 domain possesses 26 lysine residues, which could serve as potential ubiquitin acceptor sites (hence their loss could theoretically lead to reduced ubiquitination irrespective of Ras binding), we generated a point mutation (R898D) in the CDC25 domain that cannot bind Ras (Fig. 6 B). Similar to the ΔCDC25 mutant, the R898D mutant showed impaired ubiquitination (Fig. 6 A). These results suggest that Ras binding is critical for the ubiquitination of CNrasGEF. To test whether Ras binding to CNrasGEF affects the ability of Nedd4 to associate with this exchange factor, we tested the ability of Nedd4 to co-immunoprecipitate with the R898D mutant, which is incapable of binding Ras. Fig. 6 D shows that Nedd4 can still bind the R898D mutant, suggesting that Ras binding to the CDC25 domain is not affecting Nedd4 binding to the PY motifs of CNrasGEF. Thus, Ras binding is not required for Nedd4 binding to CNrasGEF, but rather, for its subsequent ubiquitination. We have previously shown that CNrasGEF activates Ras in response to cAMP in HEK 293T cells (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether CNrasGEF activation can influence binding to and regulation by Nedd4. As depicted in Fig. 7 A, CNrasGEF potently activates Ras in response to treatment with the membrane permeant cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP or treatment with forskolin and IBMX, which elevate intracellular cAMP levels (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, 8-Br-cAMP treatment had no effect on the amount of Nedd4 co-immunoprecipitating with CNrasGEF (Fig. 7 B) or on CNrasGEF ubiquitination (Fig. 7 C). Similar results were also obtained following treatment with Forskolin plus IBMX (not shown). Therefore, the association of CNrasGEF with Nedd4 as well as the Nedd4-mediated CNrasGEF ubiquitination are not dependent on CNrasGEF-mediated activation of Ras in response to cAMP. We had identified CNrasGEF as an interacting protein of Nedd4 in an expression library screen (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and have now characterized the interactions between these two proteins. In this report, we show that (i) Nedd4 binds in vitro and in cells to CNrasGEF; this association is mediated by one or more WW domains of Nedd4 (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the PY motifs of CNrasGEF; (ii) CNrasGEF is ubiquitinated in cells in a Nedd4-dependent manner, because it requires both active Hect domain of Nedd4 and intact PY motifs of CNrasGEF; (iii) Nedd4 regulates the stability of CNrasGEF in cells; (iv) removal of the Ras (or Rap-1) binding region on CNrasGEF leads to impaired ubiquitination of CNrasGEF; and (v) Binding of Nedd4 to CNrasGEF and the regulation of its ubiquitination are not dependent on cAMP-mediated activation of Ras by CNrasGEF. Only a few studies have investigated regulation of Ras exchange factors by the ubiquitin system. In an earlier report, the yeast Cdc25p was shown to possess a destruction box (DB) similar to that found in mitotic cyclins, which controls Cdc25p stability in vivo. The effect of this DB on Cdc25p ubiquitination was not investigated, however. Moreover, Cdc25p degradation appeared constitutive and not cell cycle-dependent (19Kaplon T. Jacquet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20742-20747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another report has demonstratedin vitro ubiquitination and shortening of half-life of mSos2, which contains two sequences resembling the DB but not mSos1 (where the equivalent sequences are somewhat different) (20Nielsen K.H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Willumsen B.M. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7132-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recently, GRF2 was shown to become ubiquitinated and destabilized in cells upon elevation of cellular calcium, effects dependent on a DB sequence present between the Ras exchange motif and CDC25 domains of this protein. Moreover, Ras binding to the CDC25 domain of GRF2 seems to be critical for its subsequent ubiquitination (21de Hoog C.L. Koehler J.A. Goldstein M.D. Taylor P. Figeys D. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2107-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In all three cases, a destruction box was implicated in the ubiquitination process, but the E3 involved was not identified. The work presented here demonstrates ubiquitination-mediated regulation of the stability of the Ras/Rap-1 exchange factor CNrasGEF in cells, which is mediated by a different recognition signal: PY motifs that are recognized by WW domains of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. This study thus identifies the E3 involved in the regulation of stability of CNrasGEF. Our recent work has demonstrated that CNrasGEF activates Ras in cells in response to cAMP (6Pham N. Cheglakov I.

The present results showing impaired ubiquitination of CNrasGEF by mutants that are unable to bind Ras/Rap-1 (ΔCDC25, R898D) suggest that Ras or Rap-1 binding is important for the ensuing ubiquitination of CNrasGEF by Nedd4. This is in agreement with the recent demonstration of requirement for Ras binding to GRF2 for its ubiquitination (21de Hoog C.L. Koehler J.A. Goldstein M.D. Taylor P. Figeys D. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2107-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and implicates Ras/Rap-1 binding as an important signal for destruction of these exchange factors. Interestingly, our work shows that stimulation of Ras activation by cAMP is not required for Nedd4 binding to, or Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of, CNrasGEF. These results suggest that Ras (or Rap-1) binding per se, not the ensuing activation of this protein by CNrasGEF, provides the trigger for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. How the binding of Ras to CNrasGEF leads to recognition by Nedd4 is currently unknown. Clearly, Ras binding to the CDC25 domain is not affecting the ability of Nedd4 to bind the PY motifs of CNrasGEF. Thus, a possible explanation, albeit speculative, may be that Ras binding mediates conformational changes of CNrasGEF that may expose key lysine residues, thus allowing the Hect domain of Nedd4 to attach ubiquitins onto them. A similar scenario may exist for GRF2, whereby Ras binding may allow ubiquitination of exposed lysine residues by an as yet unknown E3 ligase (21de Hoog C.L. Koehler J.A. Goldstein M.D. Taylor P. Figeys D. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2107-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nedd4 and its yeast orthologue Rsp5p have been shown to regulate ubiquitination and cell surface stability of several transmembrane proteins (17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nedd4 is best characterized by its interactions with the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). ENaC is composed of three subunits (αβγ), each containing one PY motif (22Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) that can bind to the Nedd4-WW domains (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1313-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a genetic form of hypertension caused by increased retention and activity of the channel at the cell surface (22Schild L.

Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Nedd4 was demonstrated to be a suppressor of ENaC, which regulates channels numbers at the plasma membrane (3Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 25Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol.

Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). This regulation by Nedd4 is impaired in Liddle syndrome due to impaired binding of Nedd4 to ENaC (3Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and impaired endocytosis of ENaC (27Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, ENaC is a well-documented substrate for Nedd4. Interestingly, recent studies have reported regulation of ENaC by K-Ras-2A, which increases channel activity while decreasing its numbers at the cell surface (28Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because cAMP is a known regulator of ENaC in native tissues (29Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), it is possible, although speculative, that the association of Nedd4 with CNrasGEF may be somehow involved in connecting ENaC to the Ras pathway. Although numerous studies have demonstrated regulation of endocytosis and cell surface stability of transmembrane proteins by Nedd4 and Nedd4 family members (e.g. ENaC, the chlorine channel ClC-5, the voltage-gated sodium channel H1, LMP2A, and several yeast amino acid permeases and receptors (30, 31; reviewed in Refs. 17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)), several studies have shown that Nedd4 and its family members regulate stability of intracellular proteins as well. For example, Smurf1 and -2 regulate ubiquitination and stability of Smads proteins involved in transforming growth factor-β signaling (33Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 34Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and Rsp5p binds to and regulates stability of RNA polymerase II (18Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, although CNrasGEF is localized to the plasma membrane in a PDZ-domain-dependent manner (6Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is nevertheless an intracellular protein. Accordingly, our results here suggest that ubiquitination of CNrasGEF targets it for proteasomal degradation. Thus, Nedd4 can ubiquitinate and target its substrates for either endocytosis/lysosomal degradation or for proteasome degradation. In summary, we have shown here that Nedd4 regulates ubiquitination and stability of CNrasGEF and that such ubiquitination is likely linked to Ras binding to this exchange factor. The mode of ubiquitination of Ras-bound CNrasGEF by Nedd4 remains to be characterized."

Conclusive links have been drawn between chemoattractants and such diverse processes as inflammation, leukocyte migration, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis (1Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). However, despite the ever-expanding characterization of function for chemokine receptors, much remains unknown regarding their activation and regulation, in particular, the precise molecular mechanisms and transient macroassemblies underlying their biochemical behavior. Regulation of chemoattractant/chemokine receptors most likely proceeds in a manner similar to that of the more characterized, classical heptahelical or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 such as rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor (2Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

However, comparative efforts to elucidate regulatory processes are as a matter of course limited, because there is such great mechanistic diversity within the family of GPCRs as a whole and in particular across subfamilies. General themes regarding the biology of GPCRs are well described in the literature (5Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev.

Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In response to the binding of their cognate, stimulatory ligand(s), GPCRs undergo a conformational change, activate G protein, and initiate a variety of diverse signaling events. Activated receptors are rapidly phosphorylated by a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases, triggering desensitization and eventual internalization. It is known that, for certain GPCRs, arrestins mediate these latter processes (8Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that the family of arrestin proteins accomplish desensitization primarily through preferential binding to the phosphorylated form of the receptor, thus sterically occluding further G protein binding (9Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

It has also been shown that arrestins have direct interactions with proteins involved in endocytotic sequestration, including the proteins clathrin and AP-2 (11Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.

However, precise analyses of both the sequence and components of transient GPCR complexes have remained for the most part unexplored in the case of chemokine/chemoattractant receptors. The traditional ternary complex model frames GPCR complexes and states in terms of molecular interactions between ligand, receptor, and G protein (14De L.A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Liganded or activated receptor promotes the assembly of a transient receptor complex (LRG) with high agonist affinity, followed by the catalytic release of GDP and ultimate G protein activation through GTP binding. Although the properties of these protein complexes have been well characterized for several heptahelical chemokine receptors, there have been few direct studies of alternative, ternary complexes, i.e. of G protein-uncoupled, putative ligand-receptor-arrestin complexes. A limited number of inquiries into the formation of ligand-receptor-arrestin complexes for classical GPCRs have been conducted (8Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Prior studies with the visual receptor rhodopsin have implied a direct connection between the phosphorylation and activation states of the receptor and its interactive ability with arrestin (18Kuhn H.

A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It was suggested that disruption of the polar core of arrestin by the negatively charged phosphates on the receptor is primarily responsible for its activation (20Hirsch J.A. Schubert C.

In contrast, the affinity of G protein for rhodopsin appears to diminish on a linear basis with increasing levels of receptor phosphorylation (22Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding our knowledge of some of the factors influencing the formation of certain ligand-receptor-arrestin complexes, the properties of such assemblies in terms of chemoattractant/chemokine receptors are poorly understood. The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a well described member of the chemoattractant subclass of GPCRs and is expressed predominantly in leukocytes (23Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Coupling to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, the FPR is known to modulate several important cell functions, including superoxide formation, degranulation, and chemotaxis via interactions with its ligand, the formyl peptide (24Gierschik P.

We have previously described characteristics of G protein-based ternary complex formation in both cell-based and cell-free assays with the FPR using flow cytometry and spectrofluorimetry (26Bennett T.A.

In the current study using a solubilized receptor system, we sought to investigate the formation of receptor complexes and the corresponding ligand binding properties of both phosphorylated (Rp) and native FPR in association with G proteins and arrestins. We describe the assembly and real time disassembly of soluble receptor complexes, including the formation of a high ligand affinity, nucleotide-insensitive complex of phosphorylated FPR with arrestins. Our findings represent to our knowledge the first qualitative and quantitative characterization of a solubilized, desensitized receptor complex. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma except where noted. Bovine brain G protein subunit mixtures were purchased from Calbiochem. Arrestin-2 and -3 were expressed inEscherichia coli (strain BL21) and purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography as previously reported (35Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L.

Alkaline phosphatase was from Calbiochem.N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (fMLFK-FITC) was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories.N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe (fMLFF) was from Commonwealth Biotechnologies. U937 cells were grown in tissue culture-treated flasks (Corning) with RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. U937 cells were stably transfected with the wild type FPR as previously described (36Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were passaged from near confluent cultures every 3–4 days by reseeding at 2 × 105 cells/ml, expanded for membrane preparations to sealed, 5% CO2-equilibrated, 1-liter, baffled spinner flasks (Pyrex), and incubated at 37 °C. Spinner flasks containing near confluent FPR-expressing U937 cells were stimulated for 8 min at 37 °C with 10 μm fMLF. As previously reported, stimulation at this ligand concentration for this duration of time results in ∼90% maximal receptor phosphorylation (32Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

Following stimulation, flasks were immediately placed on ice, and an equal volume of ice-cold PBS was added. The preparation was otherwise identical to that for unstimulated cells. For membrane preparation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min and resuspended in cavitation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mmNaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 600 μg/ml ATP, pH 7.3) at a density of 107 cells/ml at 4 °C. The cell suspension was placed in a nitrogen bomb and pressurized to 500 p.s.i. for 15–20 min at 4 °C. Following cavitation, nuclei and cytoplasmic material were separated by centrifugation twice at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 109,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in HEPES sucrose buffer (200 mm sucrose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0). All membrane preparations received protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) prior to flash freezing. The aliquots were stored until use at −80 °C. The membranes were thawed and diluted to 1–2 × 107 membrane cell equivalents/ml in an extracellular binding buffer (BB: 30 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmMgCl2). The membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman Avanti centrifuge, and the supernatant was discarded. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of BB containing protease inhibitor mixture set I, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). The suspensions were then gently mixed on a nutator (Clay Adams) for 90 min at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 70,000 ×g for 5 min in a Beckman Airfuge, and the supernatant containing the solubilized FPR was placed on ice for immediate experimentation.

Approximately 200 μl of solubilized receptor was incubated with 10 μl of BB and either 10 μl of anti-Gαi-1,2,3 antibody (Calbiochem) or 10 μl of a polyclonal mixture of anti-arrestin-2 and -3 (generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic, Thomas Jefferson University) or 10 μl of each for 45 min on ice with gentle agitation. To remove antibody-substrate conjugates, excess protein A-Sepharose (Calbiochem) was added to the sample and allowed to incubate for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was removed. Excess protein A was again added, and the samples were respun to ensure complete removal of antibodies. Whole and cleared lysates were run on an SDS acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blotted with relevant antibodies, and exposed using a chemiluminescent detection system to estimate the extent of endogenous protein depletion. Detergent-solubilized FPR (8–12 μl of receptor preparation) was incubated with either bovine brain Gi/Go heterotrimer mixture, purified arrestin, or buffer for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation.N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (10 nm) was added, and the samples were gently mixed at 4 °C for up to 120 min. The samples in some cases were depleted of endogenous proteins, as described above, or received 100 nmGTPγS where indicated. Blocked samples received 1 μmfMLFF, a large excess of nonfluorescent formyl peptide, and were mixed for 15 min prior to fluorescent ligand addition. In the case of alkaline phosphatase treatment, ∼200 μl of solubilized FPR was incubated with either 5 units alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) or an equal volume of alkaline phosphatase buffer for 60 min at room temperature, followed by 60 min at 4 °C. Treated preparations were then handled in the aforementioned manner for fluorescence setup and analysis. Fluorescence associated with fMLFK-FITC was measured by an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronics) using the photon counting mode in a slow time-based acquisition mode as described previously (30Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sample holder was fitted with a cylindrical cuvette adapter to permit measurements in stirred volumes of 200 μl using small cylindrical cuvettes (Sienco) and 2 × 5-mm stir bars (Bel-Art). Excitation was fixed at 490 nm, and stray light was reduced with a 490-nm, 10-nm band pass filter (Corion). FITC fluorescence emission was monitored using a 520-nm, 10-nm band pass interference filter (Corion) and a 3–70 orange glass, 500-nm long pass filter (Kopp). Additions during kinetic measurements were made with 10-μl glass syringes (Hamilton) through a microinjection port above the sample holder. Following protein reconstitution and ligand incubation at 4 °C, the samples were brought up to a volume of 200 μl with room temperature BB containing 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and inhibitors. The diluted samples were then placed into the spectrofluorimeter with gentle stirring. The data were acquired for 120 s with a 0.5-s integration time. For the first 20 s, equilibrium fluorescence levels were obtained. At 20 s, 60 nm anti-fluorescein antibody, prepared as previously described (29Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the sample. The antibody rapidly binds free fMLFK-FITC with high affinity and results in complete quenching of unbound ligand. At 70 s, 100 μm GTPγS (Sigma) was added to assess coupling between receptors and G proteins based on characteristic ligand dissociation rates. All experiments were performed using a detergent concentration slightly above the critical micelle concentration, typically 0.2% throughout (30Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To assess the phosphorylation status of the receptor, U937 cells transfected with C-terminal His6-tagged FPR were used. The cells were grown to a density of ∼1.25 × 106 cells/ml and washed three times in 10 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) to remove traces of phosphate, as previously described (32Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to a density of 107 cells/ml, and 10 mCi of carrier-free, acid-free [32P]orthophosphate was added. The cells were loaded for 3 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After loading, the cells were washed two times and resuspended to a density of 108 cells/ml with phosphate-free RPMI. Stimulated cells received 10−6m fMLFF at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were pelleted and subsequently solubilized in ice-cold BB containing 1% DOM and protease inhibitors for a period of 1 h with mild agitation. The insoluble fraction was pelleted via centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. Solubilized membranes received either 5 units of alkaline phosphatase/106 cells or an equivalent volume of phosphatase buffer and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. 1× RIPA buffer was added, and the entire volume was transferred to 10 mg of protein A precoated with 5 μg of chicken anti-C-terminal FPR (and goat anti-chicken antibodies) or protein G beads precoated with mouse anti-His antibodies and incubated overnight on ice. The beads were washed extensively and resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, followed by electrophoresis on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (32Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and determinations of relative32P content were performed on duplicate samples with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The detergent-based solubilization of GPCRs from membranes, employment of FITC-conjugated ligands, and reconstitution with purified proteins of interest for studying molecular complexes have recently been characterized (26Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E.R. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neubig R.R. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22453-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The system fundamentally hinges on three facts. First of all, ligand dissociation rates vary in accordance with the components comprising the receptor complex. It has been shown for a number of GPCRs, including the FPR, that an FPR-G protein complex has a significantly higher affinity for ligand (i.e. slower ligand dissociation rate) than receptor alone (27Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Sklar L.A. Mueller H. Omann G. Oades Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8483-8486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data on the β2-adrenergic and the m2 muscarinic receptor also suggest that an Rp-arrestin complex has a higher affinity for ligand than Rp alone (17Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, at this point, a direct study of FPR interactions with arrestins in terms of agonist affinity has not been conducted. Second, the addition of a guanine nucleotide, such as the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTPγS, facilitates the rapid dissociation of G protein from receptor. This dissociation, in turn, typically leads to a decrease in affinity of ligand for receptor, because FPR-G protein complexes give way to isolated FPR. The subsequent changes in ligand kinetics are directly measurable in our system as a conversion from a high ligand affinity FPR-G protein complex to a low ligand affinity FPR species. The few characterized high ligand affinity ligand-Rp-arrestin complexes, in contrast, are unaffected by the presence of guanine nucleotide analogues and thus may be distinguished from high ligand affinity LRG complexes by their insensitivity to GTPγS (17Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Hence, discrimination of LRG and ligand-Rp-arrestin high affinity complexes should be possible on this basis. The third unique aspect of our system involves the ability of the anti-fluorescein antibody to quench only unbound ligand. The ligand utilized is of such size and composition that, when bound to the FPR, the attached fluorescein is sterically unavailable for interacting with anti-fluorescein antibodies (29Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is only upon dissociation from the receptor that ligand can be bound and quenched by antibody. Because of the high concentration of antibody used, the latter process is quite rapid, occurring on the order of less than a second. In that regard, following addition of the antibody, the remaining fluorescence is solely a function of ligand bound to the FPR and therefore provides a direct measure over time of the fluorescent ligand dissociation rate. We initially sought to examine agonist affinity differences between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated receptor preparations as obtained from unstimulated and fMLF-stimulated cells, respectively. As shown in Fig.1A, incubation of fluorescent ligand with the solubilized FPR prepared from unstimulated cells leads to the formation of slowly dissociating, nucleotide-sensitive complexes with nearly maximal effects seen at ∼90 min (data not shown for later time points). We have previously reported reconstitution of the native FPR with endogenous G proteins, with similar properties, over this time course (26Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E.R. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neubig R.R. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22453-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the FPR obtained from fMLF-stimulated cells (i.e. phosphorylated FPR), there is also evidence for time-dependent formation of a slowly dissociating complex (Fig. 1B). This high ligand affinity complex is in contrast predominately GTPγS-insensitive, unlike the well characterized LRG complex. Thus, although there is evidence of time-dependent complex formation in the case of Rp, its precise makeup is not clear. Given the GTPγS insensitivity of the complex, it is likely that the assembly does not involve accessible GTP-binding proteins. We further sought to characterize the time-dependent ligand affinity differences by incubating detergent-solubilized receptor with fluorescent ligand in the absence and presence of 100 nmGTPγS. In prior studies, it has been observed that 100 nmnucleotide completely disrupts coupling between receptor and G protein (38Sklar L.A. Bokoch G.M. Button D. Smolen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 135-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As Fig. 1C demonstrates, incubation of the extract from unstimulated cells with GTPγS prior to spectrofluorometric analysis alters the observed dissociation kinetics of ligand; the time-dependent formation of high affinity, nucleotide-sensitive receptors is completely prevented. However, when GTPγS is preincubated with the phosphorylated receptor extract, its presence does not inhibit the formation of high ligand affinity, nucleotide-insensitive complexes. It should also be noted that"

Although Pgp is generally thought to be an efflux transporter, the mechanism of action remains elusive. To determine whether Pgp confers drug resistance through changes in transmembrane potential (Em) or ion conductance, we studied electrical currents and drug transport in Pgp-negative MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/MDR1 stable transfectants that were established and maintained without chemotherapeutic drugs. AlthoughEm and total membrane conductance did not differ between MCF-7 and MCF-7/MDR1 cells, Pgp reduced unidirectional influx and steady-state cellular content of Tc-Sestamibi, a substrate for MDR1 Pgp, without affecting unidirectional efflux of substrate from cells. Depolarization of membrane potentials with various concentrations of extracellular K+ in the presence of valinomycin did not inhibit the ability of Pgp to reduce intracellular concentration of Tc-Sestamibi, strongly suggesting that the drug transport activity ofMDR1 Pgp is independent of changes inEm or total ion conductance. Tetraphenyl borate, a lipophilic anion, enhanced unidirectional influx of Tc-Sestamibi to a greater extent in MCF-7/MDR1 cells than in control cells, suggesting that Pgp may, directly or indirectly, increase the positive dipole potential within the plasma membrane bilayer. Overall, these data demonstrate that changes in Em or macroscopic conductance are not coupled with function of Pgp in multidrug resistance. The dominant effect of MDR1 Pgp in this system is reduction of drug influx, possibly through an increase in intramembranous dipole potential.

P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance tetraphenyl borate modified Earle's balanced salt solution intracellular K+ concentration MDR1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp),1 a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane transporters, decreases intracellular concentrations of structurally diverse compounds, many of which are hydrophobic and cationic. Conventionally, Pgp is thought to function as an efflux transporter, although it is unclear whether any experiment has demonstrated unequivocally that Pgp mediates transport of a substrate across a membrane bilayer against its electrochemical gradient. Several models have been proposed to account for the apparent function and remarkable variety of compounds that are recognized by this protein. Pgp may be an efflux transporter that recognizes substrates within the lipid bilayer (“hydrophobic vacuum cleaner”) (1Stein W. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 545-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Pgp has been hypothesized to be a pump with multiple binding sites for different drugs (2Shapiro A. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), a translocase for lipids (3van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), or a modifier of vesicular trafficking (4Kim H. Barroso M. Samanta R. Greenberger L. Sztul E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C687-C702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another model suggests that MDR1Pgp indirectly alters partitioning of substrates within cells through effects on transmembrane potential (Em), intracellular pH, and/or surface potentials and does not directly transport drugs (5Roepe P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These disparate hypotheses may result from comparisons of data from transfected cells that have not been exposed to chemotherapeutic agents with cell lines in which expression ofMDR1 is induced or maintained through exposure to drugs in the MDR phenotype. Pathways of resistance other than Pgp may exist in drug-selected cell lines, potentially confounding identification of properties attributable solely to MDR1. In addition, many studies have used “Pgp-negative” control cells that later were shown to express low levels of endogenous Pgp, further complicating interpretations regarding function of the protein itself. We investigated MDR1 Pgp transport activity using MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, which do not expressMDR1 (6Ogretmen B. Safa A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and MCF-7/MDR1 cells in which we established and maintained overexpression of MDR1 using a bicistronic vector in the absence of MDR drugs. Effects of Pgp onEm were measured directly by whole-cell patch clamping, and transport activity of the protein was studied with Tc-Sestamibi, an organotechnetium cationic substrate for Pgp (7Piwnica-Worms D.

Rev. 1999; 99: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the absence of MDR1 Pgp, Tc-Sestamibi accumulates within the mitochondrial matrix of living cells in response to negative mitochondrial inner membrane potentials (Δψ) andEm while showing negligible nonspecific binding to lipids and proteins (9Piwnica-Worms D.

Using this system, we determined the effects of MDR1Pgp on substrate content under steady-state and unidirectional influx or efflux conditions. As proposed over 25 years ago (13Ling V. Thompson L.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1974; 83: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), we found that the dominant effect of Pgp is to establish a permeability barrier, limiting unidirectional influx of Tc-Sestamibi without affectingEm.

Rao V. Kronauge J. Croop J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12210-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). [3H]Daunomycin (1.9 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. G418 was from Life Technologies, Inc. Trace metal-grade nitric acid was from Fisher. All other reagents were from Sigma. The control solution for transport experiments was a modified Earle's balanced salt solution (MEBSS) containing 145 mmNa+, 5.4 mm K+, 1.2 mmCa2+, 0.8 mm Mg2+, 152 mm Cl−, 0.8 mmH2PO 4−, 0.8 mmSO 42−, 5.6 mm dextrose, 4.0 mm HEPES, and 1% calf serum, pH 7.4 (12Piwnica-Worms D.

A solution of 142 mm K+ and 20 mm Cl−was prepared by equimolar replacement of potassium methanesulfonate for NaCl (16Piwnica-Worms D. Jacob R. Horres C.R. Lieberman M. J. Gen.

MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. pGEM3Zf(−)Xba-MDR1.1 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and sequenced to confirm wild-type identity.MDR1 was excised with XbaI and subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA forMDR1 was then removed with NotI andBamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pIRESneo (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were transfected with MDR1 or vector using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Clones of transfected cells were isolated and maintained in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Drug-sensitive (Pgp-negative) KB 3-1 and MDR (Pgp-positive) KB 8-5 human epidermoid carcinoma cells were grown and maintained as described (17Luker G. Rao V. Crankshaw C. Dahlheimer J. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14218-14227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pgp was detected in enriched membrane fractions of cells with monoclonal antibody C219 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA) as described previously by our laboratory (17Luker G. Rao V. Crankshaw C. Dahlheimer J. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14218-14227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibody C219 as described for detection of Pgp in KB 8-5 and Chinese hamster ovary cells (18Luker G. Pica C. Kumar A. Covey D. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 72-h cytotoxicity assays with daunomycin and paclitaxel were performed using sulforhodamine B (19Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as percent growth relative to cells treated with vehicle only. Whole-cell current-clamp or voltage-clamp experiments were carried out at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (20Lederer W. Nichols C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 419: 193-211Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Micropipettes were pulled from thin-walled glass (WPI Inc., New Haven, CT) on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Two different solutions were used in pipettes: KINT solution 1 contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, and 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.35 with KOH; and KINT solution 2 contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA, and 2 mmMgATP, pH 7.35 with KOH (10−8 to 10−9m free Ca2+). The bath solution was serum-free MEBSS without or with drugs as indicated. pClamp Version 6.0 software and a DigiData 1200 converter were used to generate command pulses and collect data. Data were filtered at 5 kHz. Off-line analysis was performed using ClampFit and Microsoft Excel programs. Current-voltage relationships were generated from steady-state currents at 300 ms. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Transport function and modulation ofMDR1 Pgp under steady-state conditions were assayed with99mTc-Sestamibi (12Piwnica-Worms D. Rao V. Kronauge J. Croop J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12210-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transport assays with99mTc-Sestamibi were performed within 3 days of all electrophysiology experiments to confirm functional expression of Pgp in MCF-7/MDR1 cells. To determine unidirectional influx of99mTc-Sestamibi or [3H]daunomycin during short periods of incubation (≤90 s), the protocol was modified as follows. 1) The concentrations of 99mTc-Sestamibi and [3H]daunomycin were 40 μCi/ml (5–10 pmol/mCi) and 0.2 μCi/ml (1.9 Ci/mmol), respectively; and 2) coverslips with cells were washed four times with ice-cold MEBSS. Cell-associated tracer is expressed as fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo, where cell content of Tc-Sestamibi or daunomycin (fmol) was normalized to mg of cell protein and extracellular concentration of tracer (nmo). For efflux experiments, cells were first incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in MEBSS containing 10 μCi/ml 99mTc-Sestamibi to reach steady-state accumulation of radiotracer (12Piwnica-Worms D. Rao V. Kronauge J. Croop J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12210-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Coverslips were blotted briefly (≈5 s) to remove excess buffer, transferred to isotope-free MEBSS (37 °C) for various times, and then washed with ice-cold MEBSS. To measure steady-state content of99mTc-Sestamibi prior to efflux, incubation in isotope-free buffer was omitted. Accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi was quantified as described above and is expressed as a percentage of steady-state values for each cell line. Volumes of intracellular water space were determined with 3-O-[3H]methyl-d-glucose and phloretin (21Kletzien R. Pariza M. Becker J. van Potter R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 68: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as μl of intracellular water space/mg of cell protein. Cells were plated as described above for accumulation of99mTc-Sestamibi. Coverslips without cells were incubated in the same medium for use as controls, and values for these blank coverslips were subtracted from data for samples with cells. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline prepared without potassium and extracted with 1% nitric acid for 30 min. Samples were microwaved to prepare for analysis, and each sample run included a 1% nitric acid solvent blank and an external standard. K+ content was determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (IRIS Advantage Duo-View system, Thermo Jarrell Ash, Franklin, MA) using a method that scanned each sample three times and provided a data value with 1 ς level of confidence. 2Additional details of the microwave protocol for sample preparation are available upon request. Data for μg of K+ were normalized to mg of cell protein, and intracellular K+ concentration ([K+]i) in each cell line was calculated by dividing K+ content by intracellular water space. Because cell lines derived from stepwise selection with MDR drugs may have multiple mechanisms of drug resistance (22Jongsma A. Riethorst A. Lankelma J. Dekker H. Westerhoff H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5369-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we stably transfected MCF-7 cells with MDR1 and established clonal cell lines that express Pgp without use of MDR drugs. Pgp was detected specifically by Western blotting in several different clones that expressed the protein at levels comparable to or greater than KB 8-5 cells (Fig.1A), a cell line derived from selection in colchicine (23Akiyama S.I. Fojo A. Hanover J.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1985; 11: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). A clone (termed 3-4) with higher amounts of Pgp than in KB 8-5 cells was selected for further characterization. In the remainder of report, this clonal cell line is referred to as MCF-7/MDR1 cells. Pgp localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in MCF-7/MDR1 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). No immunodetectable Pgp was present in control MCF-7 cells, as determined by Western blotting or immunofluorescence (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Function of transfected MDR1 Pgp initially was characterized with Tc-Sestamibi. Compared with parental cells, steady-state accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi after 30 min of incubation was almost 70-fold less in MCF-7/MDR1 cells (55 ± 11versus 0.8 ± 0.1 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo, respectively). Radiotracer content inMDR1 transfectants increased to control values when cells were incubated with a saturating dose of LY335979 (1 μm) (Fig. 1C), a specific inhibitor of MDR1 Pgp (15Dantzig A. Shepard R. Cao J. Law K. Ehlhardt W. Baughman T. Bumol T. Starling J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4171-4179PubMed Google Scholar). LY335979 did not enhance accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7 cells, providing further evidence that this cell line does not expressMDR1 Pgp (6Ogretmen B. Safa A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Fairchild C. Moscow J. O'Brien E. Cowan K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, our laboratory has shown that KB 8-5 cells accumulate ∼50-fold less Tc-Sestamibi than Pgp-negative parental KB 3-1 cells (17Luker G. Rao V. Crankshaw C. Dahlheimer J. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14218-14227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, these functional data are consistent with differences in relative expression of Pgp in MCF-7/MDR1and KB 8-5 cells. Furthermore, to verify that transfectedMDR1 conferred multidrug resistance to MCF-7/MDR1cells, we performed 72-h cytotoxicity assays with doxorubicin and paclitaxel, two validated substrates for Pgp (15Dantzig A. Shepard R. Cao J. Law K. Ehlhardt W. Baughman T. Bumol T. Starling J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4171-4179PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sikic B. Fisher G. Lum B. Halsey J. Beketic-Oreskovic L. Chen G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: S13-S19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with control cells, MCF-7/MDR1 cells were also ∼100-fold more resistant to doxorubicin and at least 50-fold more resistant to paclitaxel, as determined by 72-h cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 1, D and E). Overall, these data demonstrate that functional MDR1 Pgp was expressed and localized correctly, conferring MDR to transfected MCF-7 cells. As determined by differences in accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi between MCF-7/MDR1 and control cells, function of Pgp was stable over at least 7 months of continuous culture (data not shown). Therefore, these matched cell lines provided an appropriate system for biophysical analysis of MDR1 Pgp without the confounding effects of prior exposure to MDR drugs. Previous studies suggest that MDR1 Pgp (26Wadkins R. Roepe P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 121-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other ATP-binding cassette transporters (27Wei L. Stutts M. Hoffman M. Roepe P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 883-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reduceEm in cells. To determine directly whetherMDR1 Pgp alone affects resting Em, we compared the electrical properties of the cell lines by conventional whole-cell patch clamping. Using KINT solution 1 (no ATP) in the pipette and MEBSS in the bath solution, Emdid not differ between cell lines, measuring −36.4 ± 6.0 and −32.9 ± 3.7 mV (n = 7 and 9; p> 0.25) in control and MCF-7/MDR1 cells, respectively (Fig.2A). Because ATP-dependent K+ channels have been shown to influence Em of MCF-7 cells (28Woodfork K. Wonderlin W. Peterson V. Stroble J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we also determinedEm using a pipette solution (KINTsolution 2) that contained ATP. Em of MCF-7 and MCF-7/MDR1 cells were −42.8 ± 6.6 and −47.6 ± 3.3 mV (n = 3; p > 0.48), respectively, using KINT solution 2 . For both cell lines,Em was more negative as measured with KINT solution 2, although differences were significant only for MCF-7/MDR1 cells (p < 0.01). However,Em did not differ between control cells and Pgp transfectants under either experimental condition. In MEBSS, an ∼2-log difference in Em would be required to account for the almost 70-fold reduction of Tc-Sestamibi in the Pgp-expressing line (Fig. 1), assuming a constant Δψ in both cell lines. We also did not detect differences in macroscopic currents between MCF-7/MDR1 and control cells as measured with a pipette solution of either KINT solution 1 or 2 (Fig. 2,B and C; and data not shown). Measurements ofEm and macroscopic currents were stable for at least 2 min, implying that the patch clamp did not disrupt membrane integrity and allow leakage of ions or macromolecules from cells. In addition, no difference in Em was measured between Pgp-negative KB 3-1 cells and Pgp-positive KB 8-5 cells (data not shown), for which colchicine (an MDR drug) was used in the latter to select and maintain expression of MDR1 Pgp. If MDR1 Pgp were to confer MDR through alterations inEm, specific inhibitors of Pgp should hyperpolarizeEm only in cells that express Pgp. To test this possibility, whole-cell patch clamping was performed with saturating doses of either LY335979 (1 μm) or GF120918 (300 nm), another potent inhibitor of MDR1 Pgp (14Hyafil F. Vergely C. Du Vignaud P. Grand-Perret T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4595-4602PubMed Google Scholar). Although these inhibitors blocked drug transport by MDR1 Pgp within seconds after addition to cells (see below), neitherEm nor macroscopic conductance was affected in either cell line during 2 min of monitoring (data not shown). Overall, the data directly demonstrate that expression of functionalMDR1 Pgp without selection in MDR drugs does not alter basalEm or membrane conductance. To investigate further the relationship of Pgp to Δψ and Em, we sought to quantify accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi under conditions in which membrane potentials were altered by variation of the extracellular K+ concentration in the presence of valinomycin. Because expression of a truncated form of MDR1 Pgp in yeast has been reported to alter [K+]i under selected conditions (29Fritz F. Howard E. Hoffman M. Roepe P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4214-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we determined [K+]i in both parental and MCF-7/MDR1 cells. [K+]i was not affected by expression of MDR1 Pgp: water spaces were 3.3 ± 0.2 and 3.3 ± 0.4 μl/mg of protein (n = 12), and calculated [K+]ivalues were 140 ± 7 and 144 ± 12 mm(n = 4) for parental and MCF-7/MDR1 cells, respectively. We performed transport assays with the K+ ionophore valinomycin added to standard buffer (5.4 mm extracellular K+) (Fig. 3A). Because intramitochondrial and cytosolic K+ concentrations are approximately equal (30Backus M. Piwnica-Worms D. Hockett D. Kronauge J. Lieberman M. Ingram P. LeFurgey A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C178-C187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these conditions were predicted to depolarize Δψ toward zero and to hyperpolarizeEm toward the K+ reversal potential. In MCF-7 cells, radiotracer content decreased from 43.2 ± 4.0 to 2.3 ± 0.6 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo in the absence and presence of valinomycin (1 μg/ml), respectively, consistent with depolarization of Δψ as the dominant determinant for reduction of the accumulation of hydrophobic cationic compounds in these cells (9Piwnica-Worms D. Kronauge J. Chiu M. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1826-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Piwnica-Worms D. Rao V. Kronauge J. Croop J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12210-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Davis S. Weiss M. Wong J. Lampidis T. Chen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13844-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells was 0.8 ± 0.1 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo and could not be detected above background when valinomycin was added to 5.4 mmK+ buffer (threshold of detection of ≈0.1 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo). Addition of GF120918 (300 nm) or LY335979 (1 μm) increased net accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells to values observed in parental cells, whereas control cells were unaffected (Fig.3A). These results indicate that MDR1 Pgp does not reduce cell content of Tc-Sestamibi by decreasing steady-state Δψ. To depolarize both Em and Δψ to ≈0 mV, we equilibrated [K+]i and extracellular K+ concentration by incubating cells in 142 mmK+ and 20 mm Cl− buffer containing valinomycin (1 μg/ml). Cl− was reduced to prevent high KCl buffer-induced increases in cell volume mediated by K+/Cl− cotransporters expressed in mammalian cells (32Russell J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Under isoelectric conditions, steady-state content of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7 cells was reduced to 0.92 ± 0.07 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo, which is 2.5-fold less than that observed in buffer containing 5.4 mm K+ (Fig.3B). By comparison, accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells was reduced to background levels. Thus,MDR1 Pgp either transported tracer out of the cells against a significant concentration gradient to levels well below those expected for passive distribution into intracellular water space (calculated as 3.3 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo) or produced a diffusion barrier that prevented equilibration of an inwardly directed concentration gradient for the tracer. When Pgp was inhibited with GF120918 (300 nm) or LY335979 (1 μm), accumulation of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells increased to that observed in MCF-7 cells. Thus, although these data demonstrate that net content of Tc-Sestamibi was reduced in fully depolarized cells, MDR1 Pgp lowered cell content of radiotracer to an amount less than that produced by reductions in membrane potentials alone. Steady-state reduction in cell content of Tc-Sestamibi produced by Pgp could be due to alterations in influx (permeability) and/or efflux (active transport). To determine the relative contribution of each component, we first quantified cell-associated Tc-Sestamibi over the initial 90 s of exposure to radiotracer. Uptake of Tc-Sestamibi in control cells was linear throughout this period and did not reach steady state until ≈30 min, indicating that these early time points represent unidirectional influx of radiotracer (Fig. 4A). In MCF-7/MDR1 cells, accumulation of radiotracer reached a plateau of 1.0 ± 0.04 fmol/mg of cell protein/nmo at 60 s, a level maintained throughout 120 min of incubation. At the earliest time point (10 s), content of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells was ∼7-fold less than in control cells. Furthermore, the effects of MDR1Pgp were completely reversed within 10 s by GF120918 (300 nm) or LY335979 (1 μm) (Fig. 4, Band C), providing additional evidence that MDR1Pgp markedly reduces influx of Tc-Sestamibi. To determine whether Pgp also limits unidirectional influx of a different substrate, we measured net content of daunomycin at time points between 10 and 90 s in these cells. Similar to Tc-Sestamibi, cell content of daunomycin in MCF-7/MDR1 cells was less than in control cells at all time points, although differences did not become statistically significant until 30 s of influx (Fig. 4D). However, unlike Tc-Sestamibi, cell-associated daunomycin in the MDR1transfectants did not reach a plateau during the initial 90 s of incubation, which may be due to partitioning of anthracyclines into lipid bilayers (33Gallois L. Fiallo M. Laigle A. Priebe W. Garnier-Suillerot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether MDR1 Pgp also affects unidirectional efflux of Tc-Sestamibi, cells were incubated with Tc-Sestamibi for 30 min to reach steady-state levels of radiotracer and then transferred to isotope-free buffer (zero trans-conditions). During the initial 30 s of efflux, cell-associated Tc-Sestamibi was not affected by Pgp, as evidenced by an ∼30% decrease in radiotracer in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, LY335979 (1 μm) did not alter the 30-s unidirectional efflux of Tc-Sestamibi in either control or MCF-7/MDR1cells. Steady-state content of Tc-Sestamibi after 30 s of efflux in the absence and presence of LY335979 was 73.1 and 70.4% in control MCF-7 cells, respectively, and 69.3 and 71.2% in MCF-7/MDR1transfectants, respectively. Comparable results were observed when parental cells were loaded with 40-fold less radiotracer than MCF-7/MDR1 cells to achieve similar amounts of cell-associated Tc-Sestamibi at the start of efflux (data not shown). When incubations in isotope-free buffer were extended to longer periods of time, significant differences between cell lines were not detected until 5 min and were maintained over the ensuing 30 min (Fig.5B). Control cells retained 67.1 ± 8.4 and 26.2 ± 4.7% of the initial content of Tc-Sestamibi after 5 and 30 min of efflux, respectively, compared with 22.2 ± 2.4 and 7.9 ± 2.2% in MCF-7/MDR1 cells, respectively. During these longer incubations, LY335979 (1 μm) increased cell content of Tc-Sestamibi in MCF-7/MDR1 cells to levels observed in parental cells (Fig. 5B). However, these extended incubation times yielded data reflecting the combined effects of efflux and contaminating influx (re-entry) of substrate into cells and no longer isolated unidirectional efflux kine"
https://openalex.org/W2009239738,"Low catalytic efficiency of protein kinases often results from intrasteric inhibition caused by the activation loop blocking the active site. In the insulin receptor's kinase domain, Asp-1161 and Tyr-1162 in the peptide substrate-like sequence of the unphosphorylated activation loop can interact with four invariant residues in the active site: Lys-1085, Asp-1132, Arg-1136, and Gln-1208. Contributions of these six residues to intrasteric inhibition were tested by mutagenesis, and the unphosphorylated kinase domains were characterized. The mutations Q1208S, K1085N, and Y1162F each relieved intrasteric inhibition, increasing catalytic efficiency but without changing the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The mutants R1136Q and D1132N were virtually inactive. Steric accessibility of the active site was ranked by relative changes in iodide quenching of intrinsic fluorescence, and A-loop conformation was ranked by limited tryptic cleavage. Together these ranked the openness of the active site cleft as R1136Q ≈ D1132N ≥ D1161A > Y1162F ≈ K1085N > Q1208S ≥ wild-type. These findings demonstrate the importance of specific invariant residues for intrasteric inhibition and show that diverse activation loop conformations can produce similar steady-state kinetic properties. This suggests a broader range of regulatory properties for the activation loop than expected from a simple off-versus-on switch for kinase activation.

This form of inhibition is achieved when a polypeptide segment of the kinase blocks or distorts the active site, thereby preventing binding or proper orientation of one or both substrates. One frequently observed structural feature of intrasteric inhibition is a “pseudosubstrate” amino acid sequence that has the consensus recognition sequence of a true peptide substrate but does not always have the phosphoryl acceptor hydroxy-amino acid. A pseudosubstrate sequence is not a universal feature of intrasteric inhibition, as in the case of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I in which distortion, more than occlusion, of the active site occurs (5Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).

The intrasterically inhibitory “gate-closed” conformation identified in a crystal structure of the unphosphorylated kinase domain (7Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) blocks both ATP and peptide substrate binding sites, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 (see below). The side chains of Phe-1151 to Met-1153 that block the adenine binding pocket probably do not contribute to stability of the gate-closed conformation, as suggested by high B values for the Phe-1151 ring and the undefined side chain of Met-1153. In contrast, binding of the pseudosubstrate sequence appears to be stable, as inferred from the lower Bvalues of the pseudosubstrate side chains and the potential to form numerous hydrogen bonds (7Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that intrasteric inhibition at both ATP and peptide binding sites would be determined by interactions at the peptide binding site. Among residues shown in Fig. 1 that are potentially involved in stabilizing pseudosubstrate binding, six are invariant within the insulin receptor family. 3R. A. Kohanski, unpublished. 3R. A. Kohanski, unpublished.Three of the six hydrogen bonding residues are invariant in the tyrosine kinase superfamily (Asp-1132 and Arg-1136 in the catalytic loop, and the presence of one tyrosyl residue, either Tyr-1162 or Tyr-1163, in the A-loop), and three are variable in the tyrosine kinase superfamily (Lys-1085, Asp-1161, and Gln-1208; see Table I below). The latter residues are engaged in a triad of interactions in the basal state of the IR (see Fig. 1), which may be absent in other tyrosine kinases due to amino acid differences in at least one of these residues (see Table I, boldface letters). Importantly, the homologous residues of closely related tyrosine kinases such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor and Src family kinases do not appear to interact with each other in crystal structures in which the A-loops are unphosphorylated, and these A-loops do not show pseudosubstrate binding nor do they block the ATP binding site (8Mohammadi M.

Therefore, the residues participating in these interactions in the insulin receptor's kinase domain may be necessary for maintenance of the gate-closed conformation and intrasteric inhibition.Table IHomologous residues of receptor tyrosine kinases in the IR superfamilyRTKResidue number (HIR1-aHIR, human insulin receptor.)116110851208IR/IGF1R/IRR1-bIR, insulin receptor; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IRR, insulin receptor-related receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; TRK, neurotrophin receptor; LTK, leukocyte tyrosine kinase; 7LESS, sevenless receptor ofDrosophila melanogaster; AX1, growth arrest-specific gene 6 receptor; MET, hepatocyte growth factor receptor.DKQFGFRDRSTRKDNQLTKSKM7LESSDLQAX1DHTMETERP1-a HIR, human insulin receptor.1-b IR, insulin receptor; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IRR, insulin receptor-related receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; TRK, neurotrophin receptor; LTK, leukocyte tyrosine kinase; 7LESS, sevenless receptor ofDrosophila melanogaster; AX1, growth arrest-specific gene 6 receptor; MET, hepatocyte growth factor receptor.

A D1161A mutation has been reported, showing that loss of three interactions (1,2, and 3, Fig. 1) produced an unphosphorylated kinase with increased catalytic efficiency (13Frankel M. Ablooglu A.J.

The structure of this mutant IRKD displayed a “gate-open” conformation in which the ATP binding site was freed and pseudosubstrate binding of the A-loop was not observed; most residues in the A-loop were disordered. With this background information and the other mutants in hand, we tested the following three hypotheses: First, if each residue making up the bonding network in Fig. 1 is required to maintain intrasteric inhibition, then mutation of any one residue should yield a gate-open conformation and loss of intrasteric inhibition. Second, if intrasteric inhibition at the ATP binding site depends on interactions at the peptide binding site, then mutating residues at the peptide binding site will lowerK m, ATP. Third, if a specific function of A-loop autophosphorylation is to lower theK m, peptide, then a gate-open conformation in these unphosphorylated kinase mutants will not improveK m, peptide. The steady-state kinetic results presented here suggest intrasteric inhibition of the insulin receptor requires each of these invariant residues. However, physical and biochemical evidence indicate that a range of A-loop conformations accompanies the changes in kinetic parameters.

The mutation Lys-1085 to Asn was based on the TRK sequence, and mutation of Gln-1208 to Ser was based on fibroblast growth factor receptor (Table I). Taken from closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, each substitution might have the least impact on the mutant's ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer, in contrast to the R1136Q and D1132N mutations. Overlap-extension polymerase chain reactions (OE-PCR) were used to generate these IRKD mutants with pairs of oligonucleotides as “inner primers” encoding the mutation and pairs of oligonucleotides as “outer primers” to generate a fragment for endonuclease digestion and subcloning (21Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Cann A.D. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Specific nucleotide sequences of the primers and the exact subcloning protocols will be provided by the corresponding author upon request. The template vector for OE-PCR was pXCKD (22Cann A.D. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pXCKD was used for subcloning cDNAs to yield 48-kDa kinases encoding residues 953–1355 with Met preceding Arg-953, and a plasmid pXΔΔCKD was used to encode double-truncation mutants yielding 36-kDa proteins, including residues 978–1283, and a Met preceding Val-978 (21Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Most OE-PCR products were digested withBstXI and StuI and inserted into pXCKD or pXΔΔCKD at the unique BstXI and StuI sites. The D1132N-IRKD (48- and 36-kDa forms) mutation was subcloned with added silent mutations to add a new ApaLI restriction site. Subcloning the K1085N-IRKD (36 kDa) added a silent mutation for a newBglII restriction site. Subcloning the Y1162F-IRKD (36 kDa) introduced a silent mutation for a new SmaI site. Subcloning the Q1208S-IRKD (36 kDa) mutant encoded a silent mutation that nullified an EcoNI restriction site. The cDNA inserts encoding each mutant IRKD were subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 or pVL1393, and the recombinant viruses were generated using the BaculoGold kit from PharMingen. Wild-type and mutant kinase domains were expressed in “High Five” cells (Invitrogen), maintained at 27.5 ± 0.5 °C. The monolayers were grown to 60% confluence at the time of infection. Each viral infection was done for 3–4 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infection media was then replaced with fresh media. Cells were harvested at 48–54 h from the start of infection. Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris base, 20 mm NaCl at pH 7.5), and stored at −80 °C, at least overnight. IRKD purification was done as described in Bishop et al. (23Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with modifications to accommodate charge changes resulting from the double-truncation and point mutations (e.g. the mutation converting Asp-1132 to Gly). The first anion-exchange chromatography step for purification of the 36-kDa kinases used a 50-ml SOURCE 15Q matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) rather than a Waters DEAE 8HR matrix. Other steps in the purification scheme were essentially the same as for the 48-kDa kinases. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were made as described by Bishop et al (23Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the emission spectra were obtained with an SLM 4800 spectrofluorometer operating in the single-photon counting mode. For intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra, an excitation wavelength of 300 nm was used and emission spectra were collected over the range of 310–420 nm in 1-nm increments. The final spectra were determined from the average of three spectral scans. Iodide quenching was done in the absence or presence of ADP as described by Ablooglu and Kohanski (15Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The IRKD was 1 μm, and quenching was done with 0.0–0.6 mKI in 50 mm TrisAc, 20 mmMgAc2, and 0.1 mm sodium thiosulfate, at pH 7.0; the potassium salt concentration was kept constant at 0.6m by the addition of KCl, as needed. For each IRKD, the bimolecular collisional rate constant k q was determined as described previously (15Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis of the IRKD was done according to Frankel et al. (21Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IRKD was digested at 5 μm in cleavage buffer (50 mm TrisAc, 20 mm MgAc2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0) with or without 10 mm ADP. Trypsin was added to a ratio of 1:20 by mass, trypsin to IRKD. The reaction proceeded for selected times and was quenched by addition of sample buffer. The cleavage products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with AgNO3 and dried, scanned as grayscale images using an Arcus II scanner (Agfa) with Fotolook and Photoshop software (Adobe), and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). Steady-state kinetic parameters for the unphosphorylated kinase domains were determined as described previously (15Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed, in triplicate, at room temperature with 50 nm mutant or wild-type IRKD in 50 mm TrisAc, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% BSA (w/v), with one substrate at a fixed concentration and the second substrate concentration varied. In all reactions, product formation was no greater than 10% of the limiting substrate, and autophosphorylation of the IRKDs did not occur during these measurements. The kinetic parameters were determined from a fit of the initial velocity versus variable substrate concentration using the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data with the dead-end inhibitor AMP-PNP were analyzed assuming simple linear competitive inhibition against ATP, using a concentration range of 0.1 to 5 mm AMP-PNP (and no inhibitor in the control reactions), 0.2–2 mm ATP, and fixed 1 mm IRS939. The viscosity dependence fork cat andk cat /K m, peptidewere determined using sucrose as the microviscogen, following procedures described previously (15Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); control experiments ruling out potential artifacts arising in viscosity dependence experiments are described in that study. To determine K m, peptide for the activated kinases, each mutant IRKD was autophosphorylated for 30–60 min at a concentration of 2 μm kinase, 5 mmATP, 10 mm MgAc2, 0.01% hydrogenated Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm TrisAc, pH 7.0, which produced maximum activation of each kinase (not shown). The activated kinase was diluted into peptide phosphorylation reaction mixtures to give a final concentration of 2–4 nm; dephosphorylation does not occur after dilution (i.e. during the assay). Peptide phosphorylation was assayed at 0.025–2 mm IRS939, at fixed 10 mm MgATP. Low catalytic efficiency is the functional hallmark of intrasteric inhibition of the unphosphorylated IRKD. It is produced by low k cat and high K m for both substrates (15Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters for three mutants are summarized in Table II, together with previously published control data for the WT-IRKD and D1161A-IRKD. These results show relief of intrasteric inhibition for Q1208S-, K1085N-, and Y1162F-IRKD, based on increased catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m). There were 4- to 6-fold increases in k cat and 12- to 22-fold decreases in K m, MgATP compared with the WT-IRKD, but K m, peptide was essentially unchanged in each of these mutant IRKDs. These features were observed previously in the D1161A-IRKD mutant (Table II), suggesting that a mutation breaking any subset of hydrogen bonds for pseudosubstrate recognition relieves intrasteric inhibition.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for mutant IRKDs and hydrogen bonds affected in pseudosubstrate recognitionParameter2-aApparent parameters as defined under “Experimental Procedures”; k catfrom the determination of K m, peptide at 10 mm MgATP.

Open table in a new tab The Michaelis constant is often equated with a dissociation constant, although this does not apply in all kinetic mechanisms. Therefore, to determine if a lower K m, MgATPrepresents an increased affinity for adenine nucleotide, we measured the inhibition constant for AMP-PNP, which is an analog of ATP that does not support phosphoryl transfer. Surprisingly, theK i, AMP-PNP indicated slightly stronger nucleotide binding to the Q1208S-IRKD but 5- to 7-fold tighter nucleotide binding for the K1085N- and Y1162F-IRKD mutants. This result subdivides these kinase mutants in two groups, in which intrasteric inhibition is accompanied by (a) tighter nucleotide binding (K1085N-, Y1162F-, and D1161A-IRKD) or (b) occurs with only a modest change in affinity (Q1208S-IRKD). The residues Lys-1085 and Gln-1208 interact with the P−1residue of the peptide substrate, 4The residues in a peptide substrate are designated as follows (40Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar): the P0 residue is the hydroxy-amino acid that accepts the phosphate group from ATP during catalysis. Successive residues amino-terminal to the P0residue are designated P−1, P−2, etc. Successive residues carboxyl-terminal to the P0 residue are designated P+1, P+2, etc. shown in structures of the activated IRKD (24Hubbard S.R.

Biol. 2001; 8: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues could affect directly the value ofK m, peptide. This was tested in the activated (autophosphorylated) forms of the mutant kinases (Table III). The value forK m, peptide for the activated Q1208S-IRKD was equivalent to activated WT-IRKD, but theK m, peptide for activated K1085N-IRKD was 5-fold higher. The data show that Lys-1085 is more important than Gln-1208 for K m, peptide. This result suggests the substitution of Ser for Gln-1208 does not disrupt pseudosubstrate binding of the A-loop as much as substitution of Asn for Lys-1085. The surprising result was the relatively highK m, peptide for autophosphorylated Y1162F-IRKD compared with the other autophosphorylated kinases. This probably resulted from a limiting stoichiometry of 1 mol of phosphate per mol of IRKD after autophosphorylation (not shown), and at least two phosphotyrosines are required for significant activation (26Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

Because of these low turnover numbers, we made no attempt to determine K m, MgATP orK m, peptide for these two mutants. Previous studies showed that relief of intrasteric inhibition was accompanied by changes in the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle, without (14Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M.

We probed these unphosphorylated mutant IRKDs for similar changes by measuringk cat andk cat /K m, peptideat increasing solution viscosity. As shown in Fig. 2, neither parameter differed from the unphosphorylated WT-IRKD for any of the three mutants examined here, unlike the D1161A-IRKD. Therefore, the phosphoryl transfer reaction remains limited by a viscosity-insensitive step despite the relief of intrasteric inhibition from steady-state kinetics for the K1085N-, Y1162F-, and Q1208S-IRKD. In the functional patterns emerging from solution properties, these results distinguish D1161A-IRKD from the other IRKD mutants, K1085N-IRKD is grouped with Y1162F-IRKD, and Q1208S-IRKD remains intermediate between WT-IRKD and the other mutants. In previous work we had shown that collisional quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by iodide is a sensitive indicator of solute exposure at the active site cleft, resulting from A-loop phosphorylation (23Bishop S.M.

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5), by regulating the bioavailability of IGFs, is involved in controlling IGF-dependent differentiation. We investigated the effects of TGF-β on the IGFBP-5 production induced by IGFs in mouse myoblasts. TGF-β leads to a decrease in IGFBP-5 synthesis at both transcript and protein levels, and blocked muscle differentiation. The Smad proteins and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been shown to be involved in TGF-β signaling pathways. We provide evidence that the JNK pathway, rather than Smad proteins, is involved in the response of muscle cells to TGF-β. This factor failed to stimulate the GAL4-Smad 2/3 transcriptional activities of the constructs used to transfect myoblasts. Moreover, stable expression of the antagonistic Smad7 did not abolish the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 production whereas expression of a dominant-negative version of MKK4, an upstream activator of JNK, did. We also showed, using a specific inhibitor, that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was not involved in the inhibition of IGFBP-5 production.

IGFs (insulin-like growth factors) stimulate myoblast replication but also induce terminal differentiation (1Florini J. Ewton D. Coolican S. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R)1and are strongly regulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which control the bioavailability of IGFs (2Jones J. Clemmons D. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IGFBP family includes six structurally related soluble proteins that bind IGFs with a very high affinity, equal to or greater than that of IGFs for binding to the IGF-1R. IGFBP-5, the most highly conserved of all known IGFBPs, is produced in large amounts in muscle tissue and is up-regulated during differentiation in vitro(3Rotwein P. James P.L. Kou K. Mol.

IGFBP-5-mRNA has been detected as early as embryonic day 10.5 in the rat embryo, especially in muscle progenitors, and is present in muscle cells in all regions of the embryo throughout fetal life (8Green B. Jones S. Streck R. Wood T. Rotwein P. Pintar J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 synthesis is induced by IGF following IGF-1R activation (7Rousse S. Montarras D. Pinset C. Dubois C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Ewton D. Florini J. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but seems to be repressed by several growth factors including TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β), fibroblast growth factor-2, and epidermal growth factor (10McCusker R. Clemmons D. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified IGFBP-5 prevents the proliferation of interstitial cell precursors in vivo (11Caroni P. Schneider C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3378-3388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and negatively regulates IGF-dependent proliferation and differentiation, in vitro (12Ewton D. Coolican S. Mohan S. Chernausek S. Florini J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overproduction of IGFBP-5 in muscle cells by transfection inhibits differentiation whereas inhibition of IGFBP-5 production results in more extensive differentiation (4James P. Stewart C. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the factors that regulate IGFBP-5 synthesis by muscle cells determine the bioavailability of IGFs and the IGFBP-5 synthesis induced during myogenic differentiation may regulate IGF activity by negative feedback. However, the mechanisms by which IGFBP-5 synthesis is regulated during myogenesis are still incompletely understood. TGF-β plays an important role during myogenesis but has contrasting activities. In vivo, TGF-β expression is associated with myogenesis during the early stages of myoblast differentiation and during muscular regeneration (13McLennan I.S. Koishi K. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, myoblasts have been reported to require functional TGF-β receptors for fusionin vivo (14Filvaroff E. Ebner R. Derynck R. Development. 1994; 120: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that TGF-β may act as a competence factor in myogenic differentiation. However, the situation is probably more complicated as the effects of TGF-β on muscle differentiation depend on culture conditions and the combination of TGF-β with other growth factors. TGF-β has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts, but only if the cells are cultured at high density (15De Angelis L. Borghi S. Melchionna R. Berghella L. Baccarani-Contri M. Parise F. Ferrari S. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12358-12363Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, TGF-β not only promoted differentiation when combined with other growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor-2, but also blocked the effects of stimuli that negatively regulate myogenic differentiation (16Zentella A. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5176-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Schofield J. Wolpert L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1990; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, it has often been reported that, in vitro, TGF-β is negatively regulated by IGFs, at the RNA and protein levels, during later stages of differentiation (18Bosche W. Ewton D. Florini J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and that both the TGF-β secreted by muscle cells and exogenous TGF-β inhibit myoblast fusion (19Lafyatis R. Lechleider R.

TGF-β signals by simultaneously contacting two transmembrane serine/threonine kinases known as the type I and type II receptors. The type II receptor can bind TGF-β directly, but cannot mediate responses in the absence of the type I receptor (24Wrana J. Attisano L. C′arcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X. Massagué J.

On phosphorylation by the activated type I receptor at COOH-terminal serine residues, the Smad2 or Smad3 protein associates with the shared partner Smad4, and the resulting complex is translocated to the nucleus where they participate in transcriptional activation of target genes. Unlike Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, the antagonistic Smad proteins which includes Smad6 and Smad7, appear to regulate these pathways negatively by blocking ligand-dependent signaling (26Heldin C. Miyazono K. Ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 27Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.

Recently, the role of Smad7 was revealed more complex as it is involved in cell death regulation (29Landström M. Heldin N.E. Bu S. Hermansson A. Itoh S. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Cell. 2000; 87: 565-576Google Scholar, 30Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A.

(2001) 276,36797–36803Google Scholar). The JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling pathway is also one of the downstream effectors required for TGF-β-mediated responses. TGF-β can activate the JNK pathway in a variety of cell lines (32Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of JNK by TGF-β signaling seems to be largely mediated by sequential activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, a MAP kinase kinase, such as MKK4, ultimately leading to activation of the MAP kinase, JNK. JNK is thought to be responsible for phosphorylating the transactivation domain of the c-Jun proteinin vivo. The phosphorylated c-Jun then homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with members of the Fos family, and these complexes bind to AP1 sites and control the expression of a number of genes including that encoding c-Jun itself (36Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 37Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 production and on the differentiation induced by high concentrations of insulin which mimic the action of IGFs. We found that TGF-β inhibited IGFBP-5 induction and muscle differentiation. We present evidence that the inhibition of IGFBP-5 synthesis is independent of Smad proteins and requires the functional regulatory kinase, MKK4, an upstream activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Specific complementary DNA probe for mouse IGFBP-5 was generously provided by a gift from S. Drop (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The expression vectors encoding the dominant-interfering mutant form of MKK4 (pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK4-Ala) (pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7), GST-Jun (pGEX-4T1-c-Jun 1–79), and β-galactosidase (pCMV-5-LacZ) have been described elsewhere (32Atfi A.

The p3TP-Lux reporter construct (a gift from Dr. Joan Massagué) contains three consecutive AP1 sites, and sequences from the plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter driving the expression of a luciferase reporter gene. To obtain plasmids encoding GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 fusion proteins, cDNAs from pCMV5-Flag-Smad2 and pCMV5-Flag-Smad3 (generously provided by Dr. Wrana) were inserted into the pSG424 vector in-frame with an amino-terminal GAL4-(1–147) tag, using convenient sites in the vector polylinker. The expression vector for G15E1b-lux, which contained the luciferase reporter gene downstream from the DNA-binding elements of GAL4 and the E1b TATA box, has been described elsewhere (38Whitmarsh A. Shore P. Sharrocks A. Davis R. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The C2 myoblast cell line stably transfected with a vector generating an antisense RNA complementary to the first 106 nucleotides of the mature IGF-II protein, called C2 anti-IGF-II (39Montarras D. Aurade F. Johnson T. Iian J. Gros F. Pinset C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar), was cultured in proliferation medium, which consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 20% (v/v) FCS (Institut Jacques Boy, Reims, France), 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/μl hygromycin B (Sigma) added for selection. For experiments, cells were cultured for 3 days in proliferation medium then incubated in low-serum medium containing 1% (v/v) FCS, for 1 day. These quiescent cells were transferred to serum free-medium supplemented with 10−6m bovine insulin (Sigma) to induce differentiation, in the presence or absence of human TGF-β1 (Sigma) at the concentrations indicated. The parental untransfected C2 myoblasts used in some experiments were induced to differentiate in a serum-free medium with 10−6m insulin or in low-serum medium containing 1% FCS. To generate C2 anti-IGF-II cells stably expressing the FLAG-Smad7 construct and the dominant-interfering mutant MKK4-Ala gene, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7 or pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK4-Ala using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h of expression in regular medium (20% FCS), selection was initiated by adding 200 μg/μl hygromycin B (Sigma) and 400 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Single colonies obtained on day 15 were cloned. Control cells were transfected with the appropriate vector alone (control), selected in parallel with the other cells, and expanded as pools of stably transfected cells. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2, used as a positive control of transfection with the GAL4/Smad-2 and -3 constructs, was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells cultured in plastic tissue culture plates were fixed by incubation for 3 min with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone and stored at −20 °C. Cells were incubated with antibodies as previously described (39Montarras D. Aurade F. Johnson T. Iian J. Gros F. Pinset C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar): (i) 40 min with a monoclonal antibody against troponin T (Sigma) used at 1:200 dilution; (ii) 30 min with a biotin-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma); (iii) 20 min with a streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. The product of the peroxidase reaction was detected with a kit from Sigma. Cells were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline after each step. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). Cell extracts (350 μg of proteins) were incubated with a polyclonal anti-JNK/SAPK antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:100, for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed 3 times in lysis buffer, and once with the kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm orthovanadate). The kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the pelleted beads in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture plus 2 μg of GST-Jun, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped after 20 min at 30 °C by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and boiling for 5 min. The samples were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The level of c-Jun phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINETM method. Cells were incubated for 24 h to facilitate expression. They were then placed in low-serum medium and incubated for 1 night with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β (three wells per treatment). The cells were lysed and luciferase activity determined using the luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). An aliquot was used to determine β-galactosidase activity using the Tropix's Galacto-Light kit (Tropix), and luciferase activities were standardized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. 24-h conditioned serum-free media was collected. Secreted IGFBP-5 was precipitated from 0.5-ml samples with 40% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. For Flag-tagged MKK4DN, Flag-Smad7, endogenous JNK, and troponin detections, cells were lysed with the same lysis buffer used for JNK kinase assays, and 40 μg of cellular protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and incubated with specific antibodies: the rabbit polyclonal anti-human IGFBP-5 antiserum (UBI, Euromedex, Souffelweyerseim, France); the rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz); the monoclonal antibody directed against the Flag epitope (anti-Flag M2, from Sigma), and the monoclonal anti-troponin T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using RNAxel extraction kit (Eurobio). Ten micrograms of total RNA were then subjected to gel electrophoresis, and blotted as previously described (40Pinset C. Montarras D. Chenevert J. Minty A. Barton P. Laurent C. Gros F. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mouse IGFBP-5 sequences have been published (41Schuller A.G. Groffen C. Van Neck J.W. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L. Mol. Cell. Endo. 1994; 104: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we used a specific complementary DNA probe generously provided by S. Drop (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), random primed with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine the serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, the subconfluent populations of cells were maintained in serum-free medium for different times and DNA laddering was performed as previously described (42Bertrand F. Atfi A. Cadoret A. L'Allemain G. Robin H. Lascols O. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2931-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric determination of DNA degradation was performed in cells deprived of serum for 24 h as we previously described (43Mazars A. Tournigand C. Mollat P. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Bourgeade M.F. Gespach C. Atfi A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We first investigated the effect of TGF-β on the muscle differentiation triggered by insulin using a C2 cell line variant (C2 anti-IGF-II cell line) obtained by stably transfecting C2 myoblasts with a vector generating an antisense IGF-II mRNA (39Montarras D. Aurade F. Johnson T. Iian J. Gros F. Pinset C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). This well characterized cell line, which did not undergo muscle differentiation without the addition of exogenous IGF or insulin at high concentration (10−6m), was used to investigate directly the relationships between IGF and TGF-β in the regulation of muscle differentiation. Consistent with previously published results, the insulin-induced differentiation of C2 anti-IGF-II was markedly inhibited by TGF-β, as shown by the smaller number of troponin T-positive cells (Fig. 1). IGFBP-5 is produced and secreted by muscle cells early in differentiation (5McCusker R. Camacho-Hübner C. Clemmons D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7795-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6James P. Jones S. Busby W.J. Clemmons D. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rousse S. Montarras D. Pinset C. Dubois C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether TGF-β could also inhibit IGFBP-5 production. Exposure of the C2 anti-IGF-II myoblasts to TGF-β greatly decreased the amount of IGFBP-5-mRNA detected and caused a similar decrease in the amount of IGFBP-5 protein secreted (Fig. 2 A). The inhibitory effect of TGF-β on the amount of IGFBP-5-mRNA and secreted protein was also observed using the parental C2 myoblast cell line (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in addition to inhibiting differentiation, TGF-β also inhibited IGFBP-5 induction in response to IGF signaling. It has been suggested that the activation of TGF-β signaling via the type I receptor may involve Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (44Derynck R. Feng X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 45Kawabata M. Miyazono K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 9-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Smad4 is the common mediator required by all pathways, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are specific substrates of TGF-β receptors. So, to investigate the possible role of Smad proteins in mediating the effects of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 production, we studied the effect of TGF-β on the transcriptional activity of Smad2 and Smad3 in C2 anti-IGF-II cells. We first assessed the effects of TGF-β on the 3TP-Lux reporter construct, which contains the sequences from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter that bind Smad3 and Smad4, along with three consecutive AP1 sites (47Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). The addition of TGF-β to C2 anti-IGF-II cells strongly induced transcription from the 3TP-Lux promoter (Fig. 3). To investigate directly whether Smad proteins were involved in the regulation of gene expression by TGF-β in these cells, we assessed the effect of TGF-β on the activity of the GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 constructs. The Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, if fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4-(1–147), activate transcription of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of GAL4-binding sites linked to an E1b TATA box. Surprisingly, we observed that the addition of TGF-β had no significant effect on GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 transcriptional activities in C2 anti-IGF-II cells (Fig. 3). The lack of TGF-β activation of the GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 constructs was not due to a defect in expression as we demonstrated that TGF-β increased, under these experimental conditions, the activity of GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). These results suggest that, in C2 anti-IGF-II cells, TGF-β receptor activation may exert its inhibitory functions on IGF-induced functions by triggering a signaling pathway different from that involving Smad proteins. In support of this hypothesis, we generated stable independent clones of C2 anti-IGF-II cells stably expressing Smad7, the antagonistic Smad (Fig. 4 A). We used these clones to assess the role of Smad proteins in the regulation by TGF-β of IGFBP-5 expression and myogenic differentiation. As expected, the overexpression of Smad7 did not interfere with the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 secretion (Fig. 4 B) and troponin expression (Fig. 4 C) induced by 10−6m insulin (or 10−8m IGF). In these cell lines Smad7 is functional since its overexpression sensitizes cells to apoptosis (Fig. 4 D) and inhibits NF-κB activity (data not shown), two well established functions of Smad7 (30Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,31Mazars, A., Lallemand, F., Prunier, C., Marais, J., Ferrand, N., Pessah, M., Cherqui, G., and Atfi, A. (2001) 276,36797–36803Google Scholar). The JNK signaling pathway is also regulated by TGF-β. This pathway activates transcription of several genes via interactions of c-Jun with AP-1 sites, thereby enabling TGF-β to transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. We first investigated the possible involvement of JNK in TGF-β-mediated responses in C2 anti-IGF-II cells by determining the activity of endogenous JNK from cells exposed to 2 ng/ml TGF-β for a variety of time periods. Endogenous JNK was isolated by immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody and its activity was determined in an in vitrokinase assay using GST-Jun as a specific substrate of JNK. Consistent with our previous reports in other cell lines, TGF-β increased JNK activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Activation of JNK by TGF-β was first detected after 1 h, peaked at 6 h (reaching a level 3 to 4 times higher than the initial level), and remained high for a prolonged period of time. The delayed and persistent activation of JNK by TGF-β may be due to the accumulation of JNK protein in the cells. However, immunoblotting analysis of total cell lysates with anti-JNK antibody demonstrated that similar amounts of JNK proteins were present. Thus, the increase in JNK activity probably results from the phosphorylation and activation of JNK by an upstream kinase such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4, also called Sek1 or JNKK). MKK4 is a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates JNK, resulting in its activation. If MKK4 acts downstream from the TGF-β receptor in the biochemical pathway leading to JNK activation in C2 anti-IGF-II cells, then expression of a dominant-negative mutant version of the MKK4 gene might abolish TGF-β-induced JNK activation. We investigated this possibility by generating independent clones of C2 anti-IGF-II cells stably expressing MKK4-Ala. MKK4-Ala (MKK4DN) encodes a dominant-negative mutant with defective JNK activation by TGF-β and other extracellular stimuli (45Kawabata M. Miyazono K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 9-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of whole cell lysates from transfected C2 anti-IGF-II cells revealed that three representative clones of 12 isolated, produced large amounts of a Flag-MKK4DN fusion protein (Fig. 6). As expected,the expression of MKK4DN reduced the TGF-β-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 6), indicating that TGF-β signaling via MKK4 was specifically blocked in the transfected cells. Anti-JNK immunoblotting of cell lysates confirmed that the observed decrease in JNK activity was not due to low levels of JNK in the MKK4DN-transfected cells (Fig. 7).Figure 7Dominant-negative mutant of MKK4 abolishes TGF-β-induced JNK activation. Control myoblasts transfected with the insert-free vector and MKK4DN myoblasts (clone n°4) were exposed to TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 6 h. Top panel, JNK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-JNK antibody and the immunoprecipitates were used for kinase assays with GST-Jun-(1–79) as the substrate. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. Bottom panel, whole cell lysate proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-JNK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the possible involvement of the JNK pathway in the TGF-β-dependent activation of gene expression, we determined the extent to which MKK4DN decreased the TGF-β-induced activation of the 3TP-Lux construct. The level of transcriptional activation of the 3TP-Lux promoter by TGF-β was significantly lower in cells expressing MKK4DN than in control myoblasts (Fig. 8). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the JNK pathway plays a critical role in the TGF-β-dependent activation of JNK in C2 anti-IGF-II myoblasts. We investigated whether the JNK pathway was essential for the TGF-β-dependent inhibition of IGFBP-5 production by assessing the ability of cells transfected with MKK4DN to induce IGFBP-5 production upon insulin stimulation in the presence or absence of TGF-β. In the absence of TGF-β, cells harboring the dominant negative version of MKK4 responded to insulin stimulation by producing IGFBP-5 in amounts similar to those in control cells (Fig. 9), indicating that the JNK pathway is not required for the up-regulation of IGFBP-5 by insulin. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on insulin-induced IGFBP-5 expression was abolished in MKK4DN-expressing cells (Fig. 9), indicating that MKK4 plays a crucial role in the negative regulation of IGFBP-5 expression by TGF-β, probably through its ability to activate JNK. Previous studies have shown that MKK4 phosphorylates and activates both JNK and p38 MAP kinases (48Han J. Lee J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 49Guan Z. Buckman S. Pentland A. Templeton D. Morrison A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Moreover, p38 kinases are activated in C2 myoblasts in response to TGF-β (50Hanafussa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J.I. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 17: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We evaluated the possibility that TGF-β inhibited IGFBP-5 production via the activation of p38 kinases. Treatment of C2 anti-IGF-II cells with a specific inhibitor of p38 kinases (SB 203580) did not abolish the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 production (Fig. 10). This inhibitor which also did not alter IGF-dependent IGFBP-5 induction, abolished the IGF-dependent differentiation of C2 anti-IGF-II (data not shown), as previously described (51Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of IGF-induced IGFBP-5 secretion by TGF-β appears to be independent of p38 kinase but likely dependent on JNK. IGFBP-5 is the major IGFBP produced by differentiated muscle cellsin vitro and in vivo (3Rotwein P. James P.L. Kou K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 913-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6James P.

As TGF-β is known to inhibit differentiation in vitro, we analyzed its effects on IGFBP-5 production and investigated the signaling pathways involved. Consistent with previous studies, we found that treatment of myoblasts with human TGF-β counteracted the stimulatory effect of IGFs on myoblast differentiation (21Florini J. Roberts A. Ewton D. Falen S. Flanders K. Sporn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16509-16513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heino J. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We also found that TGF-β abolished the IGF-dependent synthesis of IGFBP-5 in C2 anti-IGF-II cells. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 expression, we focused our analysis on the signaling pathways triggered by TGF-β, by investigating the involvement of Smad proteins and JNK in this process. Our data provide evidence that human TGF-β cannot activate Smad proteins in C2 anti-IGF-II myoblasts. We assessed the activation by TGF-β of Smad proteins by measuring the transcriptional activity of Gal4-Smad2 and Gal4-Smad3 constructs in transiently transfected myoblasts. Surprisingly, TGF-β did not activate either of these reporter constructs, in contrast to results obtained in other cell lines (26Heldin C. Miyazono K. Ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 27Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 28Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression in the myoblasts of Smad7, which is known to block the TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus of Smad2 and -3, did not modify the negative effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 induction and differentiation. Our observations differ significantly from those recently reported by Yamamoto et al. (52Yamamoto N. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Kurokawa T. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These authors demonstrated that overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 which was supposed to mimic TGF-β actions, specifically blocked myogenin promoter activity in C2C12 myoblasts cultured in differentiation medium. In our hands, TGF-β did not increase the transcriptional activities of Smad2 and Smad3 and stable expression of Smad7 did not abolish the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGF-dependent IGFBP-5 secretion and differentiation. Our data raise the interesting possibility that TGF-β might act by a mechanism independent of Smad protein involving interaction with the IGF signaling pathway. The basis for these differing observations concerning the role of Smad proteins in myoblasts is not clear. Further investigations are required to determine the precise conditions under which Smad proteins could be implicated. Our results provide evidence that the effect of TGF-β in cultured muscle cells largely depends on JNK. In addition to Smad protein activation, TGF-β also induces JNK activation in a variety of cell lines (32Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment of C2 anti-IGF-II myoblasts with TGF-β induced an increase in JNK, with levels peaking at 3 to 4 times basal levels after 6 h and remaining high thereafter. Activation of the JNK cascade by TGF-β was confirmed by activation of the 3TP-Lux reporter construct, the promoter of which contains Smad3/Smad4 binding sequences and three consecutive AP-1 sites. The Smad pathway was not activated by TGF-β in myoblasts, but the activation of JNK, which in turn activated AP1 proteins, was probably responsible for activation of the 3TP-Lux promoter. Consistent with this, stable expression of a dominant interfering mutant of MKK4DN in C2 anti-IGF-II myoblasts reduced the ability of TGF-β to induce the activation of JNK and 3TP-Lux. We used C2 anti-IGF-II clones stably transfected with the MKK4DN construct to show that the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 production induced by insulin (10−6m) was dependent on JNK activation. None of the MKK4DN clones analyzed was susceptible to TGF-β and thus the induction of IGFBP-5 production by insulin in the presence of TGF-β was still occurring. Like JNK, p38 MAP kinase is also a target of MKK4 (48Han J. Lee J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 49Guan Z. Buckman S. Pentland A. Templeton D. Morrison A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The addition of a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase (SB 203580) to C2 anti-IGF-II cells, which are still sensitive to TGF-β, did not affect the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of IGFBP-5 production. Thus, the pathway activated by TGF-β to regulate IGFBP-5 expression does not involve the p38 kinase whereas it probably activates JNK via MKK4. However, as far as the signaling triggered by IGFs or insulin (10−6m) is concerned, none of these kinases (MKK4, JNK, and P38) seemed to be involved in IGFBP-5 induction which still occurred in MKK4DN clones and in C2 anti-IGF-II cells treated with the p38 kinase inhibitor. Our study focused on the regulation of IGFBP-5 expression by TGF-β. In the course of these analyses we also checked whether IGFs or insulin could induce the differentiation of Smad7- and MKK4DN-transfected cells. Surprisingly, whereas Smad 7-transfected C2 anti-IGF-II cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of insulin 10−6m, MKK4DN-transfected cells were not any more able to undergo differentiation even though they retained myoblastic features of myoblasts such as Myf5 expression (data not shown) and were induced to secrete IGFBP-5. These observations confirm our previous data (7Rousse S. Montarras D. Pinset C. Dubois C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showing that IGFBP-5 induction by IGFs or insulin could be dissociated from differentiation. They also suggest that MKK4 protein kinase is involved in the pathway triggered by IGF-IR activation to promote differentiation whereas Smad proteins are not. Investigations are under way to identify the target of MKK4 which could be the p38 protein kinase. We are also investigating the possible role of IGF-induced IGFBP-5 in the inhibition of differentiation via this target, or otherwise. Smad proteins are critical mediators of many of the effects of TGF-β in a variety of cell systems. However, by studying the mechanisms of IGFBP-5 regulation by TGF-β, we found that in C2 myoblasts, TGF-β acts on cell differentiation and IGFBP-5 secretion via a mechanism independent of Smad activation. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β on IGFBP-5 secretion, is mediated by the activation of MKK4 and probably JNK, an essential component of TGF-β signal transduction. The results presented here provide evidence of a further mechanism for the modulation of IGFBP-5 synthesis in muscle cells.

In animals, the closed circular mtDNA genome encodes only 13 polypeptides, leaving the nuclear genome to provide the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins. All proteins involved in expression, replication, and repair of mtDNA are encoded in nuclear DNA. One of the key proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance is DNA ligase, required in the final stages of both DNA replication and repair. Initially it was thought that mitochondria lacked repair mechanisms, as pyrimidine dimers induced by UV light were not removed (1Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2777-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, in recent years it has become evident that mitochondria possess the ability to remove damage introduced into the mitochondrial genome by alkylation, oxidation, spontaneous base loss, A:G mismatches, and misincorporation of uracil (2Bogenhagen D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1276-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Sawyer D. VanHouten B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Characterization of enzymes involved in mtDNA repair is still at an early stage. Our purification of a DNA ligase activity from the mitochondria ofXenopus laevis oocytes provided the first characterization of this important protein (4Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The 100–110-kDa ATP-dependent mtDNA ligase was able to ligate the synthetic homopolymers oligo(dT)·poly(dA) and oligo(dT)·poly(rA). The size and properties of mtDNA ligase invite comparison with nuclear DNA ligases. Five biochemically different DNA ligase activities have been characterized in the nuclei of mammals, although genes have been identified only for DNA ligases I, III, and IV (5Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At least one form, DNA ligase II, is a proteolytic fragment of another activity, DNA ligase III (6Husain I. Tomkinson A.E. Burkhart W.A. Moyer M.B. Ramos W. Mackey Z.B. Besterman J.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9683-9690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Currently it is believed that DNA ligase I is the major enzyme that ligates Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication (7Lasko D.D. Tomkinson A.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). DNA ligase III has been implicated in short patch base excision repair (13Capelli E. Taylor R. Cevasco M. Abbondandolo A. Caldecott K.W. Frosina G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23970-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and meiotic recombination (14Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DNA ligase IV appears to be involved in double strand break repair associated with V(D)J recombination (15Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and nonhomologous end-joining (16Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). All of these functions have been studied in more detail in the nucleus than in the mitochondrion. The mtDNA ligase activity purified from Xenopus oocyte mitochondria has a size and substrate specificity similar to those of human DNA ligase III or IV. Preliminary Western blotting results showed that the mtDNA ligase was immunologically related to human DNA ligase III (4Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Since no Xenopus DNA ligase sequences other than DNA ligase I were represented in public data bases, we analyzed mammalian DNA ligase cDNA sequences for potential NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signals. The sequences of human DNA ligase III and IV were originally reported with the prediction that translation would start at the second in-frame AUG since, in each case, the first AUG was not found within an optimal context for efficient translation initiation (17Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C. Yu G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K. Nash R.A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Haseltine W.A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3206-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA sequences permitted us to predict the polypeptides that would result if translation did initiate at the upstream AUG residues. For both human DNA ligase III and IV, computer analysis of the NH2 termini of these predicted polypeptides revealed features characteristic of a mitochondrial localization sequence (4Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Experimental data supporting the role of human DNA ligase III in mtDNA maintenance was later obtained with green fluorescent protein targeting experiments (18Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Lakshmipathy and Campbell (19Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that expression of human DNA ligase III antisense mRNA in tissue culture cells decreased the amount of adenylation activity in mitochondria and reduced mtDNA integrity. Very little characterization of mtDNA ligase has been reported on the protein level. Alternative splicing of the mouse DNA ligase III mRNA produces two transcripts that are predicted to encode an α isoform that contains a BRCA 1 COOH terminus (BRCT)1 domain and a β isoform that does not (14Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). BRCT domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions (20Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 21Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), including the stable interaction between nuclear DNA ligase IIIα and XRCC1 (22Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether mtDNA ligase is the product of the DNA ligase IIIα or IIIβ mRNA. Lakshmipathy and Campbell (23Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3880-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were not able to detect XRCC1 in immunoblots of crude mitochondrial protein. Although the detection limit of this assay is uncertain, it appears that XRCC1 might not be directed to mitochondria, and that association with XRCC1 is not required for the stability of mtDNA ligase. In this paper we report the cloning of X. laevis DNA ligase IIIα, DNA ligase IIIβ, and DNA ligase IV cDNAs as well as additional characterization of the mtDNA ligase protein. RT-PCR revealed that while DNA ligase IIIα and DNA ligase IV are expressed in all tissues, expression of DNA ligase IIIβ was only observed in testes and ovary. We demonstrate that both DNA ligase IIIα and IIIβ, but not DNA ligase IV are detected in mitochondrial lysates from X. laevis oocytes. Purified mtDNA ligase IIIα is selectively contained in a higher molecular weight form. In contrast, mtDNA ligase IIIβ behaves as a monomer in gel filtration and sedimentation experiments. We discuss the possibility that DNA ligase IIIα exists in mitochondria in the presence of novel mitochondrial protein partners or as a homodimer. Custom oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon.

The predicted translation products of human and mouse DNA ligase III were aligned using the CLUSTAL program included in the PCGene Software package. Highly conserved sequences, corresponding to the peptides HIKCMFE and DCIYFND, were chosen in order to design degenerate oligonucleotides to amplify an internal portion of X. laevis DNA ligase III cDNA by PCR on first strand oocyte cDNA. The resulting PCR product was used in successive rounds of 5′ and 3′ thermal rapid amplification of cDNA ends (24Frohman M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) with the same oocyte cDNA pool in order to generate a composite sequence representing the full-length DNA ligase IIIβ message. The initial partial DNA ligase III cDNA was radiolabeled by random priming with a Prime-It II kit and used to screen several cDNA libraries including a λgt11 X. laevis stage 24 embryo cDNA library (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A protein alignment of human and yeast DNA ligase IV sequences revealed conserved peptides CILDGEM and DKEWHECM used to design degenerate oligonucleotides that were used in PCR reactions with X. laevis oocyte first strand cDNA to obtain a partial clone which served as a probe in subsequent screens with a λZAP X. laevis oocyte cDNA library (kindly provided by M. Roth). DNA sequencing of all clones was carried out using either the Sequenase chain terminator method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or an automated ABI-PRISM Model 373 DNA Analysis System (PE Applied Biosystems Inc.). cDNA sequences were analyzed for NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signals using Mitoprot (26Claros M. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) (mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/medgen/mitop) and for other sequence motifs using the Pfam data base (27Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) (sanger.ac.uk/cgi_bin/pfam). Two micrograms of total RNA from adult X. laevis tissues were reverse transcribed with Superscript II RT primed with oligo(dT) following the conditions listed by the manufacturer. One-microliter aliquots corresponding to 40 ng of total RNA were then used as templates for PCR amplification of sequences unique to X. laevis DNA ligase IIIα cDNA or to DNA ligase IIIβ cDNA. This was done by using a primer common to both sequences, 5′-CTGGAAAACCGCCACAAC-3′, and another primer specific for either DNA ligase IIIα, 5′-ATGCCTTCTCCTGGTGTG-3′, or for DNA ligase IIIβ, 5′-TGTTGTCGTCTGCTCAGC-3′. The same templates were also used in order to determine the tissue-specific expression pattern of the DNA ligase IV gene by PCR amplification with the primers 5′-CAATACCAGGCAGATTCC-3′ and 5′-TTCCCCAGGACCTGAAGC-3′. PCR amplification of the constitutively expressed β actin cDNA, utilizing the primers 5′-TGGAGAAGAGCTATGAGCTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-GTGCCACCAGACAGCACTGTGTTG-3′, was performed as a control for template quantity in each reaction. PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 30 cycles of amplification used was determined to be within the log-linear range of amplification by quantitating PCR products as a function of the number of cycles. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose TBE gels and detected by staining with ethidium bromide. The expected sizes of PCR products were 691 bp for DNA ligase IIIα, 558 bp for DNA ligase IIIβ, 431 bp for DNA ligase IV, and 201 bp for β actin. Relative amounts of each PCR product were determined by fluorimetric analysis with a FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics). Molar amounts of each PCR product were calculated, adjusted for differences in product size, and used to derive ratios of DNA ligase IIIα, DNA ligase IIIβ, and DNA ligase IV cDNA with respect to β actin cDNA. NH2-terminal sequences suspected to serve as mitochondrial targeting signals were cloned into pEGFP-N1 in order to test their ability to localize enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to mitochondria (28Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar, 29Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). Amino acids 1–56 ofXenopus DNA ligase III, 1–88 of human DNA ligase III, 1–73 of X. laevis DNA ligase IV, and 1–68 of human DNA ligase IV were amplified by PCR using primers designed to permit cloning into the polylinker of pEGFP-N1 as EcoRI-BamHI fragments. The localization sequence of a known mitochondrial protein, the accessory subunit of DNA polymerase γ (DNA Pol γB), was also amplified by PCR and subcloned into pDsRed (30Matz M. Fradkov A. Labas Y. Savitsky A. Zaraisky A. Markelov M. Lukyanov S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) to create a γB-DsRed construct for use as a mitochondrial marker. All constructs were sequenced to verify that the inserts were in-frame with the start codon of EGFP. For transfection, the expression vector plasmid DNA was prepared by double-banded CsCl gradient centrifugation. Each EGFP fusion construct was co-transfected with γB-DsRed transiently into HeLa cells following standard calcium phosphate transfection protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were examined 16 h post-transfection with a Nikon PCM 2000 confocal microscope system using a 60XA/1.40 oil immersion objective. Mitochondria were isolated from 270 g of X. laevis ovarian tissue by several cycles of differential centrifugation (31Wu G. Dawid I. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3589-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A cleared Triton X-100 lysate of ovary mitochondria was prepared as described (32Bogenhagen D.F. Insdorf N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2910-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and passed through a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column at a salt concentration of 250 mm KCl. The flow-through fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 2 mm DTT to a final KCl concentration of 50 mm. All column buffers described contained a standard mixture of protease inhibitors, including 0.5 mmbenzamidine HCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, E64, and aprotinin. The dialyzed flow-through was then applied to a 20-ml SP-Sepharose column. At this and subsequent chromatography steps, fractions containing DNA ligase were assayed for adenylation activity as described below. The peak fractions from SP-Sepharose were pooled, diluted 2.5 times with buffer lacking KCl, and concentrated on a Poros HS/F column by step elution prior to chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 (16/60) gel filtration column equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.3m KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 40 μg/ml acetylated gelatin and the standard protease inhibitor mixture described above. Two peaks of adenylation activity were identified, pooled separately, and subjected to chromatography on a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose HiTrap column. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of KCl increasing linearly from 50 to 800 mm. Throughout the purification, chromatography fractions were stored at −80 °C after addition of one-half volume of storage buffer containing 75% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Analytical glycerol gradient sedimentation was performed as described (33Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21491-21497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human DNA ligase III was prepared from a HeLa cell nuclear extract using phosphocellulose and mono-S column chromatography (34Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). DNA ligase was detected in each column eluate by assaying enzyme adenylation. DNA ligase III was purified from the post-mitochondrial supernatant of Xenopus ovary homogenates. The fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and the resulting supernatant was treated with 62% saturated ammonium sulfate to precipitate proteins (35Cozzarelli N.R. Gerrard S.P. Schlissel M. Brown D.D. Bogenhagen D.F. Cell. 1983; 34: 829-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DNA ligase III was purified by SP-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite chromatography and column fractions were assayed for enzyme adenylation. The mechanism-based adenylation of enzyme was used to detect DNA ligase activity at all purification steps. Enzyme fractions were incubated in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and stopped by addition of an equal volume of sodium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and detected by autoradiography or direct PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel. Primers 5′-ACTGGCCCCCATATGATGGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTCATCCTCGAGGGTGAGCTT-3′ were used to amplify a 0.95-kilobase PCR product, corresponding to amino acids 88 to 353 of DNA ligase III, from mouse testis cDNA. Primers 5′-CAAATACTCCCATGGTCATGCAAAAA-3′ and 5′-ATCAAATAATTCTGCGGCCGCGTAACCAGA-3′ were used to amplify a 514-bp DNA fragment of X. laevis DNA ligase IV corresponding to amino acids 347 to 515. PCR reactions were performed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase to reduce errors and both products were cloned into the polylinker of pET22b(+). Expression was achieved using the BL21(DE3)Escherichia coli strain after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Induced cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm PMSF). A similar buffer was prepared replacing glycerol with 8 m urea in order to solubilize the antigens, which were present in insoluble fractions. Purification of antigens was accomplished by preparative SDS-PAGE on a Bio-Rad Model 491 Prep Cell. Rabbits were immunized using standard protocols. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% methanol onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes which were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antisera diluted in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). Proteins were detected by incubation of the membranes with a commercial alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody followed by the colorimetric substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium. Recombinant human XRCC1 protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using pET22b(+). To prepare these constructs, primers 5′-CCAGGCGAAGAATTCGACGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTGTATAGCACAGATCTCAGGCTTGC-3′ were used to amplify a 1.9-kilobase PCR product from a human testis first strand cDNA pool, using Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase. This product was cloned into the TOPOII vector to produce the plasmid pXRCC1TOPO. For bacterial expression, PCR on pXRCC1TOPO DNA with primers 5′-GAATTCGACCATATGCCGGAG-3′ and 5′-GTATAGCACAGAAGATCTGCTTGC-3′ were used to produce a fragment capable of insertion into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET22b(+) to introduce a polyhistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus of XRCC1. Fusion constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing with an ABI-PRISM Model 373 DNA Analysis System (PE Applied Biosystems Inc.). Expression was achieved using the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography as described (37Carrodeguas J. Bogenhagen D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified protein was dialyzed to remove imidazole and stored at −80 °C in aliquots after freezing in liquid nitrogen. An XRCC1 affinity column was prepared by loading pure recombinant protein onto Ni-NTA-agarose beads to capacity (4 μg of protein/μl bead). Beads were then washed twice with 4 column volumes of W20 buffer (500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole) and resuspended in an equal volume of W20 buffer. Partially purified DNA ligase III samples, containing both the 110- and the 100-kDa forms of the enzyme, were adenylated and used to set up affinity precipitation reactions as follows. Two hundred-microliter reactions were prepared with partially purified DNA ligase III (7 μg of total protein), 10 μl wet volume of XRCC1 beads, and W20. Reactions were incubated on ice for 1 h with frequent gentle mixing. 35 μl were removed, imidazole added to 250 mm final concentration, and stored on ice as a “load” sample. The remaining reaction mixture was gently centrifuged for 1 s and the supernatant containing nonadsorbed material was removed and saved as an “un-bound” fraction. The Ni-NTA pellet was washed three times with 190 μl of W20 buffer. Adsorbed material was eluted from the Ni-NTA beads with two 190-μl washes of EB250 buffer (500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mm imidazole). Twenty-five μl of load, unbound, wash, and elution samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and detected by direct PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel. One-microliter samples of partially purified DNA ligase IIIα and IIIβ activities from X. laevis oocyte mitochondria and human nuclear DNA ligase III were adenylated as described above. Labeled material was incubated with 0, 0.05, 0.25, and 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate for 30 min at room temperature or with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.03% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Following incubation with cross-linker, an equal volume of sodium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer was added and proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize molecular weight markers and dried following a brief period of destaining. Cross-linked products were detected by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel. Partially purified DNA ligase IIIα and IIIβ activities from X. laevis oocyte mitochondria and human nuclear DNA ligase III were analyzed by blue native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to compare molecular masses and analyze the polypeptide composition of protein complexes (38Schagger H. Cramer W. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). A 6–13% polyacrylamide gradient gel (with a 4% stacking gel) was prepared with 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 500 mm6-aminocaproic acid using a Hoeffer Tall Mighty Small gel electrophoresis system. Samples were labeled by adenylation and loaded in 0.5% Serva Blue G, 50 mm aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0. The gel was run at 4 °C with cathode buffer containing 15 mmBisTris, pH 7.0, 50 mm Tricine, 0.02% Serva Blue G, and anode buffer containing 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0. Electrophoresis was performed for 1 h at 100 V before increasing the voltage to 500 V for 20 min. Electrophoresis was stopped to change the cathode buffer for fresh buffer without Serva Blue G and resumed at 500 V until the dye front exited the bottom of the gel. An internal portion of X. laevis DNA ligase III was generated by standard PCR methods with degenerate primers designed from peptide sequences conserved between human DNA ligase III and yeast DNA ligase IV using first strand ovarian cDNA as template. A resulting 1435-bp DNA fragment revealed extensive homology to the central region of human DNA ligase III. 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed as described to complete the clone (24Frohman M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Five PCR products were isolated and used to construct a 3.0-kilobase composite sequence of a X. laevis cDNA with homology to human and mouse DNA ligase IIIβ (14Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levi"
https://openalex.org/W2012695451,"In this paper, we show that amino acids Glu73 and Asp77 of staphylococcal nuclease cooperate unequally with Glu75 to stabilize its structure located between the C-terminal helix and β-barrel of the protein. Amino acid substitutions E73G and D77G cause losses of the catalytic efficiency of 24 and 16% and cause thermal stability losses of 22 and 26%, respectively, in comparison with the wild type (WT) protein. However, these changes do not significantly change global and local secondary structures, based on measurements of fluorescence and CD222 nm. Furthermore, x-ray diffraction analysis of the E75G protein shows that the overall structure of mutant and WT proteins is similar. However, this mutation does cause a loss of essential hydrogen bonding and charge interactions between Glu75 and Lys9, Tyr93, and His121. In experiments using double point mutations, E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, and E75G/D77G, significant changes are seen in all mutants in comparison with WT protein as measured by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The losses of thermal stability are 47, 59, and 58%, for E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, and E75G/D77G, respectively. The triple mutant, E73G/E75G/D77G, results in fluorescence intensity and CD222 nm close to those of the denatured state and in a thermal stability loss of 65% relative to the WT protein. Based on these results, we propose a model in which significant electrostatic interactions result in the formation of a locally stable structure in staphylococcal nuclease.

The “Levinthal paradox” (1Levinthal C. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 65: 44-45Crossref Google Scholar) is still an unresolved issue for protein researchers. With rigorous investigation, however, both the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding may yield answers to this major biological question. From the kinetic point of view, a protein can be refolded in vitro to its active three-dimensional conformation on a millisecond time scale, as we have shown for staphylococcal nuclease (SNase)1 (2Chen H.M. You J.L. Markin V.S. Tsong T.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Chen H.M. Markin V.S. Tsong T.Y.

The sequence of equilibrium reactions among three denatured states and one native state has been established (5Su Z.D. Arooz T.M. Chen H.M. Gross C.J. Tsong T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2539-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar): D3 ⇆ D2 ⇆ D1 ⇆ N0, where D i (i= 1, 2, or 3) denotes the protein in its unfolded state and N0 is the protein in its native state. Under this scheme, a least activation path model for protein folding was established and used to help to solve puzzles such as accumulated intermediates, random searches among “microscopic states” (6Chen H.M. Markin V.S. Tsong T.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12369-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the cofactor roles of chaperonin proteins such as prolyl isomerase, disulfide isomerase, and molecular chaperones (7Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. Vandervies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 8Ellis R.J. Vandervies S.M. Annu.

Recently, the chaperonin function of the GroEL-GroES-ATP system (10Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) in the forced unfolding of ribulose-1,5-bisphophate carboxylase-oxygenase was reported (11Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether protein refolding is done with or without the assistance of chaperones, rigorous kinetic analysis is necessary to understand protein folding (12Kim P. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 631-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 13Karplus M. Weaver D.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 650-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The recent development of photolabile linkers has made the study of the early events of protein folding possible, although protein refolding may be completed within a matter of nanoseconds or less (14Rock R.S. Chan S.I. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 1526-1529Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Rock R.S. Chan S.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10766-10767Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein folding is also governed by thermodynamics, since it has been observed that an unfolded protein can spontaneously refold to its native structure at the global free energy minimum (5Su Z.D. Arooz T.M. Chen H.M. Gross C.J. Tsong T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2539-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 17Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5206) Google Scholar). This observation illustrates the basis of the Levinthal paradox (1Levinthal C. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 65: 44-45Crossref Google Scholar), which notes that the number of possible conformational states of a protein can be enormous and that it can take an infinitely long time to find the energy minimum that represents the native state. Although thermodynamic measurements cannot address the questions of rates and pathways of protein folding, a protein's energy state can be expressed as an aggregate thermal unfolding energy that is locally additive:e.g. ΔH unfolding = ΣΔH i (i = 1, 2, 3, …n), where ΔH i is the energy released by folding of a locally stable segment. The locally maintained energies are much smaller than those energies produced by covalent bonding. Therefore, a protein's local native structures are only marginally stable in solution. Despite this, they remain stable in the face of relatively severe perturbations although only weak forces such as electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions contribute to their local structures. Quantitative determination of the energetics of protein unfolding using point mutations is a promising approach to addressing the problem of protein folding. In this paper, we used wild type SNase and seven mutants, E73G, E75G, D77G, E73G/E75G, E73G/D77G, E75G/D77G, and E73G/E75G/D77G, to test in part the above thermal scheme. A local stable segment surrounded by Glu73, Glu75, and Asp77 may exist, and these residues may contribute significantly to SNase stability by maintaining the native conformation of the whole protein. X-ray structural analysis of E75G (Fig.1) was done, and the results further support the arguments regarding the loss of stability and enzyme activity after the replacements of Glu or Asp by Gly in the local area of SNase between C-terminal α-helix and a β-barrel. The WT staphylococcal nuclease nucgene was obtained from Prof. Tian Yow Tsong and originally donated by Prof. David Shortle. Luria-Bertani broth and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Difco Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. Salmon testes DNA and some analytical grade chemicals such as EDTA, Tris-HCl, CaCl2, NaCl, and mineral oil were obtained from Sigma. Substrate DNA was used without further purification. Guanidine hydrochloride and dNTPs were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Absolute ethanol (>99%) was obtained from Panreac, and urea was a product of Acros. The Stratagene QuickChangeTMkit containing Pfu DNA polymerase, × 10 reaction buffer, and DpnI restriction enzyme was purchased from Stratagene. 2-Methyl-2,4-pentadiol was purchased from Merck. Water used for these experiments was deionized and distilled. Mutants used for this experiment were generated by the PCR site-directed mutagenesis method. A commercial kit (Stratagene QuickChangeTM) was used for sample preparation. Glu73, Glu75, and Asp77 were replaced by Gly. Plasmid pTrc-99A encoding wild type (WT) SNase was stored at −20 °C before mutagenesis. Two complementary 33-mer primers that included the Gly codon at position 73, 75, or 77 were designed and synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.). Single point mutations were made to generate E73G, D77G, and E75G. Double mutation was used to generate E73G/E75G, E75G/D77G, and E73G/D77G, using a single point mutation plasmid as a template. Similarly, the triple mutation, E73G/E75G/D77G, utilized a double mutation plasmid as a template. The PCRs were then conducted. After the isolation of DNAs, the mutants were identified by cutting with restriction endonucleases, NcoI and BamHI. The mutant sequences (positions 1–149) verified by using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer) were compared with the WT sequence and were found to be correct. Colonies picked from −80 °C storage bottles containing WT or mutant SNase expression plasmids were streaked on ampicillin-containing agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. One colony from each plate was isolated and then inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C at 250 rpm for 5 h in a shaker incubator. A small amount of cell medium was poured into a 1-liter flask containing 200 ml of LB medium. The flask was incubated in the shaker incubator at 37 °C, 250 rpm overnight. Five portions of 40 ml of cell culture were then poured into each of five 1-liter flasks containing 400 ml of LB medium. These flasks were again incubated in the shaker incubator at 37 °C at 250 rpm for 4 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (20 μl, 0.5 mm), was added to each flask and then incubated for 4 h to induce recombinant protein expression. Cells were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant was discarded. The pellets were slowly dissolved by adding buffer A (6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2). The solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then mixed with prechilled absolute ethanol (1:1, v/v). The mixture was incubated at −20 °C for 2 h and was centrifuged at 4 °C, 7500 rpm for 20 min. The sediment was discarded. The remaining liquid was mixed with prechilled absolute ethanol (1:2, v/v) and incubated at −20 °C overnight. After proteins were completely precipitated, the sample was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were then dissolved in buffer B (6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2). Further purification was conducted using a cation exchange column (Carboxy-Methyl-25). The column was loaded with protein solution and washed with buffer B. The sample was eluted with buffer C (6m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2) and collected using a fraction collector measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The purified proteins were dialyzed with distilled water and then lyophilized using a vacuum freeze dryer. The yield of proteins was ∼40 mg/l. The purities were checked by 15% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue stain. A purity of over 90% was estimated by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The protein extinction coefficients were calculated with Gill and von Hippel's method (18Gill S.C. von Hippel H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 319-326Crossref Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by incubating the enzyme with a DNA substrate and measuring the change of absorbance at 260 nm. 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA were dissolved in 1 ml of buffer (10 mm CaCl2, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8). The mixture was boiled for 30 min and then cooled on ice for 15 min. 5 μl of enzyme (1 mg/ml) were gently mixed with 1 ml of substrate buffer in a spectrophotometer cuvette. The change in absorbance at 260 nm was recorded as a function of time. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to calculate best fit curves ofV o versus [C], whereV o is the initial velocity and [C] is the substrate concentration. The Michaelis constant, K m, and the maximal velocity, V max, were calculated from these best fit curves. The turnover rate of the enzyme,k cat, was calculated asV max/[E o], where [E o] was the initial concentration of the enzyme. The ratio k cat/K m was used to determine catalytic efficiency. WT and mutant protein solutions were prepared in a phosphate buffer (1 mg/ml) for CD studies using a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). The CD spectra were recorded in the far UV region (200–250 nm) using a 1-mm path length cuvette with a capacity of 200 μl. The data obtained from the Jasco J-720 was transferred to Origin™ software (MicroCal Software, Inc.) for plotting and further data treatment. A series of experiments was conducted by observing the shifts of CD222 nm for pH between 2.0 and 8.0 and for denaturant (Gdn-HCl) concentrations between 0 and 2 m. For pH-shifting experiments, the solution pH was adjusted to the desired value using 6 m HCl or 5 m NaOH. For additive Gdn-HCl experiments, the final solution was prepared by the dilution of 6 m Gdn-HCl stock solution with a protein solution to the desired concentration. Each experiment was completed by using at least 10–15 samples in different conditions. Protein solutions in a phosphate buffer (1 mg/ml) were prepared for fluorescence studies using a luminescence spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fluorescence spectra were recorded at wavelengths between 300 and 550 nm and excitation at 298 nm using a 1-cm path length cuvette with a capacity of 700 μl. The data obtained from the LS50B fluorometer were transferred to Origin software for plotting and further data treatment. Protein solutions in a phosphate buffer (2 mg/ml) were prepared for thermal analysis using a Nano differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Provo, UT). The results of DSC were recorded with the plot of heat capacity (C p, kcal/degrees·mol) versustemperature (15–70 °C). To remove bubbles, the sample solutions were degassed with sonication for 15 min before the thermal heating experiment. 1.5 ml of the sample was then loaded in the thermal chamber, and an equal amount of protein-free buffer was added as a reference. The pressure in the sample chamber was adjusted until 3 atmospheres was reached. The scan rate was 1 °C/min. The melting point (T m) can be directly obtained from the DSC curve. The enthalpy change (ΔH) was calculated by the integration of the curve-covering area using Origin software. A series of experiments under different environmental conditions such as the addition of denaturant, Gdn-HCl, were conducted, and the calculated ΔH values were recorded. Suitable crystals of the E75G protein were prepared as follows: a 20.5 mg/ml protein solution (10.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.3) including a final concentration of 18% 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol (w/w) was prepared. The solution was then incubated in a water bath at 4 °C for 3 days. Afterward, a 1.1 m equivalent of pdTp (2.5 mg/ml) and 2.0 m equivalent of calcium (200 mmCaCl2) were added, and the protein solution was filtered and crystallized against 40–50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol in 10.5 mm potassium phosphate at pH 8.3 using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Small, poorly diffracting crystals were formed at 4 °C within 3 months (19Loll P.J. Lattman E.E. Proteins. 1989; 5: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), whereas suitable single crystals (dimensions 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm) were obtained after 6 months. Data were collected on an R-axis II imaging plate detector using CuKα radiation generated by a RIGAKU RU-300 rotating anode operating at 50 kV and 80 mA and processed using a commercial software package (Molecular Structure Corp.). The space group deduced from systematic absence is P41, and the unit cell parameters are as follows: a = b = 48.085 Å, c = 63.52 Å, which is isomorphous with wild type crystals. The resolution (Å), bond length (Å)/angle (degrees) and dihedral (degrees) were 2.2, 0.012/1.849, and 25.626, respectively (the refinement statistics are not shown). Refinement of the E75G mutant crystal structure was carried out using the PROLSQ (20Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and XPLOR (21Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 348-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) programs. The mutant model was derived from the wild type protein (22Cotton F.A. Hazen E.E. Legg M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) using the CHAIN program (23Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-245Crossref Google Scholar). The Glu75 side chain was deleted from the WT structural frame, which was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (entry pdb1snc.ent). The pdTp and calcium ion were omitted for the initial refinement. The simulated annealing refinement was conducted on the initial model using the XPLOR program (21Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 348-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After the first round of simulated annealing, the R-factor was reduced to 22% at a resolution from 1.0 to 2.5 Å. This model was further refined to restore its geometry using PROLSQ. Both 2F o − F c andF o − F c omit maps were calculated within the areas containing the deleted areas around position 75 and the loop regions, including positions 72–82 and positions 39–53, so that the bias caused from building the model could be avoided. Using the CHAIN program, the side chains were rebuilt by manual adjustment in the regions of position 75 and the loops. The topology and parameters of pdTp used in the XPLOR program and the dictionary parameters used in PROLSQ program were constructed based on standard B-DNA. The pdTp and calcium ion were restored on the maps, and 206 water molecules were located in the deletion maps. The solvent location, simulated annealing refinement, and PROLSQ refinement were processed and repeated three times to confirm system convergence. No additional solvent molecules could be located after refinement. Enzyme activity assays were done for WT SNase and the single point mutants E73G and D77G. The results are shown in Table I. The Michaelis constant (K m) of the WT enzyme (2.63 ± 0.45 × 10−2m) is 22 and 41% greater than E73G (2.05 ± 0.30 × 10−2m) and D77G (1.54 ± 0.29 × 10−2m), respectively. This implies that the dissociation rate of the enzyme-substrate complex is faster for the WT enzyme than for the mutants. The turnover rate (k cat) representing the number of times each enzyme molecule catalyzes the reaction per unit time is greater for the WT enzyme (4.49 ± 0.80 × 103 s−1) than for E73G (2.67 ± 0.31 × 103 s−1) and D77G (2.20 ± 0.35 × 103 s−1). The mutants also have lower apparent rate constants,k cat/K m, which represent the catalytic efficiency. The rate constant for E73G (1.30 × 105m−1 s−1) is 76% of the WT enzyme (1.71 × 105m−1 s−1), and the rate constant of D77G (1.43 × 105m−1s−1) is 84% of the WT enzyme. The rate constant for the E75G mutant (24Chen H.M. Dimagno T.J. Wang W. Leung E. Lee C.-H. Chan S.I. Eur. J.

Temperature is 23 °C and enzyme concentration is 5 μg/ml. The best fit of the nonlinear regression was used to calculate bothK m and k cat. Among the estimates, the smallest difference between E73G and D77G is still significant, since the t test values (25Skoog D.A. West D.M. Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc., New York1969: 37-50Google Scholar) (4 degrees of freedom) for the differences of K m andk cat (Table I) between E73G and D77G are 3.52 (>95% probability) and 2.85 (>95% probability), respectively. Thet test values of the differences for the rest of the estimates have greater than 99% probability. The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues can be used to detect shifts of a protein's tertiary structure or changes in tertiary structure caused by mutations. Fig. 2 A shows the fluorescence emission curves of WT SNase and the E73G and D77G mutants in their native (N) (pH 7.0) and denatured (D) states (pH 2.5). A change in the maximum emission wavelength from N (340 nm) to D (355 nm) is observed for all three proteins. The intensity of fluorescence decreases significantly upon denaturation. This indicates that the Trp residues in the protein are significantly exposed to water upon unfolding. In the native state, the fluorescence intensities of the mutants are less than that of the WT protein, indicating that the exposure of Trp residues to water is greater for these mutants. Taken together, these data indicate that the confirmations of the mutated proteins are slightly relaxed compared with WT SNase. Some typical CD spectra of WT SNase and the E73G and D77G mutants, in both N and D states, are shown in Fig. 2 B. All proteins have similar secondary structures in their N states. In their D states, induced by the addition of 6 m Gdn-HCl, secondary structures are destroyed. Similar to the fluorescence data, these results show that the substitution of Gly for Glu at residue 73 or for Asp at residue 77 causes changes that primarily affect the protein's tertiary conformation rather than secondary structures. The resistance of a protein to unfolding can be used to evaluate protein stability. The relative stability of the SNase mutants compared with the WT protein can be conveniently defined by thermal unfolding methods. Thermal analysis curves of WT SNase (solid line) and the E73G (dashed line) and D77G (dotted line) mutants are shown in Fig.3 A. A summary of the DSC results for these proteins, including T m, ΔH cal, and percentage loss of stability, is presented in Table II. The calculated enthalpic changes (ΔH cal) are 84.1 ± 6.2, 65.6 ± 3.2, and 62.1 ± 2.5 kcal/mol for WT, E73G, and D77G, respectively. Therefore, the E73G mutant has lost 22.1% of protein stability, and the D77G mutant has lost 26.2%. TheT m values for WT, E73G, and D77G are 52.0 ± 0.6, 36.8 ± 0.2 and 43.9 ± 0.4 °C, respectively. The E75G mutant has the highest loss of stability (49.3%) compared with the WT protein. The E57G mutant retains the most stability, with only a 5.8% loss (19Loll P.J. Lattman E.E. Proteins. 1989; 5: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). E73G and D77G have intermediate stability losses of 22.1 and 26.2%, respectively. The thermal unfolding (ΔH cal) of the proteins as a function of Gdn-HCl concentration is shown in Fig. 3 B. The midpoint transitions (the concentration of Gdn-HCl at half-maximum of ΔH cal between the native and unfolded states of proteins) are 0.52, 0.27, and 0.31 m for WT, E73G, and D77G, respectively. Thus, the resistance to Gdn-HCl unfolding is greater for the WT protein than for the mutants.Table IIAnalysis of thermal unfolding of WT protein and E73G, D77G, E75G, and E57G mutantsParameterWTE73GD77GE75G2-aData from previous report (24).E57G2-aData from previous report (24).T m (°C)52.0 ± 0.636.8 ± 0.243.9 ± 0.435.9 ± 1.049.3 ± 0.6ΔH cal (kcal/mol)84.1 ± 6.265.6 ± 3.262.1 ± 2.542.7 ± 5.579.3 ± 7.1Loss (%)2-bLoss percentage is calculated by ((ΔH cal,WT − ΔH cal,mutant)/ΔH cal,WT) × 100.022.126.249.35.82-a Data from previous report (24Chen H.M.

Open table in a new tab The t test value (5 degrees of freedom) for ΔH cal (Table II) between E73G and D77G is 3.5 (>95% probability). For the t test of the differences between mutant and WT proteins, the values are all greater than 95% probability except for E57G, which shows no significant difference in stability compared with the WT protein. To further evaluate the effects of mutations of the charged residues Glu73, Glu75, and Asp77 on protein conformation and on stability, we generated the double point mutants E73G/E75G, E75G/D77G, and E73G/D77G and the triple point mutant, E73G/E75G/D77G. Fig.4 A shows their fluorescence emission spectra. The relative fluorescence intensity is WT ≫ E73G/D77G > E75G/D77G ≫ E73G/E75G > E73G/E75G/D77G. Increases in the peak emission wavelengths are observed for the E73G/E75G and E73G/E75G/D77G mutants, which also demonstrate low fluorescence intensity. This is especially true for the triple point mutant, where the fluorescence intensity is close to that of the denatured state (compare Fig. 4 A with Fig. 2 A). This indicates that the E73G/E75G and E73G/E75G/D77G mutants have very little tertiary conformation. A ladder of CD spectra is observed for these proteins (Fig. 4 B). The strength of CD222 nm is WT ≫ E73G/D77G > E75G/D77G ≫ E73G/E75G > E73G/E75G/D77G. The triple point mutant, E73G/E75G/D77G, has the lowest degree of secondary structure among the mutants. The pronounced change in secondary structure observed for the double/triple point mutants is not observed for the single point mutants (compare Fig. 4 B with Fig. 2 B). Thermal analysis curves for the double and triple mutants are shown in Fig. 4 C. The DSC curves for the double and triple mutants are shifted to lower temperatures relative to the DSC curve of the WT protein. Table III summarizes the thermal unfolding parameters for the mutant proteins. The E73G/E75G/D77G mutant has the lowest T m, 25.1 ± 0.5 °C. The ΔH cal values for protein unfolding are 84.2 ± 6.2, 45.0 ± 3.6, 34.3 ± 4.2, 35.6 ± 2.7, and 29.4 ± 1.9 kcal/mol for WT SNase and the E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, E75G/D77G, and E73G/E75G/D77G mutants, respectively. The E73G/E75G/D77G mutant demonstrates a 65% loss of stability compared with the WT protein. The other three double point mutants have stability losses of 46–60%. The t test values (5 degrees of freedom) for ΔH cal (Table III) between mutants and WT are all better than 95% probability.Table IIIAnalysis of thermal unfolding of WT protein and E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, E75G/D77G, and E73G/E75G/D77G mutantsParameterWTE73G/D77GE73G/E75GE75G/D77GE73G/E75G/D77GT m (°C)52.0 ± 0.630.0 ± 0.427.5 ± 0.232.0 ± 0.225.1 ± 0.5ΔC p (kcal/degrees·mol)2.2 ± 0.2−0.7 ± 0.1−0.8 ± 0.1−1.2 ± 0.1−1.3 ± 0.1ΔH cal(kcal/mol)84.1 ± 6.245.0 ± 3.634.3 ± 4.235.6 ± 2.729.4 ± 1.5Loss (%)3-aLoss percentage is calculated by ((ΔH cal,WT − ΔH cal,mutant)/ΔH cal,WT) × 100.046.659.357.765.03-a Loss percentage is calculated by ((ΔH cal,WT − ΔH cal,mutant)/ΔH cal,WT) × 100. Open table in a new tab The most sensitive position among single point mutations in the local area is at position 75 for Glu, which contributes to the loss in thermal stability of about 49.3%. The x-ray diffraction structure of the E75G mutant was therefore investigated. The final model structure of E75G consists of residues 7–141, Ca2+, pdTp, and 206 water molecules. The overall folding of the E75G mutant (Fig. 1) shows good geometry with r.m.s. deviations in bonds, angles, dihedral angles, and improper angles (data not shown) similar to those of wild type protein. The r.m.s. deviations for superimposition of Cα atoms or for all equivalent atoms between the structures of mutant and wild type proteins are small (0.15 and 0.69 Å, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2154402610,"Translational regulation plays an important role in development. In terminally differentiating cells a decrease in translation rate is common, although the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. We utilized 32Dcl3 myeloblast cells to investigate translational regulation during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced differentiation. G-CSF causes a significant decrease in translation rate compared with interleukin-3, which is a mitogen for these cells. Although these two cytokines exhibit modest differences in their effect on translation factor phosphorylation, they exhibit dramatic differences in their effect on ribosomal abundance and ribosomal DNA transcription. However, because both cytokines stimulate cell cycling, G-CSF induces a dissociation of ribosomal biogenesis from cell cycle progression. This uncoupling of ribosomal biogenesis from cell cycle progression appears to be closely related to the transmission of a differentiation signal, because it is not observed in cells expressing a carboxyl-terminally truncated G-CSF receptor, which supports proliferation but not differentiation of these cells. Because a similar event occurs early in differentiation of murine erythroleukemic cells, this suggests that ribosomal content is a common target of differentiating agents.

In terminally differentiating cells a decrease in translation rate is also common, occurring in species ranging from Dictylostelium (4Palatnik C. Wilkins C. Jacobson A. Cell. 1984; 36: 1017-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to humans (5Krichevsky A. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In murine erythroleukemic (MEL)1cells a decrease in translation is an effect of virtually every differentiation-inducing agent (6Sherton C. Kabat D. Dev.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that this change may play a role in the alterations in gene expression that occur during differentiation. Consistent with this possibility, in both MEL and HL-60 cells this translational change has selective effects upon individual mRNAs (5Krichevsky A. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Hensold J. Barth-Baus D. Stratton C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that regulate translation during terminal cell differentiation are largely unknown. In cells exposed to mitogens, translation is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of translation factors (9Hershey J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Regulation of m7GTP “cap” recognition is mediated by phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, as well as the eIF4E-binding protein, 4E-BP or PHAS (10Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Cap-dependent translation has been proposed to be important for the expression of mRNAs with stable secondary structure in their 5′-untranslated regions (10Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar), and a number of mRNAs whose translation have been demonstrated to be affected by eIF4E are involved in cell cycle progression (11Rosenwald I. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 12Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl.

Consistent with this, microinjection of eIF4E into quiescent cells stimulates their entry into S phase, and overexpression of this protein is transforming (14Smith M. Jaramilla M. Liu Y.-L. Dever T. Merrick W. Kung H.-F. Sonenberg N. New Biol. 1990; 2: 648-654PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K. Sonenberg N.

Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is also common following mitogenic exposure (18Fumagilli S. Thomas G. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). This has been proposed to enhance translation of mRNAs that contain a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (19Jefferies H. Reinhard C. Kozma S. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 20Terada N. Patel H. Takase K. Kohno K. Nairn A. Gelfand E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), of which ribosomal protein mRNAs are the primary example (21Meyuhas O. Hornstein E. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 671-693Google Scholar). Microinjection of antibodies to the S6 kinase, p70s6k, inhibits entry of cells into S phase (22Lane H. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), suggesting that S6 phosphorylation also plays a role in cell cycle progression. More recent data suggest that this kinase may also play a role in regulating cell size (23Montagne J. Stewart M.S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have provided evidence that translation in differentiating MEL cells utilizes distinct regulatory mechanisms from those employed during mitogenic signaling (8Hensold J. Barth-Baus D. Stratton C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these cells, inducers of differentiation cause a 50–70% decrease in translation rate in the face of constitutive phosphorylations of PHAS I and eIF4E. 2D. Barth-Baus, C. Stratton, L. Parrott, H. Myerson, O. Meyuhas, D. Templeton, G. Landreth, and J. O. Hensold, manuscript submitted., 3J. O. Hensold, R. Duncan, and J. W. Hershey, unpublished observations.Inducers also do not affect S6 phosphorylation, which is undetectable in MEL cells under normal growth conditions. We have recently provided evidence that S6 phosphorylation is suppressed in a lineage-specific manner in hematopoietic cells by an S6 phosphatase.2Although these results do not identify the specific mechanism(s) responsible for translational repression in differentiating cells, they do provide evidence that this is not mediated by the signaling pathways that regulate phosphorylation of PHAS I (phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTOR (mammalian target ofrapamycin)), eIF4E (the ERK and p38 kinases), or S6 (phosphoinositol 3-kinase, mTOR, and ERKs) (for review of this regulation see Refs. 18Fumagilli S. Thomas G. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar and 24Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). The myeloid cell line, 32Dcl3, provides a useful system for analyzing the signaling pathways required for differentiation. These cells grow continuously in IL-3 but differentiate into granulocytes over a time course of 1–2 weeks when grown in G-CSF (25Friedman A. Kreider B. Venturelli D. Rovera G. Blood. 1991; 78: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) responsible for the differential effect of these two cytokines is unknown. Several lines of evidence suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor is necessary for transducing a differentiation signal (26Fukunaga R. Ishizaki-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations that delete this region cause severe congenital neutropenia with a high frequency of conversion to acute myeloid leukemia (27Dong F. Byrnes R. Tidow N. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). When similar receptor mutants are expressed in hematopoietic cell lines, sustained activation occurs in response to G-CSF, presumably because of defective receptor internalization (28Hunter M. Avalos B. Blood. 1999; 93: 440-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hermans M. Antonissen C. Ward A. Mayen A. Ploemacher R. Touw I. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, 32D cells expressing this truncated receptor do not differentiate but proliferate indefinitely in response to G-CSF (30Ward A. Smith L. de Koning J. van Aesch Y. Touw I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14956-14962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal truncation of the G-CSF receptor also results in defective activation of STAT3 (31Ward A. Hermans M. Smith L. van Aesch Y. Schelen A. Antonissen C. Touw I. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transcription factor that appears to play a role in G-CSF-induced myeloid differentiation (32Shimozaki K. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these changes for differentiation is unclear. The experiments described in this manuscript have investigated the mechanisms of translational regulation in differentiating 32D cells. These results demonstrate that G-CSF and IL-3 have dramatically different effects on overall translation rate, although these agents exhibit only modest differences in their effect on phosphorylation of eIF4E, PHAS I, or rpS6. However, despite the fact that both IL-3 and G-CSF stimulate cell cycle progression, they exhibit substantial differences in their ability to stimulate ribosomal RNA synthesis, which is inhibited in G-CSF-exposed cells. This uncoupling of ribosomal biogenesis from cell cycling results in a decrease in cellular ribosomal content, which is evident as early as the first cell cycle of growth in G-CSF. Cells expressing a carboxyl-terminally truncated G-CSF receptor that supports 32D cell proliferation but not differentiation do not demonstrate this dissociation of ribosomal content from cell cycling in response to G-CSF. These data demonstrate that one function of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the G-CSF receptor is to suppress ribosomal biogenesis, and this appears closely related to cell maturation. Tissue culture supplies were from Life Sciences, Inc. except for fetal bovine serum, which was obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Human G-CSF was from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA), and murine IL-3 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cycloheximide was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher except for polyacrylamide and phenol, which were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Radioisotopes were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Technologies, and the enzymes for molecular biology were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Membranes for Northern blotting of RNA were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell (Keene, NH) and for Western blotting from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The 32Dcl3 cell line was obtained from Alan Friedman (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) and grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated 55 °C for 30 min) and IL-3 (1 ng/ml). Granulocytic differentiation was induced by growth in similar medium containing G-CSF (100 ng/ml) and lacking IL-3, as previously described (25Friedman A. Kreider B. Venturelli D. Rovera G. Blood. 1991; 78: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variant 32D clones that do not express endogenous G-CSF receptor but express recombinant wild-type or carboxyl-terminal truncated (Δ715) G-CSF receptor cDNA were obtained from Ivo Touw (30Ward A. Smith L. de Koning J. van Aesch Y. Touw I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14956-14962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and IL-3 or grown in the presence of G-CSF, as described above. Two different protocols were used to determine the leucine incorporation rate in 32Dcl3 cells, as indicated in the text. Cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in prewarmed medium containing either G-CSF or IL-3. At the times indicated, cell counts were obtained, [3H]leucine (100 μCi/ml) was added to the cultures, and incubations continued for an additional 15 min. Amino acid incorporation was terminated by three washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells lysed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. tRNAs were deacylated by 15 min of incubation at 90 °C, and following an additional 30 min incubation on ice, the acid-insoluble material was collected by vacuum filtration onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. Retained radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS 7800 liquid scintillation counter. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were standardized for cell number. Because in the previous experiments pelleting and washing the cells was noted to cause a transient slowing of translation rate, to examine the early effects G-CSF and IL-3 on translation rate, cells were deprived of cytokines for 12 h and then added at the concentrations indicated above. At 0, 2, 4, and 8 h of exposure [3H]leucine incorporation was determined as described above. The effect of cycloheximide on translation rate was determined 24 h after its addition to normal growth medium (containing IL-3). A concentration of 50 ng/ml was determined to decrease translation rate by 54% (19,831 ± 1,269 cpm [3H]leucine incorporation in cells exposed to IL-3 versus 9,154 ± 717 cpm [3H]leucine incorporation in cells exposed to IL-3 plus cycloheximide). RNA was extracted from the 32D cells by the guanidinium-acid phenol method and recovered by isopropanol precipitation (33Chomcyznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were separated by electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by capillary blotting. Blotted RNA was hybridized at 65 °C in 5× SSPE (0.9 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.7) with a cDNA encoding myeloperoxidase (34Iwama A. Zhang P. Darlington G. McKercher S. Maki R.

The blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60 °C, developed by autoradiography, and quantified by PhosphorImager. For analysis of cellular 18 S rRNA content, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter, and equal numbers of cells were resuspended in equal volumes of lysis buffer and RNA extracted and recovered as described above. During extraction care was taken to ensure recovery of equal volumes throughout all steps. The RNA pellets were resuspended in equal volumes of running buffer, and equal volumes were loaded onto gels for Northern blotting. Because of the abundance of rRNA species, loads on these gels were reduced to 110 of that loaded on standard Northern blots to avoid local saturation of the membrane. Blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled fragment of 18 S rDNA (36Wilson G. Hollar B. Waterson J. Schmekel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5367-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), washed, visualized, and quantified as described above. PHAS I phosphorylation was assessed by gel shift and immunoblotting, as previously described (37Lin T. Kong X. Saltiel A. Blackshear P. Lawrence J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) using antisera obtained from John Lawrence (University of Virginia). Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were separated in 12.5% polyacrylamide Laemmli gels. Phosphorylation of eIF4E was assessed by immunoblotting, using Ser211 phospho-specific antibodies obtained from Simon Morley (University of Sussex, Brighton, UK). Total eIF4E was determined by immunoblotting using eIF4E monoclonal antibodies obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was assessed by immunoblotting. Cell extracts were prepared as above and separated in 12% polyacrylamide Laemmli gels. The Ser51 phosphorylated form of eIF2 α was detected by phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), and the total eIF2 was detected by monoclonal antibody (38Scorsone K. Panniers R. Rowlands A. Henshaw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the results were quantified by densitometry, using the NIH Image program. Nuclear run-off assays were performed as previously described (39Hensold J. Stratton C. Barth D. Galson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3385-3391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly 3 × 107 cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, on ice. Lysates were centrifuged (500 × g), and the nuclei were resuspended in 2× nuclear resuspension buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 40% glycerol). Run-off reactions were performed for 45 min at room temperature in reaction buffer (final concentrations, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP each, and 250 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and the entirety of the recovered RNA was hybridized to DNA immobilized on a 0.45-μm Nytran membrane. Hybridization was performed in Church buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 65 °C for 48 h. Blots were washed to final stringency of 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 °C and treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC for 30 min, developed by autoradiography, and quantified by PhosphorImager. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Primer extension analysis of rDNA transcription rate was performed as described by Alzuherri and White (40Alzuherri H. White J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4328-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were synchronized and treated with IL-3 or G-CSF, equal numbers of cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium-acid phenol method. Equal volumes of RNA were hybridized to 500,000 cpm of a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled primer complementary to the 5′ end of the 45S rRNA precursor rRNA (primer 5′-CAGGCACCGCGACAGACCCAAG-3′, complementary to +100 to +122 of the mouse rDNA gene). Following hybridization for 24 h (40 mm PIPES, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50% formamide) at 42 °C, the RNA and hybridized primer were precipitated with two volumes of ethanol and resuspended in buffer for reverse transcription (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcriptions were performed using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The extended products were precipitated in ethanol, resuspended in sample buffer containing 90% formamide, and separated on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. The extended products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager. Cytosolic extracts and gradients were prepared as previously described (8Hensold J. Barth-Baus D. Stratton C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The extracts were layered onto 10–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 4 h at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor. Fractions were collected with an ISCO 640 gradient fractionator with continuous monitoring at 254 nm by an ISCO UA5 absorbance detector at a sensitivity of 0.5 absorption units full-scale using a 5-mm path length flow cell. The cells were incubated for 12 h without cytokines and separated into two equal aliquots, and either IL-3 or G-CSF was added at the concentration indicated above. At the times indicated, the cells were prepared for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content by fluorescence intensity of propidium as described by Schimenti and Jacobberger (41Schimenti K. Jacobberger J. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed on a Coulter Elite ESP. Excitation was with a 488-nm air-cooled argon ion laser at 15 mW, and propidium signal was collected using a 640-nm long pass optical filter. The percentage of distribution of cells in the cycle phases was determined using the ModFit DNA analysis program. 32D cells were synchronized by growth in the absence of cytokines for 12 h. Equal cell aliquots were then treated with either IL-3 or G-CSF for 24 h. 1.5 × 107 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by incubating for 15 min on ice. CDK2-cyclin A complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin A antiserum (Santa Cruz, 1:200 dilution) or with preimmune rabbit serum for control. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 3 h at 4 °C with protein A-coupled agarose beads added for the final 2 h of incubation. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in RIPA buffer, suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 μg of histone H1) and incubated 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by heating in Laemmli sample buffer (95 °C for 10 min). The recovered proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide Laemmli gel. The gel was dried, and the labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The band intensities were quantified using a PhosphorImager system. 1 × 107 32D cells were suspended in 1 ml of normal growth medium and the pGL-3 bicistronic luciferase plasmid (15 μg) and introduced by electroporation (1600 microfarad capacitance and 250 V). The pGL-3 vector expresses both Renilla luciferase, translated in a cap-dependent manner, and firefly luciferase translated from a cap-independent internal ribosomal entry sequence located in the intercistronic space. The electroporated cells were allowed to recover overnight in normal growth medium. At time 0, the cells were washed and transferred into medium containing either IL-3 or G-CSF. After the indicated times cells were collected and analyzed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities according to a dual luciferase reporter assay system protocol (Promega). Inducers of MEL cell differentiation cause a rapid decrease in translation rate that precedes differentiation (6Sherton C. Kabat D. Dev. Biol. 1976; 48: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Bilello J. Kuhne J. Warnecke G. Koch G. In Vivo and in Vitro Erythropoiesis: The Friend System. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1980: 229-238Google Scholar, 8Hensold J. Barth-Baus D. Stratton C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The timing of this effect suggests that translational regulation might play a role in the changes in gene expression that are necessary for differentiation. To determine whether a similar effect occurred during G-CSF induced myeloid differentiation, as well as to facilitate investigation of the signaling pathways affected, growth factor-dependent 32D cells were utilized. These cells grow indefinitely as undifferentiated myeloblasts in IL-3 but in G-CSF mature into granulocytes over a time course of 7–14 days (25Friedman A. Kreider B. Venturelli D. Rovera G. Blood. 1991; 78: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether G-CSF and IL-3 had differing effects on translation rate, cells that had been maintained in IL-3 were washed, divided into two equal aliquots, and grown in the presence of either G-CSF or IL-3 for the times indicated. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, a difference in rate of leucine incorporation, which ranged from 1.6- to 2.6-fold, was observed at all times examined. The decreased translation rate in the cells grown in G-CSF was not due to a lower effective concentration of G-CSF, because this dose induced granulocytic differentiation with normal kinetics, as assessed by expression of myeloperoxidase mRNA (Fig. 1B). The preceding results demonstrate that translation rate decreases when 32D cells are switched from medium containing IL-3 to G-CSF. However, both the IL-3 and G-CSF receptors activate the phosphoinositol 3-kinase and ERK signaling pathways (42Hunter M. Avalos B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4979-4987PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rausch O. Marshall C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and these pathways generally increase translation initiation rate (44Raught B. Gingras A-C. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). In addition, it was difficult to assess the time of onset of this translational effect in the previous experiment because pelleting and washing the cells caused a transient reduction in translation rate. Therefore, to determine whether G-CSF stimulated translation, as well as to determine the earliest time where translation rate diverged in cells grown in IL-3 and G-CSF, the cells were grown overnight in medium lacking cytokines, and the translation rate was assessed following re-exposure to either IL-3 or G-CSF. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, translation rate was stimulated 2.2-fold by 4 h in cells exposed to both G-CSF and IL-3, demonstrating that both cytokines activate translation in 32D cells. However, by 8 h the translation rate of cells in these two cytokines diverged and was 2-fold less in cells grown in G-CSF as compared to IL-3. To determine how the differential effect of these two cytokines on the translational apparatus was regulated, the phosphorylation of translational proteins was examined. Growth factors commonly regulate translation via phosphorylations of eIF4E, PHAS I, and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) (10Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

https://openalex.org/W2134013614,"Transcription factor-induced conformational changes in DNA are one of the mechanisms of transcription activation. C protein of bacteriophage Mu appears to transactivate the mom gene of the phage by this mode. DNA binding by C to its site leads to torsional changes that seem to compensate for a weak momP1 promoter having a suboptimal spacing of 19 bp between the poor -35 and -10 elements. The C-mediated unwinding could realign the promoter elements for RNA polymerase recruitment to the reoriented promoter. In this study, the model has been tested by mutational analysis of the spacer region of momP1 and by assessing the strength of the mutant promoters. The response to C-mediated transactivation was dependent on the spacer length of the promoters. Mutants with 17-bp spacing between the two promoter elements showed reduced activity in the presence of the transactivator as compared with their basal level. A synthetic promoter with near consensus promoter elements and optimal 17-bp spacing was also tested to evaluate the model. The results imply a role for C-mediated unwinding in mom transcription activation."
