We have focused our study on the effects of this compound on T cell receptor-induced T cell activation, a process dependent on the activity of the Src kinases Lck and FynT. This compound is a nanomolar inhibitor of Lck and FynT, inhibits anti-CD3-induced protein-tyrosine kinase activity in T cells, demonstrates selectivity for Lck and FynT over ZAP-70, and preferentially inhibits T cell receptor-dependent anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation over non-T cell receptor-dependent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced T cell proliferation. Interestingly, this compound selectively inhibits the induction of the IL-2 gene, but not the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or IL-2 receptor genes. This compound offers a useful new tool for examining the role of the Lck and FynT tyrosine kinases versus ZAP-70 in T cell activation as well as the role of other Src family kinases in receptor function.

Here, we describe and utilize a novel, potent, and Src family-selective small molecule inhibitor to further study the role of these kinases in T cell activation.The lck gene, which encodes a lymphocyte-specific, membrane-associated protein-tyrosine kinase of the nonreceptor type(1Perlmutter R.M.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that directs its specific interaction with the cytoplasmic domains of the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins(6Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H.

Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). This interaction is required for antigen-specific responses of several different T cell hybridomas(11Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 12Zamoyska R. Derham P. Gorman S.D. von Hoegen P. Bolen J.B. Veillette A. Parnes J.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Lck has also been reported to associate with the IL-2R β-chain via a distinct interaction(13Hatakeyama M.T. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), although its role in IL-2R function remains unclear. Several reports have demonstrated that Lck plays an important role in both T cell maturation and activation. Loss of Lck expression in the human Jurkat T cell line abrogates its response to anti-TcR antibodies(14Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), and inactivation of the lck gene or overexpression of a dominant negative lck transgene in mice leads to an arrest of thymocyte development at a stage prior to the expression of CD4, CD8. and TcR(15Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.U. Veillette A. Davidson D. Mak T.W.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1671-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Whereas the role of Lck in T cell development and function is well established, the role of Fyn is less well defined. Small amounts of Fyn are found associated with the TcR complex following mild detergent extraction of T lymphocytes(17Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4358-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of T cells through the TcR results in increased enzymatic activity of Fyn(18Tsygankov A.Y. Broker B.M. Fargnoli J. Ledbetter J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18259-18262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence that Fyn is involved in lymphocyte activation comes from experiments in transgenic animals. Twenty-fold overexpression of FynT in transgenic thymocytes results in enhanced responsiveness to anti-CD3 antibody as measured by the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cells, Ca2+ accumulation, and proliferation(19Cooke M.P. Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of FynT in the thymocytes of transgenic mice substantially inhibited TcR-mediated T cell activation(19Cooke M.P. Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Finally, gene-knockout mice that lack either p59fynT or p59fynB demonstrate defects in TcR/CD3- or alloantigen-mediated signaling(20Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 751-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 21Stein P.L. Lee H.M. Rich S. Soriano P. Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fyn plays a role in TcR-mediated signaling in vivo.Here, we show that unlike previously described protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PP1 inhibits Lck and FynT in vitro at concentrations significantly lower than those required to inhibit ZAP-70, JAK2, the EGF-R kinase, and protein kinase A. It inhibits whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation and proliferation in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and mitogens. Finally, it selectively inhibits IL-2 gene expression over GM-CSF and IL-2R gene induction in human T cells. Thus, this compound appears to dissect a component of TcR signaling not distinguished by other inhibitors of TcR signaling such as FK506. This compound is a powerful new tool to study the role of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases in lymphocyte function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture ConditionsHuman peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained from healthy donors by gradient separation of whole blood using Histopaque (22Gmetig-Meyling F.A. Waldman T.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-CD3-induced proliferation experiments were carried out using 1 × 105 PBL cells/well in 96-well assay plates (Costar Corp.) that were precoated with 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse antiserum (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, MA) in PBS for 4 h. PBL were treated with varying concentrations of compound and either anti-CD3 (50 ng/ml; Becton Dickinson) or PMA (10 ng/ml; Sigma) plus PHA (2 μg/ml; Wellcome). Proliferation was assessed by the addition of 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN) at 48 h, followed by harvesting the cells at 72 h using a Skatron harvester. Results are reported as an average IC50, determined from a plot of the percent inhibition of proliferation from media control, derived from separate experiments run in triplicate (see Table 2). Influenza-induced T cell proliferation (see Table 2, Ag-Sp (which represents specific antigen)) was assessed by combining 1 × 105 PBL in triplicate with 160 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with 20 μl of either diluted test compound or media alone in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar Corp.). Antigen (influenza virus vaccine Fluzone, Connaught Laboratories) was prepared by centrifuging and washing (three times) 2 ml of vaccine through a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.) to remove preservative and diluting the remaining material to 40 ml (1:20). Twenty microliters of antigen was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. [3H]Thymidine was then added (0.5 μCi/well), and the plates were incubated for an additional 18 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested with a 96-well harvester (Tomtec), and the amount of incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined using a Pharmacia Biotech β-plate counter. Concentrations that cause 50% inhibition of proliferation (IC50) were determined from a plot of the percent inhibition of proliferation from media control versus concentration of test compound added. Results are presented as the mean IC50 from repeated experiments (see Table 2). T cell proliferation in the one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction was assessed by combining in triplicate 5 × 104 fresh PBL, 5 × 104 irradiated (5000 rads) pooled stimulator PBL, and diluted test compound in RPMI 1640 medium in each well of a 96-well assay plate. After 18 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h. The cells were then harvested using a Pharmacia Biotech β-plate system. Percent inhibition was determined by the following equation: % inhibition = 1 - (mean cpm of drug-treated cells/mean cpm of control stimulated cells) × 100. IC50 values represent the concentration of drug that caused 50% inhibition of the control response. Results are presented as the mean IC50 from repeated triplicate experiments (see Table 2). Purified human T cells, used in the whole cell phosphotyrosine analyses, were isolated by the T-Kwik method (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA). T cell purity, as determined by flow cytometric analysis, was generally >90% CD3+ T cells, with the major contaminant being CD16+ cells (natural killer cells). Jurkat T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Immune Complex Enzyme AssaysThe enolase substrate (Sigma) used for measuring Lck and FynT catalytic activity (see Fig. 2 and Table 1) was prepared as described(23Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acid-treated enolase was diluted 1:20 with 1 × PBS before aliquoting 100 μl/well into a Nunc 96-well high protein binding assay plate. Assay wells were then aspirated; blocked with 0.5% bovine serum, 1 × PBS for 1 h at 37°C; and then washed five times with 300 μl of 1 × PBS/well. The source of Lck was either LSTRA cells or Lck expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia expression system(8Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). FynT (a gift of R. Perlmutter, University of Washington, Seattle) was expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia system(24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar, 25Gauen L.K. Zhu Y. Letourneur F. Hu Q. Bolen J.B. Matis L.A. Klausner R.D. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3729-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells (12.5 × 106/ml) were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 23 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 cpm for 15 min at 4°C in an Eppendorf tube. The Lck antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide containing residues 41-54 of the N-terminal domain of Lck. The anti-Fyn antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The clarified lysates were then incubated with the appropriate anti-kinase antibody at 10 μg/ml for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; prepared as a 50% (w/v) suspension) were added to the antibody/lysate mixture at 250 μl/ml and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were then washed twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice in 1 ml of kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES, 3 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM sodium orthovanadate) and resuspended to 50% (w/v) in kinase buffer. Twenty-five microliters of the bead suspension was added to each well of the enolase-coated 96-well high protein binding plate together with an appropriate concentration of compound and [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN; 25 μl/well of a 200 μCi/ml solution in kinase buffer). After incubation for 20 min at 20°C, 60 μl of boiling 2 × solubilization buffer (26Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10 mM ATP was added to the assay wells to terminate the reactions. Thirty microliters of the samples was removed from the wells, boiled for 5 min, and run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were subsequently dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film (see Fig. 2A). For quantitation, films were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics laser scanner, and the optical density of the major substrate band, enolase p46, was determined. Concentrations of compound that caused 50% inhibition of enolase phosphorylation (IC50) were determined from a plot of the density versus concentration of compound (see Fig. 2B). In companion experiments for measuring the activity of compounds against Lck (see Fig. 2C), the assay plate was washed with two wash cycles on a Skatron harvester using 50 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP. Scintillation fluid (100 μl) was then added to the wells, and 32P incorporation was measured using a Pharmacia Biotech micro-β-counter. Concentrations of compound that caused 50% inhibition of enzyme activity (IC50) were determined from a plot of the percent inhibition of enzyme activity versus concentration of compound. Since there was good correlation between the gel and plate assays, subsequent repeat experiments for both Lck and FynT were performed using scintillation counting (see Table 1). EGF-R activity was measured by immunoprecipitation of EGF-R from A-431 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell lysates were prepared by adding 4 ml of lysis buffer to a T-75 flask that contained a confluent layer of cells. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation as described above and then incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-EGF-R (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the antibody/lysate mixture at 250 μl/ml and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were then washed twice in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer and twice in 1.0 ml of kinase buffer (as described above) and finally resuspended to 50% (w/v) in kinase buffer. To each 1.5-ml assay tube was aliquoted 50 μl of bead suspension, which was then spun for 15 s at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was discarded. To the bead pellet was then added 5 μl of the appropriate compound dilution, 5 μl of EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to a final concentration of 100 pM, and 5 μl of a 33 μCi [γ-32P]ATP/ml solution in kinase buffer. After incubation for 20 min at 20°C, the beads were washed once with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer and once with 1.0 ml of 1 × PBS. To the bead pellet was added 60 μl of boiling 2 × solubilization buffer (26Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10 mM ATP. Samples were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and exposed using BAS-III imaging plates. Labeled EGF-R protein bands were visualized, and 32P incorporation was quantitated using the BAS-2000 BioImaging analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems USA, Stamford, CT). Concentrations of compound that caused 50% inhibition of enzyme activity (IC50) were determined from a plot of the percent inhibition of enzyme activity by different concentrations of compound. Murine JAK2 was produced in baculovirus and supplied as an immune complex bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). JAK2 beads (2.5 μl) were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.25 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed, and JAK2 autophosphorylation was measured by eluting the labeled proteins into SDS-PAGE buffer and was analyzed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Bands corresponding to JAK2 were quantitated using the Fuji BAS-1000 phosphoimager. IC50 values were determined as described above. Full-length ZAP-70 kinase (27Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 28Chan A.C. van Oers N.S.C. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.-L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J.

Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Lysates from Sf9 cells infected 48 h previously with a human ZAP-70 recombinant virus were prepared as described above for Lck, and a 1:100 dilution was used in a soluble kinase assay. Briefly, kinase activity was quantitated by measuring the incorporation of γ-32P into the substrate p62(31Richard S. Yu D. Blumer K. Hausladen D. Olszowy M. Connelly P. Shaw A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using SDS-PAGE to resolve phosphorylated p62 and a phosphoimager to quantitate radioactivity. ZAP-70-specific activity was assessed by subtracting p62 phosphorylation obtained using Sf9 cell lysates infected with nonrecombinant baculovirus. IC50 values were determined as described above.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Whole Cell Phosphotyrosine MeasurementsInhibition of anti-CD3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in purified human peripheral blood T cells was measured as follows. All incubations were carried out at 37°C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer 5436 at a mixing setting of 11. Cells (1 × 106 in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium) were incubated for 15 min with drug prior to a 6-min incubation with 1 μg of anti-CD3/ml (anti-leu4, 100 μg/ml; Becton Dickinson). The final volume of the reaction was 115 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 57.5 μl of 3 × solubilization buffer (26Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar) incubated at 100°C prior to its addition. Samples were mixed, boiled for 5 min, and stored at −70°C. Western blots of these cell lysates, run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, were probed with a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and immune complexes were detected with 125I-labeled protein A (ICN) (26Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation, films were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics laser scanner, and the optical densities of the major substrate band, p70, were quantitated in the presence of anti-CD3 (in the presence and absence of drug). Percent inhibition was calculated as follows: (1 - (p70 optical density units in presence of drug/p70 units in absence of drug)) × 100. IC50 equals the concentration of compound at which 50% inhibition was measured.cDNA ProbesPlasmid DNAs were prepared as described (32Hanke J.H. Nichols L.N. Coon M.E. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA inserts were isolated by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, electroelution, and passage over a G-50 spin column(33Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The cDNA probes were labeled using a DNA labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The human cDNAs for IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-2Rα, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.Northern BlotsTotal RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 fresh isolated human PBL using acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform(34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156Crossref PubMed Scopus (62993) Google Scholar). Ten to fifteen micrograms of total RNA/lane was electrophoresed on a 6% formaldehyde, 1.5% agarose gel in buffer containing 5 mM NaHPO4, pH 4.45, 15 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.85, and 1.5% formaldehyde. The RNA was capillary-blotted to GeneScreen (DuPont NEN) and UV-cross-linked using a UV Stratalinker 8000. The immobilized RNA was hybridized to probe DNA (4 × 105 dpm/ml) in 50% deionized formamide, 1% SDS, 1 M NaCl, and 10% dextran sulfate. The blots were incubated, with agitation, overnight at 42°C. The blots were subsequently washed with constant agitation, twice in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate) for 5 min at room temperature, twice for 30 min in 2 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 60°C, and then twice for 30 min each in 0.1 × SSC at room temperature prior to autoradiography. For each probe, a single blot was stripped and hybridized to cDNA probes specific for each mRNA.Promoter-Reporter Plasmid TransfectionsThe promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed as described previously(32Hanke J.H. Nichols L.N. Coon M.E. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the promoters from the human IL-2 (positions −327 to +51) and IL-2Rα (positions −479 to +109) genes were cloned into pUC13 upstream of the firefly luciferase gene and SV40 polyadenylation signal. The human Jurkat T cell line was transfected as described previously, and luminescence was measured using a Dynatech ML1000 Luminometer. All experiments were run in triplicate, and the data are presented as mean light units. Standard deviations greater than 0.1 are shown.RESULTSSelective Inhibition of Src Family Kinases in VitroThe pyrazolopyrimidine PP1 (Fig. 1) was synthesized as one of a series of compounds used for inhibition of p56lck and p60c-src, based on a parent compound first discovered in tyrosine kinase inhibitor screens. When PP1 was first examined in vitro for its ability to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of enolase by p56lck, it was found to be a potent inhibitor of this enzyme (Fig. 2). p56lck isolated from LSTRA was incubated with enolase and various concentrations of PP1 in a 96-well plate. Solubilization buffer was then added, and the reactions were run out on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 2A, PP1 inhibited phosphorylation of the 46-kDa enolase protein in a dose-dependent manner. The 46-kDa enolase band was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics laser scanner, and the IC50 for inhibition of enolase was ~5 nM (Fig. 2B). Duplicate reactions were run in triplicate in the 96-well plate in the presence of various concentrations of PP1 and quantitated using a Pharmacia Biotech micro-β-plate reader (Fig. 2C). The IC50 for inhibition of Lck in these duplicate reactions using the plate reader was 20 nM. A repeat experiment comparing the gel assay with the plate reader yielded IC50 determinations of 8 and 4 nM, respectively (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using a peptide substrate containing the ITAM sequence derived from the human TcR ζ-chain (data not shown). Since the gel and plate assays provided similar results and the plate reader was more facile for quantitating enolase phosphorylation, subsequent repeat experiments were performed using the plate reader to obtain average IC50 values for inhibition of Lck and FynT. In three separate subsequent experiments, PP1 inhibited p56lck activity with an average IC50 of 5 nM (Table 1). Similar results were obtained with p56lck expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia virus expression system (data not shown)(8Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). The compound was also a potent inhibitor of a second lymphocyte Src family kinase, p59fynT (IC50 = 6 nM), expressed using the vaccinia system (Table 1). A closely related pyrazolopyrimidine, PP2 (Fig. 1), was similarly effective in the inhibition of Lck and FynT (Table 1). In further selectivity tests using other Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, PP1 also inhibited Src (170 nM) and Hck (20 nM), while PP2 demonstrated potent inhibition of Hck (5 nM) (data not shown). In contrast, PP1 and PP2 were both 50-100-fold less active in the inhibition of A-431 epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation (IC50 = 0.25 and 0.48 μM, respectively). Further specificity for inhibition of Lck and FynT was demonstrated when it was found that PP1 and PP2 were essentially inactive for inhibition of ZAP-70 and JAK2 (Table 1) and protein kinase A (data not shown). Since the activity of the ZAP-70 enzyme may be enhanced following phosphorylation at residue 493 by Lck(35Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we also examined whether inhibition of ZAP-70 by PP1 was altered when coexpressed in insect cells together with Lck as described previously (35Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although coexpression of ZAP-70 with the catalytic domain of Lck consistently led to a 3-4-fold elevation in the specific activity of ZAP-70 for the p62 substrate, PP1 was still unable to inhibit this enzyme up to concentrations of 100 μM (data not shown). For comparison purposes, we also examined the activity of staurosporine and genistein, two previously described tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The fermentation product, staurosporine, has previously been demonstrated to be a potent but nonselective protein kinase inhibitor(36Barret J.M. Ernould A.P. Ferry G. Genton A. Boutin J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Burke Jr., T.R. Drugs Future. 1992; 17: 119-131Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here (Table 1), staurosporine was found to be a nanomolar inhibitor of p56lck and p59fynT as well as a low micromolar inhibitor of the EGF-R kinase. However, unlike PP1 and PP2, it was also a potent inhibitor of the ZAP-70 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases. For further comparison, the naturally occurring isoflavone genistein (36Barret J.M. Ernould A.P. Ferry G. Genton A. Boutin J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to inhibit the four tyrosine kinases. As expected, it was the least potent inhibitor (Table 1). Thus, relative to other reported tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the novel compounds PP1 and PP2 demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of the Src family kinases, such as p56lck and p59fynT.Figure 1:Structures of PP1 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) and PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyri"

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells and therefore has a central role in physiological events of angiogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression on the other hand is elevated in tissues that undergo active angiogenesis but does not induce proliferation of endothelial cells. We demonstrate using Northern analysis that treatment of various cell lines with IL-6 for 6-48 h results in a significant induction of VEGF mRNA. The level of induction is comparable to the documented induction of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia or cobalt chloride, an activator of hypoxia-induced genes. In addition, it is demonstrated by transient transfection assays that the effect of IL-6 is mediated not only by DNA elements at the promoter region but also through specific motif(s) located in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of VEGF mRNA. Our results imply that IL-6 may induce angiogenesis indirectly by inducing VEGF expression. It is also shown that the 5′-UTR is important for the expression of VEGF. The 5′-UTR of VEGF is exceptionally long (1038 base pairs) and very rich in G + C. This suggests that secondary structures in the 5′-UTR might be essential for VEGF expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a multistep process in which many growth factors and cytokines have an essential role.

VEGF is a very potent angiogenic agent that acts as specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells through specific cell surface receptors. VEGF is encoded by a single gene, however, 4 isoforms of 206, 189, 165, and 121 amino acids long are produced as a result of alternative splicing(7Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc.

Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The 165-amino acid long isoform is the most abundant. However, no differences in the biological activities of these isoforms have been reported although differences in their receptor binding abilities and their capability to interact with the ECM were demonstrated(9Cohen T.

Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The promoter region of VEGF has been cloned, sequenced, and found to contain numerous putative binding sites for various transcription factors such as AP1, AP2, and SP1(11Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, VEGF contains a very long (1038 bp) 5′-UTR that was also noted in a related cytokine, Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and found to contain all the DNA binding motifs described above. This 5′-UTR is characterized by a high G + C content upstream to the translation initiation site which is also characteristic of 5′-UTRs corresponding to PDGF, placenta growth factor and TGF-β(12Maglione D.

VEGF expression was reported in normal tissues like lung, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, stomach, heart, and peritoneal macrophages and during normal physiological conditions such as cyclical corpus luteum formation, wound healing, and embryo development. Conversely, the expression of VEGF was also reported during abnormal physiological conditions such as tumor angiogenesis(2Schott R.J. Morrow L.A. Cardiovasc.

The expression of VEGF promotes the formation of new blood vessels in a regulated mechanism that is sensitive to hypoxia and is not completely characterized. Recently, it was demonstrated that physiological conditions such as hypoxia (or treatment with cobalt, that mimics hypoxia) can induce VEGF expression(20Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar, 21Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, induced expression of VEGF was also noted in cells treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TGF-β, PDGF-B, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate(22Li J. Perrella M.A. Tsai J.C. Yet S.F.

Yet, the molecular mechanism governing the expression of VEGF are not characterized and it is likely that other cytokines might promote the expression of VEGF as well. In this work, we have studied the effect of various cytokines on the expression of VEGF. We show that VEGF mRNA is induced by IL-6. This induction is also demonstrated by transient transfection assays in which the promoter region of VEGF including its exceptional 5′-UTR were connected to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). We show that DNA element(s) located upstream to the transcription initiation site mediate in part the response to the IL-6. In addition, we demonstrate that the induction of VEGF is also mediated through specific DNA element(s) located at the 5′-UTR of the gene. The data suggests that the 5′-UTR elements cooperate synergistically with DNA elements located upstream to the transcription initiation site. It is also shown that 5′UTR of VEGF has an important role in the expression of VEGF. Finally, we propose that IL-6 should be considered as an indirect inducer of angiogenesis that exerts its activity through the induction of VEGF. The cell line A431 was received from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The cell lines C6 and L8 were kindly obtained from Drs. E. Keshet (The Hebrew University, Israel) and S. Salzberg (Bar-Ilan University, Israel), respectively. The cell lines were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with gentamicin, glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum for A431 and C6 cells and 15% fetal calf serum for L8 cells. Cells were grown to 75% confluency and a typical set of experiments included untreated cells and cells treated with cytokines and cobalt at indicated times. R-IL-6 (80 ng/ml) was kindly obtained from Inter-Lab Ltd. (Ness-Ziona, Israel) through Drs. M. Revel and J. Chebath (Weizmann Institute, Israel) and from Dr. M. Rubinstein (Weizmann Institute, Israel). Human interferon-β (IFN-β, FroneR, 2500 IU/ml) was kindly obtained from Interpharm Laboratories LtD. (Rehovot, Israel), Tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) was a generous gift from Dr. D. Wallach (Weizmann Institute, Israel). Cobalt chloride (550 μM) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing Corp. (Gardena, CA). Following the incubation, the cells were harvested and RNA was prepared using Tri Reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Northern blot analyses were carried out as described previously(26Weisz A. Marx P. Sharf R. Appella E. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Levi B.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25589-25596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled VEGF and human interferon regulatory factor 1 probes were prepared as described previously(26Weisz A. Marx P.

Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), respectively. The blots were either exposed to x-ray film that were scanned and analyzed by Scanalytics densitometry system using RFLPscan computer analysis program (Billerica, MA) or analyzed by a Fuji PhosphorImager. The bacteriophage λ genomic clone (λ4), originally generated from human lung fibroblasts that contains the first two exons of VEGF and the 3.4-kb sequence upstream to the translation initiation site, was kindly obtained from Dr. J. Abraham (California Biotechnology Inc.)(11Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment from λ4 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC18 (pUC18-5.5). This recombinant pUC18 plasmid was digested with EcoRI and NarI and a 3.3-kb segment corresponding to DNA sequences 83 bp upstream to the first ATG codon of VEGF was cloned into the same restriction sites in pUC19 thus generating pUC19-3.3. This plasmid was digested with NarI and HindIII and the resulting fragment (3.3 kb) was cloned into the promoterless CAT construct pBLCAT3 (28Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) that was digested with AccI and HindIII, thus generating p3.4CAT▿NrX. To generate internal deletions p3.4CAT▿NrX was digested with NheI, thus removing 695 bp. The digested plasmid was self-ligated thus generating p3.4CAT▿Nhe. Similarly p3.4CAT▿NrX was digested with NheI and XhoI, thus deleting 989 bp upstream to the translation initiation site, that was then religated to itself following fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment generating the reporter plasmid p3.4CAT▿NX. All 3 CAT constructs were digested with PstI, self-ligated, and as a result a 1571-bp fragment was deleted from the 5′ region of each clone and the equivalent plasmid were termed p1.8CAT▿NrX, p1.8CAT▿Nhe, and p1.8CAT▿NX. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to construct CAT reporter plasmids that contain the missing 83 bp located 5′ to the first ATG codon. The 3′ primer corresponding to the first 15 bp located upstream to the first ATG to which a XhoI site was engineered (L-4, 5′-CATATGCTCGAGGGTTTCGGAGGCCCG-3′) was amplified with the 5′ primer corresponding to the native PstI site located −1829 bp upstream to the translation initiation site (L-3, 5′-TCACTTTGATGTCTGCAGGC-3′) using pUC18-5.5 as a template and the resultant 1829-bp fragment was digested with PstI and XhoI and was replaced with the corresponding fragment in plasmid p1.8CAT▿NrX generating p1.8CAT reporter plasmid. To generate a reporter plasmid that contains the available promoter region of VEGF and the 5′-UTR (from position −3400 up to +1), p3.4CAT▿NrX was digested with PstI and the resultant 1751-bp fragment was cloned into the PstI site of p1.8CAT generating p3.4CAT. The various CAT constructs are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4, A and B, and their features are described under “Results.” L8 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described before (29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of various plasmid DNA and 15 μg of pUC19 as carrier DNA. For IL-6 treatments, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h following transfection, and then treated with human IL-6 at indicated concentration and harvested 48 h later. For cobalt chloride treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline as above and cobalt chloride was added to a final concentration of 550 μM for 6 h from a 100-fold stock solution prepared in the growth medium. The cells were then washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested 42 h later. CAT assays were performed and normalized for protein concentration and transfection efficiencies as described previously(26Weisz A. Marx P. Sharf R. Appella E. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Levi B.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25589-25596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In principal, transfection efficiency was monitored by β-galactosidase activity driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeats that were cotransfected in each experiment. Each set of transfection experiments was repeated at least three times generating similar results. It is well documented that various cytokines have a role in biological processes such as: inflammation, wound healing, and tumor progression, in which angiogenesis takes part. To investigate if cytokines can affect angiogenesis by influencing the expression of VEGF mRNA, we have tested the effect of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β on the expression of VEGF in A431 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma) that constitutively express low levels of VEGF(30Myoken Y. Kayada Y. Okamoto T. Kan M. Sato G.H. Sato D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that exposures of A431 cells to IFN-β for 5 h and to TNF-α for 20 h resulted in induced VEGF mRNA levels. In addition, treatment of cells with IL-6 for 5 h resulted in a moderate induction of VEGF mRNA level that was further induced following 24 h of treatment. This elevated level was also apparent after 48 h of treatment (data not shown). As a positive control, the cells were treated for 5 h with cobalt, which mimics anaerobic conditions(21Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, a significant induction in VEGF mRNA was observed following cobalt treatment (Fig. 1). To show that the observed induction of VEGF is specific, the same membranes were also probed with labeled DNA fragment derived from interferon regulatory factor-1, a transcriptional activator that mediates interferon responsiveness. As expected(26Weisz A. Marx P. Sharf R. Appella E. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Levi B.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25589-25596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interferon regulatory factor-1 was induced mainly by IFN-β and to a lesser extent by IL-6 (Fig. 1). Treatment of cells with either TNF-α or cobalt had no effect on the expression of interferon regulatory factor-1. The lower panels show relative amounts of 28 S rRNA. It was demonstrated by Keshet and co-workers (32Motro B. Itin A. Sachs L. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that IL-6 is expressed during the angiogenesis that accompanies folliculogenesis of the maternal decidua and during early postimplantation development. Therefore, we have focused on the effect of IL-6 on VEGF expression. Since A431 cells are not very suitable for transfection, the ability of IL-6 to induce VEGF mRNA was tested in two rat-derived cell lines, L8 cells (skeletal muscle myoblasts) and C6 cells (Glioma cells) in which VEGF is hypoxia-inducible(20Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2 clearly demonstrate that VEGF mRNA expression in the two cell lines was augmented by both IL-6 and cobalt. Thus, the effect of IL-6 on VEGF expression is not limited to A431 cells. To examine the role of specific regulatory elements within the VEGF promoter region in mediating the response to IL-6 and cobalt, a genomic DNA segment was connected to the reporter gene CAT. This ~3.4-kb genomic fragment also contains the 5′-UTR up to the translation initiation site (see illustration of construct p3.4CAT in Fig. 4A, for details see “Materials and Methods”). A promoter region is defined as regulatory DNA sequences located upstream to the transcription initiation site. Since VEGF has an exceptionally lengthy 5′-UTR that also contains putative binding sites for various transcription factors it was included in the initial CAT construct (pCAT3.4). The reporter construct p3.4CAT was introduced into L8 cells and the cells were treated with increasing amounts of IL-6. A 3-fold increase in CAT activity was detected in cobalt treated cells (Fig. 3). A similar potentiation of CAT activity (3-fold) was also observed in L8 cells treated with 80 ng/ml IL-6 and to a lesser extent with 40 or 160 ng/ml as compared with the CAT activity of untreated cells (Fig. 3). Similar results were also obtained with C6 cells and U937 cells (human promonocytic cells) (data not shown). To determine which part of the promoter region of the 5′-UTR of VEGF confers responsiveness to either IL-6 or cobalt, a series of deletions were generated in the 3.4-kb segment. The various deletions made in the promoter region or in the 5′-UTR are illustrated in Fig. 4, A and B. Using available restriction sites, we have made three types of deletions in the 5′-UTR region. The first construct, p3.4CAT▿NrX, contains a 83-bp deletion of an NarI-XhoI fragment located upstream to the translation initiation site that is G + C-rich (83%). In the second construct (p3.4CAT▿Nhe), a 695-bp fragment confined by NheI restriction sites located in the 5′-UTR 49 bp downstream to the transcription initiation site was deleted. In the third construct, p3.4CAT▿NX, most of the 5′-UTR except for 49 bp adjacent to the transcription initiation site was removed (Fig. 4A). An EcoRI-PstI fragment (1571 bp) was deleted from all these CAT constructs thus leaving 791 bp upstream to the transcription initiation site (see 1.8CAT plasmids illustrated in Fig. 4B). All 8 constructs were transfected into L8 cells that were either treated with IL-6 (80 ng/ml) or cobalt or not treated. We first wanted to test the effect of the 5′-UTR on the promoter region. For that purpose, we have compared the CAT activity of the full-length construct, p3.4CAT, with that of the other 3.4-kb constructs containing deletions in that region. The results of these transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 4A. As expected, both IL-6 and cobalt promoted CAT activity of the full-length promoter that also contains 5′-UTR (construct p3.4CAT) as compared to CAT activity of untreated cells. However, in cells transfected with the construct p3.4CAT▿NX, in which most of the 5′-UTR was deleted (except for 49 bp downstream to transcription start site), no significant change in CAT activity in response to IL-6 or cobalt was detected. Interestingly, this construct (p3.4CAT▿NX) still contains “a classical promoter region” which is missing the 5′-UTR. However, the CAT activity derived by this construct in untreated cells was reduced by 50% when compared to that of cells transfected with the full-length construct. We have also studied the effect of shorter internal deletions in the 5′-UTR on the ability to promote CAT activity in response to IL-6 and cobalt. Deletion of only 83 bp in the 5′-UTR near the translation start site (p3.4CAT▿NrX) resulted in a significant reduction in CAT activity of the untreated transfected cells (at least by 30%) and in a weak response to IL-6, although the response to cobalt was still sustained. A reporter construct containing an internal deletion of 695 bp out of the 1038 bp of the 5′-UTR (p3.4CAT▿Nhe) was also tested. When introduced into the cells, the level of CAT activity as compared to the full-length construct was also reduced by 25% but no significant response to either cobalt or IL-6 was noted. These results imply that the 5′-UTR potentiates the expression of the VEGF promoter and that response elements to either IL-6 or cobalt may be located within that region. Fig. 4B shows the results of transient transfection experiments using the 1.8-kb group of CAT constructs which are similar to the 3.4-kb constructs except for a deletion of 1751 bp at the 5′ end of the available DNA sequence of the promoter region of VEGF (see illustrations in Fig. 4B). In general, the results of the 1.8-kb group resemble that of the 3.4-kb group except for the fact that the basal CAT activity and responses to IL-6 or cobalt were reduced by 25-50%. The 1.8CAT construct promoted response to both IL-6 and cobalt. However, in comparison to the 3.4CAT construct the extent of increased CAT activity was only 1.4-1.5-fold and not 3-3.5-fold as for the 3.4CAT construct. Similarly, deletion of 83 bp (p1.8CAT▿NrX) resulted in a modest response to cobalt treatment and a weak response to IL-6. The remaining constructs, p1.8CAT▿Nhe and p1.8CAT▿NX, promoted CAT activities in untreated transfected cells that were 4-fold lower as compared to that of cells transfected with the full-length 3.4-kb construct. No significant response to IL-6 was observed with these constructs and the response to cobalt was residual. These results indicate that the 1751-bp deleted segment contains DNA motifs that work cooperatively with DNA or RNA elements located at the 5′-UTR and confirm the fact that this region is essential for expression of VEGF. Formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, is mediated through the activation of parental vessels by specific inducers that either act directly or indirectly. VEGF is a direct angiogenic agent and its role in promoting angiogenesis during normal and abnormal physiological conditions is well documented(1Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (4384) Google Scholar). This suggests that its expression is subjected to complex regulatory mechanisms. Several stimulators of VEGF expression have been reported including hypoxia and cobalt chloride (20Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E.

IL-6 is a multi-functional cytokine that is produced by many cells and has pleiotropic effects. IL-6 acts on a wide range of tissues and cell lines and promotes cell growth and differentiation on the one hand and growth arrest on the other hand(36Van Snick J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 253-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sehgal P.B. Res. Immunol. 1992; 143: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that the in vivo expression of IL-6 accompanies vascularization in the reproductive tissues(32Motro B. Itin A. Sachs L. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-6 expression has been noted during wound healing and tumor growth(38Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 39Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. Albina J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1840-R1844PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that IL-6 may induce angiogenesis and may also induce motility of cells such as endothelial cells(32Motro B. Itin A. Sachs L. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 38Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol.

The Lancet. 1991; 337: 211-214Abstract PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We provide evidence indicating that IL-6 may promote angiogenesis through the induction of VEGF expression. This induced expression is mediated by specific DNA motifs located on the putative promoter region of VEGF as well as by specific elements located in the 5′-UTR. IL-6 exerts its biological effects through association with specific cell surface receptors resulting in the activation of specific transcription factors that interact with two types of cis-acting DNA control elements mediating IL-6 response. Type I elements have a consensus sequence agTgNNGYAA which serves as binding sites for NF-IL-6, and type II IL-6 response elements have a consensus sequence CTGGGA that binds IL-6-RE binding protein(41Akira S. Isshiki H. Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Natsuka S. Kishimoto T. Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 299-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Won K.-A. Baumann H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3965-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two type I response elements are located at DNA sequences flanking the translation initiation site of VEGF. The first is located between positions −796 and −804 (GTGCTGGAA) within the 5′-UTR and the second is located between positions −2313 and −2320 (TGAGGGAA) upstream to the transcription initiation site. Our results provide evidence that both elements might be functional. When DNA sequences between positions −1829 and −3400 were deleted, the response to IL-6 was decreased by 2-fold in comparison to the response of the full-length promoter plus 5′-UTR. This suggests that part of the IL-6-REs are confined to the deleted region (Fig. 4). In addition, internal deletions within the 5′-UTR abrogated the effect of IL-6, indicating that a possible functional IL-6-RE is also contained within that region. These findings indicate that the putative IL-6-REs at the promoter region of VEGF and its 5′-UTR are not only functional but also operate in a cooperative manner. Our results, however, do not enable us to determine whether motifs in the 5′-UTR regulate the expression of VEGF at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Recently, it was reported that IL-6-like VEGF is induced in response to hypoxia(44Yan S.F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings together with these recent results suggest that induction of IL-6 by hypoxia may promote the expression of VEGF that eventually leads to angiogenesis. The involvement of IL-6 in angiogenesis is apparently not limited to the hypoxia conditions since it is also produced during wound healing (39Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. Albina J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1840-R1844PubMed Google Scholar) and ovulation(32Motro B. Itin A. Sachs L. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-6 should be considered as an indirect angiogenic factor. Interestingly, α2-macroglobulin is an acute-phase protein that is also induced by IL-6(42Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Won K.-A. Baumann H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3965-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that VEGF is inactivated by binding to α2-macroglobulin(45Soker S. Svahn C.M. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7685-7691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL-6 induces α2-macroglobulin it may eventually lead to the inactivation of circulating VEGF. We also demonstrate that other cytokines such as IFN-β and TNF-α can also induce the expression of VEGF mRNA. The involvement of IFN-β in angiogenic processes have not been described before. However, IFN-β is expressed during inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and wound healing. Thus, it is probable that expression of IFN-β in response to these disorders might be one of the signals that triggers the angiogenic process through the induction of VEGF expression. Direct proof for such regulatory mechanisms awaits future studies. On the other hand, TNF-α has been implicated as an indirect angiogenic factor(46Frater-Schroder M. Risau W. Hallmann U. Gautschi P. Bohlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5277-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Our data suggests as published very recently, that it acts through the induction of the expression of the direct angiogenic agent, VEGF(47Frank S. Hubner G. Breier G. Longaker M.T. Greenhalgh D.G. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR of VEGF is exceptionally long (1038 bp) and contains several putative DNA motifs for SP1, AP1, AP2, as originally noted by Tischer and colleagues(11Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also the putative IL-6-RE type I element. This region is rich in G + C content. A similar structure was also reported for PDGF-B. It was demonstrated that the PDGF 5′-UTR acts as translational inhibitor and upon deletion translation efficiency increases(13Rao D.C. Pech M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 48Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during megakaryocytic differentiation, in which PDGF-B is produced, translation repression is removed by cis-acting elements(48Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 5′-UTR of placenta growth factor, albeit shorter (less then 300 bp), is composed of 73% G + C base pairs with a short open reading frame that has an inhibitory effect on translation(12Maglione D. Guerriero V. Rambaldi M. Russo G. Persico M.G. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrate a possible role for the 5′-UTR in VEGF expression. However, unlike the 5′-UTRs of PDGF and placenta growth factor that serve as translation inhibitors, VEGF 5′-UTR enhances promoter activity as determined by transient assays. A deletion of 83 bp located in the vicinity of the translation start site resulted in a significant decrease in CAT activity (30-40%), suggesting that this region has a role in VEGF expression. Since this region is characterized by a highly G + C content (83%) it is most probable that it has a role in maintaining proper secondary structure of the 5′-UTR which is crucial for proper translation. A possible role for secondary structure was also suggested for PDGF 5′-UTR in inhibiting scanning mechanisms of ribosomes. It was proposed that such structured 5′-UTRs might serve as internal ribosome entry sites(48Bernstein J. Shefler I. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10559-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since the 5′-UTR of VEGF can theoretically form such structures, it is most probable that it is also subjected to translational regulation. DNA motifs that confer response to hypoxic treatment enable the binding of specific hypoxia induced factor(21Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar DNA motifs were also observed for VEGF, however, only the motif located at the 3′-UTR was functional while the two homologous motifs at the promoter region of VEGF (−2856 to −2847 and −1958 to −1949) were not essential(49Minchenko A. Salceda S. Bauer T. Caro J. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that a putative new hypoxia element was contained within a 100-bp region between locations −1882 to −1782. Our results support this finding and enables the margins of the hypoxia element to be further narrowed to positions −1782 to −1829 (construct p1.8CAT). The magnitude of increased CAT activity for the 3.4CAT construct following treatment with cobalt and for the 1.8CAT construct was similar (~2-fold), implying that the hypoxia (cobalt) response element is indeed located downstream to position −1829. When most of 5′-UTR was deleted, the response to cobalt was not observed (Fig. 4). This is not in agreement with the reported results of Minchenko et al. (49Minchenko A. Salceda S. Bauer T. Caro J. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar) that also used constructs lacking the 5′-UTR to which luciferase was connected as the reporter gene. They demonstrated enhanced luciferase activity in response to cobalt in HeLa cells, and calculated their results as ratio between the activity of the reporter gene in treated cells and untreated cells and not in absolute light units. Therefore, it is likely that the extremely sensitive luciferase assay enabled the detection of variations even at very weak promoter activities. However, their results do not contradict ours showing that the 5′-UTR is essential for VEGF expression. Differences in cell lines should be ruled out since our data were also reproducible in HeLa cells (data not shown). In conclusion, we provide evidence showing that the role of IL-6 in angiogenesis is mediated through the induction of VEGF, a potent angiogenic agent. We show that putative DNA motifs located at the promoter region as well as in the 5′-UTR are necessary for the responsiveness to IL-6. In addition, it is demonstrated that 5′-UTR enhances the basal promoter activity of VEGF as determined by transient transfection assays. These results indicate that the secondary structure of 5′-UTR may be important for an efficient expression of VEGF and suggest that transcription and post-transcription control mechanisms are involved.

https://openalex.org/W2170880090,"The mammalian 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is related to a growing family of protein kinases in yeast and plants that are regulated by nutritional stress. We find the most prominent expressed form of the hepatic AMPK catalytic subunit (α1) is distinct from the previously cloned kinase subunit (α2). The α1 (548 residues) and α2 (552 residues) isoforms have 90% amino acid sequence identity within the catalytic core but only 61% identity elsewhere. The tissue distribution of the AMPK activity most closely parallels the low abundance 6-kilobase α1 mRNA distribution and the α1 immunoreactivity rather than α2, with substantial amounts in kidney, liver, lung, heart, and brain. Both α1 and α2 isoforms are stimulated by AMP and contain noncatalytic β and γ subunits. The liver α1 isoform accounts for approximately 94% of the enzyme activity measured using the SAMS peptide substrate. The tissue distribution of the α2 immunoreactivity parallels the α2 8.5-kilobase mRNA and is most prominent in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. Isoforms of the β and γ subunits present in the human genome sequence reveal that the AMPK consists of a family of isoenzymes."

We report here that treatment of ΔF508-expressing cells with glycerol dramatically stabilizes newly synthesized ΔF508 polypeptides and leads to the accumulation, in the plasma membrane, of stable, functional CFTR Cl− channels. Cells were cultured and transfected exactly as described previously(5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant cDNA constructs were engineered as described in(13Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase and immunoblotting experiments were performed as described previously(5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications in the presence of glycerol. Transfected HEK cells were first treated with 5% glycerol in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS for 30 min. HEK cells, which were floating after this treatment, were spun down and suspended in 10% glycerol in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM-FCS. Cells were pulse-labeled with 35S-protein labeling mix (1175 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) at a concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml for 15 min and chased with DMEM-FCS with 10 mM methionine and 4 mM cysteine. Untransfected HEK cells were treated with 7.5% glycerol in DMEM-FCS for 30 min, and cells were spun down and resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM-FCS supplemented with 7.5% glycerol. Glycerol uptake was measured by incubating untransfected HEK cells at 37°C with [3H]glycerol (0.1 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN) for various times. Cell-associated [3H]glycerol was separated from free [3H]glycerol by rapid centrifugation (25 s at 16,000 × g) through an 80-μl cushion of silicon oil (Versalube, General Electric). After removing the supernatant, the bottom of the tube was cut, and the cell pellets were extracted in 1% Triton X-100 for determination of cell-associated radioactivity. [3H]Glycerol uptake measurements were adjusted for trapped extracellular volume by using [14C]sucrose (1.5 μCi/ml) as a fluid-phase marker(14Restrepo D. Kozody D.J. Spinelli L.J. Knauf P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C520-C527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with 10% glycerol for 24 h, glycerol was removed from HEK cells expressing CFTR or ΔF508 by diluting the glycerol-containing medium slowly with fresh medium over the course of 1 h. After removal of the glycerol, cells were allowed to recover for at least 1 h prior to analysis by whole cell patch clamp recording.

The bath solution contained in mM: 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2.5 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES buffered to 7.3. The osmolarity was adjusted to 300 mosm/liter. The pipette solution contained in mM: 125 CsCl, 2.5 MgCl2, 10 EDTA, 3.5 Mg-ATP, 0.5 cAMP, and 10 HEPES buffered to 7.3. The osmolarity was adjusted to 250 mosm/liter to avoid inducing swelling currents. In some experiments 80 units/liter protein kinase A were added to the pipette solution. The experiments were conducted at 22°C. Whole cell currents were measured using the AxopatchTM 1-C, and the data were digitized, stored to disc, and analyzed using the program pClampTM. The current was filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 2 KHz. The effect of glycerol treatment on steady-state expression of ΔF508 was initially evaluated by immunoblot analysis of detergent extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected with ΔF508 cDNA (Fig. 1). In untreated cells, only the immature (core glycosylated, 140 kDa) form was detected in cells incubated at 37°C (Fig. 1A), as previously observed(5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a diffuse immunoreactive band, corresponding to the mobility of mature (complex glycosylated, 165 kDa) CFTR, was apparent in extracts of cells treated with glycerol for 24 h. The steady-state levels of mature ΔF508 induced by glycerol or by incubation at reduced temperature in these cells were similar, but the effects appear to be additive. The small difference in mobility between mature ΔF508 rescued by reduced temperature and that rescued by glycerol is probably due to differences in terminal glycosylation(15Fukuda M. Guan J.L. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5314-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of glycerol on the maturation of ΔF508 was also observed in a stable line of C127 mammary carcinoma cells expressing ΔF508 cDNA (16Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C.R. Ferrara D. Amara J.F. Hoppe IV, H. Scheule R.K. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2978-2995Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), indicating that this phenomenon is not unique to transiently transfected HEK cells. Glycerol significantly increased expression of mature ΔF508 in these cells above basal levels and above the levels induced by incubation at 26°C. The effect on steady-state expression of mature ΔF508 in C127 cells was maximal at 10% glycerol; concentrations above or below this level did not support ΔF508 maturation. By contrast, similar levels of ΔF508 maturation were observed in HEK cells between 8 and 15% (data not shown). Glycerol did not appear to be acutely toxic to either cell type. Cell viability (determined by trypan blue exclusion) after 24-h exposure to 10% glycerol was between 75% in HEK cells and 90% in C127 cells. Mature ΔF508 accumulated to clearly detectable levels in C127 cells 6 h following the addition of glycerol and continued to accumulate up to 48 h (Fig. 1C). This effect was reversible; the level of mature ΔF508 in glycerol-treated C127 cells decreased with time following glycerol removal at a rate consistent with the half-life of mature ΔF508 protein estimated from pulse-chase experiments (see below). Taken together, these data demonstrate that exposure of ΔF508-expressing cells to 10% glycerol partially rescues the “misprocessing” phenotype of the mutant protein. The effect of glycerol on ΔF508 processing could not be replicated by incubating the cells with similar concentrations of other structurally related polyols (1,2-propanediol or 1,3-propanediol), perhaps because of lower permeability of cell membranes to these agents. Similarly, dimethyl sulfoxide (2%) did not support ΔF508 maturation; higher concentrations were not tested because of its toxicity. Glycerol, a small (Mr = 98) polyhydric alcohol, is highly permeant across the plasma membrane of animal cells(17Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 18Ma T. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In HEK cells incubated at 7.5% glycerol, [3H]glycerol equilibrated rapidly (t½, ~5 min) across the plasma membrane (data not shown). As glycerol is uncharged its distribution across the plasma membrane is independent of membrane potential. Thus, it is likely that intracellular and extracellular glycerol concentrations rapidly equilibrate in HEK cells and that glycerol's effect on ΔF508 processing is due to its high intracellular concentration. At least two mechanisms could account for the effect of glycerol on the accumulation of mature ΔF508. One possibility is that glycerol stabilizes a ΔF508 folding intermediate, which is normally rapidly diverted to the degradation apparatus. The stabilized folding intermediate would remain competent to fold into a conformation resistant to proteolysis and permissive for maturation beyond the ER. A second possibility is that glycerol acts by increasing the stability of a mature but unstable ΔF508 polypeptide that has escaped ER retention. To discriminate between these models, the kinetics of ΔF508 maturation and degradation were evaluated by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation in ΔF508-transfected HEK cells (Fig. 2). In control cells not treated with glycerol, label in the band corresponding to immature ΔF508 decayed rapidly and was nearly undetectable after 6 h of chase (Fig. 2A). The t½of this decay was estimated to be 45 min (Fig. 2, A and D), similar to previously reported values(5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No label was detected at the mobility corresponding to the mature protein. By contrast, in the presence of glycerol, the kinetics of immature CFTR degradation were significantly slowed (t½= 87 min); some of this label was clearly chased into mature ΔF508 (Fig. 2, A and D). The fractional conversion of immature ΔF508 in glycerol-treated (Fig. 2E) cells ranged between 3 and 8% in separate experiments, which is considerable when compared with the ~20-25% efficiency of wild-type CFTR processing. The kinetics of wild-type CFTR degradation were also slowed by glycerol, suggesting that the effect of glycerol is not unique to the folding of ΔF508 molecules (Fig. 2, C and D). Glycerol had no measurable effect on the stability of mature ΔF508 or CFTR (Fig. 2, B and E). These data suggest that accumulation of mature ΔF508 in glycerol-treated cells is not the result of an effect on the mature protein and that glycerol stabilizes the immature form of ΔF508. However, inhibition of ΔF508 degradation, either directly with protease inhibitors or indirectly by blocking ubiquitination, also stabilizes the immature form of the protein but, unlike glycerol treatment, does not result in any accumulation of mature forms(7Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). This disparity in the fate of stabilized immature ΔF508 molecules suggests that glycerol maintains immature ΔF508 in a maturation-competent state, either by inhibiting reactions that are off pathway or by enhancing reactions that are on the folding pathway. To rule out the possibility that the effects of glycerol on ΔF508 processing and degradation are due to a general disruption of the ER quality control machinery, we examined the effect of glycerol on the maturation and degradation of other CFTR mutants that, like ΔF508, are unable to escape the ER (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the missense mutants D572A and S1251A and a mutant harboring a deletion of exon 13 (ΔEX13) were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met and chased for 5 h in the presence or absence of glycerol (Fig. 3A). These mutants were synthesized as immature polypeptides that were degraded and, unlike ΔF508, failed to mature even in the presence of glycerol. Thus, some mutations in all three major cytoplasmic domains of CFTR, including the first and second nucleotide binding domains (D572A and S1251A, respectively) as well as the “R” domain, can lead to a glycerol-insensitive ER retention phenotype, suggesting that glycerol treatment does not induce a general suppression of ER retention mechanisms. The efficiency of processing and the ability to be rescued by glycerol are also highly dependent upon the nature of the substituted amino acid in CFTR Lys464 missense mutants (Fig. 3B). Processing of mutants K464R and K464A was inefficient by comparison with wild type and was enhanced by incubation in the presence of 10% glycerol, even after accounting for the unequal label present in the immature precursor in the presence of glycerol (Fig. 3B). By contrast, no maturation was detectable for the mutant K464W in the presence or absence of glycerol. These data support the argument that glycerol rescue of CFTR maturation is not the result of a general suppression of ER quality control and suggest a correlation between the “leakiness” of the mutation and its ability to be remediated by glycerol. Although these data establish that glycerol treatment facilitates the maturation of ΔF508 molecules to a post-ER compartment, they do not establish that the “rescued”ΔF508 molecules actually move to and are functional at the plasma membrane. To test the functional surface expression of glycerol-rescued ΔF508 molecules, whole cell CFTR currents were examined in HEK cells expressing CFTR or ΔF508 by the patch-clamp technique (Fig. 4). Large (56 ± 4 pA/picofarad) rapidly activated, cAMP-dependent Cl− selective currents were readily observed in cells expressing CFTR but not in control (not glycerol-treated) cells expressing ΔF508 (1.54 ± 0.13 pA/picofarad). By contrast, significant (13.31 ± 2.3 pA/picofarad; p < 0.002 compared with untreated; Student's t test) Cl− currents, although slower activating than wild type, were observed in glycerol-treated cells expressing ΔF508 cDNA. These currents were not observed in the absence of cAMP, as expected of CFTR. The difference in maximal current level and activation kinetics between CFTR and glycerol-treated ΔF508 expressing cells is likely due both to the lower steady-state expression of mature ΔF508 and to the lower open probability of the mutant channels(19Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest a model in which glycerol, a short chain polyhydric alcohol, serves to stabilize an otherwise unstable intermediate in CFTR biosynthesis, maintaining it in a conformation that is competent for folding and its subsequent release from the quality control apparatus. As degradation of immature CFTR and ΔF508 is initiated without an apparent lag following translation(5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that glycerol serves to stabilize nascent ΔF508 chains soon after or during translation. In this role, glycerol would function as a chemical chaperone, much as HSP70 serves as a molecular chaperone. Our data suggest that these effects are not due to a generalized breakdown of ER quality control nor to stabilization of cell surface mature ΔF508 molecules that have escaped quality control surveillance. We hypothesize that glycerol stabilizes an early intermediate in CFTR folding that lies at a branch point between productive folding (on pathway) and competing non-productive (off pathway) steps. In this respect the effect of glycerol on ΔF508 is similar to “osmotic remedial” mutants previously observed in yeast (20Hawthorne D.C. Friis J. Genetics. 1964; 50: 829-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (21Russell R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 661-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations are temperature-sensitive and can be reversed by increasing the osmotic potential of the incubation medium causing the microorganisms to synthesize and accumulate high concentrations of intracellular osmolytes such as glycerol(22Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observe a strong correlation between the temperature sensitivity of CFTR mutations like ΔF508, K464R, and K464A (data not shown) and their ability to be remediated by glycerol. Glycerol may provide a useful tool to manipulate the temperature-sensitive phenotypes of CFTR and perhaps other genes at non-permissive temperatures. Our data establish the precedent that both the intracellular processing and the membrane Cl− transport phenotypes of the ΔF508 mutation can be remediated by chemical means. These data should stimulate a search for other small membrane-permeant molecules, which may be more effective or more easily delivered than glycerol at enhancing ΔF508 processing. Finally, these data may have implications for the study or treatment of other diseases, including Alzheimer's, retinitis pigmentosa, and proteinase inhibitor deficiency that are associated with protein misfolding. We are indebted to William J. Welch (University of California, San Francisco) for stimulating discussions and for suggesting glycerol as a chemical chaperone and to Kevin Gunderson for providing the mutants used in Fig. 3."

INTRODUCTIONApoptosis is the unique morphological pattern of cell death characterized by chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and cell fragmentation. The most prominent event in the early stages of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA cleavage by undefined endonuclease activities. This programmed cell death is widely observed in different cells of various organisms, from nematodes to mammals. It is generally accepted that apoptosis plays important roles in developmental processes, maintenance of homeostasis, and elimination of cells that have suffered serious damage (reviewed in (1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and (2Thompson C.B.

Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). GR can cause single-stranded and double-stranded breaks in the genomic DNA (3Ward J.F. Radiat. Res. 1994; 138: S85-S88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals generated by radiolytic attack on H2O in the cellular aqueous environment can cause oxidative damages to macromolecules(4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989Google Scholar). Although the direct damaging effects of GR have been well studied, the biochemical and genetic mechanisms that initiate the active programmed cell death in radiation-damaged cells remain largely unknown.The p46/p54 serine/threonine kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1 and JNK2), are emerging members of the MAP kinase-related family(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Similar to MAP kinase, JNK activation requires phosphorylation at 2 residues, Thr-183 and Tyr-185, by MAP kinase kinase 4/JNK kinase(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), a dual specificity kinase, which is structurally related to MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs). MAP kinase kinase 4/JNK kinase itself is phosphorylated and activated by the upstream kinase MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). The JNK kinase cascade can be induced by various mitogenic factors including growth factors, oncogenic Ras, phorbol esters, and T-cell activation signaling(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar, 6Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). JNK activity is also induced by stimuli such as UV light, protein synthesis inhibitors, osmotic shock, and proinflammatory cytokines(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar, 7Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This kinase cascade was shown to be the common pathway shared by cell proliferation and stress-response signaling. The exact mechanism of how JNK kinase cascade integrates with other signaling pathways to achieve specific response to different stimuli remains to be elucidated. There are three cellular proteins currently known to be phosphorylated by JNK, which are the transcription factors c-Jun(8Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), ATF-2(9Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Transcription activities driven by the responsive elements binding these transcription factors are strongly enhanced after JNK activation (5Karin M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), a potent inducer of apoptosis(2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tumor suppressor p53, which causes apoptosis on some occasions(1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), was suggested as an in vivo substrate of JNK1(11Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5511-5518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the general involvement of JNK in responses to various stresses, we proposed that JNK may be activated by GR. In these studies, we demonstrated that JNK1 was activated in cells exposed to lethal doses of GR. The radiation-induced JNK1 activation showed a unique kinetics in comparison with that induced by other stimuli.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, Antibodies, and Fusion ProteinsJurkat T-cell culture, peripheral blood lymphocyte preparation, and anti-CD28 mAb stimulation were performed as described(12Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-JNK1 serum (Ab101) was raised against a peptide sequence consisting of the C terminus (amino acids 368-384) of the human JNK1 protein. GST-Jun-(1-331) and GST-JNK1-(26-384) were constructed by inserting each into pGEX-4T-3 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).γ and UV Irradiation and Cell Extract PreparationCultured cells were γ-irradiated by using a 137Cs source Gammacell 1000 (10 Gy/min) at various dosages. UV irradiation was performed by using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Whole cell extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Kyriakis et al. (13). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were collected as described previously (12Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).DNA Fragmentation and Western Blot Analysis106 irradiated cells were lysed in 50 μl of NTE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20 mM EDTA) containing 0.5% SDS. The lysate was heated at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate nucleases and digested by a 2-h incubation with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K followed by a 2-h incubation with 0.2 mg/ml RNase A at 50°C. The DNA fragmentation was analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Western blot using anti-JNK1 Ab (1:1,000 dilution) was performed as described previously (12Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Solid-phase, Immunocomplex, and In-gel Kinase AssaysThe JNK activities were precipitated by GST-Jun-(1-79), and solid-phase kinase assay was performed as described by Hibi et al. (8Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Immunocomplex kinase assay was carried out as described by Kyriakis et al. (13Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-f. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cellular JNK1 activities were immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-JNK1 Ab, Ab101. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (500 mM LiCl, 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mM Mops, pH 7.2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mM Na3VO4). Then the pellets were mixed with 5 μg of GST-Jun-(1-331), 15 μM ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was performed at 30°C for 30 min and terminated with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer. The reaction products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The in-gel kinase assay using GST-Jun-(1-331) as the substrate was performed as described by Hibi et al. (8Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar).RESULTSGR Induces the JNK Activity in the Early Phase of ApoptosisJurkat cells irradiated by 100 Gy were collected at different time points for viability count, DNA fragmentation analysis, and cell lysate preparation. Cellular DNA was analyzed by 1.8% agarose electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The typical nucleosomal DNA ladders appeared 4 h after irradiation, and the intensity of fragmented DNA was continuously increased, indicating the progression of massive fragmentation of chromosomal DNA (Fig. 1A). The viability of irradiated cells dropped below 50% 48 h after irradiation as determined by trypan blue exclusion, with no viable cells observed 4 days after irradiation (data not shown).To study the possible JNK activation induced by GR, we used GST-Jun-(1-79) bound to GSH-Sepharose beads to precipitate JNK or JNK-like activities from Jurkat cell lysate. The precipitated complexes were washed and subjected to solid-phase kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-Jun phosphorylation activity dramatically increased between 1 and 2 h after irradiation and peaked at 3 h; then it slightly decreased but remained constant through the 6-h time point. The kinase activity was still higher than the basal level 12 h after irradiation. We did not, however, detect a significant increase of GST-Jun phosphorylation activity before the 1-h time point (data not shown). In comparison with the immediate and transient JNK activation induced by other stimuli such as TNF-α (7Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and UV light(14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar), the induction of JNK activity by GR was late and sustained.GR and T-cell Activation Signals Induce Different Kinetics of JNK1 ActivationTo determine if the GST-Jun-(1-79) phosphorylation detected by solid-phase kinase assay is due to JNK or other JNK-related kinases, JNK1-specific antiserum (Ab101) was used for the detection of JNK1 activity. As shown in Fig. 2, this antiserum recognizes the 46-kDa JNK1 protein in Jurkat cell extract (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The anti-JNK1 Ab also recognized the affinity-purified GST-JNK1 protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). To further determine the specificity of the anti-JNK1 Ab, we incubated Ab101 and protein A-conjugated agarose beads with cell lysate prepared from Jurkat cells exposed to various JNK stimuli. The precipitated kinase activities were resolved in SDS-PAGE copolymerized with GST-Jun-(1-331) protein, and the in-gel kinase reaction was performed after denaturing and renaturing of the protein gel. As shown in Fig. 2B, single kinase activity around 46-kDa, which phosphorylated GST-Jun, was precipitated by anti-JNK1 from UV light, anisomycin, and GR-treated cell lysates (lanes 2-4, respectively). These results clearly showed that Ab101 specifically recognized only one kinase activity, JNK1, which can phosphorylate the c-Jun protein.Figure 2:Anti-JNK1 (Ab101) specifically recognizes human JNK1 protein. A, Jurkat cells lysate (lane 1) and purified GST-JNK1 fusion protein (lane 2, fusion protein bound on GSH beads; lane 3, eluted fusion protein) resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose filter. The filter was subjected to immunoblot with rabbit anti-JNK1 (Ab101). B, kinase activities precipitated by Ab101 from untreated and UV light (100 J/m2), anisomycin (1 μg/ml), and GR (100 Gy) treated cell lysates (lanes 1-4, respectively) were examined by in-gel kinase assay using GST-Jun-(1-331) as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the kinetics of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation activities induced by GR is very different in comparison with those induced by other stimuli, it is possible that GR may induce several kinases, in addition to JNK, that will phosphorylate the N terminus of c-Jun. The kinetics pattern detected by solid-phase kinase assay could be the additive effect of different kinase activities. To determine the JNK1 activation kinetics, we used the anti-JNK1 Ab for immunocomplex kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the precipitated JNK1 activity from irradiated cells has the same kinetics as that determined by solid-phase kinase assay. This shows that GR induced a delayed and sustained JNK1 activation. To exclude the possibility that this unique kinetics is the specific property of certain Jurkat cell clones, we used anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA, which are the potent stimuli for T-cell activation(12Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), to induce JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 3B, after addition of anti-CD28 plus PMA, JNK1 activity rapidly increased within 15 min and reached the peak at the 30-min time point. However, the JNK1 activity induced by anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA diminished significantly 2 h after stimulation. These results show that, although both T-cell activation signals and GR induce JNK1 activation in Jurkat cells, the induction kinetics are quite different. While anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA induced an immediate and transient JNK1 activation, GR induced a relatively delayed and much more prolonged JNK1 activation.Figure 3:GR and T-cell activation signals induce different kinetics of JNK1 activation. Jurkat cells were treated with: A, 100 Gy of GR; or B, anti-CD28 mAb (1:1,000 dilution) plus PMA (50 ng/ml). Cell lysates were collected at different time points after stimulation.

Using anti-JNK1 Ab in Western blots, we found that the JNK1 protein was constitutively expressed in non-stimulated Jurkat cells and remained at the same levels after irradiation (data not shown). This indicates that the elevation of kinase activity is not due to an increased production of JNK1 protein. The known JNK kinase cascade was initiated in the cytosol(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), and it was shown that nuclear events are not required for UV-induced JNK activation(15Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Since most of the possible JNK substrates are nuclear transcription factors, we thought that nuclear translocation may be a necessary step for JNK function. To study the translocation of JNK1, we examined the distribution of JNK1 proteins in nuclear and cytosolic fractions after irradiation. In the absence of kinase activity, we detected the constitutive expression of JNK1 protein in the nuclear fraction of unstimulated cells. There is no significant change in JNK1 protein levels in either nuclear or cytosolic fractions after irradiation (Fig. 4A). Although we did not detect an apparent nuclear translocation of JNK1, we did observe a simultaneous increase of JNK1 activity in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions after irradiation (Fig. 4B). This nuclear JNK1 activation is consistent with the expected function of JNK1.Figure 4:Simultaneous activation of JNK1 in the nuclear and cytosolic fraction by GR without apparent translocation. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions of irradiated Jurkat cells were collected at various time points. Intracellular JNK1 protein distribution was determined by immunoblotting (A), and JNK1 activity was examined by immunocomplex kinase assay (B).

If JNK activation is a paralleled phenomenon of apoptosis, there should be a dose-dependent response of JNK activation. Since normal lymphocytes are more susceptible to GR than the Jurkat cells, JNK1 activity should be induced by a lower dose of GR in normal cells than in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, low doses of radiation (5-20 Gy), which did not cause significant DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells (data not shown), also failed to induce JNK1 activation. JNK1 induction increased as the dosage of irradiation increased and reached the plateau at 60 Gy. However, in normal peripheral lymphocytes, 5 Gy of GR induced a significant JNK1 activation (Fig. 5B). This dosage of radiation, which did not cause detectable DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells, induced a significant DNA fragmentation in normal lymphocytes (data not shown). These results show that the abilities of irradiation to induce apoptosis and JNK activation are integrated.Figure 5:Peripheral lymphocytes are more sensitive to GR than Jurkat cells in JNK1 induction. Jurkat cells (A) and peripheral lymphocytes (B) were γ-irradiated using various dosages. Cell lysates were collected 3 h after irradiation. JNK1 activity was determined by immunocomplex kinase assay.

Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and (ii) TNF-α strongly induces JNK activity(7Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), we suspected that the JNK kinase cascade may be involved in the induction of cell death. In these studies we show that JNK1 activity is strongly activated during the early phase of apoptosis caused by GR. Because of the correlation between JNK1 activation and apoptosis induced by GR, we propose that JNK1 activation may be involved in the initiation of programmed cell death in response to radiation damages.Immediate and transient kinetics of activation is universal in JNK responses to various stimuli(14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). However, the JNK1 induction by GR in Jurkat cells was delayed and persistent. Since the T-cell activation signals, anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA, induced a rapid and transient JNK1 activation in the same cell line, the unique pattern of JNK1 induction should be a specific cellular response to GR rather than a unique property of Jurkat cells. The induction of JNK1 in both T-cell activation and apoptosis indicates that JNK1 is the common kinase shared by these two distinct phenomena. However, the opposite outcomes imply that the presence or absence of other co-activators at different times may be important. In addition, prolonged JNK1 induction in irradiated cells may cause the persistent activation of some cellular factors (e.g. c-Jun or p53) and results in detrimental effects to the cells. Therefore, the different timing and/or duration of JNK1 induction may lead to opposite outcomes, T-cell proliferation or apoptosis.JNK (JNK1/JNK2) and p38-Mpk protein kinases are coordinately regulated, although to a different extent, by proinflammatory cytokines, UV light, and other environmental stresses(7Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). Since the substrate specificities of these kinases are different(14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar), they may have distinct functions in response to the stimuli. It will be important to determine whether GR induces all of these stress-responsive kinases. It is possible that different combinations of the kinase members, with various kinetics, may mediate diverse cellular signaling and dictate final outcomes, proliferation or cell death.The delayed kinetics of JNK1 induction in irradiated cells also implies the existence of a distinct activation or regulation mechanism. In the known JNK activation mechanism, a nuclear translocation of JNK after activation at the proximity of the plasma membrane is required for nuclear function of the kinase(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). However, we show that nuclear JNK1 is constitutively present and can be activated without evident, nuclear translocation in irradiated cells. The delay of JNK1 activation may be due to the time needed for accumulation of cellular damage to certain threshold levels. Furthermore, the existence of unrepairable damage could be the reason for persistent JNK1 activation, probably through the continued activation of upstream kinases. The other possible explanation for the prolonged JNK1 induction after ionizing radiation is the absence of dual specificity phosphatase activities, which were shown to dephosphorylate ERK and JNK causing down-regulation of the kinase activities(17Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The imbalance between kinase and phosphatase activities may have detrimental effects and lead to cell death. Finally, identification of JNK1 as a potential signaling molecule in mediating apoptosis will open a new avenue for unraveling the signal transduction mechanisms of apoptosis. INTRODUCTIONApoptosis is the unique morphological pattern of cell death characterized by chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and cell fragmentation. The most prominent event in the early stages of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA cleavage by undefined endonuclease activities. This programmed cell death is widely observed in different cells of various organisms, from nematodes to mammals. It is generally accepted that apoptosis plays important roles in developmental processes, maintenance of homeostasis, and elimination of cells that have suffered serious damage (reviewed in (1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and (2Thompson C.B.

Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). GR can cause single-stranded and double-stranded breaks in the genomic DNA (3Ward J.F. Radiat. Res. 1994; 138: S85-S88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals generated by radiolytic attack on H2O in the cellular aqueous environment can cause oxidative damages to macromolecules(4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989Google Scholar). Although the direct damaging effects of GR have been well studied, the biochemical and genetic mechanisms that initiate the active programmed cell death in radiation-damaged cells remain largely unknown.The p46/p54 serine/threonine kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1 and JNK2), are emerging members of the MAP kinase-related family(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Similar to MAP kinase, JNK activation requires phosphorylation at 2 residues, Thr-183 and Tyr-185, by MAP kinase kinase 4/JNK kinase(5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), a dual specificity kinase, which is structurally related to MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs). MAP kinase kinase 4/JNK kinase itself is phosphorylated and activated by the upstream kinase MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) (5Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). The JNK kinase cascade can be induced by various mitogenic factors including growth factors, oncogenic Ras, phorbol esters, and T-cell activation signaling(5Karin M. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONThe white-rot wood-metabolizing basidiomycete fungi are major degraders of lignin contributing essential chemistry to the global carbon cycle. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, the organism most extensively studied for its lignin-degrading ability, produces three classes of extracellular enzyme under ligninolytic conditions: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and glyoxal oxidase(1Kirk T.K.

The oxidizing peroxide cosubstrate for this reaction must be generated in situ for efficient turnover of extracellular lignin peroxidase, a function performed by glyoxal oxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of a number of aldehyde and α-hydroxy carbonyl compounds, reducing O2 to H2O2 in the process. The enzyme exhibits a broad substrate specificity for oxidation of simple aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acids, as shown by (10Kersten P.J. Kirk T.K. J.

Spectrophotometric titrations were performed on a Hitachi U2000 UV-vis absorption spectrometer. Spectroelectrochemical studies on glyoxal oxidase used a special thin layer optical cell 2E. S.

Boyd D.C. Mann K.R. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 3084-3086Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cell is constructed by supporting a 1000 lines/inch gold grid working electrode (Buckbee-Mears Co., St. Paul, MN) between quartz disks separated by a 0.2 mm polyvinylchloride gasket, using silver/saturated AgCl reference electrode (0.22 V versus NHE; (28Latimer W.M. Oxidation Potentials. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1952: 342Google Scholar)) and a platinum wire counter electrode. Electroanalytical measurements were performed with an EG& model 263 potentiostat interfaced with a microcomputer for data acquisition and analysis. Resonance Raman spectra were collected with a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67-m focal length, 600-groove grating, 7 cm−1 spectral resolution) using a Coherent Innova 302 krypton (647 nm) laser, a Kaiser optical super-notch filter, and a Princeton Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2-cooled CCD detector. Spectra were obtained on samples in glass capillaries at 278 K using a 90° scattering geometry and a 10-min accumulation time. Sample integrity was verified by the observation of the same absorption spectrum (typical of active enzyme) before and after laser irradiation.RESULTSRedox CharacterizationPurified native glyoxal oxidase is catalytically inactive, but can be oxidatively activated by lignin peroxidase (11Kersten P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or by high potential inorganic oxidants including molybdicyanide (K3Mo(CN)8) or hexachloroiridate (Na2IrCl6), or Mn3+ EDTA (which reacts relatively slowly). The redox-activated enzyme is unstable and reversibly loses activity on dialysis or exposure to chromatographic media, reverting to the reduced, inactive form. Native glyoxal oxidase exhibits a cupric EPR signal at low temperatures, which is completely eliminated by addition of strong oxidants (Fig. 1). Spin quantitation of this EPR signal shows that it represents 0.7-0.8 equivalents of Cu2+/enzyme, identical to the total copper content determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The disappearance of the EPR signal on oxidation is similar to the behavior previously reported for galactose oxidase (25Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hamilton G.A. Adolf P.K. de Jersey J. DuBois G.C. Dyrkacz G.R. Libby R.D. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an EPR-silent oxidized complex with an antiferromagnetically coupled electronic ground state(16Whittaker J.W. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel1994: 315-360Google Scholar). Like galactose oxidase(25Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9610-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glyoxal oxidase typically contains substoichiometric copper (0.7-0.8 Cu2+/mol) and the oxidized protein exhibits a minority EPR signal arising from the presence of a small amount of apoenzyme radical (Fig. 2). The radical signals for the two enzymes are very similar, each having an average g value near 2.005 characteristic of phenoxyl π-radicals and revealing partly resolved hyperfine structure. In galactose oxidase the spectrum has been assigned by isotopic substitution (30Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9610-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ENDOR analysis (18Babcock G.T. El-Deeb M.K. Sandusky P.O. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem.

The strong spectroscopic correlations between the two enzymes are developed in more detail below.Figure 1:EPR spectra for glyoxal oxidase complexes.

A Nernst plot of the absorption intensities through the oxidation step (Fig. 3, right) averaged between increasing and decreasing potential scans is linear (r2 = 0.995) with a slope of 0.048 mV consistent with a single-electron step for the oxidation (n = 1.2) and a midpoint potential (E1/2 = 0.42 V versus Ag/AgCl; 0.64 V versus NHE) significantly higher than that found for galactose oxidase (0.4 V versus NHE at pH 7.3; ref. 31Johnson J.M. Halsall H.B. Heineman W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the requirement for a relatively high potential oxidant for activation of glyoxal oxidase (Na2IrCl6 (0.892 V; (32Margerum D.L. Chellappa K.L. Bossu F.P. Bruce G.L. J. Am.

Kuwana T. Anal. Chem. 1973; 45: 1021-1027Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar)). Activation of glyoxal oxidase by diffusible high potential manganese chelates (illustrated here by Mn3+ EDTA oxidation) may have a physiological role in regulation of the extracellular activity of glyoxal oxidase through the metabolic networking of the ligninolytic enzymes(1Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 2Cullen D. Kersten P.J. Kinghorn J.R. Turner G. Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi. Chapman and Hall, New York1992: 100-131Crossref Google Scholar). The biological significance of this interaction is presently under further study. The stability of the redox-activated proteins (reflecting the stability of the free radical sites) differs between glyoxal oxidase and galactose oxidase. While the latter is stable for days at 4°C(25Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stability of the active glyoxal oxidase is markedly lower, with a half-life of 4 h for the radical under similar conditions (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5).Spectroscopic Correlations between Glyoxal Oxidase and Galactose OxidaseOptical Absorption SpectraThe optical spectra of redox-activated and native (inactive) glyoxal oxidase are shown in Fig. 4(Table 1), with the corresponding spectra previously obtained for galactose oxidase included for comparison. Blue, inactive glyoxal oxidase exhibits strong absorption in the visible spectrum at 451 and 678 nm (ε451 = 1875 M−1 cm−1; ε678 = 1365 M−1 cm−1) that may be assigned as phenolate-to-Cu2+ ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and mixed LMCT and cupric ligand field (d → d) absorption, respectively, by analogy with the corresponding features in galactose oxidase(35Whittaker J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These assignments are further supported by resonance Raman spectroscopy (see below). Activation by oxidation of the protein results in conversion to a green form with the appearance of intense absorption bands in the blue (ε448 = 5700 M−1 cm−1) and red (ε851 = 4300 M−1 cm−1). The unusual red absorption band extending deep into the near IR region has been assigned in galactose oxidase as arising from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer associated with the presence of both a Cys-Tyr free radical ligand and an unmodified tyrosinate in the active site metal complex(36McGlashin M.L. Eads D.D. Spiro T.G. Whittaker J.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 4918-4922Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The spectra for galactose oxidase and glyoxal oxidase are strikingly similar, suggesting nearly identical environments for the active site metal ions, in spite of the lack of obvious sequence homology between the two proteins(14Kersten P.J. Cullen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7411-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Optical absorption spectra.

While the spectrum of the redox activated glyoxal oxidase is nearly unchanged over a wide pH range (4.5-8.5), more dramatic pH-dependent changes occur in spectra of the inactive enzyme (Fig. 5). Titration of inactive glyoxal oxidase in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer converts the enzyme to a purple form at low pH (ε522 = 1365 M−1 cm−1), maintaining two isosbestic points (at 504 and 568 nm) that identify the reaction as a simple two-state transition. More detailed analysis by Henderson-Hasselbach fitting of the titration data gives an estimate for the pKa of the protein group involved in the protonation step (pKa = 7.7) (Fig. 5, inset). The spectral changes associated with the pH-dependent structure change (loss of 451 nm phenolate-to-Cu2+ LMCT absorption at low pH) suggest that the titratable group is a coordinated tyrosinate, ionizing more readily in the metal complex than is typical of the free amino acid (pKa = 10.1; (37Barker R. Organic Chemistry of Biological Compounds. Prentice-Hall, New York1971Google Scholar)) and dissociating from the metal on protonation. The assignment to the unmodified tyrosinate (corresponding to Tyr-495 in the active site of galactose oxidase, Fig. S1) is supported by the observation that resonance Raman profiles at low pH reveal only vibrational modes of a Cys-Tyr group, whereas at high pH contributions from both tyrosinates are observed (see below).Figure 5:pH-dependent spectral changes for native glyoxal oxidase. Glyoxal oxidase (0.15 mM protein in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (1-12): pH 8.34, 8.15, 7.98, 7.86, 7.71, 7.50, 7.39, 7.16, 7.10, 6.92, 6.44, 4.53). Inset, absorption data fit to a protonation equilibrium model with pKa= 7.7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In glyoxal oxidase, the acid titration of the coordinated tyrosinate reflects a perturbation of the phenolate basicity by approximately 2.5 pH units in the metal complex. The lack of sensitivity to protons for the corresponding low and high pH spectra of the redox activated enzyme implies a more dramatic perturbation of phenolate basicity in the radical-copper complex. This difference can be understood in terms of the decrease in overall charge of the ligand set associated with oxidation of the coordinated cysteinyl-tyrosinate anion to generate the neutral (Cys-TyrO·) phenoxyl, making the copper a more strongly acidic metal center(38Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 762-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The modulation of ligand acidity by metal interactions is an essential feature of ligand participation in catalysis in galactose oxidase (16Whittaker J.W. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel1994: 315-360Google Scholar) (see below). In that enzyme, the spectra of both active and inactive forms are relatively insensitive to pH, but there is evidence for a temperature-dependent proton transfer equilibrium in the active site and for proton-coupled anion binding(38Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 762-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Anion InteractionsGlyoxal oxidase is inhibited by phosphate in a pH-dependent fashion with Ki values in the millimolar range (Ki (pH 4.5) = 5.1 mM; Ki (pH 6.0) = 1.0 mM) correlating with the ionization of the weak acid and preferential binding of the dibasic ion. Unlike azide, which blocks turnover by binding to copper (see below), phosphate has no significant effect on the optical spectrum of redox-activated enzyme, indicating that the inhibition is not a consequence of direct interaction with the active site metal ion and may result from steric effects, such as blocking substrate access to the active site. Inhibition of enzyme activity by phosphate may be physiologically important for regulation of glyoxal oxidase activity and can be expected to be a significant factor in environmental chemistry.Azide acts as an analog of peroxide in oxygen-metabolizing enzymes, forming stable complexes that mimic reactive oxygen species. Addition of azide to both native and redox activated forms of glyoxal oxidase leads to the appearance of new spectral features (Fig. 6, Table 1), that are again similar to those observed for the azide complexes of galactose oxidase and other copper proteins (39Agnus Y.

The lower energy absorption bands have more metal-centered d → d character, as indicated by their relatively large CD anisotropy (see below).

Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The precipitate was suspended into 360 ml of homogenizing buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 10% sucrose) to prepare the crude membrane fraction(19Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The proteins in this fraction were extracted by addition of an equal volume of homogenizing buffer containing 4 M NaCl. After shaking for 1 h at 4°C, the membrane fraction was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2) three times. Solid ammonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 40% saturation. The 0-40% precipitate was dissolved into 16 ml of buffer A, dialyzed against buffer A three times, and used as the membrane extract. The membrane extract (16 ml) was eluted through 2.5 ml of a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove endogenous GST. One-tenth of the pass-through fraction was loaded on 0.25 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns containing respective GST-small G proteins loaded with guanine nucleotides as described(19Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After washing the columns with 0.825 ml of buffer A three times, the bound proteins were coeluted with respective GST-small G proteins by addition of 0.825 ml of buffer A containing 10 mM glutathione and 0.2 M NaCl three times. To prepare affinity-purified p180 for peptide sequencing, the pass-through fraction (16 ml) was loaded onto a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose column containing 24 nmol of GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras. The proteins were eluted by addition of 10 ml of buffer A containing 10 mM glutathione and 0.2 M NaCl, and fractions of 1 ml each were collected. The p180 protein appeared in fractions 2-10. The same procedures were repeated 12 times. The affinity-purified p180 was dialyzed three times against distilled water and concentrated by freeze-drying. The concentrated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes(20Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The immobilized p180 was digested, fractionated, and subjected to amino acid sequencing as described(20Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In vitro translation of pRSET-AF-6 (36-848 aa), pRSET-AF-6 (36-206 aa), and pRSET-Canoe (1-217 aa) were performed as described(19Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vitro translated products labeled with [35S]methionine were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing the respective GST-small G proteins loaded with guanine nucleotides(19Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were then coeluted with GST-small G proteins by addition of glutathione. The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and vacuum-dried followed by autoradiography. The shorter N-terminal domain of AF-6 (36-206 aa) was expressed as an MBP fusion protein (MBP-AF-6) and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). MBP-AF-6 (0.15 nmol) was subjected to the GST-small G protein affinity column chromatography as described above. For competition assay with c-Raf-1, 1.5 nmol of MBP-c-Raf-1 was simultaneously added to the incubation mixture. SDS-PAGE proceeded as described previously (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The BLAST program was used for protein homology search(22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of p180 was carried out as described(23Harlow E. Lame D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). To detect molecules interacting with Ha-Ras, the bovine brain membrane extract was loaded onto GST-Ha-Ras affinity columns. The proteins bound to the affinity columns were coeluted with GST-Ha-Ras by addition of glutathione. Proteins with a molecular mass of about 180 kDa (p180) and 195 kDa (p195) were detected in the glutathione eluate from the GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras affinity column but not from those containing GST or GDP•GST-Ha-Ras (Fig. 1). Neither p180 nor p195 was detected in the eluate of the affinity column for GTPγS•GST-Ha-RasA38, which has a mutation in the effector-interacting domain(1Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We further confirmed the specificity of the interaction by affinity column chromatography using GST-R-Ras, GST-RalA, and GST-RhoA. Less p180 and p195 were eluted from the GTPγS•GST-R-Ras affinity column but not from the GDP•GST-R-Ras affinity column (data not shown). Neither p180 nor p195 was eluted from the GST-RalA or GST-RhoA affinity column (data not shown). To identify the GTPγS•Ha-Ras-interacting molecule, p180 was subjected to amino acid sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six peptide sequences derived from p180 were determined. These were: 1) STATTQDVLE; 2) DMPETSFTR; 3) LPYLVELSPDG; 4) PGIVQETTFDLG; 5) YAPDDIPNINS; and 6) LLLEWQFQK. All six peptide sequences were almost identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of human AF-6, which is the fusion partner of the ALL-1 protein(16Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. Miyazaki Y. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar). The ALL-1/AF-6 chimeric protein is the critical product of the t (6:11) abnormality associated with some human leukemia. Furthermore, p180 was recognized by the antibody raised against human AF-6 (Fig. 2). The calculated molecular mass of human AF-6 is 181,777 Da, which is close to the apparent molecular mass of p180 estimated by SDS-PAGE. We therefore concluded that p180 is the bovine counterpart of human AF-6 and hereafter referred to it as AF-6. Since this antibody cross-reacted with p195 weakly (data not shown), p195 may be an isoform or an alternatively spliced form of AF-6. To address whether or not recombinant AF-6 interacts with GTPγS•Ha-Ras, GST-small G proteins immobilized on beads were mixed with the in vitro translated N-terminal domain of AF-6 (36-848 aa), and interacting proteins were coeluted with GST-small G proteins by the addition of glutathione. The in vitro translated AF-6 (36-848 aa) was coeluted with GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras but weakly with GDP•GST-Ha-Ras, GTPγS•GST-Ha-RasA38, GST-R-Ras, GST-RalA, and GST-RhoA (Fig. 3a). The band with GTPγS•GST-Ha-RasA38 was very faint (lane 5), and the bands with GDP•GST-RalA and GTPγS•GST-RalA (lanes 8 and 9) were a little bit stronger than those with GDP•GST-R-Ras and GTPγS•GST-R-Ras (lanes 6 and 7). The weak bands detected in the eluates other than that from GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras may result from the weak interaction of AF-6 with the respective small G proteins. Although some AF-6 in the membrane extract was slightly retained on the GTPγS•GST-R-Ras affinity column (data not shown), the in vitro translated AF-6 was not. This may be due to the lower affinity of AF-6 for GTPγS•GST-R-Ras than that for GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras. To determine the Ras-interacting domain of AF-6 more accurately, a similar experiment was performed using the shorter N-terminal domain of AF-6 (36-206 aa). A similar retention was observed when the shorter N-terminal domain of AF-6 (36-206 aa) was employed (Fig. 3b). A homology search of the GenBank protein data base revealed a high degree of sequence similarity of AF-6 with Drosophila Canoe (Fig. 4), which is assumed to function downstream from Notch in a common developmental pathway(17Miyamoto H. Nihonmatsu I. Kondo S. Ueda R. Togashi S. Hirata K. Ikegami Y. Yamamoto D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 612-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since Canoe was presumed to interact with Ras in the same manner as AF-6, the interaction of Canoe was investigated. The in vitro translated N-terminal domain of Canoe (1-217 aa) was also coeluted with GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras and scarcely with GST, GDP•GST-Ha-Ras, and GTPγS•GST-Ha-RasA38 (Fig. 3b). We examined whether or not AF-6 directly interacts with GTPγS•Ha-Ras. The shorter N-terminal domain of AF-6 (36-206 aa) was expressed as an MBP fusion protein (MBP-AF-6) and mixed with immobilized GST-Ha-Ras. Interacting proteins were coeluted with GST-Ha-Ras by the addition of glutathione. MBP-AF-6 was coeluted with GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras but not with GST, GDP•GST-Ha-Ras, or GTPγS•GST-Ha-RasA38 (Fig. 3c). The band corresponding to molecular mass of about 55 kDa may be a degraded product of MBP-AF-6. The apparent Kd values for MBP-AF-6 and MBP-c-Raf-1 were estimated to be about 250 and 200 nM, respectively, under the conditions (data not shown). Since c-Raf-1 interacts with activated Ras via the effector domain(1Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we examined whether or not c-Raf-1 competes with AF-6 for interaction with activated Ha-Ras. An excess amount of MBP-c-Raf-1 inhibited the interaction of the MBP-AF-6 with GTPγS•GST-Ha-Ras (Fig. 3c). In this study, we purified a Ras-interacting protein (p180) from a bovine brain membrane extract. We identified it as AF-6, which has a GLGF/DHR motif and shows a high degree of sequence similarity with Drosophila Canoe(16Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. Miyazaki Y. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto H. Nihonmatsu I. Kondo S. Ueda R. Togashi S. Hirata K. Ikegami Y. Yamamoto D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 612-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The recombinant AF-6 and Canoe specifically interacted with activated Ha-Ras. Furthermore, c-Raf-1 inhibited the interaction of AF-6 with activated Ha-Ras. These results indicate that AF-6 and Canoe serve as putative targets for Ras. We showed that activated Ras interacted with the N-terminal domains of AF-6 and Canoe. These domains show a high degree of sequence similarity to each other, indicating that this unique domain confers specificity for the GTP•Ras complex. The direct interaction of c-Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Ral GDS, and Rin1 with activated Ras has been demonstrated(3Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Ras-interacting interfaces of these proteins have been determined. There is no obvious homology among Ras-interacting interfaces of c-Raf-1, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Ral GDS, Rin1, and AF-6/Canoe, indicating that activated Ras can recognize a variety of target interfaces. This diversity of Ras-interacting interfaces may allow a range of downstream pathways from Ras to induce appropriate cellular responses to extracellular signals. AF-6 and Canoe are homologous to each other and share a common domain organization (Fig. 4)(16Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K.

The most highly conserved region among them is a GLGF/DHR motif, which is found in a number of other proteins including Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor gene product (Dlg)(24Woods D.F.

The GLGF/DHR motif is thought to function to localize them at the specialized sites of cell-cell contact by forming a complex with specific proteins such as protein 4.1 homologues(31Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The structural feature of AF-6 and Canoe suggests that they locate at the junction of plasma membrane and cytoskeleton, where they may regulate signal transduction and cytoskeleton. The N terminus of AF-6 flanked by the GLGF/DHR motif also shares a high homology with that of Canoe, to both of which activated Ras binds specifically. Canoe has been postulated to function downstream from Notch and to mediate interactions between the Notch cascade and other signaling pathways(17Miyamoto H. Nihonmatsu I. Kondo S. Ueda R. Togashi S. Hirata K. Ikegami Y. Yamamoto D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 612-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although AF-6 function remains obscure, the similar structural feature and property of AF-6 and Canoe suggest that the AF-6/Canoe family may serve as an intracellular signaling component controlled by two distinct signaling pathways such as Ras and Notch. Our preliminary experiments suggest that Canoe is genetically linked to Ras1 in Drosophila eye development. Further studies are required to understand the roles of AF-6/Canoe family in signal transduction. We thank Dr. Takahisa Hachiya and Tosiaki Miyazaki (MBL, Japan) for preparing the polyclonal antibody against human AF-6. We are also grateful to Masako Nishimura for secretarial assistance."

INTRODUCTIONThe extracellular matrix provides a controlled environment for cellular differentiation and tissue development. The integrity of the extracellular matrix is maintained through a balance between the amount and activity of matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes and their associated activators and inhibitors(1Alexander C.M. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Sympson C.J. Talhouk R.S. Alexander C.M. Chin J.R. Clift S.M. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J.

The expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), 1The abbreviations used are: TIMP-1tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1PBSphosphate-buffered salineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTRETPA response elementbpbase pair(s). an inhibitor of a key regulatory class of matrix-degrading proteinases, is under strict developmental and tissue-specific control. TIMP-1 expression is largely confined to adult bone and ovary and to tissues undergoing remodeling or inflammation. In cultured cells its expression is regulated by serum and growth factors and, in F9 cells, by differentiation(4Adler R.R. Brenner C.A. Werb Z. Development. 1990; 110: 211-220PubMed Google Scholar, 5Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The basic structure of the TIMP-1 promoter has been described previously(6Coulombe B. Ponton A. Daigneault L. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Gewert D.R. Coulombe B. Castelino M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 possesses a TATA-less promoter and is composed of six exons. DNA sequences conferring transcriptional activation by viruses, serum, phorbol esters, and transforming growth factor-β have been localized to the 5′ region of the gene(6Coulombe B. Ponton A. Daigneault L. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Campbell C.E. Flenniken A.M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation can be quite dramatic, with serum inducing endogenous TIMP-1 expression by as much as 3 orders of magnitude (6Coulombe B. Ponton A. Daigneault L. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2S. K. Logan and Z. Werb, unpublished observations. Sequences including this region and approximately 2 kilobases more in the 5′ direction have also been shown to direct appropriate embryonic expression of the gene(9Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMP-1 is negatively regulated by the extracellular matrix in primary mammary epithelial cells, although the sequences conferring regulation have not been identified. 3R. S. Talhouk, M. J. Bissell, and Z. Werb, unpublished observations. The TIMP-1 gene is induced in response to the activation of c-Fos(10Reichmann E. Schwarz H. Deiner E.M. Leitner I. Eilers M. Berger J. Busslinger M. Beug H. Cell. 1992; 71: 1103-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggesting that in vivo the gene is regulated by AP-1 family members. In fact, inspection of sequences in the TIMP-1 regulatory region has revealed two potential AP-1 binding sites or TPA response elements; however, neither the element that selectively binds AP-1 in vitro nor the sequence that directs AP-1-dependent transcriptional enhancement in vivo has been identified(5Edwards D.R.

Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several members of the AP-1 family have been shown to have positive (e.g. JunD) or negative (e.g. JunB) effects on transcriptional regulation(11Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Hirai S.-I. Ryseck R.-P. Mechta F. Bravo R. Yaniv M.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 71-79Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ratio of various Jun and Fos proteins expressed in cells may be one determinant of their transcriptional efficacy on target genes. Functionally, AP-1 has been shown to be necessary for collagenase induction by phorbol esters, oncogenes, and α5β1 integrins(14Schonthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Cell. 1988; 54: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 15Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4284-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).The TIMP-1 promoter also has multiple binding sites for Ets transcription factors. One of these sites has been shown to bind Ets in vitro (5Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Like AP-1 and TIMP-1, Ets proteins are serum-inducible. These proteins appear functionally diverse, participating in transcriptional regulation as well as DNA replication and growth control(18Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 19Kraut N. Frampton J. McNagny K.M. Graf T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Ets-related proteins are critical for cellular differentiation(20Klaes A. Menne T. Stollewerk A. Scholz H. Klambt C. Cell. 1994; 78: 149-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Ets proteins appear to bind DNA and to activate transcription as monomers or in complexes with other proteins. For example, Elk-1, an Ets-related protein, forms a ternary complex with serum response factor and is phosphorylated in response to growth factors(22Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).It is widely assumed that AP-1 and c-Ets interact to regulate gene expression, because their binding sites are often juxtaposed in cellular promoters, including TIMP-1, and because the proteins act synergistically at a multimerized viral enhancer site(24Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, such effects have not been documented for cellular promoters, although related proteins such as serum response factor and Elk-1 have been shown to interact(25Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study we used TIMP-1 promoter sequences to examine the transcriptional regulatory proteins that control TIMP-1 transcription and to characterize the interaction of AP-1 and Ets in the context of a cellular promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionMonolayers of F9 embryonic carcinoma cells were grown at 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and Pen-strep (penicillin G at 100 units/ml and streptomycin SO4 at 100 mg/ml). Partially confluent cultures (50-80%) were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure(26Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 27Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Fresh medium was added 1-4 h before the cells were transfected. The calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate was prepared in 125 mM CaCl2, HEPES-buffered saline (pH 6.92, 25 mM HEPES, 0.75 mM Na2HPO4/7 H2O, 140 mM NaCl). The amounts of plasmid transfected were within the linear range of the assay conditions used. In experiments showing an average of two samples, variation between samples was <15%. Cells were incubated for 15 h with precipitate and then either assayed immediately or washed and assayed 24 h later. In experiments in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, the cells were then shocked by the addition of 4 ml of 15% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37°C for 2 min, washed twice with 37°C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), refed with fresh medium, and grown an additional 24 h. In all other transfection experiments the cells were washed once with PBS and immediately scraped from the plates in 1 ml of PBS. The same trends were observed with the use of either transfection method; however, the number of counts/minute tended to be higher for both constitutive and inducible expression in the longer experiments.For chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, the cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS, scraped from the plates in 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in 125 μl of 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and lysed by four cycles of freeze/thaw (−70°C/37°C). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g. CAT activity was assayed in a 1-h incubation with 14C-labeled acetyl coenzyme A, followed by extraction of the labeled acetylated chloramphenicol with ethyl acetate (28Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Scintillation fluor was added to the ethyl acetate supernatant and monitored for radioactivity. β-Galactosidase activity was monitored by adding 50 ml of cell extract to 450 ml β-galactosidase buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM KCl, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The reaction was started by the addition of the substrate, 100 μl of 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase. The samples were then incubated at ambient temperature until the color began to develop, and spectrophotometry was performed at absorbance of 420 nm.Plasmid ConstructionsFragments of the TIMP-1 promoter were inserted upstream of the CAT gene in the polylinker of a promoterless CAT construct, pBLCAT3, or its HSV thymidine kinase promoter-driven derivative, pBLCAT2(29Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 30Rutherford M.N. Hannigan G.E. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The construction of −858/-601 and −834/-601 has been described previously(8Campbell C.E. Flenniken A.M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the derivatives are referred to as pTCAT5′-858 and pTCAT5′-834, respectively. Additional plasmids were made by subcloning restriction enzyme-generated fragments into pBLCAT2 or pBLCAT3 using restriction enzyme cleavage sites at −3450 and −1008 (HindIII), −1320 (KpnI), and −601 (BamHI). The TIMP-1 promoter fragment −1320 to −601 was subcloned as a KpnI-BamHI fragment in which the KpnI site was blunted and inserted into the blunted SalI and BamHI sites of pBLCAT3. The structure referred to as −1008/-601 was isolated as a HindIII-BamHI fragment and inserted into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBLCAT3. The structure −3450/-601 was made by inserting the HindIII fragment −3450/-1008 into the 5′ HindIII site of −1008/-601 in pBLCAT3 and selecting clones with the correct orientation. The two clones −3450/-1008 were made by insertion of the isolated HindIII-cleaved fragment into the HindIII site of pBLCAT2 (tkCAT) or pBLCAT3. Structures in which oligonucleotides with wild-type or mutant AP-1 or Ets sites were inserted upstream of a CAT reporter were made by inserting these sequences into the SalI and XhoI sites of pBLCAT2: wild type, 5′-tcgacTGGATGAGTAATGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTGc-3′; mAP-1, 5′-tcgacTGGATAAGTTATGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTGc-3′; and mEts, 5′-tcgacTGGATGAGTAATGCGTCACTTCAGCCTGc-3′. The wild-type AP-1 and Ets sites (in the first oligonucleotide), the mutant AP-1 site (in the second oligonucleotide), and the mutant Ets site (in the third oligonucleotide) are underlined. The capital letters refer to the TIMP-1 sequence from −847 to −820. The small letters on the left side of the sequences show nucleotides compatible with a SalI-cleaved site, and those on the right show nucleotides compatible with a XhoI-cleaved site. All reporter structures were constructed by using pBLCAT2Bam-, a derivative of pBLCAT2 in which the polylinker BamHI site GGATCC was changed to GC by standard methods; this removed an Ets motif previously reported by Treisman et al. (25Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The mEts oligonucleotide was designed by changing 5 bp of the Ets consensus binding site in the TIMP promoter shown to bind bacterially expressed c-Ets(5Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This site is also identical to the Ets binding site of the polyoma virus enhancer that was used in the initial studies demonstrating interaction between c-Ets and AP-1(24Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 31Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Gel Mobility Shift AssaysAll oligonucleotides were annealed in equimolar amounts and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by desalting through Sephadex G-25 spun columns. The following oligonucleotide was used for gel shift experiments: 5′-TGGATGAGTAATGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTG-3′. This oligonucleotide is identical to the TIMP-1 sequence from −847 to −820 and includes both the AP-1 and Ets binding sites. The larger DNAs used in mobility shift assays were HindIII-BamHI-generated fragments from pTCAT5′-858 and pTCAT5′-834, yielding fragments of 257 or 233 bp. These fragments were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, isolated from the gel, and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by desalting through Sephadex G-50 spun columns. Binding reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Probes and the indicated amounts of bacterially expressed and purified c-Fos and c-Jun (gifts of Geoff Parson and Keith Yamamoto, UCSF) were added to the reactions on ice and brought to ambient temperature for 10-15 min before loading on a low ionic strength (0.5 × TBE (0.045 M Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA)) 6% polyacrylamide gel. The F9 cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Zimarino and Wu(32Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Coimmunoprecipitation AnalysisLabeled c-Ets was prepared in vitro by transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN; 1190 Ci/mmol). The resulting c-Ets protein was then mixed with purified c-Fos and c-Jun and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature. The reactions were diluted 10-fold in buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and precleared by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (100 mg/ml) to 10% for 30 min at 4°C with gentle rotation. Ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) was also added to buffer A to show that AP-1 and c-Ets proteins were binding to one another rather than to contaminating DNA in the protein preparations(33Lai J.-S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). After removal of the Sepharose, affinity purified c-Jun-specific monoclonal antibody (c-Jun/AP-1(N); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and another aliquot of protein A-Sepharose were added before the slurry was incubated at 4°C for 3 h with rotation. The beads were centrifuged and washed 4 times in 20 volumes of buffer A and one time in fresh tubes in buffer A without Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from the beads with sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.RESULTSc-Jun and c-Fos Induce Expression of the TIMP-1 PromoterPrevious analysis of the mouse TIMP-1 promoter identified a sequence that was responsive to serum, phorbol esters, and transforming growth factor-β when placed upstream of a promoterless CAT gene(8Campbell C.E. Flenniken A.M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is located 5′ to the first exon and contains a TPA response element (TRE) similar to the one shown to bind AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) in the collagenase and stromelysin gene promoters (Fig. 1)(34Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 35Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J.

The Hormonal Control Regulation of Gene Transcription. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 235-253Google Scholar). (In this paper, we use the terms c-Fos-c-Jun interchangeably with AP-1.) To determine whether this TRE could be activated directly by AP-1 in vivo, we cotransfected expression vectors for c-Fos and c-Jun with reporter constructs in which regions of the TIMP-1 promoter were placed upstream of a CAT gene. We used F9 cells, which do not have demonstrable AP-1 activity(37Angel P. Smeal T. Meek J. Karin M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 35-43PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested the effect of AP-1 activity on two TIMP-1 promoter sequences, −1320/-601 and −858/-601, that possess a TRE identified by sequence comparison with known transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 1). Cotransfected AP-1 transcriptionally activated both TIMP-1/CAT reporter structures to a similar extent but had virtually no effect on the plasmid that lacked these sequences.By sequence inspection of the TIMP-1 promoter, we identified another potential TRE located at approximately −1600. To determine whether this putative AP-1 binding site also participated in AP-1-mediated transcriptional enhancement in vivo, we compared the response of a variety of TIMP-1 promoter constructs to AP-1 by cotransfection into F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. Whereas AP-1 activated (>10-fold) a TIMP-1/CAT reporter construct containing TIMP-1 sequences between −1008/-601, the promoter region containing the putative TRE between −3450/-1008 was not activated (Fig. 2). Furthermore, this sequence was not by itself transcriptionally responsive to AP-1 when placed upstream of either a promoterless CAT gene or a thymidine kinase promoter-driven CAT gene (Fig. 2). Therefore, our functional studies indicate that a TRE located between −858/-601 is a target for AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation, but the TRE at −1600 is not.Figure 2:AP-1 activates a proximal TRE but not a distal TRE in the TIMP-1 promoter. The Ets binding sites are represented by open ovals. The position of the distal TRE is represented by a shaded rectangle. See the legend to Fig. 1 for an explanation of other symbols. Regions diagrammed below the map were cloned into either pBLCAT3 (CAT) or pBLCAT2 (tkCAT). These structures (2 μg) were transiently transfected into F9 cells in the presence (▪) or the absence (□) of 0.5 μg of AP-1 as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Each data point represents an average of two samples from the same experiment; the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The experiment is representative of several independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the TRE located within the −858/-601 fragment was the DNA binding site that enabled transcriptional activation by AP-1, we next examined the response to AP-1 of an oligonucleotide containing this TRE upstream of a heterologous promoter (tkCAT). Like many other transcription factor binding sites, a single TIMP-1 TRE was not transcriptionally active. However, when three tandem repeats of this site were placed upstream of tkCAT, significant AP-1-dependent transcriptional enhancement was achieved (Fig. 3A). In addition, this TRE bound bacterially expressed and purified c-Jun and c-Fos in vitro, suggesting that the TRE located between −858/-834 is a site of AP-1 action on this promoter (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:A 28-bp TIMP-1 TRE transcriptionally responds to AP-1 in vivo and binds purified c-Jun and c-Fos protein in vitro. A, see the legends to Figure 1:, Figure 2: for an explanation of the symbols. Oligonucleotides containing the TIMP-1 TRE were placed upstream of a tkCAT gene (pBLCAT2) as single (wt × 1) or triple (wt × 3) copies. These plasmids were transiently transfected into F9 cells in the presence or the absence of 0.5 μg of AP-1 as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Each data point represents an average of two samples from the same experiment; the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described in the legend to Fig. 1. This experiment is representative of three independent experiments. B, a TIMP-1 oligonucleotide containing the TIMP-1 TRE at −847/-841 binds purified c-Fos and c-Jun in vitro. 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the TIMP-1 sequence 5′-TGGATGAGTAATGCGTCCAGGAAGCCTG-3′ were incubated with 100 ng of c-Jun and 100 ng of c-Fos proteins expressed and purified from E. coli (lanes 2-5). The underlined sequence is the AP-1 binding site, or TRE. Lane 1, labeled oligonucleotides alone; lane 2, labeled oligonucleotides with added c-Jun and c-Fos proteins; lanes 3-5, same as lane 2, except that unlabeled TIMP-1 oligonucleotides were added in molar excess of labeled oligonideotides as follows: lane 3, 100×; lane 4, 1000×; lane 5, 10,000×. The protein-DNA complex was resolved from unbound DNA by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and is indicated by the upper arrow. The lower arrow indicates DNA not complexed with protein. The audioradiogram was exposed for 48 h at ambient temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test for additional AP-1 binding sites, we used a TIMP-1 reporter construct, −834/-601, in which the TRE had been deleted. Surprisingly, this construct was still AP-1-inducible in F9 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than the −858/-601 construct, suggesting that additional AP-1 binding sites are present in the −834/-601 sequence (Fig. 4).Figure 4:AP-1 responsiveness of a TIMP-1 promoter from which the TRE has been deleted. A, two DNA structures, one containing the TIMP-1 TRE at −858/-601 and one deleted of the TRE (−834/-601), were transiently transfected into F9 cells (-AP-1) or 3T3 cells (+AP-1) in the presence (▪) or the absence (□) of 0.5 μg of AP-1 as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Each data point represents an average of two samples from the same experiment; the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described in the legend to Fig. 1. This experiment is representative of three independent experiments. B, TIMP-1 promoter fragments −858/-601 (lanes 1-6) and −834/-601 (lanes 7-12) were isolated from the gel, labeled, and incubated with c-Jun and c-Fos protein as follows: lanes 1 and 7, labeled oligonucleotides alone; lanes 2 and 8, 100 ng of c-Jun; lanes 3 and 9, 400 ng of c-Jun; lanes 4 and 10, 100 ng of c-Jun and 100 ng of c-Fos; lanes 5 and 11, 200 ng of c-Jun and 200 ng of c-Fos; lanes 6 and 12, 100 ng of c-Jun and 200 ng of c-Fos. The arrows indicate the positions of the protein-DNA complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Constitutive Expression of the TIMP-1 Promoter Is Modulated by Cell-specific FactorsTo examine AP-1-mediated TIMP-1 expression in cells containing endogenous AP-1, we compared the results of transfections done in AP-1-deficient F9 cells with those done in 3T3 fibroblasts, which contain endogenous AP-1 family proteins. In contrast to F9 cells, the −858/-601 TIMP-1 promoter construct was actively transcribed in 3T3 cells in the absence of exogenous AP-1 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the endogenous Jun and Fos proteins present in 3T3 cells are sufficient for TIMP-1 transcriptional activation. This is further supported by the observation that exogenous AP-1 did not substantially increase transcription of −858/-601 in 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). These results are similar to those observed for the stromelysin promoter, in which AP-1 functions in basal level transcription(39Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the TRE between −858 and −834 resulted in a promoter that no longer responded to endogenous AP-1 in 3T3 cells. As in F9 cells, AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation from the −834/-601 promoter construct was achieved only when high levels of AP-1 were provided exogenously (Fig. 4). These data suggest that when the concentration of AP-1 is relatively low, as in 3T3 cells in the absence of cotransfected AP-1, the canonical high affinity AP-1 binding site between −858 and −834 is occupied, resulting in AP-1-dependent transcriptional enhancement. In contrast, under identical conditions, the additional AP-1 site between −834 and −601 is not bound by AP-1 and is incapable of activating transcription. However, as AP-1 protein concentration rises, by introduction via transfection, for example, the alternative AP-1 binding site between −834 and −601 is also used. Although we have not precisely mapped the AP-1 binding site between −834 and −601 functionally, a computer search revealed multiple noncanonical AP-1 sequences (5 of 7 bp match to a canonical AP-1 site). Moreover, c-Jun and c-Fos bound this promoter region (−834/-601) in vitro, although with lower affinity than the TIMP-1 promoter fragment −858/-601 containing the canonical AP-1 site (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that at least two AP-1 binding sites are present in the TIMP-1 promoter: a high affinity site between −858/-834 tha"

Transport kinetics were similar, but not identical, to those determined using the same technique for the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) of Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells (MCT1) (Carpenter, L., and Halestrap, A. P.(1994) Biochem. J. 304, 751-760). Km values for L-lactate (4.7 mM), D-lactate (27 mM), D,L-2-hydroxybutyrate (3.3 mM), L-3-hydroxybutyrate (12.7 mM), and acetoacetate (6.1 mM) were very similar in both cell types, whereas in hepatocytes the Km values were higher than MCT1 for pyruvate (1.3 mM, cf. 0.72 mM), D-3-hydroxybutyrate (24.7 mM, cf. 10.1 mM), L-2-chloropropionate (1.3 mM, cf. 0.8 mM), 4-hydroxybutyrate (18.1 mM, cf. 7.7 mM), and acetate (5.4 mM, cf. 3.7 mM). In contrast, the hepatocyte carrier had lower Km values than MCT1 for glycolate, chloroacetate, dichloroacetate, and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate. Differences in stereoselectivity were also detected; both carriers showed a lower Km for L-lactate than D-lactate, while hepatocyte MCT exhibited a lower Km for D- than L-2-chloropropionate and for L- than D-3-hydroxybutyrate; this is not the case for MCT1. A range of inhibitors of MCT1, including α-cyanocinnamate derivatives, phloretin, and niflumic acid, inhibited hepatocyte MCT with K0.5 values significantly higher than for tumor cell MCT1, while stilbene disulfonate derivatives and p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate had similar K0.5 values in both cell types. The branched chain ketoacids α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate were also potent inhibitors of hepatocyte MCT with K0.5 values of 270 and 340 μM, respectively. The activation energy of L-lactate transport into hepatocytes was 58 kJ mol−1, and measured rates of transport at 37°C were considerably greater than those required for maximal rates of gluconeogenesis. The properties of the hepatocyte monocarboxylate transporter are consistent with the presence of a distinct isoform of MCT in liver cells as suggested by the cloning and sequencing of MCT2 from hamster liver (Garcia, C. K., Brown, M. S., Pathak, R. K., and Goldstein, J. L.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1843-1849).

The most extensively studied MCT is that found in the red blood cell (Deuticke, 1982; Poole and Halestrap, 1993), which has been identified and partially purified in this laboratory (Poole and Halestrap, 1992). N-terminal sequencing (Poole and Halestrap, 1994) has shown it to be the same as the transporter recently cloned and sequenced from Chinese hamster ovary cells and named MCT1 (Garcia et al., 1994). Detailed studies of the kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity of monocarboxylate transport into heart cells has indicated that this tissue contains two isoforms of MCT that each have properties distinct from MCT1 (Poole et al., 1989, 1990; Wang et al., 1993, 1994, 1995). Immunofluorescent studies using MCT1-specific antibodies have shown that heart cells also contain a small amount of MCT1, but this is confined to the intercalated disk region (Garcia et al., 1994). Data from other laboratories suggest that the transporter found in skeletal muscle is yet another isoform (see Roth(1991) and Poole and Halestrap(1993)), and immunofluorescent studies of white muscle support these conclusions (Garcia et al., 1994). monocarboxylate transporter 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate 4,4′-dibenzamidostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate α-ketoisocaproate α-ketoisovalerate 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The hepatocyte requires a very rapid transport mechanism for the uptake of lactic acid for gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis while lactic acid efflux occurs under hypoxic conditions. In addition, the liver is the major producer of ketone bodies and exports acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyric acid during fasting or endurance exercise (see Poole and Halestrap(1993)). Lactate transport into liver cells has been investigated in this and other laboratories using radioactive tracer techniques (see Poole and Halestrap(1993)). Although some studies have been performed in vivo (Lupo et al., 1990), in the perfused liver (Schwab et al., 1979; Bracht et al., 1981) and in isolated liver plasma membrane vesicles (Quintana et al., 1988), it is doubtful whether these systems allow accurate kinetic analysis of the transporter itself (see Poole and Halestrap(1993)). Isolated hepatocytes are more suitable and have been used in this and other laboratories (Monson et al., 1982; Fafournoux et al., 1985a; Edlund and Halestrap, 1988; Metcalfe et al., 1986). However, to resolve the true initial rates of transport, we have found it necessary to work at low temperatures (0°C) and to measure transport over very short time periods (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). At more physiological temperatures, the rapid and extensive uptake of labeled lactate may well represent metabolism rather than transport. The limited studies on the kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity of the hepatocyte monocarboxylate transporter performed in this way have confirmed that its properties are similar to those of MCT1. However, using immunofluorescent microscopy, Garcia et al. (1994) have shown that Syrian hamster hepatocytes contain little or no MCT1. Very recently, these workers have cloned and sequenced an MCT-related cDNA derived from hamster liver and have shown that when expressed in insect Sf9 cells using baculovirus, it stimulated pyruvate transport activity. This new isoform of MCT, named MCT2, is 60% identical to MCT1, and its transport activity is inhibited by phloretin and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) but apparently not by organomercurials. However, only very limited functional studies of MCT2 were performed, and it is clearly important for the properties of the new isoform to be fully characterized. In this paper, we have used the intracellular pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) to provide such a detailed analysis of the kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity of monocarboxylate transport in rat hepatocytes as we have done previously in Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994) and isolated cardiac myocytes (Wang et al., 1994, 1995). Since fluorescence can be measured continuously with a very rapid time resolution, the technique produces both more accurate measurements of transport rates and allows them to be made at higher, more physiological temperatures and with any substrate. Our results confirm that the kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificity of MCT in liver cells are similar to those of MCT1 but with some significant differences that may relate to its biological function or regulation. We also demonstrate that the transporter is capable of transporting L-lactate at rates considerably faster than required for maximum rates of metabolism, implying that the carrier is unlikely to be a major site of regulation of lactate metabolism under physiological conditions. Chemicals and biochemicals, including all substrates and inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporter, were obtained from sources given previously (Poole and Halestrap, 1988, 1991; Poole et al. 1990; Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). Hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988) using collagenase digestion of livers from 250-g male Wistar rats starved overnight. Cells were >95% viable (trypan blue exclusion) and were stored on ice at about 20 mg of protein/ml of bicarbonate-buffered saline medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin under an atmosphere of O2/CO2 (19/1). The hepatocytes were washed once in bicarbonate-buffered saline without albumin before resuspending at 20 mg of protein/ml in the same buffer supplemented with acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF (10 μM). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min before centrifugation and washed three times in the HEPES/MOPS-buffered saline medium (150 mM Na+, 5 mM K+, 150 mM Cl−, 1 mM Ca2+, 1 mM sulfate, 1 mM phosphate, 3.3 mM MOPS, 10 mM HEPES brought to pH 7.4 at 25°C using NaOH). The loaded cells were stored on ice, protected from light at about 1 × 107 cells/ml (approximately 20 mg of protein/ml) until use, and showed no detectable deterioration for at least 3 h. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the cells loaded with BCECF (final concentration of approximately 1.5 × 106 cells per ml) was added to 3 ml of HEPES/MOPS-buffered saline medium contained in a 4-ml fluorescence cuvette. The cells were kept in suspension by constant stirring using an overhead paddle stirrer integral to the cuvette holder of the fluorimeter, which was maintained at the required temperature (usually 25°C) by water circulation. BCECF fluorescence was measured as described previously, using dual wavelength excitation at 450 and 500 nm (2-nm slit widths, oscillating frequency of 397 Hz) with emission (>520 nm using a cut-off filter) detected with a photomultiplier orientated at 90° to the incident light and in close proximity to the cuvette. The ratio of fluorescent light corresponding to the two excitation wavelengths (the 450/500 ratio) was determined electronically, and the resulting signal was averaged by computer to give 2-4 data points per second, which were displayed in real time and stored for further data analysis using our own software. The 450/500 ratio provides a measure of pHi, which minimizes errors due to light scattering of the sample and loss of BCECF from the cell by bleaching or diffusion (Eisner et al., 1989). Once the fluorescence signal from the cell suspension had reached a steady state, usually after 1 min, substrates (neutralized as the sodium salts) were added to the suspension through a light-sealed addition port, and the subsequent fluorescence change was monitored. The initial rate of the fluorescence change was determined by fitting the data to a first order progress curve using Fig P and PFit software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The first two data points were omitted since these incorporated errors associated with the mixing time and addition artifacts. Whenever additions of colored reagents were made to the standard assay buffer, it was confirmed that these had no effect on the 450/500 fluorescence ratio. To calibrate the BCECF 450/500 flourescence ratio in terms of pHi the null-point technique was used (Eisner et al., 1989). This avoids the use of nigericin and the associated risk of contaminating the apparatus with the ionophore. In this technique, defined mixtures of sodium butyrate (a weak permeant acid) and trimethylamine hydrochloride (a weak permeant base) were added to the cell suspension until a mixture was found that gave no change in fluorescence. The pHi was then calculated using the formula derived by Eisner et al. (1989) and consistently gave a value for pHi of 7.5 under our normal incubation conditions. This is the same value as determined by others in HEPES-buffered saline using 14C-labeled 5,5′-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (McGivan, 1979) and is higher than usually observed in bicarbonate buffered media. This probably reflects the absence of HCO3−/CO2 acidifying pathways that compensate acid extrusion pathways in the homeostatic regulation of pHi (Frelin et al., 1988). The rate of carrier-mediated transport was calculated as a rate of proton uptake in nmol/μl intracellular volume from the initial rate of fluorescence change, determined by first order curve fitting as above, using the change in fluorescence ratio at equilibrium following the addition of increasing concentrations of butyrate. This weak acid rapidly enters the cells as the undissociated acid and equilibrates according to the pH gradient as follows: [Butyrate]in/[Butyrate]out = [H+]out/[H+]in. Thus, from the pH gradient estimated as above and from the initial slope of a plot of [butyrate] added against the change in fluorescence ratio observed at equilibrium (Fig. 1), changes in fluorescence ratio can be converted into uptakes of protons in nmol of H+/μl of intracellular volume (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). However, a problem we have encountered when applying this technique to liver cells is the variable contribution of autofluorescence to the 450/500 fluorescence ratio. Whereas in tumor cells we found autofluorescence to account for <10% of the signal and thus the calibration curve to be highly reproducible between experiments, in liver cells autofluorescence was much greater and represented 20-50% of the signal observed depending on the initial loading with BCECF and its subsequent bleaching or leakage from the cell. A major contributor to the autofluorescence was probably mitochondrial flavoproteins and cytochromes, which are present at high concentrations in liver cells. To circumvent this problem, detailed calibration curves were performed on three separate occasions and used to determine accurate rates of L-lactate transport into the same cells. From these values, a mean rate of transport of 5 mML-lactate transport (in nmol/μl/min) was obtained. In subsequent experiments, the rate of transport at 5 mML-lactate was used as a reference point, and all other rates were corrected to absolute values by reference to this rate. It should be noted that the only parameter influenced by this correction is the Vmax of the transporter; Km and K0.5 values are independent of the correction value used. We are aware that our methodology also fails to take account of intracellular compartmentation of BCECF, for example into mitochondria. However, this is unlikely to invalidate our results since we measured initial rates of the change in fluorescence ratio following addition of monocarboxylates, and the cytosolic dye will be the first to see the intracellular monocarboxylates and associated influx of protons. Calculation of kinetic constants was performed using non-linear least squares regression analysis of the data to the relevant kinetic equation using Fig P and PFit software (Biosoft). These analyses routinely produced standard errors for each parameter of <20% of the parameter value, but in most cases several experiments were performed on separate cell preparations, and the derived parameter values are expressed as means ± S.E. Fig. 1 shows the maximum change in 500/450 fluorescence ratio that occurred following addition of increasing concentrations of butyrate or lactate. Mean data from three separate experiments are presented. The initial slope of the curve for butyrate was calculated by interpolation to be 25 mV per mM butyrate added. Since the pH gradient across the plasma membrane was 0.1 alkaline inside, this represents 20 mV per mM intracellular butyrate or 20 mV per nmol of proton transported across the plasma membrane per μl of intracellular volume (see Carpenter and Halestrap(1994)). Thus, from an initial rate of change of fluorescence ratio per second (ΔF), the initial rate of substrate transport (V) can be calculated in nmol min−1 per ml of intracellular space as follows: V = ΔF × 60/20 or V = 3ΔF. This calculation assumes that the proton:lactate stoichiometry is 1:1, as we have shown previously for MCT in tumor cells (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994) and heart cells (Wang et al., 1994). The assumption is further justified by the similarity of the maximum change in pHi induced by increasing concentrations of butyrate and L-lactate shown in Fig. 1. In the same three experiments, the initial rate of fluorescence ratio change upon addition of 5 mML-lactate was 3.53 ± 0.07 s−1 when calculated by first order regression analysis of the data as described in the legend to Fig. 2. This represents an initial rate of lactate transport of 10.2 ± 0.2 nmol min−1 per μl of intracellular space. In all subsequent experiments, the initial rate of change of fluorescence ratio observed with 5 mML-lactate (ΔFlac) was used as a reference for the determination of the rates of transport of other substrates in nmol min−1 per μl intracellular space (V) from their initial rate of change of fluorescence ratio (ΔF) as follows: V = 10.2 ×ΔF/ΔFlac. The possibility that pH regulatory processes might lead to an underestimate of the true rates of transport using this technique was considered. However, the absence of bicarbonate in the buffer prevented bicarbonate-dependent processes operating, while interference by the Na+/H+ antiporter appeared minimal since addition of 0.1 mM dimethyl-amiloride was without effect on the initial rate of change fluorescence ratio, although the return of pHi to normal levels following monocarboxylate-induced acidification was slowed by its presence (data not shown). In Fig. 2a, we show the time courses of the change in 500/450 fluorescence ratio upon addition of increasing concentrations of L-lactate in the presence and absence of 5 mM CHC. These time courses can be analyzed by first order regression analysis as shown in Fig. 2b, and this allows calculation of true initial rates of transport. In Fig. 3, mean rates of transport from the three experiments used for the calibration in Fig. 1 are fitted by non-linear least squares analysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and it is apparent that the fit of the data is very good. In previous experiments involving the uptake of 14C substrates at 0°C, it was found necessary to subtract the rate of transport observed in the presence of 5 mM CHC to obtain a good fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The CHC-insensitive rate was taken to represent both the free diffusion of undissociated monocarboxylic acid and entry of the carboxylate anion through an anion channel (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). However, it is clear from the data presented in Fig. 3 that such a correction was unnecessary at 25°C, where CHC almost totally abolished L-lactate uptake. Indeed, the rate of transport in the presence of CHC still showed a hyperbolic relationship with substrate concentration, implying that residual transport was on the carrier and not by diffusion. This contrasts with the situation at 0°C, where the CHC-insensitive rate of transport increased linearly with substrate concentration as predicted for free diffusion. The temperature dependence of diffusion is expected to be less than that of carrier-mediated transport, and thus the greater relative contribution of diffusion to the overall transport rate at 0°C is not surprising. Table 1 presents the Km and Vmax values for a variety of different monocarboxylates determined in the same manner as described for L-lactate. In each case, the initial rate of change of the 500/450 fluorescence ratio was determined by first order analysis for at least eight substrate concentrations, where possible distributed at either side of the Km. The resulting data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the best-fit values of Km and Vmax were derived. The data in Table 1 are the means ± S.E. of these values from the number of experiments shown, each involving a different liver cell preparation. For comparison, data are also presented for the kinetics of MCT1 from Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells obtained under similar conditions (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). For all but two (acetate and 4-hydroxybutyrate) of the wide variety of substrates shown in Table 1, transport into hepatocytes was inhibited >90% by 5 mM CHC even at the highest substrate concentrations used, confirming that almost all transport was via the monocarboxylate transporter. Thus, diffusion rates could be ignored. However, for acetate and 4-hydroxybutyrate, it was found necessary to correct for diffusion of the undissociated acid before fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the rate of acetate uptake in the presence of 5 mM CHC is seen to increase linearly with the acetate concentration, indicative of free diffusion. This is to be expected, since the high pKa of acetic acid (4.8) and the lipid solubility of the undissociated acid support rapid rates of diffusion of acetic acid across phospholipid membranes. In this case, data could be successfully fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by subtracting the CHC-insensitive rate as indicated in Fig. 3, and it is the kinetic parameters derived in this manner that are reported in Table 1. In the case of propionate, the rate of diffusion (CHC-insensitive) was so great that it was impossible to determine accurately the kinetics of transport via the monocarboxylate transporter.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab 2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropionate was found to be a poor substrate with a low Vmax and high Km. Other poor substrates were formate, glyoxylate, and oxamate, and this is reflected in the large errors in their derived Km and Vmax values. The branched chain monocarboxylates α-ketoisovalerate (KIV) and α-ketoisocaproate (KIC) were also tested as substrates but were found to be transported very poorly, as shown in Fig. 4. Indeed, an initial burst of transport was followed by a very slow rate of transport, which was also associated with an inhibition of lactate transport as shown by the poor response to 5 mM lactate added subsequently (Fig. 4). Addition of increasing concentrations of KIC and KIV prior to addition of 5 mML-lactate allowed K0.5 values of these monocarboxylates to be determined as shown in Fig. 5. The mean K0.5 values determined from three separate experiments were 270 ± 28 and 342 ± 40 μM, respectively, while in a single experiment the value for phenylpyruvate was 4.78 mM.Figure 5:Inhibition of the initial rate of L-lactate transport into hepatocytes by increasing concentrations of KIC and KIV. Hepatocytes were preincubated with KIC or KIV at the concentrations shown for 2 min before addition of 5 mML-lactate and measurement of the initial rate of increase in the 500/450 fluorescence ratio. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (error bars) of three separate experiments. K0.5 values (±S.E.) derived by least squares inhibition of the data shown to the equation Inhibition rate as % control rate = 100/(1 + [I]/K0.5) were 288 ± 21 and 347 ± 24 μM for KIC and KIV, respectively. Mean values derived from the three separate experiments are given in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 6, we present data showing the inhibition of the transport of 5 mML-lactate into liver cells by increasing concentrations of some well established inhibitors of MCT1. These are CHC and DIDS (Fig. 6a), DBDS and phloretin (Fig. 6b) and pCMBS (Fig. 6c). Data were fitted by least squares regression analysis to a non-competitive model of inhibition, and thus the derived K0.5 values cannot strictly be regarded as a Ki since it is likely that, in some cases (e.g. the stilbene disulfonates), inhibition is actually competitive (Poole and Halestrap, 1993). The rather large errors shown for pCMBS, especially at concentrations close to the K0.5, reflect considerable variation in the inhibition observed from day to day. In two out of four experiments, a sigmoid inhibition curve was observed, while in two other experiments it was hyperbolic. Although we have no certain explanation for this observation, it is possible that the difference represents the presence of variable quantities of other reactive thiols in the cell suspension that are preferentially attacked by pCMBS. Table 2 summarizes K0.5 values derived from several experiments on different hepatocyte preparations (expressed as means ± S.E.) and also presents values for MCT1 in Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells measured under similar conditions (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In Fig. 7, we present data illustrating the effect of temperature on the rate of transport of 5 mML-lactate into hepatocytes. The initial rates of L-lactate transport were calculated from the traces of Fig. 7a by first order analysis of the traces shown and plotted as an Arrhenius plot (LnV against 1/T), which is shown in Fig. 7b. The slope of the linear plot gave an activation energy of 58 kJ mol−1, while in four separate experiments in which rates of transport of 5 mML-lactate were measured at both 25 and 37°C, the first order rate constant for uptake was 2.31 ± 0.28 greater at 37°C than 25°C. This corresponds to an activation energy of 53.4 ± 6.5 kJ mol−1, which is slightly less than obtained for the complete plot shown in Fig. 7b. For some substrates and inhibitors, we determined Km or K0.5 values at 4°C using the BCECF technique. The mean Km values (±S.E. of the number experiments indicated) for L-lactate, D-2-chloropropionate, and L-2-chloropropionate were 2.49 ± 0.18(5Eisner D.A. Kenning S.C. O'Neil S.C. Pocock G. Richard C.D. Valdeolmillos A. Pflugers Arch. 1989; 413: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), 0.35 ± 0.10(3Deuticke B. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 70: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and 0.78 ± 0.22 mM(3Deuticke B. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 70: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), respectively, while in two separate experiments the derived values for pyruvate were 0.9 and 0.4 mM and for dichloroacetate were 0.26 and 0.20 mM. Comparison with the data in Table 1 suggests that in all cases, these values are about half those observed at 25°C. A similar effect was seen on the K0.5 for DBDS, which in two experiments at 4°C was found to be 131 and 78 μM compared to the mean value of 181 ± 20 μM at 25°C. In Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells, it was also observed that Km values measured at temperatures below 15°C were about half those measured at higher temperatures (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). The data we present in this paper provide a detailed characterization of monocarboxylate transport into rat hepatocytes. The Km values for L-lactate (2.5 mM) and pyruvate (0.56 mM) determined at 4°C in the present paper are in excellent agreement with those we determined previously at 0°C using the radioactive technique (2.42 and 0.63 mM, respectively) (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). From the activation energy (58 kJ mol−1) and Vmax value at 25°C (20.5 nmol min−1 per μl of intracellular volume) determined in the present paper, the predicted Vmax at 0°C would be 2.4 nmol min−1 per μl compared with the measured value of 3.3 nmol min−1 per μl (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). Our data also confirm our previous conclusion (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988; Poole and Halestrap, 1993) that kinetic parameters derived by others using radioactive tracer techniques at higher temperatures (Fafournoux et al., 1985a; Monson et al., 1982) probably underestimated true initial rates of transport. In contrast to Fafournoux et al. (1985b), we find no evidence for the presence of a specific propionate transporter in rat hepatocytes. The K0.5 value for CHC reported here (373 μM) compares with a non-competitive Ki value of 214 μM determined radioactively at 0°C (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). The difference between these values may be a consequence of both the different pH gradient and temperature used in the two studies, both of which would influence K0.5 values in the observed direction (Poole and Halestrap, 1993; Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). We showed previously that DIDS, pCMBS, and quercetin (a phloretin analogue) can inhibit L-lactate transport into rat hepatocytes, but no detailed studies were made (Edlund and Halestrap, 1988). The data presented in Table 1 demonstrate that the substrate specificity of the rat hepatocyte MCT is similar to that of MCT1 but also indicate some clear differences. Both carriers have a broad specificity for short chain monocarboxylates with side chains of 1-4 carbon atoms, which may be variously substituted on positions 2, 3, or 4. Chlorine is the preferred substitution, followed by the oxo and hydroxyl groups. Formate, oxamate, glyoxylate, and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate are poor substrates for both isoforms, although the liver cell isoform appeared to have a slightly greater affinity. Both transporters exhibit a Km for the L-lactate about 5-fold less than that for the D-isomer while the Vmax values are similar for both isomers. In contrast, for both the hepatocyte and tumor cell MCT, the Vmax for transport of L-3-hydroxybutyrate is about half that of the D-isomer. However, L-3-hydroxybutyrate has a 2-fold lower Km for liver MCT than the D-isomer, while tumor cell MCT1 shows no difference in the Km values between the two stereoisomers. Tumor cell MCT1 also demonstrates no significant stereoselectivity for D-2-chloropropionate over the L-isomer, while hepatocyte MCT has a lower Km for the D- than the L-isomer; both isomers have the same Vmax. The Vmax values for 2-chloropropionate, chloroacetate, dichloroacetate, and pyruvate are all significantly less (50-70%) than for lactate for both the tumor cell and hepatocyte carriers. The branched chain keto acids KIC and KIV show an initial rapid rate of transport followed by very slow uptake, which is associated with inhibition of the subsequent uptake of lactate (Fig. 4) for which K0.5 values are similar to CHC (Fig. 5). This phenomenon was also observed in tumor cells (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). We have argued previously it may reflect an initial rapid carrier-mediated entry of these monocarboxylates into the cell where some substrate, rather than being released, forms an inactive carrier-substrate complex involving tight binding of the substrate to a hydrophobic pocket on the inner face of the carrier (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994). Previous data from other laboratories have suggested the existence of both sodium-dependent and independent transport mechanisms for KIV and KIC in freshly isolated and cultured hepatocytes, both inhibitable by pyruvate (Kilberg and Gwynn, 1983; Nalecz et al., 1984). However, the relationship between these earlier studies using radiotracer techniques and the present ones is not obvious. Of the other inhibitors tested, none was found that inhibited either isoform specifically, but there were differences observed in some of the K0.5 values. In particular, phloretin, niflumic acid, and α-cyano-β-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)-acrylate were 4-5-fold less potent as inhibitors of L-lactate transport into hepatocytes than tumor cells, while CHC was about half as effective. In contrast, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was a more potent inhibitor of transport into hepatocytes. The stilbene disulfonates DIDS, SITS, and DBDS have similar K0.5 values for the two transporters as does pCMBS. Taken together, our results suggest that the MCT present in rat liver cells is similar but distinct from MCT1. The recent cloning of MCT2 from hamster liver cells supports this conclusion (Garcia et al., 1995). However, the properties of MCT2 expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression appear to show some differences to those observed in the present paper. In particular, MCT2 appeared to be insensitive to organomercurials unlike MCT1 and to have a higher affinity for CHC and pyruvate than MCT1. This is clearly inconsistent with the results presented here. Furthermore, the Km values for pyruvate and the K0.5 values for CHC and phloretin were severalfold higher than reported here. These differences may reflect the different membrane environment of the transporter in the insect cells but may also be a consequence of the radioactive transport assay used by Garcia et al. (1995). They utilized the accumulation of 0.5 mM [14C]pyruvate after 1 min by transformed cells; this is likely to represent the combination of pyruvate transport and metabolism (see Poole and Halestrap(1993)). If significant metabolism of the labeled pyruvate were to occur over this time period, this technique would not provide a reliable measurement of initial rates of transport. Although we cannot be certain that the kinetics we observe with isolated rat hepatocytes represent rat MCT2, Garcia et al. (1995) were unable to demonstrate the presence of any MCT1 in hamster liver cells using an MCT1-specific antibody. Thus, it seems probable that the kinetics we describe represent those of MCT2 in its natural environment. The differences we have observed in the properties of MCT1 and MCT2 using the BCECF technique are modest and give few clues as to what advantages there are in having a different MCT isoform in liver. Both MCT1 and MCT2 have similar affinities and activities for the major physiological substrates pyruvate, L-lactate, and the ketone bodies acetate, 3-oxobutyrate (acetoacetate), and D-3-hydroxybutyrate (β-hydroxybutyrate). Surprisingly, the liver isoform appears to have a lower affinity for D-β-hydroxybutyrate than MCT1 despite the liver being the major site of ketone body production. However the kinetics have only been measured for influx, while ketone bodies are exported from the liver, and the Km for efflux may be different from that for influx (Wang et al., 1994). An alternative reason for the presence of a different isoform of MCT in liver would be a need for tissue-specific regulation of MCT expression. Indeed, a stimulation of the liver monocarboxylate transporter has been reported following starvation or diabetes and by hormone treatment of isolated hepatocytes (Metcalfe et al., 1986). From the temperature dependence of the transporter, the maximum rate of transport at 37°C can be estimated to be about 50 nmol min−1 per μl of intracellular volume. This translates into a transport rate of 100 nmol min−1 per mg of protein, which can be compared with maximal rates of gluconeogenesis from L-lactate in starved hepatocytes of about 8 nmol glucose min−1 per mg of protein (Quinlan and Halestrap, 1986; Groen et al., 1983). Although two L-lactic acid molecules are required to make a glucose, it would still appear that the carrier is unlikely to present a major limitation on the rate of gluconeogenesis despite suggestions to the contrary made by others (Metcalfe et al., 1986). This conclusion is in agreement with measurements made of intracellular lactate and pyruvate concentrations in hepatocytes under conditions of rapid gluconeogenesis (Groen et al., 1983). Our data also confirm the widely held view that lactate, pyruvate, and the ketone bodies equilibrate across the liver cell plasma membrane, allowing extracellular lactate/pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratios to be used to estimate cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratios, respectively (see Tischler et al. (1977), Groen et al. (1983), and Poole and Halestrap(1993)). We thank the Wellcome Trust and the University of Bristol for financial support and Dr R. C. Poole for helpful discussions."

Despite their almost identical folds, the dimeric structures formed by the two MBP CRDs differ dramatically. Complexes of MBP-C with methyl glycosides of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose were prepared by soaking MBP-C crystals in solutions containing these sugars. Surprisingly, the pyranose ring of mannose is rotated 180° relative to the orientation observed previously in MBP-A, but the local interactions between sugar and protein are preserved. For each of the bound sugars, vicinal, equatorial hydroxyl groups equivalent to the 3- and 4-OH groups of mannose directly coordinate Ca2+ and form hydrogen bonds with residues also serving as Ca2+ ligands. Few interactions are observed between other parts of the sugar and the protein. A complex formed between free galactose and MBP-C reveals a similar mode of binding, with the anomeric hydroxyl group serving as one of the Ca2+ ligands. A second binding site for mannose has also been observed in one of two copies in the asymmetric unit at a sugar concentration of 1.3 M.

In the present study, we show in NIH3T3 fibroblasts that activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway by either specific extracellular stress stimuli or via induction of MEKK, an upstream kinase of SAPK, results in MKP-1 gene expression. In contrast, selective stimulation of the ERK pathway by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or following expression of constitutively active MEK, the upstream dual specificity kinase of ERK did not induce the transcription of MKP-1. Hence, these findings demonstrate the existence of cross-talk between the ERK and SAPK signaling cascades since activation of SAPK induced the expression of MKP-1 that can inactivate ERK.

Here, insulin-dependent insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation was examined with recombinant insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) as the substrate and shown to be 3-fold greater in cells with suppressed LAR levels. Consistent with a receptor level effect, in vivo insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and Shc was increased by a similar 3-fold with LAR suppression. These increases in IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation were paralleled by increases in insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase association with IRS-1 and activation of the MAP kinase pathway.Reduced LAR levels also resulted in increases of over 300% and 250% in epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, respectively, as well as a severalfold increase in substrate tyrosine phosphorylation.

Insulin-responsive tissues such as liver express receptor tyrosine kinases other than the insulin receptor, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor. These receptors share many characteristics with the insulin receptor. Upon binding the appropriate ligand, the kinase activity of these receptors increases, resulting in autophosphorylation and intracellular substrate phosphorylation (reviewed in (24Galimi F.

Since signaling via these receptors is most likely influenced by the activity of counter-regulatory PTPases, the effect of reduced LAR levels on EGF receptor and HGF receptor signaling was also examined.

HGF was a generous gift from Dr. Craig Orlowski (University of Rochester), and the insulin receptor antibody was kindly provided by Dr. James N. Livingston (Bayer Pharmaceutical Division). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were purchased from Amersham. Other materials were obtained as described previously(5Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol.

Equivalent numbers of null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were placed in 10-cm culture dishes. Following a 24-h incubation in serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the subconfluent monolayers were incubated for 15 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Following growth factor treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, harvested in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate) and homogenized in a hand-driven glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the clarified supernatants were normalized to protein content (Bio-Rad).

Data generated from Western blot analysis were densitometrically scanned on an XRS image scanner (XRS, Torrance, CA) dedicated to a SUNOS computer (Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, CA). Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Insulin receptors were then partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography as described previously(6Kulas D.T. Zhang W.

Receptors were incubated with 0.2 μg of recombinant IRS-1 (UBI) as an exogenous substrate for 5 min in the presence of 1 mM orthovanadate, 10 mM MnCl2, and 5 μCi of tracer [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were hormone-treated and harvested as described(6Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were treated with the indicated growth factor and harvested in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EGTA. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the clarified supernatants were normalized to protein content (Bio-Rad). For the MAP kinase kinase assay, an equal volume of total cell lysate was mixed with a reaction mixture containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 μCi/μl tracer [γ-32P]ATP. 1 μg of GST-MAP kinase (UBI) was then added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution with lysis buffer containing 1 mM ATP. After washing the agarose beads 3 times with lysis buffer, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Phosphorylated GST-MAP kinase was detected by autoradiography. The MAP kinase assay was performed similarly. MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from growth factor treated cells with a MAP kinase antibody (UBI). To the immunoprecipitate was added a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 0.1 mg/ml protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), and 2 μM ATP containing 0.01 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The phosphorylated proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. Our previous work demonstrated that a specific 63% reduction in LAR protein levels in the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 resulted in a 350% increase in insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase activation(6Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This increase in PI 3-kinase activation could have resulted if LAR was exerting its effect either at the level of the insulin receptor or a post-receptor substrate, such as IRS-1. To investigate the site of LAR action further, the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor was examined by using recombinant IRS-1 as the in vitro substrate. Null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of insulin for 5 min. Receptors were isolated by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to a tyrosine kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1, LAR antisense suppression resulted in a 3.1 ± 0.2 (mean ± 1/2 range)-fold greater increase in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation at 100 nM insulin when compared with null vector expressing cells. Analysis of kinase activity at 1 nM insulin required longer exposures but demonstrated a 2.6 ± 0.1 (mean ± 1/2 range) greater increase in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in LAR antisense expressing cells. Insulin receptor autophosphorylation can be seen in Fig. 1 also. Consistent with the difference in IRS-1 phosphorylation, insulin receptor phosphorylation was greater in the LAR antisense expressing cells than the null vector expressing cells. These LAR-dependent increases in insulin receptor activation were seen only when insulin was added to intact cells. When insulin receptors were isolated from null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells prior to insulin treatment, there was no difference in insulin receptor autophosphorylation(6Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This latter control experiment demonstrates that the increased insulin receptor activation in LAR antisense expressing cells was not due to events occurring during or after cell lysis. In addition, Western blot analysis confirmed the previously reported finding (6Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that an equivalent number of insulin receptors was isolated from null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells under these conditions (data not shown). Demonstrating that LAR suppression increased by 3-fold, insulin-dependent insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation implicated the insulin receptor as a primary site of LAR action. To support this premise, two insulin receptor-dependent pathways were examined: IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. If LAR functions at the level of the insulin receptor, then both insulin-dependent substrate phosphorylations should be increased when LAR levels were suppressed. To investigate the effect of LAR on IRS-1, null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were treated for 5 min with the indicated concentrations of insulin. After solubilization, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an IRS-1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then tested for the presence of phosphotyrosine by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by approximately 3-fold in LAR antisense expressing cells. Since insulin-dependent association of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 is thought to result from an increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J.

As shown by Fig. 2B, IRS-1/PI 3-kinase association was increased after insulin treatment in LAR antisense expressing cells. The presence of PI 3-kinase mass in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from null vector expressing cells was undetectable. This is not a surprising result. When PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates was measured, a dose-dependent increase in PI 3-kinase activation was observed in both null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells after insulin treatment(6Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase activity seen in LAR antisense expressing cells after 1 nM insulin treatment, however, was approximately 75% greater than that seen in null vector expressing cells after 100 nM insulin treatment. A second important post-receptor response to insulin treatment involves Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown by Fig. 3A, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is also increased by at least 3-fold in LAR antisense expressing cells. Since recent work has indicated that insulin treatment increases MAP kinase activity through a cascade involving Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of p21ras(15Skolnik E.Y.

Null vector and LAR antisense expressing cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of insulin for 5 min. To directly assess MAP kinase activity, lysates were immunoprecipitated with a MAP kinase antibody. Myelin basic protein was then used as a substrate to measure MAP kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, reduction of LAR levels resulted in a severalfold increase in MAP kinase activity. MAP kinase is activated by phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine residues by MAP kinase kinase (or MEK), which is highly specific for MAP kinase. Since recent work has suggested that mitogen-induced threonine/tyrosine-protein phosphatases can affect MAP kinase activity(31Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K.

Science. 1994; 266: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), MAP kinase kinase was examined specifically to rule out the possibility that LAR directly affects MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 3C, suppression of LAR resulted in up to a 4-fold increase in MAP kinase kinase activity. These results demonstrate that reduced LAR levels affected insulin-dependent MAP kinase activation and PI 3-kinase activation to a similar degree, which is consistent with a receptor level site of action. In addition to its reported in vitro activity toward the insulin receptor, LAR has also been shown to have in vitro activity toward the EGF receptor(34Hashimoto N. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since the EGF and HGF receptors are important receptors on hepatocytes, these receptors were examined specifically to determine whether LAR modulates the activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases within the intact cell. McA-RH7777 cells were treated for 1 min with 100 ng/ml EGF, 10 ng/ml HGF, or 100 nM insulin. The respective receptors were then immunoprecipitated and examined specifically for phosphotyrosine content by Western blot analysis. As expected, growth factor treatment resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation for each of the receptors (Fig. 4). When LAR levels were suppressed, however, EGF receptor, HGF receptor, and insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were increased by 3.1 ± 0.4-fold (mean ± S.D.), 2.6 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± 1/2 range), and 1.8 ± 0.2 fold (mean ± S.D.), respectively. Compatible with a growth factor-dependent increase in receptor tyrosine kinase activation, an HGF-dependent phosphotyrosine substrate of 110 kDa was observed in HGF receptor immunoprecipitates from LAR antisense expressing cells. This receptor-associated band is consistent with previous reports(35Komada M. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16131-16136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a ligand-dependent 55-kDa phosphotyrosine protein (pp55) was observed in EGF receptor immunoprecipitates from LAR antisense expressing cells. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of similar molecular weight has been shown to associate with the EGF receptor frequently after EGF treatment (36Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I.

These HGF-dependent and EGF-dependent substrates were undetectable in immunoprecipitates from null vector expressing cells unless longer exposures were obtained. This is consistent with a stronger ligand-mediated response with suppression of LAR levels. As expected, there were no substrates found within the insulin receptor immunoprecipitates. The predominant substrate of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), does not associate to an appreciable degree with the insulin receptor. The phosphotyrosine band appearing at 85 kDa has been shown to be a proteolytic fragment of the insulin receptor. An important post-receptor response to EGF, HGF, and insulin treatment is MAP kinase activation(40Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M.

One, Hcam1 (PDE1A3), corresponds to the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE (PDE1A2). The second, Hcam3 (PDE1C), represents a novel phosphodiesterase gene. Hcam1 encodes a 535-amino acid protein that differs most notably from the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE by the presence of a 14-amino acid insertion and a divergent carboxyl terminus. RNase protection studies indicated that Hcam1 is represented in human RNA from several tissues, including brain, kidney, testes, and heart. Two carboxyl-terminal splice variants for Hcam3 were isolated. One, Hcam3b (PDE1C1), encodes a protein 634 amino acids (72 kDa) in length. The other, Hcam3a (PDE1C3), diverges from Hcam3b 4 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Hcam3b, and extends an additional 79 amino acids. All the cDNAs isolated for Hcam3a are incomplete; they do not include the 5′-end of the open reading frame. Northern analysis revealed that both splice variants were expressed in several tissues, including brain and heart, and that there may be additional splice variants. Amino-truncated recombinant proteins were expressed in yeast and characterized biochemically. Hcam3a has a high affinity for both cAMP and cGMP and thus has distinctly different kinetic parameters from Hcam1, which has a higher affinity for cGMP than for cAMP. Both PDE1C enzymes were inhibited by isobutylmethylxanthine, 8-methoxymethyl isobutylmethylxanthine, zaprinast, and vinpocetine. cDNAs corresponding to two human calcium, calmodulin (CaM)-regulated 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) were isolated.

Cyclic nucleotides are involved in a large number of mammalian signal transduction pathways. The intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP reflect their rate of synthesis, by adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, and their rate of degradation to 5′-monophosphate nucleosides, by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 1PDE, phosphodiesterase; CaM, calmodulin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). A number of biochemically distinct PDEs have been identified. They fall into seven families distinguished by their allosteric regulation, substrate kinetics, amino acid sequence homology, and interaction with specific inhibitors(1Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All known mammalian PDEs share a conserved region of approximately 250 amino acids that contains the phosphodiesterase catalytic site(3Charbonneau H. Mol. Pharmacol. Cell Regul. 1990; 2: 267-298Google Scholar). In certain PDEs the regions amino-terminal to the catalytic domain are known to be involved in the allosteric regulation caused by the binding of calmodulin or cGMP(3Charbonneau H. Mol. Pharmacol. Cell Regul. 1990; 2: 267-298Google Scholar). Type I PDEs (PDE1, CaM PDEs) are activated by the binding of calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ (CaM). This binding increases the hydrolysis of both cAMP and cGMP(4Wang J.H. Sharma R.K. Mooibroek M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. Cell Regul. 1990; 2: 19-59Google Scholar). The regulation of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis by changes in calcium concentration may allow the type I enzymes to integrate the Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotide second messenger pathways within a cell. Biochemical characterizations have distinguished at least five type I PDEs differing from each other in apparent molecular weight, Km values for cyclic nucleotide substrates, affinities for calmodulin, and regulation by phosphorylation(5Charbonneau H.

The existence of type I PDEs with distinct sequences and properties suggests a diversity of cellular functions for these enzymes. However, this diversity complicates the analysis of type I PDEs in tissues where more than one biochemical form is present. Isolating each of the type I PDE genes helps aid in understanding the role played by each member of this complex family of enzymes. We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNAs corresponding to two human type I PDE genes. One, Hcam1, corresponds to the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE. The other, Hcam3, is a novel type I PDE, whose mouse and rat counterparts have also been recently isolated(52Yan C.C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We examine the tissue distribution of the mRNAs for Hcam1 and Hcam3 and the biochemical properties of amino-truncated proteins corresponding to each gene. Hcam3 shows alternative splicing that would generate phosphodiesterase proteins with different carboxyl termini; this is the first example of carboxyl-terminal splice variants for mammalian type I PDEs. A bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen human cDNA libraries. Degenerate oligonucleotides (corresponding to the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE amino acid sequences KMGMMKKK and NMKGTTND) and bovine heart cDNA were used in a PCR reaction to generate an 1108-bp bovine cDNA fragment as previously described(17Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were prepared by isolating DNA fragments from agarose gels and labeling them with [32P]dCTP and [32P]dTTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont) using a Boehringer Mannheim random priming kit. Library screening and hybridization conditions were as described elsewhere(21Loughney K. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Cell. 1989; 58: 1143-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Three positively hybridizing λ phage (H2a, H3a, H6a) were isolated from a human hippocampus cDNA library (Clontech). The cDNA inserts from these phage were subsequently used as probes to isolate additional λ phage. An H6a probe (1.2-kb HindIII/EcoRV fragment) was used to isolate λ phage A2d from an aorta cDNA library (Clontech). An H3a probe (2.4-kb HindIII/EcoRI fragment) was used to isolate two additional λ phage, He11a and He19a, from the heart library (Stratagene). cDNA inserts from H6a, H2a, H3a, and A2d were subcloned into Bluescript vectors (Stratagene). Bluescript plasmids containing the cDNA inserts from He11a and He19a were excised in vivo from the λ ZAP vector (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was extracted using kits from Promega Biotech Inc. and QIAGEN Inc. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an ABI 394 DNA synthesizer. The cDNA inserts from H6a, H3a, He11a, and A2d were completely sequenced on both strands using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp). Those from He19a and H2a were partially sequenced. Additional molecular biological techniques are as previously described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Human tissue samples were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Tissue was frozen within 8 h of death or surgery except for three of the four heart samples which were frozen within 30 h of death. The tissues were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 2 μg of human heart poly(A)+ mRNA using a Boehringer Mannheim cDNA synthesis kit. 0.5 μl of the 20-μl final reaction volume was used per subsequent PCR reaction, which also contained 10 μg/ml of each primer, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM each dNTP (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.6 unit Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 25 μl. Reaction conditions were 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, and 60°C for 2 min and 72°C for 4 min. The polymerase was added after the reaction temperature reached 94°C. Primary PCR reactions were diluted 1/100, and 1 μl was added to a 25-μl secondary PCR reaction. Hcam1 primers are shown in Fig. 1B, primers 1 and 4 were used in the primary reaction, and primers 2 and 3 in the secondary reaction. Hcam3 primers are shown in Fig. 2, B and C; primers 1 and 4 were used in the first reaction and primers 2 and 3 in the secondary reaction. The PCR-derived DNA fragments were gel purified and partially sequenced.Figure 2:A, map of Hcam3 cDNAs. The divergent 3′-ends of the cDNAs are represented by a hatched line (cDNAs He19a and He11a) or a jagged line (cDNA H3a).

The D marked with a diamond is the first amino acid that is specific to the Hcam3b splice variant. cDNA He11a begins at nucleotide 611 and the protein expressed by the truncated Hcam3a(met150) construct begins at the methionine underlined at amino acid position 150. The positions of oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR are indicated above the sequence by numbered arrows. Nucleotide and amino acid residues are numbered on the right. C, nucleotide sequence and predicted protein sequence specific to Hcam3a (PDE1C3). The first nucleotide of this sequence corresponds to nucleotide 2067 of Panel B. Following this nucleotide (G) the two sequences diverge. The Hcam3a protein contains a glycine (G) rather than the aspartic acid (D) marked with a diamond in Panel B and extends another 79 amino acids before terminating. The cDNA insert from He19a contains a G at position 2246, whereas that from He11a contains an A. This change does not affect the amino acid sequence of the protein.

The transcription reaction was performed at 37°C for 30 min and contained 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 0.25 mM each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.1 unit of RNase block I (Stratagene), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 8 μM UTP, 5 μM [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont), and 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a reaction volume of 5 μl. Escherichia coli tRNA (30 μg) and 92 μl of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM NaCl were added prior to treatment with 10 units of RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform and chloroform and then precipitated (50 μl of 7.5 M ammonium acetate, 300 μl of ethanol). RNase protection conditions were based on published methods(24Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). The probe was resuspended in 80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 7, and 1 mM EDTA. Human total RNA (4-10 μg in 1.7-8.9 μl) was added to 50-μl aliquots of the probe (5 × 104 dpm), denatured at 90-95°C for 5 min, and allowed to hybridize overnight at 52°C. Digestion buffer (350 μl of 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA) containing 1 unit/μl RNase T1 (Sigma) was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted (200 μl of phenol, 400 μl of chloroform, 10 μl of 20% SDS, and 1.5 μl of 10 mg/ml tRNA), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in sample loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cylanol) prior to being analyzed by denaturing acrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A multiple tissue blot was purchased from Clontech. The probes were prepared as described for the RNase protections except that no unlabeled UTP was present in the reaction. Prehybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 × SSC, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, and 20 units/ml heparin at 65°C; fresh solution containing the probe was added for the hybridization overnight. 5 × SSC and 2.5 × Denhardt's solutions are as defined in Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were washed first at room temperature and then at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS prior to autoradiography. The filter was stripped between uses by immersion in boiling water. The Hcam1 riboprobe was the same as that used in the RNase protection analysis. The Hcam3a-specific probe extended from nucleotides 2068-2686 (Fig. 2C) and the Hcam3b-specific probe extended from nucleotides 2062-2652 (Fig. 2B). Fragments corresponding to these regions were generated by PCR and subcloned prior to their use in preparing an antisense riboprobe (as described above). The cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pBNY6n and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This vector, which provided EcoRI and XhoI cloning sites, was constructed from pADNS (25Colicelli J. Birchmeier C. Michaeli T. O'Neill K. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 86: 3599-3603Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and Yeplac181 (26Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar, 27Ivy J.M. Klar A.J.S. Hicks J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 688-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) as follows. The polylinker of pADNS was replaced with an EcoRI/NotI/XhoI linker (5′-AGCTCGAATTCTGCGGCCGCTCGAGA-3′ and 5′-AATTTCTCGAGCGGCCGCAGAATTCG-3′). This linker was ligated into pADNS that had been cut to completion with HindIII and partially digested with EcoRI. The resultant plasmid was cleaved with BamHI and the fragment that contained the ADHI promoter and terminator flanking the new polylinker was inserted into the BamHI site of a YEplac181 derivative. In this derivative the EcoRI site of YEplac181 had been removed by digestion with HpaI and SmaI followed by ligation. The plasmid Hcam3a(met150) was constructed by ligating the cDNA insert of He11a (nucleotides 610-2067 of Fig. 2B followed by 2068-2686 of Fig. 2C) into the EcoRI site of pBNY6n. New junctions in the construct were verified by DNA sequencing. The first ATG in the cDNA insert is nucleotide 624 of Hcam3a (Fig. 2B) which corresponds to amino acid 150. The plasmid Hcam1(met141) contains an EcoRI/XhoI fragment (nucleotides 505-1692, Fig. 1B) inserted into pBNY6n. The first ATG in the cDNA insert is nucleotide 505 of Hcam1 (Fig. 1B) which corresponds to amino acid 141. DNA sequences generated by PCR and new junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this work are shown in Table 1. YKS42 was generated from SX50-1C by deleting the endogenous PDE1 gene (28Nikawa J.-I. Sass P. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

Standard methods were used for gene replacements (30Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) and yeast transformations(31Orr-Weaver T.L.

The presence of the pep4-3 allele in YKS76 was confirmed by sequencing the region of the gene that contains the nonsense mutation present in this allele(34Woolford C.A. Noble J.A. Garman J.D.

Genetics. 1977; 85: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the presence of the prb1-1122 and prc1-126 alleles gave ambiguous results because pep4-3 is epistatic to their expression. YKS76 was transformed (37Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar) with the plasmids Hcam1(met141) and Hcam3a(met150) and the transformants were grown at 30°C in synthetic medium lacking leucine to 1-2 × 107 cells/ml, collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath. The yeast cell pellets were lysed and phosphodiesterase activity was assayed as described elsewhere (38Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. [32P]cAMP and [32P]cGMP were used (25 Ci/mmol, ICN Biochemical). The 32Pi product was separated from the substrate using charcoal(39Johnson R.A. Walseth T.F. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 135-167PubMed Google Scholar, 40Prpic V. Uhing R.J. Gettys T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Two volumes of 25 mg/ml activated charcoal in 0.1 M KH2PO4 were added to terminate the reaction. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Extracts prepared from YKS76 containing only the pBNY6n vector yielded activities indistinguishable from assay background. Kinetic and inhibitor analyses were performed as described previously (38Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis was measured at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 100 μM. The specific activity of the substrate was held constant (0.2 Ci/mmol). The kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menton model using TableCurve (Jandel Scientific). Inhibitor analyses were performed at 0.1 μM cGMP. At this substrate concentration the observed IC50 should approximate the apparent inhibitor constant (Ki) for both competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors. The reaction time and amount of enzyme in the assay were adjusted such that less than 25% of the substrate was consumed in the reaction. Dose-response curves were fitted (TableCurve) using a four-parameter or a two-parameter logistic model(38Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The four-parameter model derives values for the minimum PDE activity, the maximum PDE activity, and the IC50, as well as a parameter that determines the slope of the fitted curve at the IC50. The two-parameter model derives values for the maximum PDE activity and the IC50. The minimum PDE activity is set to 0, and the parameter affecting the slope is set to 1. The two-parameter model was used when the highest concentration of inhibitor was unable to inhibit fully the enzymatic activity. All other data sets utilized the four-parameter model. Stocks of inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Aldrich), and the final solvent concentrations in the PDE assay never exceeded 2% (v/v). Vinpocetine was obtained from Andard Mount Co.; IBMX from Sigma; rolipram and zaprinast were gifts from Paul Feldman, Glaxo Inc. Research Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC); and 8-methoxymethyl IBMX was a gift from Jack Wells, Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). Cilostamide was synthesized using published procedures(41Lugnier C. Bruch M. Stoclet J.C. Strub M.P. Marivet M. Wermuth C.G. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 20: 121-125Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assayed using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and published methods(42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Three phage were isolated from a human hippocampus cDNA library screened with a cDNA fragment derived from the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE(17Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments derived from these phage were used to screen heart and aorta human cDNA libraries, and three additional phage were isolated. Subcloning and sequencing revealed that these six cDNAs correspond to two different genes, Hcam1 and Hcam3. Three Hcam1 cDNAs (H2a and H6a from hippocampus and A2d from aorta) provide a composite sequence of 2008 nucleotides (Fig. 1, A and B). This composite cDNA encodes a 535-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 61,251 Da that is similar to the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE protein (5Charbonneau H. Kumar S. Novack J.P. Blumenthal D.K. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Beavo J.A. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The three cDNAs used in building the composite (Fig. 1B) differ from it as follows (Fig. 1A). The composite sequence is identical to the sequence of cDNA H6a except that H6a is lacking nucleotides 626 and 627. These nucleotides are present in H2a and in the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE. Deletion of them alters the reading frame. We believe their absence in H6a is a cloning artifact. The cDNA insert in λ H2a contains a 47-bp insertion following nucleotide 74 and diverges from the Hcam1 composite sequence following nucleotide 807 (Fig. 1A). The 47-bp insertion is in the 5′-untranslated region and does not alter the open reading frame of the cDNA. It contains sequences that show a good match to consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences(44Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar), which suggests it may be an intron that was not spliced out of the mRNA from which the cDNA was made. It was not included in the Hcam1 composite sequence (Fig. 1B). The sequences following nucleotide 807, which show a good match to consensus splice donor sequences(44Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar), may also represent an intron. It is known from an analysis of genomic DNA sequences that an intron is present at this position. 2P. Snyder, unpublished observation. These sequences were also not included in the composite sequence (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR was used to isolate a portion of Hcam1 from human heart cDNA. A PCR-derived band extending from primer 2 to primer 3 (Fig. 1B) was sequenced. The 2 bp(626-627) were present, and the presumed intron following nucleotide 807 was absent, thus confirming our interpretation of the cDNA structures. The sequence of the cDNA insert in λ A2d contains 15 nucleotides at its 5′-end that represent an inverted repeat of sequences found elsewhere in the cDNA and which are presumably a cloning artifact. It also contains 4 additional nucleotides located just 5′ to the poly(A) tail (AGCT following nucleotide 1999 of Fig. 1B). These may reflect the use of a second polyadenylation site. The composite Hcam1 sequence (Fig. 1B) has been submitted to GenBank™ as HSPDE1A3. The human Hcam1 protein sequence contains residues that are identical to a calmodulin-binding region identified in the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE (amino acids 24-42, Fig. 1, A and B)(5Charbonneau H. Kumar S. Novack J.P. Blumenthal D.K. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Beavo J.A. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hcam1 also contains a region conserved in all mammalian phosphodiesterases that corresponds to the phosphodiesterase catalytic domain (amino acids 194-447, Fig. 1, A and B) (3Charbonneau H. Mol. Pharmacol. Cell Regul. 1990; 2: 267-298Google Scholar). Although Hcam1 is most similar to the bovine 61-kDa CaM PDE (PDE1A2), the human protein contains two regions that are not found in the bovine protein. One region is a 14-amino acid insertion in the human protein following amino acid 458. The second region is the carboxyl terminus; the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of the human protein have no homology to the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of the bovine protein. When these two regions are excluded from comparison, the human and bovine proteins share 94% amino acid identity (Fig. 1C). The sequences of three Hcam3 cDNAs (He11a and He19a from heart and H3a from hippocampus) yield a composite that predicts two splice variants with different carboxyl termini (Fig. 2A). One predicted splice variant, Hcam3b, is represented by cDNA H3a. This splice variant is designated HSPDE1C1 and was submitted to GenBank™. The 2694-nucleotide cDNA contains an open reading frame that"

Since Ca2+ dissociates 5-29 times faster from the N-terminal in these CaM·peptide complexes and both lobes are required for activation, Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal would control target protein inactivation. Ca2+ binds 70 times faster to the N-terminal (1.6 × 108M−1 s−1) than the C-terminal sites (2.3 × 106M−1 s−1). In a 0.6-ms half-width Ca2+ transient, Ca2+ occupied >70% of the N-terminal but only 20% of the C-terminal sites. RS-20 produced a 9-fold and CaM kinase II a 6.3-fold increase in C-terminal Ca2+ affinity, suggesting that some target proteins may be bound to the C-terminal at resting [Ca2+].

(1995) for reviews). The N- and C-terminal lobes are separated by an 8-turn α-helix, and they undergo a Ca2+-dependent exposure of their hydrophobic binding pockets, which allows binding and activation of target protein (LaPorte et al., 1980; Tanaka and Hidaka, 1980). In the presence of Ca2+, both the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic pockets of CaM bind an amphipathic α-helical peptide domain within the target protein structure (O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990), and recently the high resolution x-ray and NMR structure of several Ca2+·CaM·peptide complexes have been determined (Ikura et al., 1992; Meador et al., 1992, 1993). Ca2+-CaM binding removes a pseudosubstrate inhibitory domain from many enzymes' active sites, and this results in the activation of smooth and skeletal muscle MLCK, CaM kinase II, calcineurin, plasmalemma Ca-ATPase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (see Kemp and Pearson(1991) and James et al. (1995) for review).The CaM binding domains of many CaM target proteins have been identified, and peptides representing these domains from skeletal (M-13) and smooth (RS-20) muscle MLCK, CaM Kinase II (C2K), and the MARCKS protein have been synthesized. These peptides bind CaM with nanomolar affinity as does the entire target protein (Blumenthal et al., 1985; Lucas et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1988; Verghese et al., 1994).The binding of target proteins, their CaM binding domain peptides, and hydrophobic drugs all produce dramatic (7-40-fold) increases in CaM's affinity for Ca2+ (Keller et al., 1982; Olwin et al., 1984; Mills et al., 1985; Yagi and Yazawa, 1989; Kasturi et al., 1993). These increases in Ca2+ affinity might be reflected by decreases in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the lower affinity N- and higher affinity C-terminal EF hands of CaM. If target peptide and protein binding reduces the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the CaM·protein (peptide) complex, then the rate of complex dissociation and inactivation could be delayed until long after the Ca2+ transient has subsided. In this paper, we determined the rates of Ca2+ exchange with the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM and examined the effects of MLCK and several CaM binding peptides on the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM and on C-terminal Ca2+ affinity. We relate our results to the mechanism of CaM's activation and inactivation of its target proteins during a cellular Ca2+ transient.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsQuin 2 and Mg-Fura-2 were purchased from Molecular Probes; phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, TNS, calmidazolium, and EGTA were purchased from Sigma; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH); and hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.C2K peptide was purchased from L.C. Laboratories (Woburn, MD), RS-20 peptide was from American Peptide Co.

CaM41/75 and CaM85/112 were generously provided by Dr. Zenon Grabarek (Boston Biomedical Institute, Boston, MA).Protein PurificationCaM was purified from bovine brain as described previously by Kasturi et al. (1993). MLCK was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from chicken gizzard smooth muscle as described by Ngai et al. (1984).MethodsAll static fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS5 Spectrofluorometer at 10°C. Free [Ca2+] was calculated as described by Robertson and Potter(1984). Kinetic measurements were performed by mixing an equal volume (50 μl) of each reagent together in an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SF.17 MV stopped flow instrument. This instrument had a dead time of 1.6 ms and flow rate of 17 μl/ms. The samples were excited using a 150-watt Xenon arc source at the specified wavelength. Fluorescence emission was monitored through the specified interference filters. The curve fitting program (by P. J. King, Applied Photophysics Ltd.) uses the non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.The changes in Quin fluorescence as it dissociates Ca2+ from CaM were converted to moles of Ca2+ dissociating from CaM by mixing increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 μM) with Quin 2. Quin 2 fluorescence increased linearly as a function of increasing [Ca2+], allowing us to directly relate a change in Quin 2 fluorescence to the number of moles of Ca2+ dissociating per mole of CaM. Calibration curves were performed at the end of each experiment using the same Quin 2 solutions and experimental conditions as used in the experiments. The amplitude of the change in Quin 2 fluorescence was extrapolated from an exponential fit of the data in Fig. 1A, inset.Computer ModelingThe computer simulations were performed using KSIM version 1.1 (N. C. Millar, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles). The Kd of EGTA for Ca2+ at 10°C and low ionic strength (pH 7.0) was calculated to be 4.23 × 10−7M from the program of Robertson and Potter (1984). The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from EGTA (koff) was determined by stopped flow experiments where EGTA (10 μM) and Ca2+ (20 μM) were mixed with Quin 2 (150 μM) in the same buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0), at 10°C. The Quin 2 fluorescence increased at the koff of EGTA, 0.55 ± 0.03/s. Our calculated kon of 1.3 × 106M−1 s−1 (from kon = koff/Kd) was in agreement with the value of 9.2 × 105M−1 s−1 determined by Smith et al. (1984) at 16°C in 0.1 M ionic strength (pH 6.8). Modeling of the Ca2+ transient and the Ca2+ occupancy of the N- and C-terminal sites of CaM assumed the following initial concentrations: N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites (4 μM), Ca2+ (100 μM), and EGTA (1 mM), which represent the reaction conditions in the stopped flow experiments of Fig. 5 after mixing. The kinetic parameters used for Ca2+ exchange with the N- and C-terminal sites of CaM were those determined as described under “Results” and as cited in Table 1.Figure 5:The time course of the decrease in Ca2+-CaM-TNS fluorescence upon Ca2+ chelation by EGTA and after a rapid Ca2+ transient. The time course of the decrease in TNS fluorescence is shown as EGTA dissociates the Ca2+·CaM·TNS complex (trace A) or when it has been transiently formed by a rapid Ca2+ transient (trace B). The inset shows the fast kinetics of these two reactions over 0-20 ms. The EGTA-induced decrease in TNS fluorescence (traces labeled A (N-EGTA) or A (C-EGTA)) was accomplished by mixing CaM (4 μM) + Ca2+ (200 μM) + TNS (200 μM) in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, with an equal volume of 2 mM EGTA in the same buffer at 10°C. Control experiments where Ca2++ CaM + TNS was reacted with buffer + Ca2+ were flat. The transient occupancy of CaM by Ca2+ and TNS (traces labeled B (N-Transient) or B (C-Transient)) was achieved by mixing CaM (4 μM) + TNS (200 μM) + EGTA (2 mM) in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, with an equal volume of 200 μM Ca2+ in the same buffer at 10°C. Control experiments reacting the above solution with buffer containing EGTA instead of Ca2+ were flat. TNS fluorescence was monitored through a 510-nm broad pass filter (Oriel, Standford, CT) with excitation at 370 nm. The 0-1.2-s traces represent an average of six traces fit with a double exponential curve (variance < 9.8 × 105). The 0-20-ms traces in the inset represent an average of six traces fit with a single exponential (variance < 3.0 × 10−5). Each kinetic trace was fit after flow had stopped.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab RESULTSCa2+ Dissociation from the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ Binding Sites of CaMBayley et al. (1984) have previously used Quin 2 fluorescence to measure the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from CaM. Fig. 1A shows Ca2+ dissociation from CaM's N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites as measured by the increase in Quin 2 fluorescence, which occurs upon Ca2+ binding. Ca2+ dissociated from CaM as a biphasic process with 1.2 ± 0.2 mol of Ca2+ dissociating at 405 ± 75/s (Fig. 1A, inset) and 1.6 ± 0.2 mol of Ca2+ dissociating nearly 170 times more slowly at 2.4 ± 0.2/s. Thus, under the conditions used in our studies, we clearly observe Ca2+ dissociation from both the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM.Effect of MLCK and CaM Binding Peptides on Ca2+ Dissociation from CaMThe effects of MLCK and several CaM binding peptides on Ca2+ dissociation from CaM's N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites were determined using Quin 2 fluorescence. Fig. 1B shows the effect of smooth muscle MLCK, its CaM binding peptide (RS-20), and the MARCKS peptide on Ca2+ dissociation from CaM. In the presence of protein or peptide, the rapid phase of Ca2+ dissociation (405/s) was eliminated. Instead, biphasic Ca2+ dissociation rates of 2.28 ± 0.20/s and 0.39 ± 0.15/s, 1.8 ± 0.2/s and 0.07 ± 0.01/s, and 2.6 ± 0.3/s and 0.3 ± 0.02/s were observed for MLCK, RS-20, and MARCKS peptide, respectively. M-13 peptide, from skeletal muscle MLCK, was similar to RS-20 with biphasic Ca2+ dissociation rates of 2.6 ± 0.6/s and 0.06 ± 0.02/s. C2K peptide was similar to the MARCKS peptide with biphasic Ca2+ dissociation rates of 2.9 ± 0.3/s and 0.29 ± 0.03/s. Thus, MLCK and all of these high affinity peptides abolish the rapid rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal of CaM and result in ∼2 mol of Ca2+ dissociating at 1.8-2.9/s and ∼2 mol of Ca2+ dissociating at 0.1-0.4/s.Effect of Peptide on Ca2+ Dissociation from the CaM C-terminal Ca2+ Binding SitesCaM's two tyrosine residues (Tyr-99 and Tyr-138) are in the C-terminal half of the molecule and undergo a large fluorescence increase when Ca2+ binds to the C-terminal sites of CaM (Dedman et al., 1977; George et al., 1993). Fig. 2 shows the time course of the EGTA-induced decrease in Ca2+-CaM tyrosine fluorescence. These data agree with our Quin 2 studies and verify that Ca2+ dissociates from the C-terminal sites of CaM at a rate of 2.1 ± 0.1/s at 10°C. The addition of MARCKS peptide, which has no Tyr or Trp residues, reduces the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from these C-terminal sites to 0.32 ± 0.02/s.Figure 2:Effect of MARCKS peptide on Ca2+ dissociation from CaM and CaM41/75 C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites. The upper traces show the increase in Quin 2 fluorescence associated with Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal sites of CaM41/75 with and without MARCKS peptide. CaM41/75 (4 μM) + Ca2+ (60 μM) ± MARCKS peptide (10 μM) in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of Quin 2 (150 μM) in the same buffer at 10°C. Quin 2 fluorescence was monitored as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The lower traces show the decrease in CaM tyrosine fluorescence when CaM ± MARCKS peptide was rapidly mixed with EGTA. CaM (4 μM) + Ca2+ (100 μM) ± MARCKS peptide (10 μM) in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of EGTA (5 mM) in the same buffer at 10°C. Control experiments where CaM + Ca2+ were reacted with buffer + Ca2+ were flat lines, which began at the starting amplitude of the EGTA trace. CaM tyrosine fluorescence was measured through a UV-transmitting black glass filter (UG1 from Oriel (Standford, CT)) with excitation at 275 nm. Each trace is an average of five traces fit with a single exponential (variance < 2.2 × 10−4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CaM41/75 is a mutant CaM in which cysteine residues have been introduced at positions 41 and 75 by site-directed mutagenesis. When these two cysteines are cross-linked by a disulfide bridge, the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM cannot be opened in a Ca2+-dependent manner; CaM is thereby inactivated and exhibits a greatly reduced Ca2+ affinity at its N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites (Grabarek et al., 1991). 2Z. Grabarek, personal communication. When CaM41/75 (+Ca2+) is mixed with Quin 2, the rapid phase of Ca2+ dissociation from its N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites (which occurs over 0-20 ms) is not observed. 2 mol of Ca2+ still dissociate from the C-terminal sites of CaM41/75 and cause an increase in Quin 2 fluorescence at a rate of 2.4 ± 0.2/s (Fig. 2). Thus, CaM41/75 allows us to specifically monitor Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites. The addition of MARCKS peptide to CaM41/75 slowed the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from its C-terminal Ca2+ sites from 2.4/s to 0.3/s (Fig. 2). Similar studies with RS-20, M-13, and MLCK indicated that these peptides/protein reduced the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal sites of CaM41/75 from 2.4/s to 0.07 ± 0.01/s, 0.11 ± 0.02/s, and 0.5 ± 0.02/s, respectively. Similar results were obtained with a tryptic fragment of CaM, CaM 78-148, which contains only the C-terminal half of the molecule (residues 78-148). As shown with CaM41/75, Ca2+ dissociated from CaM 78-148 at a rate of 2.3/s, and addition of the MARCKS peptide slowed Ca2+ dissociation to 0.25/s (data not shown). Thus, these studies with the C-terminal fragment of CaM and with the N-terminal mutant CaM (CaM41/75) allowed us to determine the effect of these peptides on Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal of CaM, selectively.Knowing the effect of MLCK and these peptides on the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal sites of CaM, it follows (from the data in Fig. 1B) that MLCK, RS-20, M-13, MARCKS peptide, and C2K peptide slow Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM from 405/s to 2.3 ± 0.2/s, 1.8 ± 0.2/s, 2.6 ± 0.6/s, 2.6 ± 0.3/s, and 2.9 ± 0.3/s, respectively. The effects of MLCK and each of these peptides on the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM could, therefore, be unambiguously assigned as listed in Table 1.Effects of Temperature and KCl on Ca2+ Dissociation from the N- and C-terminal Sites of CaM in the Presence of RS-20Since many physiological studies are conducted at higher temperatures and ionic strength, we have examined the effects of RS-20 on Ca2+ dissociation from CaM's N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites at various temperatures in the presence of KCl (90 mM). The addition of KCl to CaM + RS-20, at 10°C, did not alter the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from either the N- or C-terminal sites from those reported in Table 1. At 20, 30, and 37°C in the presence of KCl and RS-20, Ca2+ dissociated from the N- and C-terminal sites 2.5, 5.8, and 10 times faster, respectively, than at 10°C. This suggests a Q10 of ∼2.3-2.5 for these processes.Effects of CaM Binding Peptides on Ca2+ Affinity at the CaM C-terminal Ca2+ SitesCa2+ affinity at the C-terminal sites was determined by the Ca2+-dependent increase in tyrosine fluorescence. Fig. 3 shows Ca2+ titrations of CaM in the presence or absence of C2K or MARCKS peptide and of CaM41/75 in the presence or absence of RS-20. Ca2+ half-maximally binds to the C-terminal sites of CaM and CaM41/75 at pCa 5.96. In the presence of C2K and MARCKS peptide, half-maximal Ca2+ binding occurs at pCa 6.8 and 6.4, respectively. RS-20 shifted the half-maximal binding of Ca2+ to the C-terminal sites of CaM41/75 from pCa 5.96 to 7.0 as monitored by the increase in its Trp fluorescence. These results suggest that CaM and CaM41/75 have the same C-terminal Ca2+ affinities and that RS-20, C2K, and the MARCKS peptide produce 9.1, 6.3, and 2.6-fold increases, respectively, in C-terminal Ca2+ affinity. Thus, RS-20, which produces the largest (∼9-fold) increase in C-terminal Ca2+ affinity, produces the largest (40-fold) decrease in C-terminal Ca2+ off-rate.Figure 3:Effects of RS-20, MARCKS, and C2K peptide on Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal sites of CaM or CaM41/75. The Ca2+ dependence of the increase in tyrosine fluorescence for CaM (○), CaM41/75 (∗), CaM + C2K peptide (◇), or CaM + MARCKS peptide (▵) and the Ca2+ dependence of the increase in RS-20 tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of CaM41/75 (□) are shown as a function of pCa. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ were added to 1 ml of CaM (1 μM) ± MARCKS (2 μM) or ± C2K (2 μM), or to 1 ml of CaM41/75 (1 μM) ± RS-20 (2 μM) in 200 mM Hepes, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.0, at 10°C to yield the indicated pCa. CaM and CaM41/75 tyrosine fluorescence was monitored at 305 nm with excitation at 275 nm. RS-20 tryptophan fluorescence was monitored at 325 nm with excitation at 285 nm. 100% fluorescence corresponds to a ∼2.4-fold increase in CaM or CaM41/75 tyrosine fluorescence and a 1.4-fold increase in RS-20 tryptophan fluorescence. Each data point represents an average of three titrations ± S.E. fit with a sigmoidal curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of Ca2+ Affinity at the CaM N- and C-terminal Ca2+ Binding SitesThe hydrophobic polarity probe TNS undergoes a large fluorescence increase when it binds to the Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic pockets in both the N- and C-terminal halves of CaM (Suko et al., 1985; Johnson et al., 1986).Since Ca2+ binding to both the N- and C-terminal sites exposes TNS binding sites, the Ca2+ affinity at each class of site can be determined by the Ca2+ dependence of the increase in TNS fluorescence. Ca2+ titrations of TNS in the presence of CaM41/75 or CaM85/112 (where the exposure of the N- or C-terminal hydrophobic pocket has been blocked by a disulfide bond, respectively) were half-maximal at pCa 5.9 and 5.6, respectively (data not shown). Thus, the Ca2+ titrations of CaM41/75 with TNS and of CaM or CaM41/75 tyrosine fluorescence all indicate a C-terminal Ca2+ affinity of ∼1.3 × 10−6M at 10°C. Ca2+ titrations of CaM85/112 with TNS indicate a Ca2+ affinity of ∼2.5 × 10−6M at the N-terminal sites. Knowing the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal (405/s) and the C-terminal sites (2.4/s), the Ca2+ association rate (kon) was calculated from kon = koff/Kd. These calculations suggest that Ca2+ binds to the lower affinity N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites at ∼1.6 × 108M−1 s−1 and to the higher affinity C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites at ∼2.3 × 106M−1 s−1. These calculations suggest that Ca2+ binds to the N-terminal sites ∼70 times faster than it binds to the C-terminal sites.Transient Occupancy of the N-terminal Ca2+ Binding Sites of CaMWe have utilized the slow Ca2+ on-rate of EGTA (Smith et al., 1984) to produce a rapid Ca2+ transient and determined if Ca2+ can bind to the N- or C-terminal sites of CaM and induce TNS binding during a brief Ca2+ transient. A computer simulation of the Ca2+ transient that is produced when 100 μM Ca2+ is instantaneously mixed with 1 mM EGTA is shown in Fig. 4(Ca trace). The free [Ca2+] decays at ∼1200/s to an equilibrium value of pCa 7.4, producing a 0.6-ms half-width Ca2+ transient. This Ca2+ transient can be produced and visualized in the stopped flow by following Mg-Fura-2 fluorescence when 200 μM Ca2+ is mixed with Mg-Fura-2 in the presence of 2 mM EGTA (Fig. 4, MF2 trace). Ca2+ bound to Mg-Fura-2 during the dead time and then dissociated at ∼1300/s, as EGTA chelated Ca2+. Thus, the simulation and Mg-Fura-2 fluorescence precisely define the time course of this Ca2+ transient.Figure 4:A computer simulation of the time course of a Ca2+ transient produced by rapidly mixing Ca2+ with EGTA and the time course of the occupancy of the CaM N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites by this Ca2+ transient. A computer simulation of the Ca2+ transient (Δ), which is produced when 2 mM EGTA is rapidly mixed with 200 μM Ca2+, was achieved by using the KSIM program (N. C. Millar) by setting the initial [Ca2+] to 100 μM at time = 0 and using a measured Ca2+ off-rate from EGTA of 0.55/s and a Ca2+ on-rate to EGTA of 1.3 × 106M−1 s−1 at 10°C. The time course of this Ca2+ transient was verified by stopped flow, using the rapid Ca2+ indicator Mg-Fura-2. The trace labeled MF2 (●) shows the change in Mg-Fura-2 fluorescence (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 510 nm; trace inverted for comparison) when 1 μM Mg-Fura-2 in the presence of 2 mM EGTA is rapidly mixed with 400 μM Ca2+. This trace is an average of six traces fit with a single exponential with a variance of <1.7 × 104. The simulation of Ca2+ exchange with the N- (■) and C-terminal (□) Ca2+ binding sites of CaM assumes that Ca2+ binds to both halves of CaM as a simple bimolecular process with the Ca2+ on- and off-rates given in Table 1 for CaM's N- and C-terminal sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4 also simulates the time course of occupancy of the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM (using the on- and off-rates shown in Table 1) during this Ca2+ transient. This simulation suggests that the faster N-terminal sites would be 96% occupied at 0.4 ms and that they would lose this Ca2+ to EGTA at ∼240/s. The slower C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites would only be 18% occupied, and they would then lose this Ca2+ to EGTA at 2.4/s.Ca2+ binding to both the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM exposes hydrophobic sites that bind TNS and cause a large increase in TNS fluorescence. Fig. 5(trace A) shows the time course of the decrease in TNS fluorescence when the Ca2+·CaM·TNS complex is mixed with EGTA. Similar to Suko et al. (1985), we observed a biphasic process in which 54% of the TNS fluorescence decrease occurs at 405 ± 20/s (Fig. 5, trace A (N-EGTA)), and 46% occurs at 2.1 ± 0.1/s (Fig. 5, trace A (C-EGTA)). These rates correspond to the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the N- and C-terminal sites of CaM, respectively (as measured by Quin 2), and suggest that both hydrophobic pockets close and displace TNS as quickly as Ca2+ dissociates. Thus, these changes in TNS fluorescence provide an accurate way of following Ca2+ dissociation from both the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM.If the N- and/or C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM are transiently occupied during a rapid Ca2+ transient (as in Fig. 4), then TNS fluorescence would increase with Ca2+ and TNS binding and then decrease at the rates of Ca2+ removal from the N- and C-terminal sites. Fig. 5(trace B) shows the change in TNS fluorescence when Ca2+ (200 μM) is rapidly mixed with CaM (4 μM) and TNS (200 μM) in the presence of 2 mM EGTA. Ca2+ binds and produces a rapid increase in TNS fluorescence, and then TNS fluorescence decreases as a biphasic process. Most (82%) of this decrease occurs as Ca2+ dissociates from the N-terminal sites (Fig. 5, trace B (N-Transient)) at 321 ± 33/s, and the remaining 18% occurs as Ca2+ dissociates from the C-terminal sites at 2.1 ± 0.1/s (Fig. 5, trace B (C-Transient)). When the amplitudes for the decreases in TNS fluorescence that occur in the transient occupancy experiments (Fig. 5, trace B) are compared to the amplitudes of the decreases in the EGTA experiments (Fig. 5, trace A), we find that 70% of the N-terminal and 20% of the C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites are occupied during the transient occupancy experiments. These data are consistent with the simulation of Fig. 4, where 96% of the N-terminal sites (with a Ca2+ on-rate of 1.2 × 108M−1 s−1) and 18% of the C-terminal sites (with a Ca2+ on-rate of 1.2 × 106M−1 s−1) would be occupied during this Ca2+ transient. Increasing the [Ca2+] produced greater occupancy of both the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic pockets by TNS. Thus, Ca2+ binding is the rate-limiting step and not the rate of opening of the hydrophobic pocket or TNS binding. These data confirm the Ca2+ on-rates we calculated in Table 1 and the simulation using these on-rates (Fig. 4), which shows that the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites are almost fully occupied during a rapid Ca2+ transient, while the C-terminal sites, with a 70-fold slower Ca2+ on-rate, are not.The observation that the C-terminal sites were only 20% occupied by Ca2+ during this rapid Ca2+ transient was verified using CaM-tyrosine fluorescence. When CaM (4 μM) and Ca2+ (200 μM) were mixed with 2 mM EGTA, the C-terminal tyrosine fluorescence decreased at a rate of ∼2.1/s as Ca2+ dissociated from the C-terminal sites (Fig. 6, CaM + Ca versus EGTA trace). When a rapid Ca2+ transient was produced by mixing Ca2+ (200 μM) with CaM (4 μM) in the presence of 2 mM EGTA, the tyrosine fluorescence rose to only 23% of the intensity seen with Ca2+ saturated CaM and then decayed back at 2.1/s (Fig. 6, CaM + EGTA versus Ca trace). When the [Ca2+] was increased to 400 μM, the tyrosine fluorescence increased to 42% of the intensity seen with Ca2+ saturated CaM. This suggests that Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal is the rate-limiting step and not a slower structural change at the tyrosine residues. Thus, both the TNS and the tyrosine data indicate that the N-terminal but not the C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites are maximally occupied under the conditions of this rapid Ca2+ transient.Figure 6:The failure of a rapid Ca2+ transient to fully occupy the C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM. The time course of the decrease in CaM tyrosine fluorescence is shown as EGTA dissociates the Ca2+-saturated or transiently occupied C-terminal binding sites of CaM. CaM (4 μM) + Ca2+ (200 μM) in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, at 10°C was rapidly mixed with 2 mM EGTA in the same buffer to determine the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the Ca2+-saturated C-terminal sites on CaM (CaM + Ca versus EGTA trace). The transient occupancy of CaM's C-terminal sites was tested by rapidly mixing CaM (4 μM) + EGTA (2 mM) in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, at 10°C with 200 μM Ca2+ in the same buffer (CaM + EGTA versus Ca trace). The CaM + Ca versus Ca trace represents the level of tyrosine fluorescence in Ca2+-saturated CaM; it was achieved by rapidly mixing CaM (4 μM) + Ca2+ (100 μM) with Ca2+ (100 μM). Tyrosine fluorescence was monitored as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Each trace is an average of seven traces fit with a single exponential (variance < 1.1 × 10−4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur studies show that Ca2+ dissociates from the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM at 405/s and from the higher affinity C-terminal sites at 2.4/s at 10°C. These results agree with the work of Bayley et al. (1984) who have shown that Quin 2 chelates Ca2+ from the N- and C-terminal sites of CaM at 293 ± 93/s and 2.1 ± 0.4/s, respectively, at 11°C. Martin et al. (1992) have also shown that the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites lose Ca2+ rapidly (389 ± 64/s) while the higher affinity C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites lose Ca2+ more slowly (11 ± 2.4/s) at 18°C and low ionic strength.Peptide and MLCK binding to CaM reduced the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal sites from 405/s to 1.8-2.9/s (a 140-225-fold decrease) and from the C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites from 2.4/s to 0.1-0.4/s (a 6-24-fold decrease).Martin et al. (1985) have shown that the CaM antagonist trifluoroperazine slows Ca2+ dissociation from the CaM N-terminal sites from 310/s to 15/s and from the CaM C-terminal sites from 3.6/s to 0.55/s at 13.4°C. Further, calmidazolium slowed Ca2+ dissociation to 4/s and 0.2/s for the N- and C-terminal sites, respectively (data not shown). Thus, these CaM antagonist drugs, which bind to both the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic pockets, produce similar decreases in Ca2+ off-rate as peptide.The high resolution structure of CaM complexed with RS-20 (Meador et al., 1992), C2K peptide (Meador et al., 1993), and M-13 (Ikura et al., 1992) suggest that peptide binding dramatically alters CaM structure. The central helix of CaM unwinds, allowing the hydrophobic pockets on the N- and C-terminal lobes to engulf these peptides. The amphipathic nature of these peptides allows them to shield the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic pockets of CaM from solvent (O'Neil and Degrado, 1990) and to stabilize the Ca2+ bound state of CaM. This results in peptide-induced increases in Ca2+ affinity, which we see expressed as large decreases in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from both halves of CaM.While all of the peptides produced similar dramatic decreases in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal of CaM, both RS-20 and M-13 slowed Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal ∼3-fold more than either C2K or MARCKS. Comparison of the high resolution CaM-peptide structures indicates that there are ∼40% less contacts between CaM-C2K compared to CaM-RS-20 (Meador et al., 1993). Furthermore, both RS-20 and M-13 have an aromatic Trp residue in their N-terminal domain, which makes extensive contacts with the C-terminal of CaM (Ikura et al., 1992; Meador et al., 1992). This could explain why RS-20 and M-13 reduce Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal to ∼0.1/s while C2K and MARCKS peptide reduce Ca2+ dissociation to only ∼0.3/s. While every residue of RS-20, M-13, and C2K form contacts with CaM, the Trp residue in the N-terminal of RS-20 and M-13 may further stabilize the Ca2+ bound state, increase Ca2+ affinity, and decrease the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal.Our results show that the C-terminal of CaM has a 2.6-fold greater affinity for Ca2+ than the N-terminal of CaM. This agrees with the results of Minowa and Yagi(1984) who have shown a 3.4-fold higher Ca2+ affinity at the C-terminal of the molecule. Since the N-terminal of CaM has a 170-fold faster Ca2+ off-rate than the C-terminal but only a 2-3-fold lower Ca2+ affinity, it follows that the N-terminal of CaM must have a much faster Ca2+ on-rate than the C-terminal. Utilizing the Kd and Ca2+ off-rates for the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM, we calculated their Ca2+ on-rates to be 1.6 × 108M−1 s−1 and 2.3 × 106M−1 s−1, respectively.Estimates of Ca2+ on-rate from Koff/Kd could be complicated by the cooperativity that exists between the two Ca2+ binding sites in each lobe of CaM. Therefore, it was necessary to verify the faster Ca2+ on-rate to the N-terminal sites by an additional method. Currently, there is no way to directly measure the Ca2+ on-rate to the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites in a stopped flow apparatus. Our computer simulations (Fig. 4) were conducted assuming the Ca2+ off-rates determined by our stopped flow studies and the calculated Ca2+ on-rates cited above and in Table 1. They suggest that during a rapid Ca2+ transient (half-width 0.6 ms), Ca2+ would occupy 96% of the N-terminal sites and 18% of the C-terminal sites. We have produced this rapid Ca2+ transient in the stopped flow and verified (using CaM and TNS fluorescence) that the N-terminal sites are >70% saturated by this Ca2+ transient, while the slower C-terminal sites are only 20% occupied. Thus, our calculated Ca2+ on-rates for the N- and C-terminal sites of CaM are verified by modeling (Fig. 4) and by the Ca2+ transient occupancy experiments using CaM-TNS (Fig. 5).Ca2+ not only binds quickly to the N-terminal Ca2+ sites, but it also rapidly exposes the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket to accommodate TNS and presumably protein binding. Thus, only the N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites on CaM can respond to a very rapid rise and fall in Ca2+ by opening and closing their hydrophobic binding pocket. The Ca2+ transient (0.6 ms half-width) produced in our stopped flow experiments is much faster than physiological Ca2+ transients, which exhibit half-widths from milliseconds to minutes. Clearly, during these longer Ca2+ transients, both the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites would be occupied. The rapid “artificial” Ca2+ transient produced in our stopped flow experiments was designed and used to verify the faster Ca2+ on-rate to the N-terminal sites of CaM relative to the C-terminal sites.The N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM have a ∼70-fold faster Ca2+ on-rate and a ∼170-fold faster Ca2+ off-rate than the higher affinity C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites. Therefore, the N-terminal sites of CaM resemble the N-terminal sites of TnC, which have a fast Ca2+ on-rate (∼2 × 108M−1 s−1) and off-rate (400/s) (Johnson et al., 1979, 1994) compared to the higher affinity C-terminal Ca2+-Mg2+ sites.Both the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM must bind Ca2+ and expose their hydrophobic pockets to activate target proteins (Persechini and Kretsinger, 1988). Our Ca2+ titrations (Fig. 3) indicate that RS-20 and C2K increase Ca2+ affinity at CaM's C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites so dramatically that these sites may be 50-80% occupied even at the resting levels of Ca2+ found in smooth muscle cells (∼pCa 6.8, Cornwell and Lincoln(1989)). Therefore, the higher affinity C-terminal lobe of CaM may be bound to some target proteins at resting Ca2+ levels. While this would not result in enzyme activation, the subsequent rapid binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal sites of CaM would allow it to bind also, resulting in target protein activation. A similar mechanism exists in skeletal muscle troponin C, where the higher affinity C-terminal Ca2+-Mg2+ sites stabilize the troponin complex at resting levels of Ca2+, and the rapid exchange of Ca2+ with the faster N-terminal sites regulates contraction and relaxation (Potter and Johnson, 1981).Ca2+ dissociates from CaM after cellular free [Ca2+] falls in a Ca2+ transient. This results in the disruption of most CaM-target protein complexes and target protein inactivation. Since both halves of CaM are required for activation, the removal of Ca2+ from either the N- or C-terminal Ca2+ binding site would result in enzyme inactivation. Our data (Table 1) indicate that in the presence of MLCK and peptides, Ca2+ dissociates from the N-terminal sites of CaM 5-29 times faster (1.8-2.9/s) than it dissociates from the C-terminal half of the molecule (0.1-0.4/s). This suggests that as the [Ca2+] falls, the N-terminal half of CaM would dissociate first, resulting in enzyme inactivation at a rate slower than 2-3/s (at 10°C and low ionic strength). At 20°C, in the presence of RS-20 and KCl, Ca2+ dissociates from the N-terminal sites of CaM at 4.5/s and from the C-terminal sites of CaM at 0.18/s. If Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal of CaM controls the disruption and inactivation of the CaM·MLCK complex, then these events must occur slower than 4.5/s at 20°C. Consistent with this, we have previously shown that EGTA disrupts the CaM-skeletal muscle MLCK complex at 2/s (Johnson et al., 1981) and the CaM-smooth muscle MLCK complex at 3.2/s (Kasturi et al., 1993) at 20°C. Stull et al. (1986) have also demonstrated that EGTA can inactivate CaM-activated MLCK at a rate of ∼1/s. Thus, Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal sites of CaM in the CaM·RS-20 and CaM·MLCK complexes is fast enough to control disruption of these complexes and the inactivation of MLCK. Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal sites at 0.18/s is too slow to be responsible for the disruption of this complex and inactivation of MLCK. Thus, Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal sites of CaM, in the CaM·MLCK complex, appears to control the rate of enzyme inactivation as the [Ca2+] falls.Ca2+ dissociates from the N-terminal sites of CaM hundreds of times more slowly when a target protein is bound (1.8-2.9/s). This allows a rapid Ca2+ transient to result in the binding and presumable activation of a CaM target protein for over 300-400 ms. Thus, the fast rate of Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal of CaM allows it to rapidly “sense” the Ca2+ transient and bind target proteins. The dramatic increases in Ca2+ affinity and the reductions in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation observed in the CaM-target protein complex ensures that CaM-activated enzymes can remain active long after a rapid Ca2+ transient has subsided.

(1995) for reviews). The N- and C-terminal lobes are separated by an 8-turn α-helix, and they undergo a Ca2+-dependent exposure of their hydrophobic binding pockets, which allows binding and activation of target protein (LaPorte et al., 1980; Tanaka and Hidaka, 1980). In the presence of Ca2+, both the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic pockets of CaM bind an amphipathic α-helical peptide domain within the target protein structure (O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990), and recently the high resolution x-ray and NMR structure of several Ca2+·CaM·peptide complexes have been determined (Ikura et al., 1992; Meador et al., 1992, 1993). Ca2+-CaM binding removes a pseudosubstrate inhibitory domain from many enzymes' active sites, and this results in the activation of smooth and skeletal muscle MLCK, CaM kinase II, calcineurin, plasmalemma Ca-ATPase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (see Kemp and Pearson(1991) and James et al. (1995) for review).The CaM binding domains of many CaM target proteins have been identified, and peptides representing these domains from skeletal (M-13) and smooth (RS-20) muscle MLCK, CaM Kinase II (C2K), and the MARCKS protein have been synthesized. These peptides bind CaM with nanomolar affinity as does the entire target protein (Blumenthal et al., 1985; Lucas et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1988; Verghese et al., 1994).The binding of target proteins, their CaM binding domain peptides, and hydrophobic drugs all produce dramatic (7-40-fold) increases in CaM's affinity for Ca2+ (Keller et al., 1982; Olwin et al., 1984; Mills et al., 1985; Yagi and Yazawa, 1989; Kasturi et al., 1993). These increases in Ca2+ affinity might be reflected by decreases in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the lower affinity N- and higher affinity C-terminal EF hands of CaM. If target peptide and protein binding reduces the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the CaM·protein (peptide) complex, then the rate of complex dissociation and inactivation could be delayed until long after the Ca2+ transient has subsided. In this paper, we determined the rates of Ca2+ exchange with the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM and examined the effects of MLCK and several CaM binding peptides on the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the N- and C-terminal Ca2+ binding sites of CaM and on C-terminal Ca2+ affinity. We relate our results to the mechanism of CaM's activation and inactivation of its target proteins during a cellular Ca2+ transient."

Infection by picornaviruses results in proteolytic cleavage of one of these factors, eIF4G, an event that severely restricts cap-dependent translation but permits cap-independent initiation to proceed from internal ribosome entry sequences in picornaviral RNAs. The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of eIF4G mRNA resembles such picornaviral sequences in being unusually long and containing multiple open reading frames and a polypyrimidine tract.

Initiation of the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic mRNAs proceeds by a cap-dependent mechanism whereby the AUG nearest the 5′-end serves as the initiation codon(1Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Yet other modes of initiation codon selection are used in special cases, e.g. leaky scanning, termination-reinitiation, and internal initiation(2Jackson R.J. Hunt S.L. Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Sarnow P. Cap-independent Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 1-29Google Scholar).

For Picornaviridae, the rationale for a cap-independent route is evident: entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses encode a protease that cleaves translation initiation factor eIF4G. 2This was formerly known as eIF-4γ, eIF-4Fγ, and p220 but was recently renamed eIF4G by an Expert Panel of the IUBMB convened on 4 8, 1995.

The cleavage of eIF4G by picornaviral proteases separates the N-terminal one-third of the molecule, which binds eIF4E, from the C-terminal two-thirds, which binds eIF4A and eIF3, effectively dissociating the cap recognition function from the RNA helicase and ribosome binding functions of the eIF4 factors(19Lamphear B.J.

Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) eIF4G mRNA are unusual in several respects. First, they are considerably longer (368 for human, 528 for yeast) than the average eukaryotic mRNA 5′-UTR(22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Second, they contain multiple short, open reading frames (4 for human, 11 for TIF4631, 4 for TIF4632). Third, human and yeast TIF4631 mRNAs contain a polypyrimidine tract of 9-11 nt located 50-53 nt upstream from the initiation codon. (There is a corresponding U-rich region in TIF4632 mRNA.) All of these features are reminiscent of picornaviral IRES(5Kaminski A. Hunt S.L. Gibbs C.L. Jackson R.J. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1994: 115-155Google Scholar). We present evidence here that the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA, like picornaviral IRES, acts as a strong translational enhancer and can efficiently direct internal initiation in vivo. The luciferase expression vector pGL2-Control (Promega) was either used directly (here designated pGL2/LUC) or modified to contain the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA (pGL2/4G/LUC). cDNA corresponding to nt 1-357 of human eIF4G mRNA was amplified by PCR from pHFC5 (20Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCTAGATGGGGGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGATATCCTTTCCTCC-3′, which created a HindIII site at each end. The product was inserted into the unique HindIII site of pGL2/LUC. The second, third, and fourth upstream ATG codons were changed to AAG by PCR mutagenesis of the above PCR product (23Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar) to create pGL2/4G2-4/LUC, and all four upstream ATG codons were changed to AAG to create pGL2/4G1-4/LUC. For construction of vectors encoding an RNA hairpin, a 72-bp palindromic sequence consisting of an inverted repeat of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) from the XbaI to EcoRV sites was ligated into the unique StuI site of pGL2/4G/LUC to produce pGL2/H/4G/LUC. A similar insertion was made in pGL2/LUC to produce pGL2/H/LUC. Because the StuI site is itself palindromic, the total length of the palindrome when inserted is 78 bp. For construction of vectors expressing a bicistronic mRNA, a 736-bp fragment containing the CAT coding region, flanked by 5′- and 3′-UTRs of 54 and 23 bp, respectively, was obtained from pCAT-Basic Vector (Promega) by digestion with BanI and SalI and blunt end-ligated into the StuI site of pGL2/LUC and pGL2/4G/LUC to produce pGL2/CAT/LUC and pGL2/CAT/4G/LUC, respectively. In all cases, constructions were verified by DNA sequencing or restriction endonuclease analysis. K562, HeLa CCL2, HEL 92.1.7, and Jurkat cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 30 μg of each luciferase-expressing plasmid and 5 μg of pCMVβ (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), the latter being a control plasmid that encodes β-galactosidase. Electroporation was performed in triplicate using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at ∞ ohms, 960 microfarads, and 0.22 kV. The number of cells electroporated was 8 × 106 for K562, 4 × 105 for HeLa, and 6 × 108 for HEL and Jurkat. Cells were cultured for an additional 18 h and collected, and aliquots of 1 × 103 cells were assayed for luciferase activity (24Braster A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and β-galactosidase activity(25Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.A. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Variations in transfection efficiency were corrected by normalizing luciferase activity in each sample with β-galactosidase activity. CAT activity was measured in aliquots of 4.5 × 103 cells using D-threo-[1,2-14C]chloramphenicol (ICN) as described previously(26Kingston R.E. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.6.2-9.6.9Google Scholar). A probe for ribonuclease protection assays was prepared by digestion of pGL2/LUC with XbaI and EcoRI to produce a 540-bp fragment from the luciferase coding region. This was inserted into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene), which had been cut with the same enzymes. Antisense RNA against luciferase mRNA was produced in vitro with T7 polymerase, and ribonuclease protection assays were performed as described(27Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar). Human eIF4G mRNA contains open reading frames at nt 6-39, 67-88, 90-108, and 165-171, all upstream of the 4188-nt open reading frame that encodes the protein(20Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the ribosome scanning model, such a 5′-UTR would be expected to down-regulate translation in a manner highly dependent on the presence of the upstream AUGs. To test this, we placed a DNA segment encoding the first 357 nt of eIF4G mRNA 29 bp upstream of the coding region for a luciferase reporter gene, driven by the SV40 promoter (Fig. 1A). The control vector (pGL2/LUC) and the eIF4G 5′-UTR-containing vector (pGL2/4G/LUC) were used to transfect the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Surprisingly, the 5′-UTR enhanced, rather than repressed, luciferase expression 7.3-fold (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the upstream open reading frames played a role in translation driven by the eIF4G 5′-UTR, we mutated the vector so as to produce mRNAs lacking either the second through fourth AUGs (pGL2/4G2-4/LUC) or all four upstream AUGs (pGL2/4G1-4/LUC; Fig. 1A). The expression of luciferase, however, was unaltered (Fig. 1B), indicating that the upstream AUGs do not play a significant role in the translational enhancement. The presence of the eIF4G 5′-UTR could conceivably alter steady-state levels of the luciferase mRNA. Hence, we performed ribonuclease protection analysis of luciferase mRNA in cells transfected with each of the four constructs (Fig. 1B, inset). The finding that mRNA levels were similar in all cell lines, and not proportional to luciferase expression, indicates that the 5′-UTR acts at the level of translation rather than transcription, splicing, or mRNA stability. To determine whether the translational enhancement was unique to K562 cells, we tested other human cell lines of diverse origins. HeLa cells, derived from a cervical carcinoma, HEL 92.1.7 cells, an erythroleukemia line derived from malignant peripheral blood, and Jurkat cells, derived from an acute T cell leukemia, were transfected with pGL2/LUC and pGL2/4G/LUC (Fig. 2). Even though the level of luciferase expression was considerably lower in all three cell lines compared with K562 cells (note scale change), the presence of the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA stimulated rather than inhibited expression in each case (2.1-fold in HeLa, 3.4-fold in HEL, and 3.7-fold in Jurkat). The possibility that expression of luciferase from these constructs is due to leaky scanning or termination-reinitiation is unlikely for several reasons. Some of the upstream AUG triplets in the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA have good sequence contexts for initiation(20Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the second AUG in the 5′-UTR is out of frame with the luciferase coding region; and there was no significant change in expression when these AUGs were altered (Fig. 1B). We tested directly for an internal entry mechanism by two different approaches. First, we placed a palindromic sequence 45 bp upstream of the luciferase coding region (pGL2/H/LUC; see Fig. 3A). The free energy of formation of the transcribed 78-nt RNA hairpin was calculated to be −78.9 kcal/mol using the computer program OLIGO (National Biosciences), considerably more stable than the −50 kcal/mol previously shown to be sufficient for preventing movement of the scanning small ribosomal subunit(28Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The hairpin reduced luciferase expression to 2.5% of the control vector containing no palindrome (pGL2/H/LUC versus pGL2/LUC; Fig. 3B). However, when sequences encoding the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA were placed between the palindrome and the luciferase cistron, expression was stimulated 119-fold (pGL2/H/4G/LUC versus pGL2/H/LUC). The presence of the palindrome in the eIF4G 5′-UTR-containing vectors caused only a slight drop (26%) in luciferase expression (pGL2/4G/LUC versus pGL2/H/4G/LUC). Bicistronic mRNAs have been effectively used in vivo to demonstrate the existence of IRES in both picornaviral (3Pelletier J. Sonenberg N.

Lipton H.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6249-6256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and non-picornaviral (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 10Oh S.-K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) RNAs. As most ribosomes fail to continue through the intercistronic region, the relative translational efficiency of the downstream cistron is greatly reduced unless preceded by an IRES. As a second approach to test for internal initiation, we inserted DNA encoding the eIF4G 5′-UTR into the 68-bp spacer separating CAT and luciferase cistrons (Fig. 4A). Expression of the downstream cistron was stimulated 42-fold compared with the bicistronic construct containing the spacer alone (Fig. 4C). CAT was synthesized in cells containing both constructs (Fig. 4B), although the presence of the eIF4G 5′-UTR depressed its expression. This has also been observed for in vivo expression driven by both BiP and poliovirus IRES (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and is thought to represent competition between cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation of bicistronic mRNA. The foregoing results suggest that eIF4G mRNA is translated in vivo by a cap-independent mechanism involving internal initiation. The presence of multiple upstream open reading frames would normally diminish mRNA translation severely(31Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 148-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA actually stimulates translation (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). An upstream RNA hairpin drastically inhibits translation, presumably by stopping the scanning small ribosomal subunit(28Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), but insertion of the 5′-UTR of eIF4G rescues translation (Fig. 3). Finally, the dramatic increase in translation of the downstream cistron of a bicistronic mRNA (Fig. 4) is difficult to explain without invoking internal initiation. Yet it should be noted that all of the experiments described here involve stimulation of a reporter gene and not eIF4G itself. Although there seems to be a clear rationale for the use of internal initiation by viruses, the advantage of this mechanism of initiation for the cellular mRNAs encoding BiP(9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), Antennapedia (10Oh S.-K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and basic fibroblast growth factor (11Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) is more difficult to understand. In the case of eIF4G, which is essential for cap-dependent translation but not for internal initiation, at least in its intact form, there are some intriguing possibilities why its mRNA would utilize internal initiation. First, this may represent a normal homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of intracellular levels of eIF4G. If eIF4G levels decreased, the capacity of the cell to carry out cap-dependent initiation would also decrease. The requirement of eIF4G for internal initiation may be less than that for cap-dependent initiation, although this is yet to be demonstrated. If so, the ribosomes and other components of the translational machinery would then become more available for increased translation of mRNAs that can utilize a cap-independent route. This would in turn increase eIF4G levels, completing an autoregulatory loop. Second, there are physiological events that suddenly switch the cell's predominant mode of initiation from cap-dependent to cap-independent(32Sarnow P.(ed.) Cap-independent Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995Crossref Google Scholar). The best understood of these is infection by entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses, in which cap-dependent translation decreases drastically while cap-independent translation persists. If eIF4G synthesis continues during infection, it may provide a host defense mechanism whereby viral takeover would be slowed, or recovery from infection accelerated, by replenishment of intact eIF4G in order to restore cap-dependent initiation. An alternative view is that the virus would actually take advantage of the continued synthesis of eIF4G during infection. Since internal initiation from the IRES of entero- and rhinoviruses is stimulated by eIF4G cleavage(13Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3465-3474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably through the generation of cleavage products, continued synthesis of eIF4G may provide more cleavage products to aid in viral translation. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require additional experimentation. Another physiological situation in which the predominant mode of translation can switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent is heat shock (reviewed in (33Rhoads R.E. Lamphear B. Sarnow P. Cap-independent Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 131-153Google Scholar)). In a variety of cell types and species, heat shock causes the synthesis of non-HSP proteins to decrease rapidly, but the synthesis of HSPs remains the same or increases. The change in translational specificity does not require transcription of HSP genes or the appearance of new HSPs in the cytosol. The defect produced by heat shock is preserved in cell lysates and can be corrected in both Ehrlich (34Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila (35Zapata J.M. Maroto F.G. Sierra J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16007-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cell lysates by a complex of eIF4E and eIF4G. Cells with very low levels of both factors do not recover from heat shock(36Joshi-Barve S. DeBenedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, BiP, which is produced by internal initiation (9Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and continues to be translated in poliovirus-infected cells(37Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5795-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), shares many properties with HSPs. It has partial sequence homology with HSP70 and becomes elevated during a variety of stress-inducing conditions. The finding that the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA directs internal initiation suggests that eIF4G may also continue to be synthesized after heat shock and may accelerate recovery.

Substitution of eight amino acids from the Xenopus receptor's second extracellular loop (XECL2B) for the cognate sequence in the human thrombin receptor was sufficient to confer robust constitutive activity. Smaller substitutions within the XECL2B site yielded less constitutive activation, and substitution of several unrelated sequences at this site caused no activation. Expression of the XECL2B receptor caused high basal 45Ca efflux in Xenopus oocytes and high basal phosphoinositide hydrolysis and reporter gene induction in COS cells. Of note, a mutant receptor in which all four of the Xenopus thrombin receptor's extracellular segments replaced the cognate human sequences showed much less constitutive activity than XECL2B and preserved responsiveness to agonist. This partial complementation of the XECL2B phenotype by addition of other Xenopus extracellular structures suggests that the XECL2B mutation causes constitutive activation by altering interactions among the human receptor's extracellular domains. Thus, a change in an extracellular loop of a G protein-coupled receptor can transmit information across the cell membrane to cause signaling, perhaps via a conformational change similar to that caused by agonist binding.

A variety of naturally occurring and engineered mutations in G protein-coupled receptors have been found to cause constitutive activation. Their importance is underscored by the observation that activating mutations in G protein-coupled receptors underlie a variety of human diseases. The locations of activating mutations both within a single receptor and across receptors are widespread, with activating mutations reported in transmembrane domains 2, 3, 6, and 7; in cytoplasmic loops 1 and 3; and at the junction of transmembrane domain 2 and extracellular loop 1 (reviewed in (1Spiegel A.M.

This diversity suggests that specific interactions maintain G protein-coupled receptors in their off-state(s) and that these interactions can be disrupted in a variety of ways. We recently generated a constitutively active thrombin receptor in the course of studying chimeric thrombin receptors designed to identify the receptor domains that distinguish the human from Xenopus thrombin receptor agonist peptides. Building human thrombin receptor sequence into the Xenopus receptor (specifically small regions of the receptor's amino-terminal exodomain near transmembrane domain 1 and its second extracellular loop) conferred human receptor-like agonist specificity(10Gerszten R.E.

These same receptor regions, particularly receptor residues 260-268 in the second extracellular loop, were identified by a second approach that sought receptor mutations that complemented loss-of-function mutations in the agonist(11Nanevicz T.

In an attempt to confer Xenopus receptor-like specificity to the human receptor, we built Xenopus receptor sequences into the human receptor, the converse of the chimera experiments just described. Strikingly, several of the resulting chimeras were constitutively active. The substitution responsible for activation mapped to residues 259-268 in the receptor's second extracellular loop, the same region previously identified as responsible for agonist specificity. These studies clearly show that mutation of a G protein-coupled receptor's extracellular domain can cause transmembrane signaling. The observation that the site of the activating mutation is one previously shown to be involved in agonist recognition suggests that the activating mutation may cause a conformational change similar to that caused by agonist docking and supports the hypothesis that agonist interactions with extracellular loops can contribute to transmembrane signaling. cDNAs encoding human and Xenopus mutant thrombin receptors were generated by standard techniques (12Kunkel T.A.

After culture for 24 h, receptor expression on the oocyte surface was measured as specific binding of antibody to the FLAG epitope. Surface expression of mutant receptors generally ranged from 50 to 150% of the wild type. Basal and agonist-stimulated 45Ca efflux, an index of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the oocyte, was measured as described previously(15Vu T.-K. H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

At this time, the oocytes were divided into groups of five, and 45Ca released per 10-min interval was determined. “Basal 45Ca release” is defined as that occurring in the 10-min interval between minutes 20 and 30. At 30 min, thrombin or agonist peptide was added. Agonist-induced 45Ca release was measured as that released during the subsequent 10 min. Constructs were as follows. XenAT replaced human receptor amino-terminal exodomain residues 1-92 with the cognate Xenopus sequence; XECL1, extracellular loop 1 residues 160-174; XECL2, extracellular loop 2 residues 244-268; XECL3, extracellular loop 3 residues 333-349; and XECL All = XenAT + XECL1 + XECL2 + XECL3. XECL2A replaced residues 244-254, and XECL2B replaced residues 255-268. Chimeras with more limited substitutions within the XECL2B region were also tested; the specific substitutions are indicated in Fig. 1B.

Cells were washed and treated with 20 mM LiCl in DMEM with and without 10 nM human α-thrombin (gift of Dr. John W.

Triplicate 35-mm plates with 2 × 105 COS-7 cells/plate were each transfected with 1.25 μg of each plasmid as described above. 12 h after transfection, the cells were changed to serum-free DMEM and incubated for 24 h.

Surface expression of wild-type and mutant thrombin receptors was determined as specific binding of monoclonal antibody M1 (Kodak) directed at the FLAG epitope at the receptor's amino terminus. In each experiment that examined wild-type or mutant receptor function in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells, surface expression levels were determined in parallel cultures (10Gerszten R.E. Chen J.

Constitutively active thrombin receptors were generated serendipitously while studying chimeric receptors to identify receptor domains mediating agonist recognition. The human and Xenopus thrombin receptors each respond preferentially to peptide agonists representing their respective tethered ligand domains. Substitution of small segments of the human thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain and second extracellular loop for the corresponding Xenopus thrombin receptor segments yielded a chimeric receptor with human receptor-like agonist specificity. The single substitution that yielded the greatest gain of responsiveness to human agonist replaced Xenopus receptor residues 259-262 in the second extracellular loop with the cognate human sequence. A second approach that sought human receptor mutations that complemented loss-of-function mutations in the human agonist peptide also identified the human thrombin receptor's second extracellular loop, particularly residues 260-268, as participating in agonist recognition (10Gerszten R.E.

An attempt to confer Xenopus thrombin receptor-like specificity to the human thrombin receptor by building Xenopus receptor sequence into the human receptor (a “mirror image” of the chimera experiments described above) yielded a surprise. Because substitution of the human amino-terminal exodomain and second extracellular loop into the Xenopus thrombin receptor had conferred human receptor-like specificity(10Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-H. K. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we constructed a human thrombin receptor containing the Xenopus receptor's amino-terminal exodomain and second extracellular loop. Strikingly, this chimera showed constitutive activity (Fig. 1). To identify the substitution(s) responsible for constitutive activation, we constructed chimeras in which individual Xenopus thrombin receptor extracellular domains were substituted for the cognate human sequences. A chimera bearing the Xenopus thrombin receptor's second extracellular loop alone (XECL2) caused constitutively high 45Ca release when expressed in Xenopus oocytes; chimeras bearing other Xenopus thrombin receptor extracellular domains did not (Fig. 1). The receptor's second extracellular loop can be logically divided into two segments by Cys254, which is thought to form a disulfide bridge with Cys175 at the extracellular end of transmembrane domain 3. Substitution of the carboxyl-terminal segment of the Xenopus receptor's second extracellular loop for the corresponding human sequence resulted in a chimera designated XECL2B with robust constitutive activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 1). XECL2B exchanged residues 259-262, 264-266, and 268 in the human thrombin receptor for the cognate Xenopus residues (Fig. 1). Smaller Xenopus-for-human amino acid substitutions within this region yielded less robust constitutive activity, and irrelevant or conservative substitutions instead of the Xenopus residues introduced by XECL2B failed to cause constitutive activation (Fig. 1). Thus, specific sequence must be substituted at the XECL2B site to effect constitutive activation. This result contrasts with that obtained with a well studied activating mutation in the α1B-adrenergic receptor. Mutation of Ala293 in the α1B-receptor's third cytoplasmic loop to any other amino acid caused constitutive activation, suggesting that the mechanism of mutational activation is disruption of an interaction that normally prevents the unliganded receptor from activating G proteins (21Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the observation that multiple and specific amino acid substitutions are required for the constitutive activation seen with XECL2B raises the possibility that the XECL2B mutation causes a specific conformational change in addition to or instead of simply disrupting interactions that maintain the receptor in its off-state. The constitutive activity of the XECL2B mutant receptor was manifest in mammalian cells as well as in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Expression of XECL2B in COS-7 cells yielded high basal phosphoinositide hydrolysis and induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the c-fos 5′-regulatory region (Fig. 2). Activation of luciferase expression via this reporter reflects activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and other intracellular signaling pathways(20Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin further stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and luciferase expression in cells expressing XECL2B. The 20% increase in luciferase expression caused by thrombin in cells expressing XECL2B was less than the 2-fold increase for thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis presumably because luciferase accumulated between XECL2B transfection and stimulation with thrombin. The fact that the XECL2B receptor could indeed respond to thrombin raised the question, might the constitutive activity seen in cells expressing XECL2B depend in part on tonic activation by residual thrombin from serum or by some other protease? Ablation of the thrombin cleavage site in the XECL2B receptor chimera (XECL2B-S42P) ablated its ability to respond to added thrombin, but did not alter its constitutive activity (Fig. 2). The constitutive activity of XECL2B thus does not require unmasking of the receptor's tethered ligand domain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the XECL2B mutation increases the receptor's probability of entering an active conformation even in the absence of agonist. Alternatively, one could postulate that unstimulated XECL2B and wild-type receptors enter the active conformation with the same frequency, with the XECL2B mutation interfering with receptor uncoupling and shutoff. The major uncoupling mechanism for regulating G protein-coupled receptors is phosphorylation of activated receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases(23Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 24Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 60: 651-688Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that replacing serines and threonines in the thrombin receptor's carboxyl-terminal tail with alanines prevented its agonist-dependent phosphorylation in Rat-1 and COS-7 cells and rendered it insensitive to inhibition by coexpressed β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 in the Xenopus system(17Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We compared signaling by this “desensitization-defective” mutant (C-tail Ser/Thr → Ala) with that of XECL2B in COS-7 cells. Unlike XECL2B, the C-tail Ser/Thr → Ala mutant did not cause constitutively high phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the absence of thrombin (Fig. 2A). In the presence of thrombin, the C-tail Ser/Thr → Ala mutant showed enhanced responses compared with wild-type and XECL2B receptors, consistent with the hypothesis that each activated C-tail Ser/Thr → Ala receptor coupled longer to phosphoinositide hydrolysis before its signaling was terminated (Fig. 2C)(14Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling behavior of XECL2B is thus distinct from that of a mutant receptor with defective desensitization. Overall, our data are most consistent with the hypothesis that the XECL2B mutation increases the probability of the receptor entering an active conformation. The XECL2B mutation substitutes native sequence from the Xenopus thrombin receptor at the cognate position in the human thrombin receptor. The XECL2B sequence clearly does not cause constitutive activation in its native context in the Xenopus receptor. How is it that the wild-type human and Xenopus thrombin receptors do not show constitutive activity while the chimera does? A chimera in which the Xenopus thrombin receptor's entire second extracellular loop was substituted for the cognate human loop displayed less constitutive activity than XECL2B, and a chimera in which the Xenopus thrombin receptor's entire extracellular surface was substituted for that of the human receptor (XECL All) showed less still (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). These chimeras showed robust signaling to thrombin, thus their lack of basal signaling was not due to a general loss of function. The partial complementation of the XECL2B phenotype by addition of other Xenopus extracellular structures implies a direct or indirect interaction of these structures and suggests two alternative mechanisms for XECL2B's gain of function. The XECL2B mutation may effect constitutive activation by interacting with neighboring exodomain structures, disrupting normal interactions among the human receptor's extracellular domains that help constrain the receptor in an off-state, and/or generating novel interactions that cause activation. Alternatively, the receptor's extracellular loops may interact only indirectly by constraining the arrangement of the receptor's transmembrane domains. In this model, the XECL2B mutation would cause activation via linkage of extracellular loop 2 to transmembrane domains. Explaining the complementation phenomenon described above with this second model is more cumbersome that with the first. Previously identified activating mutations reside in putative transmembrane domains 2, 3, 6, and 7 and in the first and third intracellular loops(1Spiegel A.M. Weinstein L.S. Shenker A. J. Clin.

In addition, an activating missense mutation at the junction of transmembrane domain 2 and extracellular loop 1 has been uncovered in the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor(5Robbins L.S.

The location of the XECL2B mutation spans a putative asparagine-linked glycosylation site and is well within the thrombin receptor's predicted second extracellular loop. This mutation clearly shows that changes in an extracellular domain of a G protein-coupled receptor can cause transmembrane signaling and receptor activation. As noted above, two independent approaches identified human thrombin receptor residues 259-268 as important determinants of the receptor's agonist specificity. The XECL2B substitution involves this same region. The observation that the site of the XECL2B activating mutation overlaps a site shown to be important for agonist specificity, a putative agonist-docking site, is provocative. It suggests that the activating mutation may cause a conformational change similar to that caused by agonist docking and supports the hypothesis that agonist interactions with extracellular loops may be important for signal transduction.

Two forms of the channel were examined: channels produced by the α subunit alone and those formed by α, β, and γ subunits.

We found that either α-rENaC alone or α- in combination with β- and γ-rENaC, produced highly Na+-selective (PNa/PK = 10), amiloride-sensitive (Kiamil = 170 nM), and mechanosensitive cation channels in planar bilayers. α-rENaC displayed a complicated gating mechanism: there was a nearly constitutively open 13-picosiemens (pS) state and a second 40-pS level that was achieved from the 13-pS level by a 26-pS transition. α-, β-, γ-rENaC showed primarily the 13-pS level. α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC channels studied by patch clamp displayed the same gating pattern, albeit with >2-fold lowered conductance levels, i.e. 6 and 18 pS, respectively.

Interestingly, the single channel conductance of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels found in this epithelium is 19-20 pS(19Chinet T.C. Fullton J.M. Yankaskas J.R. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

The purposes of the present work were 2-fold. First, we wished to develop a reconstitution system in which the single channel properties of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC could be studied, unencumbered by problems inherent in heterologous expression systems. Second, we tested the hypothesis that variations in relative levels of α, β, and γ have functional consequences on single channel behavior. Our results indicate that either α alone, or α in combination with one or both of the other subunits of ENaC produce mechanosensitive, amiloride-inhibited, Na+-selective ion channels following incorporation into planar lipid bilayers. α-rENaC channels showed a complex kinetic pattern: there were two main conductance transitions, one of 13 and the other of 26 pS. In contrast, α,β,γ-rENaC revealed only the 13-pS state. Different combinations of α, β, or γ did not produce channels of intermediate conductance. Gating of α-rENaC was cooperative, with transitions to a 40-pS level only occurring after the 13-pS level was open. Moreover, upon treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), both α-rENac and α,β,γ-rENaC fluctuated among three independent 13-pS sublevels. We conclude that these channels are composed of three identical conduction elements and that the differences in the activity of the channels are modulated by the presence of the β and γ subunits within the complex.

This resulted in the core glycosylation of the de novo synthesized protein(7Fuller C.M. Awayda M.S. Arrate M.P. Bradford A.L. Morris R.G. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C641-C654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translated proteins were purified on a G-75 Sephadex (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column as described previously(20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in the appropriate ENaC subunits were reconstituted into phospholipid liposomes as described earlier(20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For liposomes containing α,β,γ-rENaC, subunits were in vitro translated separately, and each was purified over a gel filtration column. Identical elution fractions were collected and assayed for total 35S incorporation. The relative ratios of α, β, and γ subunits reconstituted into vesicles were determined by these 35S measurements, assuming similar methionine compositions for each subunit. Control liposomes were also prepared from a mock in vitro translation/Sephadex column purification run, following an identical protocol. In this case, ENaC RNA was simply omitted from the reaction mixture. These liposomes were used as control material for the bilayer experiments. Membrane vesicles from α-rENaC- and α,β,γ-rENaC mRNA-injected and water-injected oocytes were made essentially as described by Perez et al. (21Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman JP. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thirty oocytes in each group were rinsed and homogenized in high [K+]/sucrose medium containing multiple protease inhibitors. Membranes were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation and resuspended in 300 mM sucrose, 100 mM/KCl, and 5 mM MOPS at pH 6.8. This material was aliquoted into 50-μl fractions and stored at −80°C until use. Lipid bilayers were cast from a phospholipid solution in n-octane containing a 2:1:2 mixture of diphytanoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/diphytanoyl-phophatidylserine/ oxidized cholesterol (25 mg/ml). Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bilayer capacitances ranged from 300 to 400 picofarads. The solution bathing the bilayers consisted of 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MOPS-Tris buffer (pH 7.4) unless otherwise noted. All solutions were made with Milli-Q water and were filter-sterilized through 0.22-μm Sterivex-GS filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The reconstituted vesicles or oocyte membranes were applied with a glass rod to one side (trans) of the preformed bilayer with the membrane voltage held at −40 mV. Under these conditions, channels oriented (>90% of the time, n = 250) asymmetrically, with the amiloride-sensitive (extracellular) side facing the trans solution. Voltage was applied to the cis chamber, and the trans chamber was virtual ground. Single channel recordings were acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP software as described previously(22Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10235-10241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The recordings were acquired and stored unfiltered. For analysis, they were filtered at 300 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter and acquired at 1 ms/point. The 50% threshold-crossing technique was employed to produce events lists. Open and closed dwell time histograms were logarithmically binned and fitted by a sum of exponential functions using maximum likelihood. All data analysis was performed in bilayers containing a single active channel. Application of a hydrostatic pressure difference across a bilayer containing reconstituted ENaC increased open probability to near 1 (20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was independent of the direction of the hydrostatic pressure gradient, i.e. it was equally effective when the bathing solution level was lowered or raised on either side of the channel-containing bilayer. In multichannel membranes, hydrostatic pressure could thus reveal the total number of channels present in the membrane. Therefore, at the beginning of every experiment, 1 ml of the trans bathing solution was removed to determine the total number of Na+ channels present. If more than one channel was detected, the membrane was broken and the incorporation procedure repeated. Cell-attached patch clamp recordings were obtained from defolliculated oocytes previously injected with α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC cRNA (12.5 ng for oocytes expressing α-rENaC alone, and 1 ng of each subunit for oocytes expressing all three rENaC subunits) or 50 nl of nuclease-free water at room temperature. The composition of the pipette solution (ND-96) was (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5.0 HEPES (pH 7.4). The bathing solution had K+ substituted for Na+ to eliminate the resting membrane potential. Blunt-tipped patch micropipettes with a tip resistance of approximately 1-2 MΩ were fabricated using a Narashigi pp73 two-stage micropipette puller. Under these conditions, inward single channel currents (downward current openings) in the cell-attached patches were carried by Na+ when the pipette was positive relative to the bath. Single channel currents were examined using an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany). After sealing the pipettes to the cells (seal resistance >10 gigaohms), the cell-attached patches were clamped to a variety of voltages using an S-95 trilevel stimulator (Medical Systems; Greenville, NY). The amplifier gain was 100 mV/pA. This degree of amplification was sufficient to resolve clearly single channel openings >0.3 pA. The resultant ionic currents at each membrane potential were filtered at 300 Hz, digitally recorded at 1 kHz, and filed for analysis by pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). All patch clamp experiments were performed at 21 ± 2°C. We have previously demonstrated that in vitro translated α-bENaC, the bovine ENaC homolog, migrates as a dimer on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions(7Fuller C.M. Awayda M.S. Arrate M.P. Bradford A.L. Morris R.G. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C641-C654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen from the autoradiograph shown in Fig. 1(lane 1), a similar gel pattern was observed for α-rENaC in vitro translated in the presence of microsomes and run under denatured but nonreduced conditions. In seven experiments of this type, the presence of a dimer at 172 ± 11 kDa was always observed. However, the relative distribution of α-rENaC in the monomeric versus dimeric form differed from one batch of translation reaction to the other. The highest yield of a dimer to a monomer form is shown in the example in Fig. 1. Despite this variability there were never any observed differences in the biophysical properties of the in vitro translated channel incorporated into planar lipid bilayers (see below). Moreover, there was no evidence for the presence of a trimer form of α-rENaC (i.e. a product that migrated at ∼270 kDa was not observed; see lane 1). These observations suggest that the α subunit of ENaC may occur in its native state as a covalently linked dimer. As seen from lane 2, this pattern of interaction was not modified by the addition of the β and γ subunits. Lane 3 shows that the 180-kDa band is absent following reduction with 20 mM DTT and that the highest molecular mass band observed was one at 92 kDa. This size protein was expected for monomeric and core-glycosylated α-rENaC and was similar to previous observations on α-bENaC(7Fuller C.M. Awayda M.S. Arrate M.P. Bradford A.L. Morris R.G. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C641-C654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-translation of all three subunits simultaneously did not reveal any forms between 200 and 300 kDa. Lane 4 shows a control, run in the absence of any ENaC message. Thus, the polypeptides seen in lanes 1-3 at molecular masses lower than 92 kDa probably represent partial translation products. The absence of a protein that migrated at a relative molecular mass in the range of the cumulative masses of one α, one β, and one γ subunit suggests that α, β, and γ do not covalently interact in a simple 1:1:1 ratio and that electrostatic interactions may be important in stabilizing the native ENaC complex. The column-purified in vitro translated polypeptides of α-rENaC, or α,β,γ-rENaC were reconstituted into liposomes and then incorporated into planar lipid bilayer membranes. As shown in Fig. 2, these in vitro translated proteins form functional ion channels (n = 7 for each). This figure depicts channel activity at different applied potentials. There was no effect of voltage on Po of either channel. Fig. 2B shows the associated main state single channel current versus voltage curves for each channel. Both α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC channels were linear. In over 1,000 attempted incorporations using control liposomes (see “Materials and Methods”), no channels of any kind were detected. Examination of the single channel records over several minutes for both α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC indicate continuous activity with no run-down (n = 16; Fig. 3). These channels were kinetically different from α-bENaC in bilayers, in that α-bENaC channel activity was punctuated by long closed periods lasting up to several minutes(20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long (>1-s) closures were never observed for the rENaC channels in over 2 h of recording. α-rENaC channels displayed a specific gating pattern; with symmetrical 100 mM NaCl, the largest conductance level was 40 pS, but the channel appeared to fluctuate among 0-, 13-, 26-, and 40-pS levels (see associated all points amplitude histograms, Fig. 3B). These histograms did not fit the binomial algorithm for independent gating, indicating that these conductance levels cannot be produced by three independent channels. Neither the 13- nor 26-pS current transitions were ever observed independently of each other in over 300 separate experiments. In the small number of cases (19/330) in which multiple channels were incorporated into the bilayer, the pattern shown at the top of Fig. 3 was simply repeated, i.e. for two channels in the bilayer, 4, 5, and 6 additional states were seen. Moreover, the single channel records indicated that the gating properties of the α-rENaC channel were not independent. Openings of the 26-pS level were only observed after the 13-pS state was open, never before. However, albeit infrequently, the 13-pS state would close prior to closure of the 26-pS transition (see Fig. 2A, top). When α,β,γ-rENaC, in a 1:1:1 (w/w/w) combination, was incorporated into bilayers, only a 13-pS conductance level was observed (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, bottom). However, brief openings of <250 ms in a duration to 40 pS were occasionally seen. Again, these openings occurred on the top of 13-pS conductance level that was, in essence, constitutively open. Event dwell time histograms were constructed for all the conductance levels of α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC channels by setting a threshold at 50% of the open level of each substate (Fig. 3C). The dwell histograms in each sublevel for each channel were all fitted by a single exponential function. The closed state time constants were 70 ± 9 and 40 ± 5 ms for α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC, respectively. The open state time constants for α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC, respectively, were (in ms) 77 ± 10 and 72 ± 3 (13-pS state), 35 ± 8 and 51 ± 3 (26-pS state), and 91 ± 11 and 52 ± 3 (40-pS state). From this analysis, the time constant for exit from the closed state is nearly twice as long for α-rENaC than for α,β,γ-rENaC. Because α,β,γ-rENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes displays a Na+-selective, 5-pS single channel conductance with relatively long lived open and closed conductance states as measured by patch clamp(2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 8Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we wanted to assess directly whether bilayer reconstitution protocol utilizing in vitro translated polypeptides could affect conductance and/or open and closed times. Therefore, we compared rENaC single channel properties determined from patch clamp measurements of rENaC-expressing oocytes with those made in bilayers using in vitro translated proteins or subsequent to fusion of rENaC-expressing oocyte plasma membranes. Oocytes were injected either with α-rENaC or α,β,γ-rENaC cRNA and then either they were patch-clamped or their plasma membranes were used for fusion to planar bilayers. Fig. 4 shows the results of these maneuvers. Patch clamp recordings of oocytes expressing α-rENaC revealed channels with a large conductance of approximately 18 pS. Interposed among the large transitions were two additional conductance levels of 6 and 12 pS each. In recordings made from three separate oocytes, these α-rENaC channels behaved in this manner. Except for the absolute values of the conductance states, this kinetic behavior was very similar to that observed for α-rENaC in the bilayer (Fig. 2). However, in contrast to the bilayer, channel activity occurred in bursts rather than continuously. Patch clamp recordings made from oocytes expressing α,β,γ-rENaC typically showed long lived 6-pS channels, similar to what was previously reported(2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Native oocyte membranes from Xenopus oocyte expressing either α-rENaC or α,β,γ-rENaC fused to bilayer membranes revealed channels with similar kinetic behavior to those measured by patch clamp, but only with larger conductance states. In all other respects, however, these channels behaved identically to those observed for in vitro translated protein incorporated into bilayers. We conclude, therefore, that the bilayer is an appropriate system in which to study rENaC. Based upon our experience with α-bENaC(20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next tested the hypothesis that both α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC could be activated by an imposition of a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the bilayer membrane. As shown in Fig. 5, channel activities of both α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC were significantly enhanced by membrane stretch. A hydrostatic pressure gradient (ΔP) was established by removal of 1 ml of bathing solution from one compartment of the bilayer chamber, which was equivalent to 0.26 mm Hg. For α,β,γ-rENaC, single channel open probability (PO) increased from 0.15 ± 0.04 to 0.65 ± 0.08 (n = 7), and for α-rENaC a ΔP of 0.26 mm Hg increased PO from 0.60 ± 0.08 to 0.91 ± 0.08 (n = 8). There was no apparent change in single channel conductances following stretch, but the relative frequencies of channel conductance levels were altered. In the case of α-rENaC, the 40-pS level predominated after stretch, while for α,β,γ-rENaC, it appeared that three 13-pS conductance levels were present. All point amplitude histogram analysis of these records after stretch revealed that these three conductances could be fit by a binominal distribution, indicating that stretch induced independent gating of the component sublevels. When α-rENaC or α,β,γ-rENaC channels were bathed with asymmetric solutions of NaCl (a 10-fold gradient) under nonstretched conditions, a reversal potential of 57 ± 3 mV was measured, and a permeability ratio for Na+versus Cl− of 10:1 for each channel type was calculated. These values did not change upon stretch (n = 9 for each channel type). These results are similar to those previously reported for α-bENaC(20Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, PNa+/PK+ for each channel was determined from reversal potential measurements made under biionic conditions in the absence of and in the presence of a 0.26 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure gradient across the membrane (Fig. 6). Under nonstretched conditions, both channels were 10-fold more permeable to Na+ than to K+. However, upon stretch, each channel lost some of its ability to discriminate between Na+ and K+, decreasing to 3:1 and 4:1 for α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC, respectively. The records depicted in Figure 2:, Figure 3: indicate that the apparent single channel kinetic behavior of α,β,γ-rENaC was different from that of α-rENaC. α-rENaC has one small 13-pS conductance level that is almost continuously open and a larger 40-pS level, while α,β,γ-rENaC primarily displays the 13 pS level with only brief openings to the 40-pS level. Based on the observations that both α-rENaC and α,β,γ-rENaC display kinetic properties indicative of subconductive type behavior and that β and γ themselves do not form channels, it is likely that the conduction pathway(s) of rENaC i"

Here we provide evidence that molecular chaperones also participate in regulating the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton.

INTRODUCTIONA class of proteins, now being referred to as molecular chaperones, facilitate various aspects of protein maturation. Perhaps the best characterized molecular chaperones are members of the so-called heat shock (hsp) or stress protein family (recently reviewed in (1Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) and (2Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar)). In animal cells, members of the hsp 70 family (DnaK in bacteria) are distributed throughout various cellular compartments and interact with proteins being synthesized on polysomes and/or being translocated into organelles. Such an interaction with the hsp 70 proteins likely serves to stabilize and/or maintain the nascent polypeptide in a relatively unfolded state until its synthesis and/or translocation has been completed. Members of the eukaryotic hsp 60 family (GroEL in bacteria) also bind newly synthesized and unfolded polypeptides. This class of molecular chaperones, often called chaperonins, are thought to provide a shielded environment in which protein folding and/or higher ordered protein assembly takes place. Although exhibiting only weak homology with other members of the chaperonin family, a eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin has been identified and, like other members of the chaperonin family, exists as a large (~20 S) particle(3Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 4Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).Despite structural similarities to other members of the chaperone family, the cytosolic chaperonin exhibits a number of differences as it relates to both its subunit composition, mode of regulation, and apparent substrate specificity. First, at least 8 related subunits, referred to as the TCP-1 family, appear to comprise the cytosolic chaperonin complex in eukaryotic cells. In contrast, chaperonins of both bacteria and plastids contain only 1 or 2 polypeptide subunits. Second, in contrast to the bacterial and plastid chaperones, the family of related TCP-1 proteins do not appear to be be up-regulated after heat shock or other metabolic stresses. Finally, while the bacterial GroEL chaperonin appears to function rather promiscuously, facilitating the folding of most any substrate presented to it, so far the cytosolic TCP-1 containing chaperonin has been observed to interact with only a limited number of substrates. Interestingly such substrates for the TCP-1 containing chaperonins are nucleotide binding proteins and include actin, tubulin, and luciferase(4Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 5Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J.

Nature. 1995; 370: 111-117Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar).Previous observations have also provided a connection between the TCP-1 proteins and microtubule related phenomena. In mice, expression of TCP-1 increases markedly during spermatogenesis(10Silver L.M. Kleene K.C. Distel R.J. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1987; 119: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a process that requires the assembly of complex macromolecular structures including the microtubule core of the flagellum. In addition, mutations within the TCP-1 locus are associated with both microtubule abnormalities and transmission ratio distortions(11Silver L.M. Remis D. Genet. Res. 1987; 49: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly in yeast, temperature-sensitive mutations of the TCP-1 gene result in a number of alterations in microtubule mediated processes. For example, at the non-permissive temperature the cells exhibit abnormal looking microtubules and give rise to the accumulation of multi-nucleated progeny(12Ursic D. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that TCP-1 may play an important role in both the folding and the proper assembly of cytoskeleton proteins.In the course of examining the intracellular locale of hsp 73 and TCP-1, we observed a portion of both proteins to exhibit rather intense staining near the nucleus. Such a locale appeared similar to another protein under study in our laboratory, the so-called pericentrin protein which has recently been shown to be a component of the centrosome(13Doxsey S.J. Kirschner M. Vale R. Kreis T. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1993Google Scholar, 14Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Owing to the fact that the centrosome serves as a primary nucleation site for microtubule growth(15Karsenti E. Maro B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 460-463Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar), along with the aforementioned observations relating TCP-1 mutations in yeast to microtubule abnormalities, we examined the possible relationship of hsp 73 and TCP-1 with the centrosome. We show here by different means that a portion of both hsp 73 and TCP-1 are, in fact, resident proteins of the centrosome. In addition, evidence is presented implicating a role for TCP-1 in mediating the growth of the microtubule network off the centrosome.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Antibody CharacterizationA synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 42-57 from the mouse TCP-1 protein was synthesized via the high density multiple antigenic peptide system(16Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), and injected into rabbits. The resultant polyclonal serum, which has been partially characterized previously(17Lingappa J.R. Martin R.L. Wong M.L. Ganem D. Welch W.J. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was analyzed here by different means. Immunoprecipitations were performed from cell lysates harvested under “native” or “denaturing” conditions. For the former, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN, specific activity 1100 Ci/mmol) for 16 h and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salinePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryTRiCTCP-1 ring complexPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mM MgCl. For immunoprecipitations under denaturing conditions, cells were labeled as above, and then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and heated at 100°C for 5 min. Following shearing of the released chromatin and subsequent clarification, the lysates were diluted 10-fold in RIPA buffer (1% Triton, 1% deoxycholate in PBS) for subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis. Characterization of the native molecular mass of the 60-kDa antigen was performed by harvesting [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following clarification (15,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was applied to a 20-50% glycerol gradient (in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, and 2 mM EGTA), and the sample centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 40 h in a SW 41 rotor.

For indirect immunofluorescence experiments, cells were either directly placed into fixative (−20°C absolute methanol for 3-5 min) or, in some cases, the cells were first extracted with nonionic detergents and then methanol fixed. Extraction was done by incubating the cells in microtubule stabilization buffer (MSB: 80 mM Pipes, pH 6.9, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl) supplemented with 0.05-0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the antibody of interest for 30 min at 37°C, the cells washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline, and the primary antibodies visualized by subsequent incubation with the appropriate anti-antibody conjugated with either fluorescein or rhodamine (all purchased from Cappel Laboratories). All antibodies were diluted into 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS.Isolation and Partial Purification of CentrosomesCentrosomes were partially purified from [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cells using techniques developed by Mitchison and Kirschner (22Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and slightly modified by Bornens et al. (23Bornens M. Paintrand M. Berges J. Marty M.-C. Karsenti E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Microinjection ExperimentsCOS cells growing on glass coverslips were incubated with nocodazole (20 μg/ml) for 90 min. While still in the presence of the drug, the cells were injected with rabbit preimmune antibody, rabbit anti-hsp 73, or rabbit anti-TCP-1. All antibodies used for microinjection were first purified by DEAE-Affi-Gel blue chromatography and used at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 μg/ml in 0.5 × PBS. 15 min after injection of the antibodies, the medium was removed, the cells extensively washed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for an additional 20 min to allow for microtubule regrowth. Coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence as described above.Microtubule Regrowth in VitroCOS and CHO cells growing on glass coverslips were treated with nocodazole (20 μg/ml) for 90 min at 37°C. The medium was then removed and the cells extracted for 2 min at room temperature with MSB supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. The extracted cells were washed with fresh MSB and then either preimmune, polyclonal rabbit anti-TCP-1, monoclonal rat anti-TCP-1, or anti-hsp 73 antibodies (2 mg/ml) in MSB were added. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature the antibody solution was removed, the cells washed with and further incubated in MSB supplemented with 1 mM GTP, 2 mg/ml purified tubulin, and 20% glycerol for 12 min at 37°C. The cells then were gently washed with MSB, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, and processed for immunofluorescence using the anti-α-tubulin antibody.RESULTSAs an initial step in characterizing the location and function of members of the hsp 73 and TCP-1 families, antibodies specific to each protein were prepared. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared and shown to be specific for hsp 73(18Brown C.R. Martin R.L. Hansen W.J. Beckmann R.P. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For the preparation of a TCP-1 specific antibody, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 45-57 of the mouse TCP-1 protein (Fig. 1A) was synthesized and injected into rabbits. Analysis of the resultant serum was done via immunoprecipitation using [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and heated at 100°C. Under such conditions, the rabbit anti-TCP-1 antibody precipitated an approximately 60-kDa protein (Fig. 1, panel B, lane 2). Preadsorbtion of the serum with an excess of the synthetic peptide used to elicit the antibody resulted in an inability of the serum to recognize the 60-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation using the rabbit polyclonal antibody to hsp 73 revealed an approximate 70-kDa band (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Further analysis of this 70-kDa protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated the protein to be identical to the constitutively expressed member of the hsp 70 family, referred to here as hsp 73 (data not shown, see (18Brown C.R. Martin R.L. Hansen W.J. Beckmann R.P. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)).To determine whether the antigen recognized by the TCP-1 synthetic peptide antibody existed as an oligomeric species, similar to the situation with other known members of the chaperonin family, [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells were solubilized by the addition of a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied to a 20-50% glycerol gradient. Following centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated and aliquots adjusted to a final 1% SDS and heated at 100°C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitants across the gradient revealed the 60-kDa TCP-1 protein to migrate with an approximate 20 S value (Fig. 1C).To further confirm the specificity of our rabbit anti-TCP-1 antibody, we examined and compared its substrate specificity with that of a previously described rat monoclonal antibody against TCP-1 (referred to as 23C). CHO cells were labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine and cell lysates prepared for immunoprecipitation analysis. In our first experiment, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing non-ionic detergents and then used to examine the substrate specificity of both our rabbit TCP-1 antibody and 23C (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, the rabbit TCP-1 antibody immunoprecipitated a prominent ~60-kDa protein (Fig. 2, lane 2) along with a few other proteins. The 23C antibody immunoprecipitated a number of polypeptides with molecular masses between 50 and 70 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3). Indeed, it is this kind of analysis utilizing the 23C antibody which has resulted in the conclusion that the eukaryotic TCP-1 containing cytosolic chaperonin is comprised of multiple subunits and therefore has been referred to by some (35Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Wall J.S. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U. EMBO. 1992; 11: 4767-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC). However, when the immunoprecipitation analyses were performed using the labeled cells first solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and the lysates then heated at 100°C, slightly different results were obtained. Now, both our rabbit antibody and the 23C antibody recognized primarily only a single 60-kDa protein (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6, respectively).Figure 2:The rabbit polyclonal TCP-1 and a monoclonal TCP-1 antibody (23C) precipitate similar proteins under denaturing conditions but not under native conditions. CHO cells were steady state labeled with [35S]methionine for 16 h and then harvested under denaturing conditions (e.g. Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and heated at 100°C) or native conditions (cold buffers containing only nonionic detergents). Immunoprecipitation analyses were performed using either the rabbit polyclonal anti-TCP-1 or the rat monoclonal 23C TCP-1 specific antibody. Duplicate immunoprecipitate samples were analyzed by both one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Panel A, analysis of the immunoprecipitates by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE.

The immunoprecipitates obtained from the nonionic detergent lysed cells using the 23C antibody (Fig. 2, panel B) and the rabbit peptide antibody (Fig. 2, panel C) revealed the presence of numerous polypeptides. In contrast, the immunoprecipitation products obtained from the cells lysed in buffers containing SDS, using either the 23C antibody (Fig. 2, panel D) or the rabbit peptide antibody (Fig. 2, panel E), revealed only a prominent ~60-kDa protein which appeared to be comprised of at least 3 or 4 isoelectric variants (the small amounts of actin and tubulin which also were present likely represent nonspecific background as evidenced by their precipitation using preimmune sera, data not shown).The intracellular locale of hsp 73 and TCP-1 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence methods. While the majority of both proteins appeared to be present throughout the cytosol, and to a lesser extent inside the nucleus, a relatively localized and rather intense staining pattern also was observed within the perinuclear region of the cells (the latter indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3). This perinuclear staining pattern appeared remarkably similar to that of another protein under study in our laboratory, specifically, the recently described pericentrin protein which has been shown to be a component of the centrosome. To examine whether a portion of both hsp 73 and TCP-1 might be present within the centrosome, simultaneous staining of the cells with antibodies specific for pericentrin and the two molecular chaperones was performed. To facilitate the analysis, HeLa cells growing on glass coverslips were first lightly extracted with buffers containing nonionic detergents to remove the majority of the cytosolic and nuclear forms of hsp 73 and TCP-1. Previous studies have shown that the centrosome, and many of its associated components, are not grossly affected by such extraction with non-ionic detergents(14Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Double label staining using a human autoimmune sera(5051) specific for pericentin, along with either antibodies specific for hsp 73 or TCP-1 revealed that a portion of hsp 73 and TCP-1 were in fact present very near or within the centrosome (Fig. 4). Staining of the centrosome by antibodies to the two molecular chaperones was observed in interphase cells as well as in cells which had entered mitosis. Although not shown, we have observed a similar distribution for hsp 73 and TCP-1 within the centrosome of other animal cells including the two monkey cell lines, CV-1 and COS, rat embryo fibroblasts, baby hamster kidney, mouse 3T3, and Chinese hamster ovary cells.Figure 3:Intracellular locale of hsp 73 and TCP-1 as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. HeLa cells growing at 37°C on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized by immersion in −20°C absolute methanol for 2 min.

Cells were simultaneously incubated with rabbit anti-hsp 73 plus a human autoimmune anti-centrosome antibody, or with rabbit anti-TCP-1 plus the human autoimmune sera.

Paintrand M. Berges J. Marty M.-C. Karsenti E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cells were treated with the microfilament poison cytochalasin and the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole. Following lysis of the cells and subsequent clarification of the lysate, the resultant supernatant was applied to a discontinuous sucrose gradient, the material centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and the gradient then fractionated. As is shown in Fig. 5, panel A, the vast majority of radioactive material was present within the first half of the gradient. In addition, a distinct peak of radioactive material was observed near the bottom of the gradient (fractions 4-7), this representing material within the 50-70% sucrose interface where centrosomes have previously been shown to migrate using this procedure (23Bornens M. Paintrand M. Berges J. Marty M.-C. Karsenti E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To confirm that the material present within fractions 4-7 contained a relatively dense particle corresponding to the centrosome, the fractions were pooled and diluted 4-fold with buffer. The diluted material then was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20-30 min and the resultant supernatant and pellet examined by SDS-PAGE. As is shown in Fig. 5B, the vast majority of the radiolabeled proteins were found within the pellet, consistent with the proteins being present within a dense particle. Both hsp 73 and TCP-1, along with a few other proteins including actin and tubulin (as well as other unidentified proteins) were found to be present within the enriched preparation of centrosomes (Fig. 5D).Figure 5:Isolation and characterization of centrosomes. CHO cells growing at 37°C were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 16 h and then used for the isolation of an enriched fraction of the centrosomes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel A, following the final sucrose gradient centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and a portion of each fraction examined for its radioactive content via liquid scintillation.

PDC activity is reduced primarily through increased phosphorylation of its pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component due to E1 kinase activity being markedly enhanced by elevated intramitochondrial NADH:NAD+ and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios. A mechanism is evaluated in which enhanced kinase activity is facilitated by the build-up of the reduced and acetylated forms of the lipoyl moieties of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component through using NADH and acetyl-CoA in the reverse of the downstream reactions of the complex. Using a peptide substrate, kinase activity was stimulated by these products, ruling out the possibility kinase activity is increased due to changes in the reaction state of its substrate, E1 (thiamin pyrophosphate). Each E2 subunit contains two lipoyl domains, an NH2-terminal (L1) and the inward lipoyl domain (L2), which were individually produced in fully lipoylated forms by recombinant techniques. Although reduction and acetylation of the L1 domain or free lipoamide increased kinase activity, those modifications of the lipoate of the kinase-binding L2 domain gave much greater enhancements of kinase activity. The large stimulation of the kinase generated by acetyl-CoA only occurred upon addition of the transacetylase-catalyzing (lipoyl domain-free) inner core portion of E2 plus a reduced lipoate source, affirming that acetylation of this prosthetic group is an essential mechanistic step for acetyl-CoA enhancing kinase activity. Similarly, the lesser stimulation of kinase activity by just NADH required a lipoate source, supporting the need for lipoate reduction by E3 catalysis.Complete enzymatic delipoylation of PDC, the E2-kinase subcomplex, or recombinant L2 abolished the stimulatory effects of NADH and acetyl-CoA. Retention of a small portion of PDC lipoates lowered kinase activity but allowed stimulation of this residual kinase activity by these products. Reintroduction of lipoyl moieties, using lipoyl protein ligase, restored the capacity of the E2 core to support high kinase activity along with stimulation of that activity up to 3-fold by NADH and acetyl-CoA. As suggested by those results, the enhancement of kinase activity is very responsive to reductive acetylation with a half-maximal stimulation achieved with ∼20% of free L2 acetylated and, from an analysis of previous results, with acetylation of only 3-6 of the 60 L2 domains in intact PDC. Based on these findings, we suggest that kinase stimulation results from modification of the lipoate of an L2 domain that becomes specifically engaged in binding the kinase. In conclusion, kinase activity is attenuated through a substantial range in response to modest changes in the proportion of oxidized, reduced, and acetylated lipoyl moieties of the L2 domain of E2 produced by fluctuations in the NADH:NAD+ and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios as translated by the rapid and reversible E3 and E2 reactions.

Spontaneous wave generation during glycolytic sugar degradation is established after an induction period of about 1 h. Controlled wave initiation could be performed by local injection of the strong activator of phosphofructokinase, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. A crucial role for wave initiation and control of pattern dynamics is attributed to the key enzyme of glycolysis, the allosterically regulated phosphofructokinase. An overall increase in the concentration of its positive effector AMP leads to the formation of rotating spirals. The dynamics of the observed wave patterns resemble that of self-organized calcium waves as recently found in frog eggs and heart cells."

Chem. 271, 824-832) two molecular chaperones, hsp 73 and TCP-1, were shown to be integral components of the centrosome. Here we show that heat shock treatment adversely affects both the structure and function of the centrosome, and that hsp 73 plays a role in the repair of the organelle. After heat shock treatment, the centrosome could not be identified via indirect immunofluorescence and cells were unable to support microtubule regrowth. During recovery from heat shock, a strong correlation between the return of staining of three centrosomal antigens (hsp 73, TCP-1, and pericentrin) and the recovery of microtubule regrowth properties was found. Incubation of cells with glycerol, a protein protective agent, prevented the heat induced alterations in the structure/function of the centrosome. Likewise, the recovery of the structure and function of the centrosome after heat shock treatment was significantly accelerated in cells first made thermotolerant. We provide evidence that this process is related to the levels of hsp 73 since: 1) microinjection of hsp 73 antibody blocked centrosomal reassembly and microtubule regrowth abilities following heat shock; and 2) microinjection of purified hsp 73 protein prior to heat shock treatment accelerated both the repair and function of the organelle, similar to that observed for thermotolerant cells.

The viral genome harbors approximately 75 open reading frames. Many have been tested for transcription in transformed human cells but, so far, only ORF1 and ORF2 (7Biesinger B. Trimble J.J. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. Virology. 1990; 176: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) encoded on a single bicistronic mRNA have been found in the permanently growing cells. We have previously shown, that the gene product of ORF1, tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) is expressed in transformed cells. Tip associates with the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck and can be phosphorylated by this enzyme in vitro (8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M.

The kinase tightly associates with the coreceptor molecules CD4 or CD8 and becomes activated after cross-linking of these receptors on the cell surface. One of the substrates of p56lck is the ζ-chain of the T cell receptor, and T cells deficient in p56lck fail to respond to T cell receptor mediated signals. This attributes a crucial role to the enzyme in the antigen-specific response of T cells(9Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y.

The ORF2-encoded saimiri transformation-associated protein (StpC) is also expressed in H. saimiri transformed human T cells and might complement the action of Tip. StpC is a strong oncoprotein in rodent fibroblasts and epithelial cells of transgenic mice, but not in T cells(11Jung J.U. Trimble J.J. King N.W. Biesinger B. Fleckenstein B.W. Desrosiers R.C. Proc.

Fleckenstein B.W. Rüther U. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 221-226PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of oncogenesis by StpC is not known. Transformation of T cells probably requires the action of Tip on the T cell-specific kinase p56lckin addition to StpC. Here we further characterize this interaction and show that Tip selectively interacts with p56lck, but not with the other Src-related kinases p60fyn or p53/56lyn which are expressed in human T cells immortalized by H. saimiri. Furthermore, this interaction leads to a dramatic activation of the enzyme. This may explain why many human cell types can be infected by H. saimiri but only T cells are transformed to permanent growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell CultureThe human CD4+ T cell clones 61/39, 61/48, 68/4, and 68/5 as well as their H. saimiri immortalized derivative T cell lines 39-HVS, 48-HVS, 68/4-HVS, and 68/5-HVS have been described previously(2Bröker B.M.

They were restimulated every 14 days with 0.5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin in the presence of irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After transformation with H. saimiri, human T cell lines were kept in 50% CG medium (Vitromex, Vilshofen, Germany) and 50% CM in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2. Jurkat cells were derived from the original culture(13Schneider H. Schwenk H.-U. Bornkamm G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar).

Raji, BJAB, and BWδζ were grown in complete medium.Antisera and Monoclonal AntibodiesAntisera to the unique regions of Src-related kinases were raised by immunizing rabbits with fusion proteins containing the unique regions of murine p56lck, p60fyn, p53/56lyn, and p62c-yes and glutathione S-transferase. Antisera to the Src-kinases p55blk, p59hck, and p58fgr were generated by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to the unique regions (15Li Z.-H. Mahajan S. Prendergast M.

The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), a rabbit antiserum to phosphotyrosine was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Antisera against Tip were a gift of H. Fickenscher, Erlangen, Germany, and have been described(8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol.

The monoclonal anti-Tip antibody BNI2 was generated from spleen cells of Balb/c mice immunized with a β-Gal-Tip fusion protein which has been described(8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H.

BNI2 reacts with β-Gal-Tip in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot sytems, and it stains a 40-kDa band in cell lines transfected with full-length Tip (see below) but not in nontransfected cells. Rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal sera were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany).ImmunoprecipitationsCells (1.5 × 107/ml in serum-free medium) were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 5 mM NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were cleared at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined. 5 μl of antiserum/mg of protein were added for at least 1 h at 4°C to precipitate Src-related kinases. This was followed by incubation with 50 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of Staphylococcus aureus particles (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). In the case of murine antibodies, the S. aureus particles were preincubated with 50 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse antibodies and washed. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in TNE buffer. For reprecipitation after the in vitro phosphotransferase reaction (see below), the phosphotransferase reaction was stopped by boiling samples in 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. This dissociated the immune complexes. The detergent was then diluted at least 1/10 with 1% Triton, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and the solution was precleared from the remaining antibodies by incubation with 50 μl of S. aureus suspension followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with the second antibody for 1 h at 4°C and precipitated with S. aureus as described above.In Vitro Phosphotransferase AssayImmunoprecipitates were washed once in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 5 mM MgCl2). The pellets were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 25 μl of kinase assay mixture containing 1 μM ATP (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and 2 μg of rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) in kinase buffer. The phosphotransferase reaction was stopped with sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature and microfuged. Supernatants were boiled for 5 min before separation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For the experiments described in Fig. 4D, 0.1 μg of recombinant p56lck was incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer in the presence of different amounts of β-Gal or β-Gal-Tip as indicated. The kinase reaction was started by the addition of 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and carried out for 5 min at room temperature. It was stopped with sample buffer, and samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Quantitative analysis was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).ImmunoblotsFor immunoblotting, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20) followed by incubation with antisera diluted in blocking buffer. After thorough washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, blots were incubated with 1 μCi/ml 125I-protein A (Amersham) in blocking buffer for at least 1 h, washed again, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Quantitative analysis was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the experiment described in Fig. 6B, the blot was incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody BNI2. Bands were visualized by incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Figure 6:Tyrosine phosphorylation analysis. A, transformation by H. saimiri increases the cellular content of phosphotyrosine. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were precipitated from 2 mg of protein of T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri, from their nontransformed parental clones and from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell blasts using the monoclonal antibody PY-20. For control, only PY-20 but no cell lysate was added. After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, bands containing phosphotyrosine were revealed with a polyclonal antiserum and 125I-protein A followed by autoradiography. B, Tip is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were precipitated from cell lysates (200 μg of protein) as described above (lanes 1-3) and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. 50 μg of whole cell lysate from the same cell lines was loaded in lanes 4-6 of the same gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was probed with the anti-Tip monoclonal antibody BNI2. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Tip expression in H. saimiri transformed cells (e.g. 39-HVS) regularly escaped detection by immunoblotting.

O'Rourke E. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the experiment described in Fig. 4D, GST-Lck was cleaved with thrombin (ICN, Meckenheim, Germany), and uncleaved GST-Lck as well as GST were precipitated with glutathione-Agarose (Sigma). The supernatant contained p56lck.A fusion protein of amino-terminally truncated Tip and β-galactosidase as well as β-galactosidase alone were gifts of B. Biesinger, Erlangen, Germany, and have been described(8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol.

This inserted a XhoI restriction site 5′ and a NotI restriction site 3′ of the coding regions which were used to clone the gene into the eukaryotic expression vector BCMGSNeo (gift of H. Karasuyama(17Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). Plasmids were transfected into BWδζ cells by electroporation. One day after transfection, 1 mg/ml G418 was added to the cultures for selection. Growing cell lines were characterized by immunoprecipitation of p56lck followed by phosphotransferase assay and reprecipitation with the anti-Tip serum. A cell line expressing large amounts of Tip was cloned to obtain BWδζ-Tip.RESULTSp56lck but Not p60fyn or p53/56lyn Phosphorylate Tip in VitroAs we have shown previously, p56lck associates with the herpesviral gene product Tip in transformed T cells, and it phosphorylates the protein in vitro. We first determined whether Tip also interacts with other Src-related kinases which are expressed in the transformed T cells. For this we screened 5 human CD4+ T cell lines and 3 CD8+ T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri for the expression of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases (Lck, Fyn, Yes, Src, Lyn, Blk, Hck, and Fgr) with immunoprecipitation followed by in vitro phosphotransferase assay. They were compared with 5 nontransformed human T cell clones. As expected, in all T cell clones, basal activity of p56lck and p60fyn was measured. All transformed T cell lines additionally exhibited significant enzymatic activity of p53/56lyn, which is not commonly found in T cells. Fig. 1 shows the gain of p53/56lyn activity in the human T cell clone 39-HVS after infection with H. saimiri. We then looked for co-immunoprecipitation of Tip with p60fyn or p53/56lyn in transformed T cells. This was never observed (data not shown). However, p60fyn and p53/56lyn are present in the T cells at much lower amounts than p56lck (Fig. 1), and the level of Tip expression in transformed T cells is also very low. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we precipitated p60fyn and p53/56lyn from the B cell lines Raji or BJAB where it is much more abundant. Furthermore, this excluded contamination of the immune complexes with p56lck. An in vitro phosphotransferase reaction was performed with recombinant Tip fused to β-galactosidase. As expected, Tip was readily bound and phosphorylated by p56lck precipitated from nontransformed human T cells or Jurkat cells. Again, p60fyn and p53/56lyn were unable to phosphorylate Tip (Fig. 2). To generate a source of native Tip, we transfected the mouse T cell line BWδζ. BWδζ-Tip expresses about 1 μg of Tip/mg of cell protein as determined by comparison with β-Gal-Tip on immunoblots (Fig. 3A and data not shown), but about 200-fold less p56lck than the human T cell line Jurkat which is representative of the other T cell lines used in our experiments (Fig. 3B). Immune complex phosphotransferase assays performed with p56lck and p60fyn immunoprecipitated directly from BWδζ-Tip again showed selective association and phosphorylation of Tip by p56lck (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Finally, we used recombinant GST-Lck, GST-Fyn, and GST-Lyn as well as Lck, Fyn, and Lyn precipitated from noninfected human T cells and B cells as above to co-immunoprecipitate Tip from BWδζ-Tip lysates which had been depleted of endogenous Lck. The results confirmed that p60fyn and p53/56lyn are not able to bind and phosphorylate H. saimiri Tip (data not shown).Figure 1:Expression of p53/56lyn in addition to p56lck and p60fyn in human T cells after infection with H. saimiri. Lysates were prepared from the nontransformed T cell clone 61/39 (A) and from the same T cell clone 6 months after transformation by H. saimiri (39-HVS, B). Src-related kinases were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cell protein/sample except for p56lck where 100 μg of total cell protein was used. S. aureus particles without anti-kinase serum served as control. An in vitro kinase assay was performed, and the resulting phosphoproteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The two gels were electrophoresed in parallel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 2 h to reveal autophosphorylation.

S. aureus particles without anti-kinase antibody served as control. An immune complex kinase assay was performed without addition or in the presence of 1 μg of either the β-Gal-Tip fusion protein or of unfused β-Gal as indicated.

A, association of p40tip with Lck. p56lck was precipitated from 100 μg of protein of the transfected T cell line BWδζ-Tip (+) and from 3000 μg of protein of its mock-transfected counterpart BWδζ-neo(-). An immune complex kinase assay was performed and proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Different amounts of total cellular protein were used for immunoprecipitation in order to achieve comparable levels of Lck autophosphorylation (lanes 1 and 2). This was necessary in order to demonstrate convincingly the absence of a 40-kDa band in the BWδζ-neo cells. The 40-kDa band in Lck immunoprecipitates from BWδζ-Tip was then identified by dissociation of the immune complexes and reprecipitation of Tip with a specific antiserum (lanes 3 and 4). Proteins in these precipitates were separated on the same gel which was dried and autoradiographed. B, expression of p56lck. Lck was immunoprecipitated from different protein amounts of BWδζ-Tip and of Jurkat cells as indicated and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the Lck protein amount was visualized by probing with a rabbit serum directed against Lck followed by 125I-protein A. The immunoblot was then autoradiographed. PhosphorImager analysis revealed that BWδζ-Tip contained 220-fold less Lck than Jurkat cells. The positions of Lck and Tip are indicated on the left, molecular mass standards are on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increase of p56lck Enzymatic Activity by Tipp56lck was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells, and the enzymatic activity was determined by a phosphotransferase assay in the presence of rabbit muscle enolase as exogenous substrate. Addition of increasing concentrations of β-Gal-Tip fusion protein augmented the enzymatic activity of Lck by a factor of 3.4 while β-Gal alone showed a negative effect if any (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, lysates of BWδζ-Tip depleted of endogenous p56lck enhanced the phosphorylation of enolase by Lck about 6-fold in this system, while lysates of the parent cell line did not affect Lck activity (Fig. 4C). Recombinant Lck could be used instead of the Lck immune complexes in the latter experiments with comparable results (data not shown). Neither β-Gal-Tip nor native Tip precipitated from Lck-free cell lysates ever showed kinase activity in these systems (data not shown). Roughly equal amounts of both recombinant (Fig. 4A) and cell-derived (Fig. 4C) Tip were needed to activate Lck; the amount of p40tip present in 1 mg of BWδζ-Tip cell protein (∼1 μg) is equivalent to 2 μg of β-Gal-Tip (Mr = ∼90,000). At very high Tip concentrations, phosphorylation of enolase decreased again due to substrate competition (data not shown). This precludes accurate measurement of the maximal activation of Lck by Tip. The factor of about 3-6 is, therefore, a conservative estimate of the enzymatic activation of p56lck by Tip. To exclude that activation of p56lck by viral Tip is mediated by other T cell-derived molecules which might have coprecipitated with either Lck or Tip in the experiments shown in Fig. 4, A-C, Lck was cleaved from GST-Lck by thrombin and incubated with β-Gal-Tip. Again, β-Gal-Tip but not the fusion partner β-Gal enhanced the enzymatic activity of this recombinant p56lck preparation as shown by an increase of Lck autophosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Re-evaluation of an effect of Tip on p60fyn or p53/56lyn in the presence of enolase never showed activation of these enzymes (data not shown).Enzymatic Activity of Lck is Increased in T Cells Transfected with TipMeasurement of the specific activity of Lck in BWδζ and BWδζ-Tip showed a dramatic increase in the Tip transfected cell line (Fig. 5A). BWδζ cells express extremely low quantities of Lck (Fig. 3B) precluding measurement of its activity in untransfected cells and necessitating precipitation from large protein amounts prior to detection on immunoblots (Fig. 5B). In contrast, specific activation of Lck could not be demonstrated reproducibly in H. saimiri infected T cells. Tip is expressed in very low amounts in these cells and can be detected only by the sensitive phosphotransferase assay but not on immunoblots. Any effect of Tip on Lck, which is very abundant in these cells, would be masked by the background activity of Lck which is not in complex with Tip.Figure 5:Expression of Tip increases the enzymatic activity p56lck in the murine T cell line BWδζ. p56lck was precipitated from different amounts of cell lysate from the Tip-transfected T cell line BWδζ-Tip and from its mock-transfected counterpart BWδζ-neo. For determination of enzymatic activity, immunoprecipitates were subjected to an immune complex kinase assay, and the resulting proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (A). For measurement of protein abundance, immunoprecipitates were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with serum directed against Lck followed by 125I-protein A (B). The dried gel (A) and the immunoblot (B) were then autoradiographed. Controls without precipitating antibody are boxed. Note the large amounts of cell lysate necessary to visualize Lck from these murine cells on immunoblots. The specific activity of Lck in BWδζ-Tip is, therefore, much higher than what is usually observed in T cells. The positions of Lck, enolase, and Tip are shown on the right, molecular mass standards are on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tyrosine Phosphorylation in T Cells Expressing TipSince an increase of specific kinase activity of p56lck could not be measured in H. saimiri infected cells, we probed their basal phosphotyrosine levels as a readout for kinase activity that might not be masked by excess of inactive enzyme. Expectedly, the amount of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in our T cells was generally low in the absence of further stimulation. However, an increase in the level of phosphotyrosine in three bands with molecular masses of 70, 55, and 30 kDa by an average factor of 2.1, 5.3, and 2.2, respectively, were observed in T cell lines transformed by H. saimiri as compared with their nontransformed parental clones or with phytohemagglutinin-blasts (Fig. 6A). The low levels of Tip expression in T cells transformed by H. saimiri precluded detection on immunoblots (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, we utilized the BWδζ-Tip cell line to demonstrate phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of Tip in vivo. After immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, Tip was readily demonstrated on immunoblots from BWδζ-Tip but not from the vector control BWδζ-neo (Fig. 6B). However, the interaction of Tip with Lck was not blocked by excess of phosphotyrosine (data not shown).DISCUSSIONPreviously we have suggested that two factors cooperate in the transformation of human T cells by H. saimiri with StpC acting as the ba"

TnC from skeletal muscle has two classes of calcium-binding sites. The two carboxyl-terminal sites (sites 3 and 4) bind calcium with a high affinity (KCa≈ 2 × 107M−1) and also bind magnesium competitively with a lower affinity (KMg≈ 5 × 103M−1) (Leavis et al., 1978). These two sites appear to have a structural role and do not contribute to calcium-dependent regulation (Zot and Potter, 1987). The two amino-terminal sites (sites 1 and 2) are calcium-specific, bind calcium with a low affinity (KCa≈ 3.2 × 105M−1) (Potter and Gergely, 1975; Leavis et al., 1978), and are the sites that regulate contraction. TnC from cardiac muscle differs from skeletal muscle TnC most significantly in the amino-terminal half, where several critical amino acid substitutions have rendered site 1 incapable of binding calcium (Van Eerd and Takahashi, 1976; Leavis and Kraft, 1978). The calcium affinities of the two classes of binding sites in cTnC (Holroyde et al., 1980) are essentially the same as the corresponding ones for skeletal muscle TnC. troponin C troponin I cardiac troponin C dithiothreitol 2-[(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid polymerase chain reaction. The x-ray crystallographic structures of TnC from chicken (Sundaralingam et al., 1985) and turkey skeletal muscle (Herzberg and James, 1985) show that the protein has an elongated, dumbbell-like shape in which the polypeptide is folded into two globular domains at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. These domains are connected by a long α-helix, the middle of which is exposed to the solvent. The crystal structure provides a structural basis for understanding the potential conformational changes that may occur in the regulatory, amino-terminal domain of TnC when calcium binds to sites 1 and 2 (Herzberg et al., 1986; Strynadk and James, 1989). These putative conformational changes may involve movements of helices B and C relative to helices A and D. It has been suggested that these movements expose a segment of hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain, which then become available for calcium-mediated interaction with TnI. Fluorescence (Wang and Cheung, 1986; Tao et al., 1990) and thermodynamic (Wang and Cheung, 1985; Cheung et al., 1987) studies have suggested that the interaction between TnC and TnI may serve as the Ca2+ switch for calcium-dependent regulation of contraction. Maximum tension in fast skeletal muscle is observed in 10-13 ms after excitation and decays after an additional 40-50 ms (Close, 1965). During a cycle of contraction and relaxation, calcium must bind to the regulatory sites and induce structural changes in both TnC and the other thin filament regulatory proteins within 10-13 ms after excitation. Likewise, calcium dissociation from the regulatory sites and reversal of the calcium-induced conformational changes must occur within 40-50 ms after excitation. These physiologic constraints place limits within which reversible Ca2+ binding to TnC and subsequent conformational changes must occur. Several groups (Iio and Kondo, 1982; Rosenfeld and Taylor, 1985a; Johnson et al., 1994) reported the kinetics of calcium binding to both classes of sites in isolated skeletal TnC and in regulatory complexes containing TnC. Calcium binding to the low affinity sites of skeletal TnC has been reported to be diffusion controlled (Johnson et al., 1994). However, given the fact that most protein conformational changes occur more slowly than this, it would be expected that the kinetics of calcium binding to the regulatory sites should be saturable. Little information is available on the kinetic mechanism of calcium binding to the regulatory site of cardiac TnC, as most of the reported information is confined to the dissociation kinetics (Robertson et al., 1981, 1982). Cardiac TnC has two cysteine residues that can be readily alkylated by a variety of sulfhydryl-specific reagents. Mutants containing a single cysteine at either position 35 (C84S) or 84 (C35S) have been generated (Zhang et al., 1992). The calcium-induced fluorescence change of IAANS-labeled mutant cTnC(C35S) has been shown to be coincident with calcium-activated force development (Zhang et al., 1992; Kerrick et al., 1992) and ATPase activity (Kerrick et al., 1992) in skinned cardiac muscle fibers. An advantage of using IAANS-labeled mutant cTnC(C35S) to study calcium-induced structural changes is that the fluorophore is located at a single site, which simplifies interpretation of the observed fluorescence change in terms of structural transitions. In the present work, we have studied the kinetics of calcium binding to the single regulatory site of cTnC using a monocysteine mutant labeled with IAANS at Cys-84. The observed kinetics suggest a three-step binding model. Because the IAANS probe is strategically located, the observed kinetics of the fluorescence change also provide insight into the time course of structural changes induced by calcium binding. The method of Saiki et al. (1985) was used to synthesize first strand cDNA from total RNA obtained from the left ventricle of rat heart (Chomczynski et al., 1987). The product of the first strand cDNA reaction was used in a PCR with a pair of appropriate primers. PCR products were purified using agarose gels and subsequently treated with restriction enzymes. The digested cDNAs were further purified by agarose gels and subcloned into a vector. The cDNA clone for cTnC was verified by sequence analysis and compared with the sequence of cDNA for cTnC (Parmacek and Leiden, 1989). The clone was ligated into the polylinker sites of the expression vector pET-24a(+) (Novagen). The recombinant DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) lysogen (Novagen) containing a gene induced by IPTG to synthesize T7 RNA polymerase, which transcribed the inert DNA in the vector. Transformed cells were grown on LB agar plates in the presence of kanamycin. Colonies were screened for inserts by either PCR or digestion of restriction enzymes. After positive clones were identified, a culture of transformed BL21(DE3) containing insert was inoculated into LB medium containing kanamycin at 37°C. The expression of target protein was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. The induced culture was incubated for 3 more hours and harvested by centrifugation. The synthesized cTnC was purified from the induced cells according to methods provided by the supplier of the pET vector. cDNA for mutated cTnC was obtained by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (Higuchi et al., 1988). The same procedures used to clone and purify wild-type cDNA were followed for mutant cDNA, and mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described for wild-type protein. The expressed protein was purified on a DE52 column equilibrated in 6 M urea, 25 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT. cTnC or mutant was eluted with a salt gradient in the same buffer from 0.05 to 0.4 M KCl. The fractions containing the desired protein were pooled and dialyzed against the same buffer without urea. The dialyzed protein was adjusted to 5 mM in Ca2+ and rechromatographed in a phenyl-Sepharose CL B4 column equilibrated in 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 0.3 M KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 20 mM EGTA. The purity of the eluted protein was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cTnC mutants were tested for their ability to support Ca2+ regulation of force development using chemically skinned rabbit skeletal muscle fibers. Briefly, endogenous TnC was extracted from the fibers, and the TnC-depleted fibers were reconstituted with an exogenous TnC to be tested. Force was measured on the reconstituted fibers as a function of free Ca2+ concentration as described previously (Martyn and Gordon, 1988). Mutant cTnC(C35S) was first dialyzed against 0.1 mM DTT in a solution containing 0.2 M KCl, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, followed by a second dialysis in which DTT was omitted. The sulfhydryl-reduced protein was reacted with a 2-fold excess of IAANS in the presence of 6 M urea at 4°C for 10 h. The reaction was terminated with a 3-5-fold molar excess of DTT, and the solution was exhaustively dialyzed against 6 M urea, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, 0.2 M KCl, and 2 mM EGTA at 4°C to remove unreacted fluorophore and DTT. A further dialysis against the same buffer without urea was repeated three times. The concentration of the labeled protein was determined with either a turbidimetric tannin micromethod (Mejbaum-Katzenelenbogen and Dobryszycka, 1959) or the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), and the amount of label covalently attached to the protein was determined by absorbance, using a molar extinction of 24,900 M−1 cm−1 at 325 nm (Johnson et al., 1980). The degree of labeling was >0.9 mol of fluorophore/mol of protein. The same procedure was used to modify the sulfhydryl group of mutant cTnC(C84S). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20.0 ± 0.1°C in an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer, with both monochromators set at a 3-nm bandwidth. All measurements were made with the ratio mode. The emission spectra were corrected for variations of the response of the detector system with wavelengths. The Ca2+ concentration was controlled by using EGTA. Free calcium concentrations were calculated by an algorithm from Dr. A. Fabiato(1988), using known stability constants of the chelator for proton and cations. Transient kinetic measurements were performed on a Hi-Tech Scientific PQ/SF-53 stopped-flow spectrometer. The dead time of the instrument was determined to be 1.8 ms. The optical system consisted of a 150-watt high pressure xenon lamp with the excitation monochromator set at 325 nm. The excitation light was directed to the observation chamber by a quartz light guide, and the emitted light was isolated at a right angle by a cut-off filter (OG 380) and detected by an EMI9798QB photomultiplier. In a typical binding experiment, one syringe contained labeled protein in 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl, 3.0 mM MgCl2, and 5.0 μM EGTA. The other syringe contained the same solution but without protein, plus different levels of total Ca2+. After mixing, the concentration of labeled protein was usually 1 μM, and the total concentration of Ca2+ was in the range of 0-500 μM. These conditions ensured that the two carboxyl-terminal high affinity sites were presaturated by Mg2+, and the single low affinity calcium-specific site remained calcium free prior to mixing. The free Ca2+ level was controlled by the chelator. The control was quite adequate when the total Ca2+ concentration was low. This is important because the rate data obtained at low levels of free Ca2+ were used to calculate the bimolecular binding rate constant. At higher total Ca2+ concentrations, there was some uncertainty in the calculated free Ca2+ levels. As shown in Fig. 4A, the observed fast rate constant approached a limiting value at large free Ca2+ concentration. Since it was this limiting rate constant that was important in our kinetic model, the uncertainty in free Ca2+ concentration did not affect the analysis. For each experimental condition, 8-10 tracings were obtained. The tracings were averaged, and the resultant tracing was fitted to a sum of exponentials by a nonlinear least squares method (Bevington, 1969). To measure dissociation of bound cations, a buffer containing either EGTA or EDTA was mixed with an equal volume of protein saturated with bound cations either at sites 3 and 4 or at all three sites. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and IPTG were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene Cloning Systems, and reverse transcriptase was from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides used as primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, and radiolabeled dATP was from Amersham. Taq DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and dNTP were from Perkin Elmer and Boehringer Mannheim. Enzyme-grade urea and ammonium sulfate were purchased from Schwartz/Mann, and a standard CaCl2 solution was obtained from Orion. IAANS was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better. Skinned skeletal muscle fibers depleted of endogenous TnC lose Ca2+ regulation of force development. Calcium-activated force, however, can be restored upon reincorporation of TnC. This was the assay used to characterize cTnC mutants C35S and C84S. At pCa 4.0, the force was 92 restored, relative to intact fibers, upon reincorporation of native skeletal TnC and 86% restored upon reincorporation of wild-type cTnC. The force was 73% restored with mutant C35S and 62% restored with mutant C84S. These results indicate that the functional properties of mutant C35S are not significantly altered. Fig. 1 shows fluorescence emission spectra of mutant C35S labeled with IAANS at Cys-84 in the presence of Mg2+ and different levels of free Ca2+. The presence of 2 mM Mg2+ reduced the intensity by about 10%. With increasing [Ca2+] over the range of pCa 6.1-4.2, the intensity progressively increased by a factor of 1.6, with a small blue spectral shift of 6 nm. A calcium titration curve of the labeled mutant cTnC is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The half-maximum increase in fluorescence occurred at pCa 5.78 with a Hill coefficient of 1.2, corresponding to an apparent association constant of 6.1 × 105M−1. Control experiments with native cTnCIAANS yielded a Ca2+ titration curve very similar to that shown in Fig. 1, with the half-maximum change in fluorescence at pCa 5.68, corresponding to an apparent association constant of 4.8 × 105M−1 and a 1.8-fold increase in maximum fluorescence (results not shown). These results indicate that the monocysteine mutant labeled at Cys-84 has similar fluorescence properties to native cTnC labeled at both Cys-35 and Cys-84. The values of the apparent affinities, as determined by fluorescence, are also similar to those determined by equilibrium dialysis. Mutant C84S labeled with IAANS at Cys-35 showed a small increase (<30%) in fluorescence over the pCa range of 8-6.7, followed by a decrease to the 10% level with further decrease in pCa. The insensitivity of labeled mutant C84S to Ca2+ is in agreement with a previous report (Zhang et al., 1992). The results from the Ca2+ titration indicate that the fluorescence increase in mutant C35S labeled at Cys-84 is suitable for monitoring the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site. Since our concern here was to monitor the binding kinetics of the regulatory site, it was necessary to block sites 3 and 4 by preincubation of the protein with an excess of Mg2+ prior to mixing with Ca2+. Two components with opposite amplitudes were observed after mixing magnesium-saturated IAANS-labeled cTnC(C35S) with saturating calcium. The first, consisting of a 1.6-fold fluorescence enhancement, was completed in <100 ms and corresponded to calcium binding to the regulatory site, while the second, consisting of a 10% fluorescence decrease, was observed over several seconds after the first component was completed and presumably was due to calcium displacement of magnesium from the high affinity sites. Thus, these two components were temporally well separated from each other. The following discussion will focus only on the first, positive amplitude phase. Fig. 2 shows kinetic tracings of this phase at increasing free Ca2+ concentrations. At very low [Ca2+] (<2 μM), these tracings could be fitted with a single exponential, but above 2 μM, fitting required two exponentials. Fig. 3 shows a typical tracing at [Ca2+] >2 μM. The monoexponential fit was only marginally adequate with a χ square ratio of 1.51, but the biexponential fit was considerably improved with a χ square ratio of 1.07. A comparison of the residual plots for the two fits also indicate an improvement of the biexponential fit over the monoexponential fit, particularly at early times.Figure 3:A typical kinetic tracing fitted to a one-exponential and a two-exponential function. The tracing was obtained as described in Fig. 2. After mixing, [protein] = 1 μM and free [Ca2+] = 6.3 μM. Panel A shows the best two-exponential fit (solid curve) with two rate constants, λf = 517 s−1, and λs = 127 s−1; χR2 = 1.07. Panel B is the residual plot of the two-exponential fit. Panel C shows the residual plot for the best one-exponential fit with a rate constant of 156 s−1 (the best fitted curve not shown); χR2 = 1.51. Note the differences between the two residual plots, particularly at early times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two observed rate constants were obtained above 2 μM calcium concentration. The fast rate constant, λf, increased with increasing Ca2+ concentration, while the slow rate constant (λs) appeared to be insensitive to Ca2+ concentration. This is illustrated in Fig. 4A. The amplitude of the fast phase varied from about 60 to 30% of the total signal above 2 μM Ca2+. The ratio of the amplitude of the slow phase to that of the fast phase increased from less than 0.5 to a limiting value of about 2.5 with increasing [Ca2+], and the shape of this plot of amplitude ratio (not shown) resembled that shown in Fig. 4A for λf. The recovered limiting value of λf was close to the dead time of the instrument, and some signal of the fast phase (about 15%) was lost at higher [Ca2+]. This loss was reflected in the larger uncertainty for λf as indicated in Fig. 4A but in no way limited the analysis. The data of λfversus [Ca2+] were fitted to with a maximum rate of 590 s−1. The initial slope of this plot (Fig. 4B) defines an apparent second-order rate constant of 1.4 × 108M−1 s−1 for calcium binding to the low affinity site. The kinetics of calcium dissociation from the low affinity site of cTnC was measured by mixing EGTA with cTnC saturated with Ca2+ in the presence of Mg2+. Upon mixing, there was a fast phase with a large negative amplitude (decreasing fluorescence), which was completed in about 20 ms at 20°C and 60 ms at 4°C (Fig. 5), followed by a slow phase with a small positive amplitude (increasing fluorescence), which was observed over several seconds (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in the absence of Mg2+. Both fast and slow phases each could be fitted adequately with a single exponential function. The rate constant for the fast phase was 102 s−1 at 4°C and 296 s−1 at 20°C, and the rate constant of the slow phase was 0.65 ± 0.06 s−1 (data not shown). To establish whether this slow phase arose from dissociation of bound Ca2+ at the two high affinity sites in the carboxyl-terminal domain, a dissociation experiment was performed by mixing EDTA with IAANS-labeled mutant C35S, which was saturated with Mg2+ or Ca2+ at sites 3 and 4. The resulting kinetic tracings are shown in Fig. 6. The tracing for Mg2+ dissociation was adequately fitted to a single exponential function, with a rate constant of 0.83 s−1. This experiment was also carried out under identical conditions over a short time interval. There was no evidence of a fast phase with a negative amplitude, indicating that the slow fluorescence transient in Fig. 6 was due to dissociation of bound Mg2+ from the two carboxyl-terminal domain, high affinity sites. Also shown in Fig. 6 is a tracing obtained by mixing EDTA with labeled mutant C35S at pCa 7.0. At this pCa, sites 3 and 4 would be expected to be close to fully saturated with Ca2+, while site 2 would be Ca2+ free. The increase in fluorescence also followed a single exponential function with a rate constant of 0.73 s−1. A lag phase was apparent in both dissociation tracings. This could be due to different rates of Ca2+/Mg2+ dissociation from the two high affinity sites (Rosenfeld and Taylor, 1985a). The slower dissociation process might dominate the observed overall fluorescence change. Taken together, these results indicate that the dissociation of Mg2+ or Ca2+ from the carboxyl-terminal domain sites occurs with slow but very comparable rates. These rates were comparable to the rate (0.65 s−1) of the slow phase with positive amplitude observed upon mixing EGTA with labeled mutant fully saturated with Ca2+ in the presence of Mg2+. Thus, Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissociated from the carboxyl-terminal domain sites with rates that were at least two orders of magnitude slower than dissociation of Ca2+ from the regulatory site.Figure 6:Kinetics of dissociation of bound Ca2+ and bound Mg2+ from carboxyl-terminal domain sites 3 and 4 at 4°C. Lower tracing, a solution of ∼1 μM labeled protein in 0.2 M KCl, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, 2 mM Mg2+, and 20 μM EGTA was mixed with a solution of 0.2 M KCl, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, 20 μM EGTA, and 20 mM EDTA. 20 μM EGTA was present in both solutions to remove residual Ca2+. The trace was adequately fitted with a one-exponential function, with λMg = 0.83 s−1, χR2 = 1.27. Upper tracing, a solution of ∼1 μM labeled protein in 0.2 M KCl, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, 5 μM EGTA, and pCa 7.2 was mixed with a solution of 0.2 M KCl, 30 mM Mops at pH 7.0, and 10 mM EGTA. The free [Ca2+] in the solution was sufficient to saturate the two high affinity sites with the regulatory site unoccupied. This tracing monitored dissociation of bound Ca2+ at the high affinity sites and was adequately fitted with a single exponential function, λCa = 0.73 s−1, χR2 = 1.12. The final levels of fluorescence were not the same because the protein concentrations were slightly different in the two samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiment described for the binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory site was repeated at several temperatures and at a saturating level of Ca2+. The observed rate constants of the fast and slow phases are plotted versus reciprocal temperature, as shown in Fig. 7. The activation energy for the fast phase was 7.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol and that for the slow phase was 26 ± 3 kJ/mol. In this paper, we have studied the kinetics of the binding of Ca2+ to the single regulatory site of cardiac TnC. Native cTnC labeled with IAANS at both Cys-35 and Cys-84 has been extensively used to investigate the equilibrium properties of Ca2+ binding to the single regulatory site of the isolated protein and of the protein reconstituted into myofibrils and skinned muscle fibers. Because the label is located at two different sites that are far separated in the x-ray structure of TnC, the question arises as to whether the labels at both sites sense the same events. Using bacterially produced mutants containing a single cysteine residue, recent studies have shown that the fluorescence of IAANS attached to Cys-84 in mutant C35S tracks Ca2+ binding to the single regulatory site and produces Ca2+ titration curves that superimpose on those for the Ca2+ activation of ATPase and force development in skinned muscle fibers (Zhang et al., 1992). As will be further elaborated below, Cys-84 is strategically located in the amino-terminal domain, and a probe linked to this position might sense Ca2+-activated conformational changes involving specific helices. To focus on the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site, the binding kinetics were studied in the presence of a large excess of Mg2+ so that the two carboxyl-terminal sites were occupied throughout the binding reaction. Since the dissociation of bound Mg2+ is at least two orders of magnitude slower than the binding of Ca2+ to the amino-terminal domain, this protocol enables us to follow the time course of the binding reaction directly. The kinetic transients for calcium binding to the low affinity site were biexponential at high Ca2+ concentration. The rate constant of the fast phase (λf) varies with increasing [Ca2+] in a hyperbolic manner, whereas λs is insensitive to [Ca2+]. We propose a three-step mechanism to account for these kinetic data: The initial binding in the bimolecular step is assumed to be a rapid equilibrium, which is characterized by Ko, followed by two sequential first-order transitions in which fluorescence enhancement occurs. In this scheme, if k1+ k−1 ≫ k2+ k−2, the normalized fluorescence transient can be described by two exponential terms (Bernasconi, 1976). The rate constants from the fluorescence transient are identified with λf and λs. The relationships of the observed rate constants to the kinetic parameters in are as follows: λf=(K0[Ca2+]1+K0[Ca2+])k1+k-1(Eq. 2) and λs=k2+k-2(Eq. 3) The initial slope of a plot of λfversus [Ca2+] (Fig. 4) yields an apparent second order association rate constant Kok1 of 1.4 × 108M−1 s−1. Extrapolation to [Ca2+] = 0 yields k−1 = 117 s−1. At large [Ca2+], λf = k1+ k−1 = 587 s−1. Thus, k1 = 470 s−1, k−1 = 117 s−1, and Ko = 2.95 × 105M−1 at 4°C. The sum of k2 and k−2 is approximately 100 s−1. While their individual values cannot be directly extracted from the present kinetic data, they can be estimated from the experimental value of the equilibrium constant Keq = 3.2 × 105M−1 obtained from the Ca2+ titration at the same temperature: Keq = Ko(k1/k−1)(k2/k−2). This yields k2 = 20 s−1 and k−2 = 80 s−1. These parameters are listed in Table 1. Alternately, can be treated as described previously (Benson, 1960), and similar conclusions are obtained. The present model is the first kinetic mechanism for cardiac TnC using any preparation of the protein.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The kinetic data indicate that step 1 is thermodynamically favorable with an equilibrium constant of about 4, but step 2 is unfavorable. This is consistent with a 3.5-fold higher activation for the slow phase. Equilibrium studies have shown that the Keq for calcium binding to the regulatory site of a TnC•TnI complex is considerably larger than that for isolated TnC. If the same kinetic scheme holds for the complex, this enhanced affinity must arise from increases in the equilibrium constants of one or all steps of the model. Since step 2 is unfavorable with isolated TnC, this step may become more favorable in the binary protein complex. This possibility can be tested with either the cTnC•cTnI complex or reconstituted troponin. The dissociation kinetics of Ca2+ from the regulatory site are monoexponential at both 4 and 20°C. Step 1 is thermodynamically favorable, but step 2 is unfavorable with an equilibrium constant of 0.25. The observed initial fluorescence change in dissociation kinetics is expected to arise from the dominant species, (CaTnC)∗, with only a small contribution from (CaTnC). Thus, the observed dissociation rate constant of 102 s−1 largely reflects k−1. Furthermore, the dissociation rate constant for the (CaTnC) state is predicted to be k−1k−2/(k−1+ k2+ k−2), which is approximately 50-60 s−1 (Trybus and Taylor, 1982). It would be unlikely that a small amplitude phase in the dissociation transient occurring at 50-60 s−1 could be resolved from the main phase, occurring at 117 s−1 determined from the intercept in Fig. 4B. The x-ray structure of skeletal TnC shows that in the amino-terminal domain Cys-84 is located on helix D and is surrounded by helices B and C. The calcium-saturated structural model of the amino-terminal domain suggests that Ca2+ binding to the two amino-terminal domain sites induces movements of helices B and C relative to helices A and D, such that two EF hands are formed. These movements result in a more “open” conformation of the amino-terminal domain (Strynadk and James, 1989) and expose a hydrophobic patch on helix B. This exposed patch may be a site for calcium-mediated interactions with troponin I. In this model, helix D in the 4Ca state is stationary relative to the 2Ca state. A recent study of cTnC suggests similar helix movements in the amino-terminal domain when the single regulatory site is occupied (Ovsak and Taskinen, 1991). These models suggest that the observed Ca2+-mediated fluorescence enhancement of IAANS attached to Cys-84 on helix D may result from movements of helices B and C away from helix D. A recent study (Dong and Cheung, 1995) with native cTnC, which was selectively modified at Cys-84 with fluorescent probes, showed that the Ca2+-mediated enhancement of probe fluorescence was related to strong internal quenching by interactions of a dipolar nature in the apo and 2Mg states. This quenching is reduced or eliminated upon reorientation of helices B and C from helix D. This lends further support to the interpretation that the two first-order transitions that lead to fluorescence enhancement of the IAANS probe may reflect these helix movements. It is not known whether the movements actually occur in two steps, but it is unlikely that they move independently of each other because only the first fluorescence transition is Ca2+ dependent. At a saturating level of Ca2+, these transitions would take about 5 ms to reach a 95% completion. This rate and the observed dissociation rate are likely overestimates of the rates that would occur in muscle. It is well known that both the time-to-peak-tension after excitation and the relaxation time can vary widely with temperature, and they are species-dependent. These time windows are generally longer in cardiac muscle than skeletal muscle, but structural transitions occurring in 5 ms in isolated cTnC may be too fast to be compatible with physiologic events. However, the Ca2+ on- and off-rates in reconstituted troponin are expected to be slower, as the Ca2+ dissociation rate from the regulatory site in the cTnCIAANS•cTnI complex is only 21 s−1 at 20°C (Robertson et al., 1982), a factor of 10 slower than with cTnC determined in the present work. The on-rate in reconstituted troponin or in the regulated thin filament can also be expected to be significantly slower (Robertson et al., 1981). If tension transients follow Ca2+ transients, this anticipated reduction in the rates of reversible Ca2+ binding should still be fast enough to support contraction. In contrast to cardiac TnC, several studies on the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to skeletal TnC have been reported. The early studies of Iio and Kondo (1980a, 1980b, 1982), based on tyrosine fluorescence, proposed a rapid diffusion-controlled binding step followed by conformational changes. Rosenfeld and Taylor (1985a, 1985b) investigated the binding of Ca2+ to both classes of sites with isolated skeletal TnC and reconstituted troponin, using a fluorescently labeled preparation. A two-step binding mechanism with a second-order rate constant of 1.3 × 106M−1 s−1 was proposed for Ca2+ binding to the high affinity sites. This value is about 100 times slower than that for Ca2+ binding to the low affinity site in cTnC determined in the present work. Rosenfeld and Taylor (1985a, 1985b) also reported very fast Ca2+ binding rates to the regulatory sites at low calcium concentration, and the rates at high [Ca2+] became too large to be measured. It could not be determined whether the rate reached a maximum, and the binding data did not establish whether the binding kinetics could be described by a two-step or a three-step model. However, the rates increased linearly with increasing [Ca2+] at low concentration, and an apparent second-order binding rate constant of 5 × 107M−1 s−1 was obtained. This is at least one order of magnitude larger than the corresponding rate at the high affinity sites determined using the same protein preparation. More recently, Johnson et al. (1994) reported the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the two regulatory sites with a tryptophan mutant of skeletal TnC(F29W). They observed monoexponential kinetic traces over a narrow range of [Ca2+] (0-6 μM) and assumed a simple one-step, diffusion-controlled mechanism for the binding of Ca2+ to the two regulatory sites. Since no data were reported at higher Ca2+ concentrations, it is not known whether the observed rate would have saturated at high [Ca2+]. Their apparent second-order binding rate constant is in the range of 1 × 108M−1 s−1 to 2 × 108M−1 s−1, essentially the same as that reported here for cardiac TnC (1.4 × 108M−1 s−1). It appears that the Ca2+ binding rate at the regulatory sites is one to two orders of magnitude faster than that at the high affinity sites, regardless of isoform. The previous interpretation of calcium binding to the regulatory sites as a simple diffusion-controlled process (Johnson et al., 1989; 1994), however, is not consistent with the present evidence. The reporter group of the skeletal TnC mutant is Trp-29 located on helix A immediately adjacent to the amino-terminal end of the Ca2+-binding loop 1, whereas in the present work the reporter group is located on helix D. The different locations of the two probes may be a reason why first- order transitions arising from activator Ca2+-mediated movements of helices B and C were not sensed with mutant F29W. In summary, we have used the fluorescence of an extrinsic probe linked to the single cysteine residue on helix D of a monocysteine mutant to investigate the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to cardiac TnC. The dissociation of Ca2+ from the regulatory site is two orders of magnitude faster than the dissociation of Ca2+ or Mg2+ from the two carboxyl-terminal domain sites. The kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the regulatory sites is consistent with a three-step mechanism in which the bimolecular binding step is in rapid equilibrium and is followed by two sequential first-order transitions."

In the present work, rat brain tissues were extracted by acidic and organic procedures.

Compounds responsible for the observed inhibitory activities were isolated and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography.A tetrapeptide corresponding to a novel amino acid sequence Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu (LSAL) was identified. It reduces the binding of [3H]5-HT to 5-HT1 receptors at low concentration (IC50 = 10−10M). This effect corresponds to a specific interaction at 5-HT1B receptors since LSAL does not significantly affect other neurotransmitter bindings. LSAL appears heterogeneously distributed throughout the brain (hippocampus > cerebellum > striatum > brain stem) and in peripheral tissues (kidney > lung > stomach > blood > liver > spleen).Two other peptides, Leu-Ser (LS) and Ala-Leu (AL), were also purified. They hardly affected [3H]5-HT binding compared with LSAL. They presumably represent degradation products of the functional peptide LSAL. The fact that LSAL interacts specifically with 5-HT1B receptors that inhibit the release of neurotransmitters and particularly that of 5-HT itself suggests that this peptide may be involved in mechanisms controlling 5-HT neurotransmission and, accordingly, may play an important role in pathophysiological functions related to 5-HT activity.

In an attempt to define the role of the LH/CG-R ECLs in hormone binding and signaling, several Arg and Lys residues were replaced: Arg341 (at the boundary between the ECD and TMH I), Lys401 (ECL I), Lys488 (ECL II) and Lys583 (ECL III). Additionally, a reciprocal mutation of Asp397 and Lys583 was characterized. The relative positions of these amino acid residues are shown in Fig. 1. These particular residues are invariant at the homologous positions in the LH/CG-R and the FSH-R of all known species; in the TSH-R, the positions equivalent to residues 401 and 583 are His and Gly, respectively, and the other residues are invariant.

For DEAE-dextran transfection, 20 μg each of pSVL-LH/CG-R and pSV-β-gal, to estimate transfection efficiencies, were added to a 10-ml solution of 90% DMEM, 10% NuSerum transfection medium containing a 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 0.1 mM chloroquine, and the washed cells (~4 × 106) were incubated for 3.5-4 h at 37°C. After removal of the transfection medium, the cells were shocked for 2 min with 10% Me2SO; then COS-7 growth medium was added to the washed cells. For transfections with Lipofectamine, a 7.85-ml solution of serum-free DMEM, containing Lipofectamine (57 μl/ml), 10 μg each of the pSVL-LH/CG-R construct and the pSV-β-gal plasmid and 10% (v/v) Opti-MEM media, was incubated with cells (~2-3 × 106) for 5 h at 37°C. The transfection medium was removed, the cells were washed, and COS-7 growth medium was added. With both types of transfection, the COS-7 cells were incubated overnight at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside staining of gluteraldehyde-fixed cells was used to estimate transfection efficiencies, which were roughly 10% for DEAE-dextran and 40% for Lipofectamine. The COS-7 cells were maintained for 16 h after transfection and then replated (5 × 105 cells/well, six-well tissue culture plates). Some 48-51 h post-transfection, the cells were about 70% confluent. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free Waymouth's medium containing 1 mg of BSA/ml, and 1 ml of this media was added to each well. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG were then added to each well, followed by addition of 25 pM 125I-hCG (approximately 105 cpm). Total and nonspecific binding were determined by addition of 125I-hCG in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled hCG (54 nM). The plates were incubated at 25°C for 16-18 h with gentle shaking. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then trypsinized, collected, and counted in a γ counter. All determinations were performed in duplicate. Binding affinities and maximal binding capacities were calculated using the Ligand program (19Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were maintained for 16 h after transfection and then replated (2-2.5 × 106 cells/dish, 10-cm tissue culture dishes). The protocol is adapted from that described by others(6Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang H. Jacquette J.

About 48 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were placed on ice for 15 min and then washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Cells were scraped into 2 ml of cold buffer A containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol in buffer A containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 15 min. This mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted with 2.25 ml of 20% glycerol in buffer A; 0.5 ml of the extract was incubated for 16-18 h at 4°C with 50 pM 125I-hCG (105 cpm). Total and nonspecific binding were determined in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled hCG, respectively. Bound radioactivity was separated from unbound by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters that were previously soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.1 (22Roche P.C. Berger E.R. Ryan R.J. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 790-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The filters were washed five times with 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM NaN3, 1 mg of BSA/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and counted in a γ counter. All determinations were performed in duplicate. Some 16-18 h after transfection, the transfected cells were replated (1 × 105 cells/well, 12-well tissue culture plates). At 48-51 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 1 mg of BSA/ml and incubated in 0.5 ml of this medium with 0.8 mM isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min at 37°C. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine and then lysed in 100% ethanol at −20°C overnight. The extract was collected, dried under nitrogen gas, and resuspended in the buffer of the 125I-cAMP assay kit, and cAMP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. All measurements were performed in duplicate; means and standard errors were calculated using the Prism program. Transfected cells were maintained for 16-20 h after transfection and then replated (2-2.5 × 106 cells/dish, 10-cm tissue culture dishes). Some 48-51 h post-transfection, detergent-soluble extracts were prepared as described above. The procedures for cell lysis and partial purification of wild-type and mutant LH/CG-Rs were based on reports from other laboratories(21Thomas D.M. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Rosemblit N. Ascoli M. Segaloff D.L.

Following cell lysis with 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifugation as described above, the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 10% glycerol in buffer A, then loaded onto a small agarose-bound wheat germ agglutinin column equilibrated with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol in buffer A, and rotated at 4°C overnight. Following extensive washing with this buffer, the LH/CG-R was eluted with one column volume of 3 mM triacetylchitotriose (24Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide. The eluted material was concentrated to approximately 0.1 ml in a Centricon-30 spin column, and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. Equal amounts of purified cell lysates in sample buffer with no reducing agent were applied to a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel without boiling. After the electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then washed twice in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl) and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in blocking solution (10% glycerol, 5% instant nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). The filters were incubated overnight at room temperature with the same blocking solution containing 3 μg/ml rabbit anti-LH/CG-R IgGs, obtained by protein A-Sepharose purification of anti-LH/CG-R antiserum(23Rosemblit N. Ascoli M. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed five times for 5 min each with blocking solution and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody in blocking solution. Next, the membranes were washed as follows: twice with TBS, twice with 1% Nonidet P-40 in TBS, then once each with TBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 in TBS, and TBS alone. The membranes were exposed to an Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence developer solution for 1 min, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1 min. The films were densitometrically scanned (PDI System, Huntington, NY). The mean Kd from multiple independent transfections (n = 9) for hCG binding to wild-type LH/CG-R on transfected intact COS-7 cells was 0.14 nM, with a range of 0.07-0.25 nM (Table 1), there being no difference between transfections with DEAE-dextran and Lipofectamine. On the other hand, receptor numbers/cell (uncorrected for transfection efficiencies) were greater with Lipofectamine transfection (mean of 2 × 104) than with DEAE-dextran transfection (mean of 0.5 × 104). The difference in receptor number/cell, however, had no significant impact on the maximal cAMP production elicited by hCG at 100 ng/ml in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA to wild-type LH/CG-R; the mean was 20.6 (range = 12.3-31.7) pmol of cAMP/105 cells under the conditions used and was independent of receptor density over the range investigated (Table 1). Likewise, the effective mean concentration of hCG necessary to increase the intracellular cAMP concentration from basal values to 50% of the maximal value in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type LH/CG-R was 0.19 nM (range = 0.05-0.4 nM) (Table 1); this too was independent of receptor density. For ease in comparing the different experiments, the maximal hCG-mediated cAMP production over basal is normalized to 100% for each wild-type LH/CG-R control, and the value obtained with the various receptor mutants, also corrected for basal, is expressed as a percentage of that of wild-type. There was no evidence for a functional endogenous LH/CG-R in nontransfected COS-7 cells: the mean (range) of the basal cAMP production was 3.9 (1.6-6.7) pmol cAMP/105 cells and that of control cells in the presence of 100 ng/ml hCG was 4.6(3.8-5.2) pmol cAMP/105 cells.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Lys583 → Glu mutation resulted in a LH/CG-R that specifically bound 125I-hCG, and this binding was inhibited by unlabeled hCG in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Although the estimated number of receptors varied in the transfected cells, e.g. 2 × 103 for wild-type and 1 × 103 for mutant LH/CG-R (uncorrected for transfection efficiency), the mutant LH/CG-R yielded a binding affinity equivalent to that of wild-type LH/CG-R (Table 1). The Lys583 → Glu replacement resulted in markedly decreased production of cAMP in response to added hCG, e.g. 15% that of wild-type LH/CG-R at 100 ng/ml hCG (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Since this result could be attributed to the decreased number of cell surface receptors, this mutant LH/CG-R was also transfected using Lipofectamine to obtain higher efficiency and increased receptor expression. The mutant receptor bound hCG with an affinity comparable to wild-type LH/CG-R (Table 1). There was an increase in cell surface expression, e.g. 2 × 104 receptors/cells (uncorrected for transfection efficiency), for both wild-type and mutant LH/CG-R, but the mutant receptor again stimulated cAMP production only 15% that of wild-type LH/CG-R at 100 ng/ml hCG (Table 1).Figure 3:cAMP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant cDNAs to LH/CG-R in the presence and absence of hCG. Panels A-D give data on six single mutant forms of LH/CG-R; in each case, results are provided for cells expressing wild-type LH/CG-R and for control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the side-chain specificity of Lys583, replacements were also made with Arg, Gln, and Pro. In each case the mutations yielded LH/CG-Rs that bound 125I-hCG with affinities comparable to that of wild-type LH/CG-R (Fig. 2B, Table 1), but these mutant receptors also resulted in cAMP accumulation <30% that of wild-type LH/CG-R upon addition of hCG to transfected cells (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Competitive binding assays were unable to detect significant cell surface binding of 125I-hCG to cells transfected with cDNAs to the Lys401 → Asp single mutation and the Asp397 → Lys/Lys583 → Asp reciprocal mutation (Table 2). 125I-hCG binding to detergent-soluble extracts of transfected cells was found for the reciprocal mutant but not the point mutant (Table 2). However, Western blot analysis indicated that the (Lys401 → Asp) LH/CG-R was expressed (Fig. 4). Wild-type and mutant LH/CG-Rs were about equally distributed among three bands of apparent molecular mass 101, 93, and 82 kDa; the total protein in the mutant LH/CG-R was much less than that of wild-type LH/CG-R.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Arg341 and Lys488 were each replaced with Glu; both mutations yielded LH/CG-Rs that bound 125I-hCG with affinities comparable to that of wild-type LH/CG-R (Fig. 2, C and D, Table 1). These mutant LH/CG-Rs were capable of stimulating cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner, quite similar to wild-type LH/CG-R (Fig. 3, C and D, Table 1). Our results on the substitution of Lys583 of the rat LH/CG-R with 4 amino acid residues, positively charged Arg, negatively charged Glu, polar but nonionizable Gln, and nonpolar Pro (an imino acid), show that the mutant LH/CG-Rs bind hCG as well as wild-type receptor, but coupling to adenylate cyclase is greatly diminished. These findings are particularly intriguing since Lys583 is located extracellularly, at the boundary of ECL III and TMH VII, and is unable to interact directly with Gs. Thus, one can conclude that ligand-mediated transmembrane signaling involves a conformational change of the LH/CG-R in which Lys583 participates in some manner. Furthermore, this observation provides additional evidence that receptor activation/signaling can be dissociated from high affinity hormone binding in LH/CG-R. A similar conclusion was recently reached in reference to another portion of the rat LH/CG-R, namely the extracellular region just prior to TMH I(25Huang J. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30023-30028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In that study we showed that individual replacements of Glu332 and Asp333 with Lys yielded mutant receptors that also bound hCG like wild-type LH/CG-R but exhibited greatly diminished signaling. Interestingly, recent results with FSH indicate that different sites are involved in receptor binding and signal transduction(26Valove F.M. Finch C. Anasti J.N. Froehlich J. Flack M.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2657-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The finding that the [Arg583]LH/CG-R mutant, in which one positively charged side chain is replaced with another, does not signal effectively indicates a stringent specificity for the lysine side chain. Interestingly, a charged residue at the interface of ECL III and TMH VII is not required for proper membrane localization since the replacements of Lys583 with Gln and Pro yielded mutants that gave levels of cell surface expression comparable to that of wild-type receptor. There is no information on the type of interaction between Lys583 of LH/CG-R and either the ligand or another portion of the receptor. Since replacements of Lys583 have no appreciable effect on hCG binding, one would conclude that any such interaction between the hormone and Lys583 makes a negligible contribution to the overall free energy of binding. However, high affinity hormone binding may occur to the ECD, followed by a conformational change that “presents” the hormone to Lys583 in ECL III where low affinity binding may occur. Using overlapping synthetic peptides, Roche et al. (15Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) found that a peptide based on the sequence of rat ECL III inhibited the binding of 125I-hCG to rat luteal membranes with an IC50 of 0.2 mM. The most obvious interaction of Lys583 would be electrostatic, e.g. an ion-dipole or an ion-ion bond between the positively charged amino group and a negatively charged carboxyl group on hCG or on the receptor ECD or ECLs. Alternatively, a more hydrophobic environment could result in an abnormal pK of Lys583, which could lead to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond. Since our results suggest some form of ligand-mediated conformational change of the receptor, it is reasonable to expect that Lys583 of the LH/CG-R may flip from one type of interaction to another concomitant with hormone binding and that this change accompanies, or perhaps even triggers, a change in the conformation or relative interhelical position of TMH VII. Ji et al. (27Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Asp397 of the LH/CG-R, located at the boundary of TMH II and ECL I, formed an ion pair with Lys91 of the α-subunit of hCG. They postulated that ligand binding may alter the conformation of the unoccupied receptor by reorienting TMH II (28Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and concluded that this residue was important in signaling but was not essential for hormone binding(29Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. as we found for Lys583. Whatever the exact role of Asp397 in LH/CG-R function, we asked whether it and Lys583 could participate in an ion-ion interaction. This was based in part on the close proximity of TMHs II and VII suggested by projection maps of rhodopsin (13Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) and by reciprocal ion-pair mutations in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor(30Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, interhelical interactions of TMH I, in proximity to II and VII, have been shown for the adrenergic receptors(31Suryanarayana S. von Zasrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the reciprocal mutation failed to express in a functional form at the cell surface, although hormone binding could be detected in detergent-solubilized cells. Thus, Asp397 and Lys583 can be individually replaced with oppositely charged amino acid residues and cell surface expression is obtained, but replacing both residues results in intracellular trapping. Lys583 is invariant in the gonadotropin receptors, i.e. LH/CG-R and FSH-R, but in TSH-R the equivalent position is occupied by Gly(2Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). In a revealing study, ECL III of the TSH-R was replaced with that from the β2-adrenergic receptor; it was found that the mutant TSH-R bound TSH with high affinity, but the sensitivity of TSH-stimulated cAMP production and the maximal level of TSH-mediated cAMP production were significantly diminished in the mutant TSH-R(32Kosugi S. Mori T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Coupled with our studies on Lys583 in ECL III of the LH/CG-R, these results indicate an important role of ECL III in glycoprotein hormone signaling and a possible region of specificity delineating gonadotropin receptors from the TSH-R. Two other positively charged residues of LH/CG-R, which are invariant in the glycoprotein hormone receptors, Arg341 (located in the ECD at the interface with TMH I) and Lys488 (ECL II) were each replaced with Glu with no observable effect on hCG binding or receptor activation. Lys401 (ECL I) was replaced with Asp, and the mutant receptor failed to exhibit significant hCG binding to intact or detergent-solubilized cells, suggesting that this amino acid residue may be involved in hormone binding. However, binding may occur but is difficult to detect if there is a low level of mutant receptor expression, if the receptor is rapidly degraded or if the Kd is significantly increased. Lys is present at this position in LH/CG-R and FSH-R, while in TSH-R it is occupied by His; depending upon the pK of the His, the potential exists for retention of a positive charge at this location in ECL I of all glycoprotein hormone receptors. Our results on Western analysis of wild-type LH/CG-R and (Lys401 → Asp) LH/CG-R revealed the presence of three bands of apparent molecular mass 101, 93, and 82 kDa. The original Western blot experiments on expressed LH/CG-R were performed using human 293 cells stably transfected with the wild-type LH/CG-R cDNA(24Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A major 85-kDa form, considered the mature receptor, and a minor 68-kDa form, which appeared to be the incompletely glycosylated form, were found. The apparent 93-kDa band observed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells corresponds to the Mr of purified rat ovarian LH/CG-R(2Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar), although wide variations have been reported in the Mr of LH/CG-R from various sources. In another study from our laboratory using a slightly different set of protein standards, we found major and minor bands of apparent molecular mass 93 kDa (~80%) and 78 kDa for expressed wild-type LH/CG-R(25Huang J. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30023-30028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The greater amount of protein loaded in that study could easily prevent resolution of the bands of 93 and 101 kDa reported herein. Interestingly, the Lys401 → Asp LH/CG-R mutant also gave the same apparent Mr forms as wild-type LH/CG-R, but at much lower levels. In summary, these results enable us to conclude that Lys583 of the rat LH/CG-R is critical in receptor activation following hormone binding. Since Lys583 (ECL III) is located on the opposite side of the membrane from G proteins and does not appear to be involved in hormone binding, these findings offer considerable weight to the concept that receptor binding and activation are dissociable phenomena. Of interest are other observations we recently made that certain amino acid residues in TMH VII are also critical for signal transduction (33Fernandez, L. M., Puett, D. (1994) Abstracts of the 76th Endocrine Society Meeting, Anaheim, CA, June 15-18, Abstr. 973, p. 444Google Scholar). Thus, this region of the receptor appears to be important in transmembrane signaling subsequent to hormone binding. We thank Drs. Jianing Huang and Prema Narayan for their interest in this work and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1965034693,"The intracellular Ca2+ pump blocker, thapsigargin, induces emptying of Ca2+ pools and entry of DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells into a quiescent G0-like growth state. Although thapsigargin blocks pumps essentially irreversibly, high serum (20%) induces appearance of new pump protein, return of functional pools, and reentry of cells into the cell cycle (Waldron, R. T., Short, A. D., Meadows, J. J., Ghosh, T. K., and Gill, D. L.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 11927-11933). Through analysis of the effects of defined serum components and growth supplements, we reveal here that the factors in serum responsible for inducing recovery of Ca2+ pools and growth in thapsigargin-arrested DDT1MF-2 cells are exactly mimicked by the three essential fatty acids, arachidonic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids. The EC50 values for arachidonic and linoleic acids on growth induction of thapsigargin-arrested cells were the same, approximately 5 μM. Nonessential fatty acids, including myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, and arachidic acids, were without any effect. Although not proven to be the active component of serum, levels of arachidonic and linoleic acids in serum were sufficient to explain serum-induced growth recovery. Significantly, arachidonic or linoleic acids induced complete recovery of bradykinin-sensitive Ca2+ pools within 6 h of treatment of thapsigargin-arrested cells. Protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide or puromycin) completely blocked the appearance of serum-induced or arachidonic acid-induced agonist-sensitive pools. The sensitivity and fatty acid specificity of Ca2+ pool recovery in thapsigargin-arrested cells were almost identical to that for growth recovery. No pool or growth recovery was observed with 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, the nonmetabolizable analogue of arachidonic acid, suggesting that conversion to eicosanoids underlies the pool and growth recovery induced by essential fatty acids. The results provide not only further information on the link between Ca2+ pools and cell growth but also evidence for a potentially important signaling pathway involved in inducing transition from a stationary to a proliferative growth state."
https://openalex.org/W2034821058,"Overexpression of the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) CD45 in nonhematopoietic cells results in decreased signaling through growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Consistent with these data, insulin receptor signaling is increased when the CD45-related PTPase LAR is reduced by antisense suppression in a rat hepatoma cell line. To test whether the hematopoietic cell-specific PTPase CD45 functions in a manner similar to LAR by negatively modulating insulin receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells, the insulin-responsive human multiple myeloma cell line U266 was isolated into two subpopulations that differed in CD45 expression. In CD45 nonexpressing (CD45-) cells, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was increased by 3-fold after insulin treatment when compared to CD45 expressing (CD45+) cells. This increase in receptor autophosphorylation was associated with similar increases in insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activation. These receptor level effects were paralleled by postreceptor responses. Insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and Shc was 3-fold greater in CD45- cells. In addition, insulin-dependent IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase association and MAP kinase activation in CD45- cells were also 3-fold larger. While expression of CD45 was associated with a decrease in the responsiveness of early insulin receptor signaling, interleukin 6-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells.

Responsiveness is restored, however, when CD45 is reconstituted. This work has recently been confirmed in CD45-deficient mice(2Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K. Wakeham A.

The PTPase CD45 appears to function as a positive mediator of this increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation by activating members of the src family protein-tyrosine kinases(1Justement L.B. Brown V.K. Lin J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 399-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). protein-tyrosine phosphatase insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis interleukin 6. Although much of the work with CD45 has focused on its role as a positive component of B-cell antigen receptor signal transduction, recent work suggests that CD45 may also function as a negative modulator of tyrosine kinase signaling. For example, cross-linking studies have suggested that CD45 negatively modulates signaling through the Fcγ receptor on a monocytic cell line(3Rankin B.M. Yocum S.A. Mittler R.S. Kiener P.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 605-616PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the phosphorylated CD3 ζ chain has been shown to be a specific substrate of CD45, leading Furukawa et al. (4Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to propose that CD45 is involved in the termination of T-cell activation. Furthermore, anti-CD45 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to inhibit interleukin 4 signal transduction(5Hasegawa K. Nishimura H. Ogawa S. Hirose S. Sato H. Shirai T. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Results demonstrating a negative role for CD45 are not surprising. We have shown that CD45 can blunt platelet-derived growth factor and insulin growth factor 1-dependent responses when transfected into the mouse mammary cell line C127(6Mooney R.A. Freund G.G. Way B.A. Bordwell K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23443-23446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been confirmed in 3T3L1 fibroblasts and the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, 2B. A. Way and R. A. Mooney, unpublished observations. as well as in human embryonic kidney fibroblast cells(8Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that LAR, a transmembrane PTPase cloned on the basis of its homology to CD45(9Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), can negatively modulate insulin receptor signal transduction within a rat hepatoma cell line(10Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CD45 (also called leukocyte common antigen) and LAR (also called leukocyte common antigen-related) are high molecular weight transmembrane glycoproteins that contain two homologous tandem PTPase domains in their cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular regions for each of these PTPases do not possess any significant homology(9Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Since CD45 has been well-characterized as an activator of intracellular tyrosine kinases, we wanted to investigate whether the structural elements it shares with LAR would allow it to function as a negative modulator of receptor tyrosine kinases. Since CD45 is expressed only by cells of hematopoietic origin, the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 was chosen for study because this cell line is known to respond to insulin(11Freund G.G. Kulas D.T. Mooney R.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1811-1820PubMed Google Scholar, 12Freund G.G. Kulas D.T. Way B.A. Mooney R.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3179-3185PubMed Google Scholar, 13Uddin S. Katzav S. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7712-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric protein complex composed of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane β subunits (reviewed in (14White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). After the α subunit binds insulin, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the β subunit increases, allowing it to phosphorylate itself as well as intracellular substrates. Two of these substrates include IRS-1 and Shc. By examining the effect of CD45 on insulin receptor signal transduction, the role of CD45 as a negative modulator of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling was revealed. Phosphotyrosine (4G10), IRS-1 (C-terminal), PI 3-kinase, Shc, fyn, and MAP kinase R2 (erk1-CT) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI, Saranac Lake, NY). GST-MAP kinase was purchased from UBI. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD45 antibody T200 (KC56) was from Coulter. Other CD45 antibodies were: HLe-1 (Becton Dickinson), T29/33 (Boehringer Mannheim), and UCHL-1 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The insulin receptor antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Furlanetto (University of Rochester). RPMI cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were purchased from Amersham. The human multiple myeloma cell line U266 (15Nilsson K. Bennich H. Johansson S.G.O. Ponten J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1970; 7: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split 1:1 every 3 days. Prior to experiments, cells were suspended in serum-free media supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for 18 h. Cell counts were performed on an S Plus Stacker Jr. (Coulter). The U266 cell line was immunolabeled with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD45 antibody T200 (KC56). CD45- and CD45+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously(6Mooney R.A. Freund G.G. Way B.A. Bordwell K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23443-23446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One cycle of fluorescence-activated cell sorting yielded >99% pure CD45+ cells. Two cycles were needed to isolate >95% pure CD45- cells. Differential expression of CD45 in the subpopulations was maintained for more than 2 months. CD45 protein levels in the CD45- and CD45+ subpopulations were determined by Western blot analysis. 15 × 106 cells were solubilized in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After diluting the Triton X-100 concentration to 0.1%, CD45 was immunoprecipitated with either T29/33 or UCHL-1. UCHL-1 was used as the blotting antibody, using methods described previously(7Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact cell tyrosine phosphorylation was measured as described previously(7Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of 25 × 106 CD45- and CD45+ cells were incubated with insulin at the indicated concentrations for 5 min and harvested in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mM orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Immunoblots were visualized by 125I-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (in conjunction with an unlabeled rabbit anti-mouse bridging layer) as described(7Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™) as described(16Stahl N. Davis S. Wong V. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7628-7631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry was performed with an XRS image scanner and Bio Image Software. 5 × 106 CD45- and CD45+ cells were treated with either insulin or IL-6 at the indicated concentrations for 5 min. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EGTA. For the MAP kinase kinase assay, an equal volume of total cell lysate was mixed with a reaction mixture containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 μCi/μl tracer [γ-32P]ATP. 1 μg of GST-MAP kinase (UBI) was then added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution with lysis buffer containing 1 mM ATP. After washing the agarose beads 3 times with lysis buffer, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Phosphorylated GST-MAP kinase was detected by autoradiography. The MAP kinase assay was performed similarly. MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from growth factor-treated cells with a MAP kinase antibody (UBI). To the immunoprecipitate was added a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 0.1 mg/ml protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), and 2 μM ATP containing 0.01 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The phosphorylated proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. 5 × 106 CD45- and CD45+ cells were harvested in lysis buffer and fyn immunoprecipitates were obtained. The fyn kinase assay was performed exactly as described previously(17Way B.A. Mooney R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 139: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In brief, immune complexes were washed twice in RIPA buffer, once in high salt buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl), and twice in kinase assay buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mM MnCl2), and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer, containing 5 μM [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi/nmol) and 10 μg of acid and heat-denatured rabbit muscle enolase. After 10 min, 50 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Phosphorylated enolase was detected by autoradiography. Flow cytometric analysis of the human multiple myeloma U266 cell line revealed a heterogeneous expression of CD45, ranging from nonexpressers to high expressers (Fig. 1A). Two stable U266 subpopulations, CD45- and CD45+ (Fig. 1, B and C), were isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This technique has been used successfully by other investigators to isolate CD45- and CD45+ subpopulations(18Danielian S. Alcover A. Polissard L. Stefanescu M. Acuto O. Fischer S. Fagard R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After two cycles of sorting, CD45- and CD45+ cells were >95% and >99% pure, respectively. The absence of CD45 expression within CD45- cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). The first parameter examined was insulin receptor binding and affinity. As shown by Fig. 2, CD45- and CD45+ cells possessed equivalent numbers of insulin receptors with equivalent binding affinity. In addition, each of these subpopulations possessed equivalent cell growth rates, morphology, immunoglobulin synthesis, and total protein per cell (data not shown). If CD45 negatively modulated insulin receptor signal transduction at the level of the receptor, then receptor activation, particularly autophosphorylation(14White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), should be increased in CD45- cells. As shown by Fig. 3A, insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation was increased by 3.2 ± 0.3-fold (mean ± 1/2 range) and 3.5 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± 1/2 range) in CD45- cells as compared to CD45+ cells at 2 nM and 200 nM insulin treatment, respectively. This increase in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in CD45- cells supports the hypothesis that CD45 can function as a negative modulator of insulin receptor activation in hematopoietic cells. Since increased receptor autophosphorylation may not necessarily correlate with increased receptor tyrosine kinase activation, receptor kinase activity was specifically examined. After insulin treatment, insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to a tyrosine kinase assay with poly(Glu-Tyr)(4:1). We have previously shown that this technique preserves insulin-dependent increases in receptor tyrosine kinase activity(10Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As shown by Fig. 3B, insulin treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The activity seen in CD45- cells was increased by approximately 2-fold at each insulin concentration tested when compared to CD45+ cells. The fold increase over basal in tyrosine kinase activation was 4.4 ± 1.0 (mean ± S.E.) at 2 nM insulin and 51.8 ± 4.8 (mean ± S.E.) at 200 nM insulin in CD45- cells. In CD45+ cells, the fold increase over basal in tyrosine kinase activation was 2.2 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.E.) at 2 nM insulin and 27.2 ± 2.4 (mean ± S.E.) at 200 nM insulin. Insulin receptor basal activity between CD45- and CD45+ cells was indistinguishable. As an additional control, insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated from untreated cells. In vitro insulin treatment of these receptors resulted in a dose-dependent increase in receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Under these conditions, however, the fold increase over basal was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the intact cell differences in insulin receptor signaling between CD45- and CD45+ cells were not due to events occurring during or after cell lysis. The best characterized substrate of the insulin receptor is the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1, recently reviewed in (19Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 115-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and (20Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar)). After insulin treatment, this protein becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). As shown in Fig. 4A, insulin treatment of U266 cells resulted in an increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. This increase, however, was amplified by 3.1 ± 0.3-fold (mean ± 1/2 range) and 3.3 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± 1/2 range) in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells at 2 nM and 200 nM insulin, respectively. Likewise, insulin-dependent association of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 was increased 3-fold in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells (Fig. 4B). Previously, we have documented the absence of a marked dose dependence in insulin-dependent PI 3-kinase activation in the U266 cell line(12Freund G.G. Kulas D.T. Way B.A. Mooney R.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3179-3185PubMed Google Scholar). If CD45 was affecting insulin receptor signal transduction at the level of the insulin receptor, then all kinase-dependent events should be affected to a similar degree by differing CD45 levels. To demonstrate that differing CD45 levels weren't affecting IRS-1-mediated events specifically, insulin-dependent Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was examined. As shown in Fig. 4C, insulin-dependent Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by 3-fold in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells at each insulin concentration tested. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway is a well-characterized post-receptor response to insulin treatment(21Denton R.M. Tavare J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 597-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Since recent studies have indicated that MAP kinase activation is also increased by IL-6 treatment(22Daeipour M. Kumar G. Amaral M.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4743-4753PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kumar G. Gupta S. Wang S. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4436-4447PubMed Google Scholar), examination of this signaling pathway provided an opportunity to test the specificity of CD45 action. As shown in Fig. 5A, insulin and IL-6 treatment resulted in an increase in MAP kinase activation. Consistent with an effect of CD45 on the insulin receptor, insulin-dependent MAP kinase activation was increased 3-fold in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells. IL-6-dependent activation of MAP kinase, however, was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells. To demonstrate that CD45 was altering MAP kinase activation through a pathway that involves MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK)(23Kumar G. Gupta S. Wang S. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4436-4447PubMed Google Scholar), MAPKK was specifically examined. When ligand-dependent MAPKK activation was examined, results similar to those noted for MAP kinase activation were observed. Insulin-dependent changes in MAPKK activation were 3-fold greater in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells. Under identical conditions, however, IL-6-dependent increases in MAPKK activation were again equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells (Fig. 5B). Since CD45 has been studied primarily as an activator of src family kinases(1Justement L.B. Brown V.K. Lin J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 399-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the basal activity of fyn, a src family kinase, was examined in CD45+ and CD45- populations. Kinase activity in fyn immunoprecipitates, as measured by phosphorylation of the substrate enolase, was severalfold lower in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells (Fig. 6). fyn activity was unaltered by insulin. Autophosphorylation of fyn was below the level of detection in the U266 cell line. The variable expression of the transmembrane PTPase CD45 on U266 cells permitted the isolation of two stable subpopulations: CD45 non-expressers (CD45-) and CD45 expressers (CD45+). Each insulin-dependent response examined, receptor autophosphorylation, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1/PI 3-kinase complexing, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, MAP kinase kinase activation, and MAP kinase activation, was increased by 2- to 3-fold in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells. Despite these ligand-dependent differences, basal activity of the insulin receptor was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells. Most significantly, the number and binding affinity of insulin receptors was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells. Interestingly, basal activity of the src family kinase member fyn was decreased severalfold in CD45- cells. This is consistent with evidence indicating that inhibitory tyrosine residues on lck and fyn are hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient cell lines(24Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, interleukin 6 (IL-6)-dependent activation of MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells. These results demonstrate that CD45 possesses functions not limited to the activation of src family tyrosine kinases. Although hematopoietic cells classically have not been defined as an insulin-responsive tissue, recent work has demonstrated many examples of insulin receptor signaling within these cells. Insulin responses have been reported in human IM-9 and J558L (mouse plasmacytoma)(13Uddin S. Katzav S. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7712-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), myeloid(25Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Li W. Lienhard G.E. Pacini S. Gutkin J.S. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3665-3670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines. Recent work with the 32D cell line, which has a myeloid progenitor phenotype, has indicated that insulin can be a potent mitogenic factor for hematopoietic cells that possess intact insulin signaling pathways(27Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). As a role for insulin in hematopoietic cell signal transduction evolves, the function of CD45 as a physiological modulator of insulin receptor signaling may well become more important. An important extension of the current work would be to determine whether the impact of CD45 on insulin receptor signaling is preserved in hematopoietic cell lines other than the U266 cell line. Whether CD45 directly or indirectly affects the insulin receptor remains to be determined. Since the CD45- and CD45+ cell populations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and not by a specific gene knock-out technique, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the enhancement of insulin receptor signaling within CD45- cells may be due to an unknown factor. It is possible, for example, that CD45 functions by activating another PTPase. This would be consistent with its well-established role as a positive signal transducer. The actual site of CD45 action can provide important information regarding the mechanism by which transmembrane PTPases can modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Since decreased CD45 expression resulted in severalfold increases in insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation and receptor kinase activation, it appears that CD45 functions at the level of the insulin receptor. This conclusion is supported by the IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation data. Insulin-dependent IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation were increased by a similar 3-fold in CD45- cells when compared to CD45+ cells at each insulin concentration tested. Furthermore, the lack of a change in IL-6 responses between CD45- and CD45+ cells supports a receptor level site of action since insulin and IL-6 activate MAP kinase through similar pathways. The possibility that CD45 also functions to a minor degree at other post-receptor sites, such as IRS-1 or Shc, cannot be excluded. We have been interested specifically in the transmembrane class of PTPases as physiological regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling due to their localization within the same subcellular compartment. We have shown that the widely expressed transmembrane PTPase LAR can function as a negative modulator of growth factor receptor signaling within a hepatoma cell line(10Kulas D.T. Zhang W. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here, we were interested whether the hematopoietic cell-specific transmembrane PTPase CD45 could perform a similar function within a hematopoietic cell line. CD45 and LAR are high molecular weight, glycosylated, transmembrane PTPases that possess two highly homologous tandem PTPase domains in their cytoplasmic regions. The membrane-proximal PTPase domains for LAR and CD45 possess catalytic activity, whereas the membrane distal PTPase domains have been suggested to serve an important role in substrate specificity. Here, we show that CD45 possesses functional as well as structural similarities to LAR. Reduction of either one of these PTPases can increase insulin receptor signaling. Interestingly, a 63% reduction in LAR resulted in a 3-4-fold increase in insulin receptor signaling. A complete absence of CD45, however, was associated with only a 2-3-fold increase in insulin receptor signaling. It is possible that CD45 and LAR differ in their substrate specificities. There is some evidence indicating that CD45 and LAR differ with regard to substrate interactions. Furukawa et al. (4Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have shown that the phosphorylated CD3 ζ chain is a specific and high affinity substrate for CD45; LAR, however, does not bind this protein. LAR might have a higher selectivity for inactivating the insulin receptor than CD45. This would be compatible with evidence indicating that LAR is a major PTPase expressed by the classic insulin-responsive tissues fat, muscle, and liver. CD45, of course, isn't expressed by these tissues. In addition, it is probable that U266 cells possess PTPases other than CD45 that are capable of regulating insulin receptor signaling. A PTPase presumably exists within CD45- cells that can terminate insulin receptor signaling. An examination of PTPases expressed in the pre-B-cell line NALM-6(28Adachi M. Sekiya M. Arimura Y. Takekawn M. Itoh F. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 737-740PubMed Google Scholar), for example, revealed that this hematopoietic cell line expresses at least seven different PTPases. One or more of these PTPases might be modulating insulin receptor signaling within U266 cells. The possibility that LAR is performing this function is currently being pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2001514698,"A transcription termination factor (Rho) was purified from the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, and the complete gene sequence was determined. The M. luteus Rho polypeptide has 690 residues, which is 271 residues more than its homolog from Escherichia coli. Most of the additional residues compose a highly charged, hydrophilic segment that is inserted in a nonconserved region between two conserved regions of the RNA-binding domain of the known Rho homolog proteins. This segment extends from residues 49 to 311 and includes a stretch of 238 residues that contain no hydrophobic side chains. Biochemical studies indicate that the M. luteus protein is very similar to E. coli Rho in terms of its RNA-dependent NTPase activity and its sensitivity to the Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin. However, the M. luteus protein has a less stringent RNA cofactor specificity. It also acts to terminate RNA transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase on the λ cro DNA template, but at much earlier termination stop points than those recognized by E. coli Rho. Thus, the M. luteus protein functions as a true Rho factor, but with a different specificity than that of E. coli Rho. We propose that this altered specificity is consistent with its need to function on transcripts that have a high content of G + C residues.

Thus, the M. luteus protein functions as a true Rho factor, but with a different specificity than that of E. coli Rho. We propose that this altered specificity is consistent with its need to function on transcripts that have a high content of G + C residues. The orderly expression of the genetic information in DNA segments into RNA molecules depends on the function of transcription terminators. In Escherichia coli, one mechanism of transcription termination is mediated in part by an essential protein factor called Rho(1Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar). Rho factor from E. coli has been studied since its discovery nearly 25 years ago(2Roberts J.W. Nature. 1969; 224: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The Rho monomer is a 47-kDa protein. However, Rho factor functions as a homohexamer (3Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that can bind to a nascent transcript and mediate its release by actions on the transcription complex that are coupled to the hydrolysis of NTPs(1Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar). A recent phylogenetic study by Opperman and Richardson (4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) comparing rho genes isolated from organisms from several of the major branches of bacteria suggests that Rho is ubiquitous throughout the bacterial domain. An unexpected result was discovered during the analysis of the rho gene from Micrococcus luteus, a Gram-positive soil bacterium that has an unusually high G + C DNA content (74%)(5Ohama T. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The M. luteus rho homolog was found to have an open reading frame encoding a protein that was homologous to E. coli Rho through a very long portion. However, the homology did not extend all the way through the RNA-binding domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Because the region of homology starts in a segment that has an in-frame GTG codon preceded by a sequence that is a good match to a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, Opperman and Richardson proposed that translation began at that GTG codon to yield a 41,733-Da protein of 382 amino acids that is 52% identical (71% similar) to E. coli Rho. If this proposal were correct, the M. luteus Rho protein would be unusual in comparison with the other Rho homologs as it would lack a conserved part of its RNA-binding domain. Additionally, the protein would be ∼30 amino acids smaller than any of the other predicted Rho factors that have been sequenced. The data of Opperman and Richardson (4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also consistent with an alternative hypothesis, namely that the M. luteus Rho polypeptide is much larger than the homologs from other organisms and includes a large region with a very unusual amino acid sequence. The DNA sequence determined in that work indicated that the open reading frame extended upstream for at least 160 amino acid residues. However, because the G + C content of that upstream region was ∼78%, which is a value that is typical of intergenic spacer regions in M. luteus DNA(5Ohama T. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and because these upstream codons had a very unusual bias favoring Arg, Asp, Gln, and Gly residues and lacking hydrophobic residues, Opperman and Richardson argued that it was unlikely to be part of the coding region for the M. luteus Rho protein. To resolve this issue, we purified Rho protein from M. luteus. Our studies show conclusively that the latter hypothesis is correct and demonstrate directly that an organism that is phylogenetically distinct from E. coli also has a factor that can cause the termination of RNA transcription. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Vent DNA polymerase, and DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Sequenase version 2.0 was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. E. coli RNA polymerase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies Corp. E. coli Rho protein was provided by Lislott Richardson (Indiana University). NusG was a gift from Barbara Stitt (Temple University). Bicyclomycin was obtained from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Ribonucleotides, deoxynucleotides, and dideoxynucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 7-Deaza-2′-dGTP was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Polynucleotides were purchased from Miles Inc. Standard primers used for sequencing, custom DNA oligonucleotides, and random deoxynucleotides (d(N)6) were synthesized at the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana University by Lawrence Washington. ATPase activity was assayed colorimetrically as described by Lanzetta et al. (6Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). Typically, 50 ng of protein were mixed with 100 μl of assay solution (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl1, 1 mM ATP, and 10 μg/ml poly(C)). After 10 min at 37°C, the release of Pi from ATP was detected by the addition of 800 μl of a mixture of 4.2% ammonium molybdate, 0.045% malachite green, concentrated flame photometer diluent (Bacharach, Inc.) (12.5:37.5:1) that had been premixed and filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Color development was quenched after 1 min by the addition of 100 μl of 34% citric acid. After 30 min at 20°C, the absorbance at 660 nm was measured. One unit is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP/min. This assay was found to be quantitative from 1 to 15 nmol of Pi. 10 μg of the intact protein were bound to a strip of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by direct adsorption (7Hugli T.E. Speicher D.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 28-30Google Scholar). The N terminus was sequenced by William Lane at the Harvard University MicroChem Laboratory. To obtain N-terminal sequence information of a stable tryptic fragment, 16.8 μg of Rho protein was digested in the presence of 105 nM trypsin for 3 min at 37°C in a total volume of 30 μl. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 4 × sample loading buffer (252 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) followed by immersion of the mixture in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel(8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and the protein bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a Pharmacia Biotech 2117 Multiphor II blotting apparatus. The transfer was carried out in Towbin buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 192 mM glycine, 15% methanol) (9Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 30 mA. The protein fragments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The band with an Mr of 42,000 was removed, washed with double distilled H1O, air-dried, and stored at −20°C. N-terminal sequencing was performed by Brian VanWuyckhuyse at the Protein Sequencing Facility at the University of Rochester Medical Center (Rochester, NY). Genomic DNA was prepared from M. luteus as described by Wilson(10Wilson K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Son, Inc., New York1989: 2.4.1-2.4.5Google Scholar). The method employs the detergent hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide to remove proteins and polysaccharides. A typical yield from a saturated 100-ml culture was 0.7 μg of DNA. To identify a 203-kbp 1The abbreviation used is: kbpkilobase pair. fragment containing the sequence encoding the N-terminal region of the M. luteus rho gene, 10 μg of genomic DNA were digested with various combinations of restriction endonucleases, and the products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments containing the desired rho gene segment were identified by Southern hybridization (11Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21472) Google Scholar) with a 0.28-kbp HindIII/SmaI fragment from the plasmid pMLRHOSK+(12Opperman, T. J. (1993) A Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of the Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of Transcription Termination Factor Rho. Ph.D. thesis, Indiana UniversityGoogle Scholar), which had been radiolabeled to a high specific activity with 32P(13Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). kilobase pair. It was determined that a BamHI/PstI double digest of M. luteus genomic DNA produced a ∼2-kbp fragment that contained the desired portion of the M. luteus rho gene. To clone this DNA fragment, 50 μg of M. luteus DNA were digested with BamHI and PstI, and the fragments were size-selected on a 1% agarose gel and ligated into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). Colonies of E. coli DH5αF′ transformed with these ligated plasmids were screened by nucleic acid hybridization (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the same HindIII/SmaI fragment used for Southern analysis. Both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA templates were utilized for sequencing reactions(15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Double-stranded templates were prepared as described in the Sequenase protocol manual (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Single-stranded DNA was generated from pBluescript derivatives by infection with M13K07 helper phage(16Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. 7-Deaza-dGTP was used in place of dGTP to reduce band compressions(17Barr P.J. Thayer R.M. Layborn P. Najarian R.C. Seela F. Tolan D.R. BioTechniques. 1986; 4: 428-432Google Scholar), and a dideoxy-dGTP/7-deaza-dGTP ratio of 1:15 and a dideoxy-CTP/dCTP ratio of 1:100 were used in the termination mixtures to enhance dG and dC signals. A DNA fragment encoding the λ cro gene was prepared by amplification of the segment of the gene from residues −188 to +372 from pCBC1 DNA 2C. M. Burns and J. P. Richardson, unpublished results. with Vent DNA polymerase. This plasmid contains a mutation of C to G at position 6 of the cro gene. Transcription complex formation was carried out according to Burns and Richardson (18Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In a reaction volume of 60 μl, 3 pmol of E. coli RNA polymerase were incubated with 3 pmol of DNA in transcription buffer (150 mM potassium glutamate, pH 7.8, 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 4 mM Mg(OAc)1, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.002% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol) for 3 min at 37°C to form open complexes. The addition of 40 μl of NTP mixture (4 μM GTP, 4 μM ATP, 4 μM [α-32P]UTP (350 nCi/pmol)) and incubation at 16°C for 20 min resulted in the formation of stalled ternary complexes 24 residues downstream from the start point of transcription of λPR (A24 complex). After the addition of 5 μl of rifampicin (1 mg/ml), the unincorporated NTPs were removed by ultrafiltration (20 min, 500 × g) with a Microcon-100 (Amicon, Inc.). The retentate (10 μl) was diluted to 200 μl with transcription buffer containing 36 units of rRNasin (Promega). 10 μl of this diluted A24 complex solution were used per reaction. After the addition of Rho factor, all four NTPs (including CTP) were added to 200 μM, and the 20-μl reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 3 min. After the addition of 20 μl of 2 × stop mixture (20 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubation at 37°C for 20 min, the RNA was collected by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 6 μl of loading dye (10 mM EDTA, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.001% xylene cyanol in 98% formamide). The entire sample was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (20 × 40 cm) containing 50% urea(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the RNA transcripts were separated by electrophoresis for 2 h at 30 watts. From preliminary studies, we found that the ATPase activity in partially fractionated extracts of M. luteus cells was stimulated by the addition of RNA homopolymers and that poly(C) was especially effective. Since E. coli Rho is an RNA-dependent ATPase that is strongly activated by poly(C) (19Lowery C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1381-1385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we made use of an assay for ATP hydrolysis with poly(C) present for purification of a putative Rho factor from M. luteus. The purification procedure, which is described in detail elsewhere (20Nowatzke, W. L., Richardson, L. V., Richardson, J. P. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar), involved chromatography of the crude extract on a Bio-Rex 70 cation-exchange column (Bio-Rad), concentration of the pooled fractions containing poly(C)-dependent ATPase with a Centriprep-100 ultrafiltrator (Amicon, Inc.), and chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Analysis of the final fraction by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) revealed that it consisted of a single polypeptide in >95% purity with an apparent Mr of 95,000 (Fig. 1), which is approximately twice as large as the E. coli Rho polypeptide and also significantly larger than the M. luteus rho gene product (Mr = 41,733) proposed by Opperman and Richardson(4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of this highly purified M. luteus ATPase, analyzed by the Microsequencing Facility at Harvard University, yielded an N-terminal amino acid sequence of TESTE, which is different from the sequence of MAGIL at the N terminus of the proposed M. luteus rho gene product(4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence also did not match any other pentapeptide sequence in the segment of the M. luteus rho gene that had been sequenced prior to this work. However, a 42-kDa fragment generated from the 95-kDa protein by partial digestion with trypsin had the N-terminal sequence GRPGPEVDE, which did match a sequence located upstream of the previously proposed rho translational start site(12Opperman, T. J. (1993) A Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of the Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of Transcription Termination Factor Rho. Ph.D. thesis, Indiana UniversityGoogle Scholar). Together, these results concerning the apparent size and N-terminal sequence of the M. luteus RNA-dependent ATPase suggested that the M. luteus rho gene sequence reported by Opperman and Richardson (4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was not complete. The M. luteus rho gene identified in the previous study (12Opperman, T. J. (1993) A Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of the Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of Transcription Termination Factor Rho. Ph.D. thesis, Indiana UniversityGoogle Scholar) was cloned as a 2.1-kbp SphI/SacI DNA fragment in the plasmid pMLRHOSK+. The remainder of the M. luteus rho gene was cloned as a 2-kbp BamHI/PstI DNA fragment into pBluescript II SK+ to create the plasmid pBN10. We intentionally chose a fragment that would overlap partially with the rho insert in pMLRHOSK+. The DNA sequence of this fragment confirmed that the target DNA had been successfully isolated and contained ∼1200 base pairs of additional upstream M. luteus sequence. 111 base pairs (37 residues) upstream from the SphI site, we found a segment encoding the sought-after N-terminal pentapeptide sequence TESTE, which had been identified from microsequencing of the purified RNA-dependent ATPase. This result demonstrated that the RNA-dependent ATPase is indeed encoded by the gene identified by Opperman and Richardson(4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the open reading frame continues upstream for 108 base pairs from the codon of the first Thr residue, the next upstream codon is GTG, which is used as the start codon in ∼50% of the M. luteus genes (5Ohama T. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and it is preceded by an excellent Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Fig. 2). We thus conclude that translation of the M. luteus rho gene starts at the GTG codon at position 1 and that the initiating Met residue is removed post-transcriptionally. The amino acid composition of the predicted protein from the completed gene sequence is in excellent agreement with the amino acid composition of the purified protein (Table 1). The molecular mass of the M. luteus Rho protein is 74,957 Da; therefore, the protein runs anomalously (∼95 kDa) in the Laemmli gel system (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab It has previously been demonstrated that the E. coli Rho protein is capable of catalyzing the hydrolytic conversion of any one of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate and Pi in the presence of an RNA cofactor such as poly(C)(21Lowery C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This aspect of M. luteus Rho was investigated by assaying for Pi release with each of the four different NTPs (Table 2). M. luteus Rho was able to utilize all four rNTPs as well as dATP as substrates, but only when RNA was present. These results indicate that M. luteus Rho, like E. coli Rho, is an RNA-dependent NTPase. However, M. luteus Rho differs from E. coli Rho in having a significantly lower activity with CTP. The results also show that, on a molecular basis, M. luteus Rho catalyzed ATP hydrolysis at the same rate as E. coli Rho.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether M. luteus Rho is significantly different from E. coli Rho with respect to its RNA-dependent ATPase activity, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the two proteins was determined in the presence of various synthetic polynucleotide homopolymers (Table 3). Both proteins were dependent on the presence of an RNA for ATP hydrolysis, and neither hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of poly(dC). Of the RNA polymers tested, poly(C) was the most effective activator for both proteins. M. luteus Rho, however, had appreciable activity with poly(A) as well as relatively high activity with poly(U) and measurable activity with poly(I). This was significantly different from E. coli Rho. Thus, the spectrum of RNA molecules that can activate ATP hydrolysis is greater for M. luteus Rho than for E. coli Rho.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To test whether the lower activity M. luteus Rho had with CTP was related to the RNA cofactor used, the rate of CTP hydrolysis was measured with poly(U) and was found to be ∼30% of that with ATP (data not shown). Thus, the lower activity of M. luteus Rho with CTP was not a consequence of using poly(C) as an activator. Bicyclomycin is an antibiotic that has recently been shown to specifically inhibit E. coli Rho function(22Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutants that exhibit bicyclomycin resistance contain mutations in the ATPase domain of the Rho protein(22Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because M. luteus Rho contains strong sequence homology in that conserved region, it was hypothesized that bicyclomycin would be an inhibitor of the M. luteus Rho protein. To investigate this, the standard ATPase assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of bicyclomycin (Fig. 3). The results reveal that bicyclomycin is a potent inhibitor of M. luteus Rho. In the presence of 25 μM bicyclomycin, the lowest concentration tested, both the E. coli and M. luteus Rho proteins retain <30% of their poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity. Activity continues to decrease with increasing bicyclomycin concentrations and is nearly abolished at 200 μM. To determine whether the RNA-dependent ATPase from M. luteus is a transcription termination factor, the purified protein was assayed for its effect on transcription of a λ cro template with E. coli RNA polymerase. This template has the well characterized Rho-dependent terminator tR1(23Lau L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6171-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The control experiments show that starting with isolated complexes, incubation for 3 or 6 min in the absence of factors yielded a 372-nucleotide RNA (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5), the readthrough transcript from the promoter (PR) to the end of the template. When E. coli Rho factor was present at 28 nM, a 3-min incubation yielded RNA molecules with ∼290, ∼312, and ∼345 nt arising from termination at subsites I, II, and III(23Lau L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6171-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), respectively, as well as the 372-nucleotide readthrough transcript (Fig. 4, lane 6). The overall termination efficiency was ∼50% for this condition. The addition of the E. coli termination cofactor NusG, which has been shown to cause Rho-dependent termination at sites upstream of tR1in vitro (24Li J. Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), yielded the expected pattern (Fig. 4, lane 7). When M. luteus Rho was used at the same concentration (28 nM), a new set of discrete RNA molecules was formed with sizes in the range of 90-280 nucleotides (Fig. 4, lane 9), indicating that it caused termination at points well upstream from those used by E. coli Rho. The addition of E. coli NusG had only a small effect in enhancing the yield of smaller transcripts with M. luteus Rho (Fig. 4, lane 10). This effect of M. luteus Rho was not specific to tR1. Similar results were obtained with another E. coli Rho-dependent terminator, tiZ1, an intragenic terminator in the lacZ gene. M. luteus Rho terminated transcription at points earlier than E. coli Rho or E. coli Rho assayed in combination with NusG.2 This ability of M. luteus Rho to give rise to smaller RNA molecules during transcription of the cro template was completely blocked when 200 μM bicyclomycin was present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 4, lane 12), showing that this inhibitor of the ATPase activity of M. luteus Rho also inhibits its termination function. To show that the smaller transcripts were the result of M. luteus Rho action as a transcription termination factor rather than as a ribonuclease, transcripts synthesized in the absence of Rho factor were subsequently incubated with M. luteus Rho (Fig. 4, lane 11). Although a small amount of a 145-nucleotide RNA appeared, the fact that no other RNA molecules appeared that had the same sizes as the products made when M. luteus Rho was present cotranscriptionally rules out the possibility that they were generated by a ribonuclease activity. Because very few of the transcripts were extended to the size of the readthrough RNA when M. luteus Rho was present during transcription, the overall efficiency of termination within the transcribed fragment was nearly 100% Two lines of evidence suggest that the 145-nucleotide RNA arose as a result of a contamination of M. luteus Rho with a ribonuclease. First, the extent of appearance of the 145-nucleotide RNA was higher with other, less pure preparations of the M. luteus factor (data not shown). Second, it also appeared when the function of M. luteus Rho was inhibited by bicyclomycin (Fig. 4, lanes 12 and 13). A comparison of the distribution of transcripts in reaction mixtures lacking Rho that had been quenched at 2, 5, and 8 s after initiation (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3) with the distribution of the terminated transcripts (lanes 9 and 10) indicated that, as with E. coli Rho, the preferred positions for termination stop points were at the positions where RNA polymerase naturally pauses. However, with M. luteus Rho, the termination occurred at pause sites that were farther upstream than the pause sites that were used as the termination points by E. coli Rho. We have isolated a transcription termination factor from M. luteus that is phylogenetically related to transcription termination factor Rho from E. coli. Although rho homologs have been identified from several different phylogenetic branches of bacteria(4Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tilly K. Campbell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Pinkham J.L. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3531-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Quirk P.G. Dunkley E.A. Lee P. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 647-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Miloso M. Limauro D. Alifano P. Rivellini F. Lavitola A. Gulletta E. Bruni C.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 8030-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration that an organism that is distantly related to E. coli actually expresses its rho homolog gene. Although M. luteus Rho is similar to E. coli Rho in having a broad NTP substrate specificity, in its turnover number with poly(C) as a cofactor, and in its sensitivity to inhibition with bicyclomycin, it differs in having a less stringent RNA cofactor specificity and in its specificity of termination during transcription of a coliphage gene with E. coli RNA polymerase. We have also found that M. luteus Rho differs from E. coli Rho in containing an extended insertion of very unusual sequence and likely structure within its RNA-binding domain. M. luteus belongs to the phylogenetic branch called the high G + C Gram-positive group. The G + C content of its DNA is ∼74%(5Ohama T. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, the G + C content of E. coli DNA is only 50%. In its function, the Rho factor of E. coli acts by binding to the nascent transcript at regions of the RNA called rut (rho utilization site). Although rut sequences lack a consensus(1Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar), they do have certain specific, defining characteristics; they have little base-paired secondary structure (1Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar) and usually have a compositional bias that is high in C residues and low in G residues(29Alifano P. Rivellini F. Limauro D. Bruni C.B. Carlomagno M.S. Cell. 1991; 64: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because of their high G + C content, the RNA molecules in M. luteus are likely to have more extensive base pairing than the RNA molecules in E. coli. Thus, M. luteus Rho has likely been adapted to use a rut site that has more extensive base pairing than is typical for a rut site in E. coli. Evidence in support of this hypothesis is our finding that M. luteus Rho caused termination of transcription at a site located well before the rut site used by E. coli Rho on the λ cro gene template. The RNA encoded by the upstream region of λ cro forms extended base-paired secondary structures (30Faus I. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), thus making it unavailable as a rut site for E. coli Rho. This interpretation is supported by the finding that E. coli Rho will cause termination at upstream sites when transcription is performed with ITP in place of GTP because the resulting inosine-substituted RNA has less stable base-paired secondary structure than the normal cro transcript(31Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8664-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M. luteus Rho, in contrast, was able to use these segments in the first 100 nucleotides of a normal, guanosine-containing cro transcript as its rut site to cause termination. An exceptionally unusual feature of M. luteus Rho is the amino acid composition of the insert in the RNA-binding domain between the two phylogenetically conserved sequence segments that are found in the RNA-binding domain of all the known Rho sequences. In M. luteus Rho, this insert is between Ile48 and Gly312 (Fig. 5). In Rho factors from most organisms, these two phylogenetically conserved landmark residues are usually separated by 14 amino acids with very little phylogenetic conservation. With its insert, M. luteus Rho has 263 residues instead of 14 in this putative loop region. The first part of the insertion sequence is rich in Ala residues, while the C-terminal part is rich in Arg, Asp, Gly, and Asn residues. Also, in a stretch of 238 residues, there are no amino acids with a hydrophobic side chain (excluding Pro and Ala residues). Since patterns of polar and nonpolar residues are important in the formation of ordered β-stranded and α-helical secondary structures (32Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2152-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and since hydrophobic residues have a major role in the formation of ordered tertiary structures for globular domains(33Kauzmann W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (4063) Google Scholar), we predict that this very hydrophilic segment of the protein will be randomly coiled, lacking a defined secondary structure. Indeed, when the insert sequence was analyzed for secondary structure (PHDsec Secondary Structure Prediction Program, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany)(34Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar, 35Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), ∼80% was predicted to exist as a loop. However, this segment has approximately an equal number of positively and negatively charged residues and might form an unprecedented, ordered structure consisting of many salt bridges. The sequences of two other rho genes from this same group of organisms have recently become available: the genes from Streptomyces lividans 3C. Ingham and I. Hunter, personal communication. and Mycobacterium leprae (GenBank™ accession number U15186). The open reading frames of these genes predict Rho proteins with 706 and 610 residues, respectively. With both, the major part of the additional residues over the ∼420 that are typical of Rho homologs from other phylogenetic groups start after Ile72 in S. lividans Rho and after Ile73 in M. leprae Rho and end before Gly336 and Gly236, respectively. Thus, S. lividans Rho has 263 and M. leprae Rho has 162 residues between these landmark residues. Like M. luteus Rho, S. lividans Rho has a major part that is very rich in Arg, Asp, Gly, and Glu residues, but is different in having many Gln residues instead of many Asn residues. The M. leprae sequence is also rich in polar residues. Like the M. luteus Rho insert, these sequences are very deficient in hydrophobic residues. These observations suggest that the presence of a polar, random-coiled structure insert is a conserved feature of the Rho proteins in these organisms that have a very high G + C content. However, in spite of the similar features, the three known Rho RNA-binding domain insertion sequences did not reveal any obvious phylogenetic relatedness. It will be of great interest to learn how the presence of a structurally unordered subdomain can help these Rho factors contend with their nascent transcripts to cause termination. M. luteus Rho also contains another smaller insertion sequence that runs from Lys364 to Gln375 (Fig. 5; see (5Ohama T. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). It is between two phylogenetically conserved residues in the RNA-binding domain corresponding to Glu108 and Arg109 in E. coli Rho. The S. lividans and M. leprae Rho homologs have insertions of three and six amino acids in that position, respectively. Like the large upstream insertion sequence, these lack amino acids with hydrophobic side chains.

INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, a large body of data has been gathered regarding the mechanisms that operate to control the expression of eucaryotic genes in specific tissues and cell types. One such tissue that has received a lot of attention is the liver. Work in many laboratories studying liver-specific gene expression has revealed that a relatively small number of hepatic transcription factors, acting cooperatively with other ubiquitous transcription factors or synergistically with each other influence transcription of many hepatic-specific genes in cultured cell lines and also in transgenic animals(1Xantopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell.

Many key liver-specific transcription factors have been identified and their mode of binding and influencing transcription has been characterized for some genes.

Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is encoded by a single-copy gene in the human genome that extends over 48 kilobases and is transcribed mainly in the liver and intestine(10Blackhart B.D. Ludwig E.M. Pierotti V.R. Caiati L. Onasch M.A. Wallis S.C. Powell L. Pease R. Knott T.J. Chu M.-L. Mahley R.W. Scott J. McCarthy B.J. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15364-15367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work in our laboratory and in others has defined the cis-acting DNA sequences and the trans-acting protein factors involved in the transcriptional control of the apoB gene in hepatic cells. For example, the hepatic-specific control elements are found in the proximal promoter region between −260 and +1(11Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), include binding sites for C/EBP, HNF-3, and HNF-4, and appear sufficient for promoter activity in cultured hepatic cell lines, such as HepG2 cells. Transcription from the apoB promoter in vivo in the liver of transgenic mice requires an enhancer from the second intron of the gene (12Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Taylor S. Simonet W.S. Taylor J.M. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2243-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that functions by a mechanism involving synergistic action of three hepatic-enriched transcription factors, namely HNF-1, C/EBP, and protein II(13Brooks A.R. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1134-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In contrast, very little is known about the DNA sequence elements of the human apoB gene and of the transcription factors that modulate transcription of this gene in intestinal cells. Studies by us and others using cultured colon carcinoma (CaCo-2) cells revealed that 139 base pairs of upstream sequence are sufficient for strong activity of the apoB promoter in these cells. Nevertheless, constructs containing this portion of the apoB promoter linked to a reporter gene fail to be expressed in the intestines of transgenic mice. 2B. Levy-Wilson, unpublished observation. Indeed, even larger constructs, encompassing several kilobases of 5′ and 3′ apoB DNA sequences that are expressed at high levels in the liver, fail to be transcribed in the intestines of transgenic mice (for review, see (4Levy-Wilson B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) making the search for the intestinal control elements of the human apoB gene an interesting challenge.Recent studies by Traber et al. (14Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with the sucrose isomaltase (SI) gene, that is transcribed exclusively in intestinal cells, revealed that two regulatory sequences in the proximal promoter region played an important functional role in transcriptional activation of the SI gene in CaCo-2 cells. These two sequences were designated SIF-1 and SIF-3(14Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Further work demonstrated that the SIF-1-binding protein is a member of the caudal family of homeodomain proteins and is equivalent to mouse mCdx-2(15Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Additionally, SIF-3 was shown to bind HNF-1(15Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).In our quest to identify the apoB sequence elements required for its expression in intestinal cells, we compared DNA sequences of regulatory segments of the human apoB gene and the binding sites for SIF-1 and SIF-3. To our surprise, we identified two sequences within the third intron of the human apoB gene exhibiting high homology to SIF-1 and SIF-3, and we designated them BSIF-1 and BSIF-3. We then examined the functional properties of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 in apoB promoter activity as well as the binding of tissue-specific transcription factors to those sequences. Our results revealed that BSF-1 and BSIF-3 repress promoter activity in intestine-derived CaCo-2 cells. Furthermore, BSIF-1, like SIF-1, binds to members of the caudal family of homeodomain proteins. On the other hand, BSIF-3, like SIF-3, binds HNF-1. Both sequences from the apoB third intron repress rather than stimulate promoter activity in intestine-derived CaCo-2 cells. Repression by BSIF-3 appears to involve an interaction with basal components of the transcriptional machinery. On the other hand, repression by BSIF-1 appears to involve an interaction with sequences from −139 to −111 of the apoB promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionConstruction of plasmids, −898 CAT, −139 CAT, −111 CAT, −85 CAT, and TATA-CAT have been described elsewhere(11Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Paulweber B. Sandhoffer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmid C/EBP-TATA-CAT was made by placing six copies of the C/EBP-binding site from the apoB promoter (−53 to −72), into the XbaI site upstream of the TATA fragment in the TATA-CAT vector. The BSIF-1 oligonucleotide corresponds to the segment from 1952 to 1979 of the apoB gene and the BSIF-3 oligonucleotide corresponds to the sequence from 2358 to 2384 of the apoB gene. Double-stranded BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 oligonucleotides were exposed to T4 polynucleotide kinase and then ligated at 14°C for 2 h. These preligated oligonucleotides were inserted into either the XbaI site of the −898 CAT, −139 CAT, −111 CAT, and −85 CAT plasmids to make BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 (−898 CAT, −139 CAT, −111 CAT, and −85 CAT) plasmids, respectively, or into the HindIII site of the −30 CAT and C/EBP-TATA-CAT plasmids. Oligonucleotides −139 to −111 and −111 to −85 were preligated prior to insertion into the XbaI site of the TATA-CAT plasmid. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing by the dideoxy termination method using Sequenase.Tissue Culture and Transient Expression AssaysHuman hepatoma cells (HepG2) and colon carcinoma CaCo-2 cells were grown as described previously(17Brooks A.R.

(22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar).

For preparation of whole cell extracts from COS cells, cells were transfected with 20 μg of expression plasmids for mCdx-2, mCdx-4, or HNF-1α using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique as described previously(13Brooks A.R.

There is a high degree of sequence similarity between the sequences from the sucrose isomaltase promoter and those in the apoB third intron. BSIF-1 is identical at 16 out of 24 base pairs (67% identity) with human SIF-1, while BSIF-3 is identical at 13 out of 19 base pairs (68% identity) with human SIF-3. Because SIF-1 and SIF-3 can specifically activate the sucrose isomaltase promoter in intestinal cells, we asked whether the homologous sequences BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 from the apoB third intron may activate the apoB promoter in intestine-derived CaCo-2 cells.To this end, oligonucleotides corresponding to BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 sequences were cloned upstream of a number of apoB promoter-CAT constructs of varying strengths, and the effects of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 sequences upon apoB promoter activity were determined in transient transfection experiments. CaCo-2 cells were used as a model of intestinal-derived cells; HepG2 cells represented hepatic derived cells. A segment containing apoB sequences from −898 to +121 (−898 CAT construct) exhibits promoter activity in transient assays with HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells(11Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this promoter construct, we observed that addition of three copies of BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 upstream of this promoter reduced CAT activity both in CaCo-2 and HepG2 cells by 20-50%, suggesting that a weak negative element may reside in the sequences represented by the BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 oligonucleotides (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Effects of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 upon the activities of various apoB promoter constructs. The left portion of the figure shows the constructs used in the transfection experiments. The constructs were made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The thick arrow represents the BSIF-1 oligonucleotide and the thin arrow represents the BSIF-3 oligonucleotide. The direction of the arrow depicts the orientation of the oligonucleotide. The table on the right shows the values of CAT activities determined as described in the legend to Fig. 2. For each construct, the data are expressed relative to that of the construct lacking BSIF-1 or BSIF-3, to which we assigned the value of 1.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To define the target for this repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 seen with the entire apoB promoter segment, we cloned the BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 oligonucleotides upstream of shorter apoB promoter-CAT constructs and evaluated the impact of these added sequences upon apoB promoter activity in these cell lines (Fig. 2). We first examined the effects of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 upon the promoter construct extending from −139 to +121 (−139 CAT). This construct displays a strong promoter activity in CaCo-2 cells (8-fold higher than that of the −898 CAT construct) and a similar promoter activity in HepG2 cells as compared to −898 CAT(11Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two series of constructs were analyzed; those incorporating one copy of the BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 oligonucleotides upstream of −139 CAT and those incorporating five copies of these oligonucleotides upstream of −139 CAT. In CaCo-2 cells, a 5-fold repression of the −139 CAT promoter construct was observed when only one copy of either BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 was incorporated upstream of the promoter (Fig. 2), thus suggesting that the BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 oligonucleotides may harbor binding sites for a negative regulator of apoB transcriptional activity. In HepG2 cells, a 2-fold decrease in promoter activity was evident (Fig. 2). When five copies of BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 were present, the reduction in promoter activity was even higher (~12-fold) in CaCo-2 cells, but about the same (~2-fold) in HepG2 cells. These results suggested that BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 exert a powerful negative effect upon apoB transcription in CaCo-2 cells, and a minor (2-fold) negative effect upon apoB promoter activity in HepG2 cells.To more accurately pinpoint the possible target for this strong repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells, three additional promoter-CAT constructs were tested. The first construct, −111 CAT, extends from −111 to +121 and exhibits a weaker promoter activity than −139 CAT in HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells (2-3-fold). The same is true for −85 CAT (−85 to +121 CAT) and TATA-CAT (−30 to +121 CAT) constructs, that are even weaker, respectively, than −111 CAT(11Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 exerted a 2-3 fold negative effect upon the activity of the −111 CAT construct in CaCo-2 cells (Fig. 2). In HepG2 cells, BSIF-1 had a minor negative effect (15%), while BSIF-3 appeared to enhance promoter activity by ~60%. Similarly, with the −85 CAT construct, BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 had a 2-3-fold negative effect in CaCo-2 cells but no significant effect in HepG2 cells. Finally, we tested the effects of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 upon activity of a minimal promoter, extending from −30 to +121 (TATA-CAT). A 2-fold negative effect on this minimal promoter was seen when four copies of BSIF-1 were linked to it, both in CaCo-2 and HepG2 cells. BSIF-3 exhibited a weak positive effect in CaCo-2 cells and a weak negative effect in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2).From the data with the promoter deletion constructs, we conclude that BSIF-1 strongly represses transcription of the strong −139 CAT apoB promoter in CaCo-2 cells (12-fold). Repression by this oligonucleotide appears to be independent of orientation, similar to an enhancer or silencer. There is clearly a target for this repression by BSIF-1 in the apoB promoter (somewhere between −139 and +1). Studies with both the −111 CAT promoter, the −85 promoter and with the −30 CAT promoter showed only a 2-3-fold repression by BSIF-1 in CaCo-2 cells, suggesting that the principal target for repression may not be localized between −111 and −30. The weak, 2-fold repression seen with the −85 CAT construct and the −30 CAT construct may be due either to an interaction of BSIF-1 with sequences from −85 to −1 or to a direct interaction of BSIF-1 with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. The loss in repression (~5-fold) seen with the −111 CAT construct as compared to the −139 CAT construct suggests that a target for repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells may reside between −139 and −111 of the apoB promoter.To address these questions, we prepared a series of constructs designed to shed light upon the mechanism of repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells. First, we asked whether the segment from −139 to −111 contains a target sequence for the repressor. To this end, three copies of an oligonucleotide harboring the sequence from −139 to −111 of the apoB promoter were cloned upstream of the minimal TATA-CAT construct to generate the plasmid (−139/-111) TATA-CAT. Upstream of this construct were cloned three and four copies of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3, respectively (Fig. 3). Transient transfections of these constructs into CaCo-2 cells revealed that BSIF-1 repressed the activity of the (−139/-111) TATA-CAT construct by about 6-fold, similar to that observed with the −139 CAT construct. In contrast, BSIF-3 did not repress, but rather enhanced, activity of the (−139/-111) TATA-CAT construct, suggesting that the mechanism by which BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 influence apoB promoter activity differ. In CaCo-2 cells, the level of repression seen with the −111 CAT construct was similar to that observed with the −85 CAT construct (~2-fold) (Fig. 2), suggesting that sequences between −111 and −85 of the apoB promoter may not be involved in the repression effect. That this is indeed the case is demonstrated in Fig. 3. Three copies of an oligonucleotide representing the sequence from −111/-85 were cloned upstream of TATA-CAT to create the (−111/-85) TATA-CAT construct. BSIF-1 did not repress this promoter, but rather slightly enhanced its activity, as was also the case with BSIF-3; thus establishing that the segment of the apoB promoter from −111 to −85 is not implicated in the repression by BSIF-1.Figure 3:Identification of DNA sequences as possible targets for the repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3. In the left panel are shown various constructs; they all contain the minimal apoB promoter −30 CAT (that is synonymous with TATA-CAT) linked to oligonucleotides representing the segments from −139 to −111; from −111 to −85, and from −53 to −72 of the apoB promoter. Upstream of these constructs, we cloned either the BSIF-1 oligonucleotide (shown as a thick arrow) or the BSIF-3 oligonucleotide (shown as a thin arrow). The tables on the right represent the values of CAT activities. In each case, the value of the construct devoid of BSIF-1 or BSIF-3 sequences was set at 1.0. The data are expressed as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)From the data in Fig. 3, it would appear that most of the repressor effect of BSIF-1 in CaCo-2 cells is attributable to an interaction with the segment from −139 to −111 of the apoB promoter, with a secondary and minor target present between −85 and the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2). A C/EBP-binding site is localized in the sequence from −53 to −72 of the apoB promoter. To eliminate it as a possible target of repression by BSIF-1, a construct containing the −72 to −53 sequence upstream of TATA-CAT was made, and BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 were cloned upstream of this C/EBP-TATA-CAT construct. Transient transfection of these constructs into CaCo-2 cells (Fig. 3) revealed no repression by BSIF-1 and a very minor repression by BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells, thus demonstrating that the C/EBP-binding site situated between −72 and −53 of the apoB promoter plays no role in the repression effect of BSIF-1 in CaCo-2 cells. This result, together with the data in Fig. 2 showing that the repression effect of BSIF-1 upon the −85 CAT and the TATA-CAT constructs is about the same (2-fold), suggests that the minor repression effect seen with these two constructs results from an interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. Therefore, we conclude that BSIF-1 repression of apoB promoter activity in CaCo-2 cells involves two targets, a principal target in the sequence from −139 to −111 and a secondary target in the vicinity of the transcription initiation complex.On the other hand, repression of the apoB promoter by BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells does not appear to involve a single main target but rather to require the full integrity of the −139 CAT promoter for maximal effect. As shown in Fig. 2, in CaCo-2 cells, the −139 CAT construct is repressed 10-fold by BSIF-3, while the −111 CAT construct is repressed only 2-3-fold, as also seen for BSIF-1. Similarly, the level of repression by BSIF-3 remains 2-3-fold upon the −85 CAT construct. In contrast with the results seen with BSIF-1, BSIF-3 exhibits no repressor activity at all when situated upstream of the −139/-111 TATA-CAT construct; thus eliminating this segment (−139 to −111) as a putative BSIF-3 target (Fig. 3). Similarly, the sequence from −111 to −85 is not repressed by BSIF-3. A minor (−30%) repressor effect is imposed by BSIF-3 upon the C/EBP-TATA-CAT construct but no effect of BSIF-3 at all is seen upon TATA-CAT. Therefore, the combined data concerning BSIF-3 in CaCo-2 cells suggests that the entire segment between −139 and −30 of the apoB promoter is required for BSIF-3 to exert its repressive effect.In CaCo-2 Cells, the Repressor Effect of BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 Cannot Be Overcome by the ApoB Second Intron EnhancerThe following experiment was designed to gain insight in the mechanism of repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3. Because the magnitude of the negative effect is maximal upon the −139 CAT promoter construct (Fig. 2), we used this construct to ask whether the strong repression caused by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 is overcome by the presence of the apoB second intron enhancer. The apoB second intron enhancer has been extensively characterized in our laboratory and encompasses a 443-bp fragment(4Levy-Wilson B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), harboring functional binding sites for the transcription factors HNF-1, C/EBP, and protein II(13Brooks A.R. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1134-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In previous experiments of this nature involving a different repressor of apoB transcription, ARP-1, that binds to the 5′ upstream region of the apoB gene, we gathered evidence suggesting that the apoB second intron enhancer may function as do other classical enhancers, i.e. by interacting directly with the basal transcriptional machinery(24Paulweber B. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24161-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we expected that if the repression effect promoted by BSIF-1- and BSIF-3-binding proteins also involved an interaction with the basal transcription complex, competition between the repressor and enhancer for available sites of interaction within the basal transcription complex may ensue. If enhancer and repressor proteins compete for interaction with the transcriptional machinery, and there is preferential occupancy of the machinery by the repressor, the enhancer might not be able to overcome this repression effect. Alternatively, if the mechanism of activity of the repressor does not involve the basal transcription complex, the enhancer should relieve the repression.The 443-bp apoB enhancer was cloned upstream of the −139 CAT construct harboring BSIF-1- and BSIF-3-binding sites. As shown in Fig. 2, BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 decreased the CAT activity of the −139 CAT construct 10-12-fold in CaCo-2 cells. Addition of the enhancer increased the promoter activity of the constructs repressed by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3 only by 2-fold (Fig. 4), thus demonstrating that the enhancer is unable to overcome repression by BSIF-1 and BSIF-3. Based on our hypothesis, this implies that BSIF-1- and BSIF-3-binding proteins must exert their repression by means of a direct or indirect interaction with the basal transcription complex. Our data further suggests that the interaction between BSIF-1- and BSIF-3-binding proteins, their targets, and the basal transcription complex take preference over the interaction o"

Therefore, post-transcriptional control must account for the decoupling of TK mRNA from protein synthesis in G1. To characterize the underlying mechanism, we studied the consequences of TK mRNA abundance on the cell cycle-dependent regulation of TK activity in nontransformed cells.

Low constitutive TK mRNA expression still resulted in a fluctuation of TK activity with a pronounced maximum in S phase. This pattern of cell cycle-dependent TK activity variation reflected the one in primary cells but is caused by post-transcriptional control. Increasing overexpression of TK transcripts after hormonal induction compromised this regulation. At the highest constant mRNA levels, regulation of enzyme activity was totally abolished in each phase of the cell cycle. These data indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of TK is tightly coupled to the amount of mRNA; high concentrations apparently titrate a factor(s) required for repressing TK production during G1 and presumably also G2.

To gain insights into the potential pathophysiological relevance of EPR-1-factor Xa interaction in hemostasis and vascular cell signal transduction, we sought to identify the structural requirements implicated in receptor-ligand recognition. Using a eukaryotic expression strategy of EPR-1 chimeric constructs combined with site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptidyl mimicry, we have identified two spatially distinct regions in the EPR-1 extracellular domain separately involved in lymphocyte activation mechanisms or factor Xa binding and prothrombin activation. Three nonoverlapping regions in the EPR-1 extracellular domain were amplified from the full-length EPR-1 cDNA sequence (6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The NH2-terminal domain, designated G2, contained the EPR-1 sequence Met1-Arg60. A second region, designated A1, encompassed residues Pro120-Ala154. A third region at the COOH terminus end of the EPR-1 extracellular domain, designated G3, comprised residues Ala157-Glu221. The following EPR-1-derived oligonucleotides were used for amplification experiments: F1 (coding sequence, bp 1-18), 5′CCATGCCATGGAATGACCTCCAGAGGTTTC-3′; R1 (bp 180-163), 5′-CTC CAGGCGCCGGTCTGTCACGTTCTCCAC-3′; F2 (bp 357-372), 5′-CCATGCCAT GGACCTCACTTCTCACCTGG-3′; R2 (bp 462-448), 5′-CTCCAGGCGCCGGAGC GGGTGCTGCTGG-3′; F3 (bp 469-483), 5′-CATCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCACCT CTGG-3′; and R3 (bp 663-647), 5′-CGTTGGGCGCCGGCTCGATGGATTGAGGCC-3′. Each oligonucleotide contained a 5′-end restriction site (underlined), NcoI (forward primer, F) or NarI (reverse primer, R), to allow directional insertion of the amplified EPR-1 PCR products into the cDNA of ICAM-1(15Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), used as an unrelated frame to generate the chimeric constructs. A topographical representation of the EPR-1-ICAM-1 chimeras is schematically shown in Fig. 1A. PCR amplification was carried out as described(13Altieri D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures containing 200 ng of the full-length EPR-1 cDNA were subjected to amplification in a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermocycler with denaturation at 94°C, annealing at 50°C, and extension at 72°C for 1 min each in the presence of 0.5 μg/reaction of the indicated oligonucleotides and 1 unit of VentR DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). A full-length ICAM-1 cDNA clone (15Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B.

Fused cDNA constructs were sequenced through the chimeric region by the dideoxy chain termination reaction method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and found to be mutation-free. In some experiments, the constructs were in vitro translated by TNTTM coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN). Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide linear gel and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film and intensifying screens. Finally, chimeric constructs were directionally subcloned in the HindIII/XbaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for transfection experiments. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the A1 chimera cDNA was carried out using the Altered Site II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The single-strand A1 chimera cDNA in pAlter vector (Promega) was annealed with the following EPR-1-derived synthetic oligonucleotides carrying a single base substitution (underlined): 5′-CACCTGGTATGCCCGGGAA-3′ (Lys126 ⤒ Met), 5′-GTAAGCCCGCGAATCAAAA-3′ (Gly128 ⤒ Ala), 5′-AGCCCGGGAGTCAAAACAG-3′ (Asn129 ⤒ Ser), 5′-GGAATCAAATCAGCAAAAA-3′ (Asn131 ⤒ Ile), 5′-CAAAACAGCATAAATGAGCC-3′ (Lys133 ⤒ Ile), and 5′-AACAGCAAAAGTGAGCCCCC-3′ (Asn134 ⤒ Ser).

Phenotypical characterization of the various transfectants was carried out by flow cytometry as described(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected CHO cells were detached by treatment with 2 mM EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; and incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-ICAM-1 mAb 6E6 (16Languino L.R. Duperray A. Joganic K.J. Fornaro M. Thornton G.B. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or anti-EPR-1 mAb 2E1 (6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 9D4 (12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) or with a 1:50 ascites dilution of mAb B61 for 30 min at 4°C. Characterization of mAb B6 recognition of EPR-1 on vascular endothelium and its ability to block binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells will be reported elsewhere in detail.1 After washes, cells were stained with a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (BioSource, International, Camarillo, TX), washed, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton-Dickinson FACSort. The experimental procedures for the preparation and characterization of activated factor X (factor Xa) from human plasma have been described previously in detail(17Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2969-2972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of human factor Xa purchased from Calbiochem or from Hematologic Technologies (Burlington, VT) gave indistinguishable results in binding assays and thrombin generation experiments. Human prothrombin was purchased from Calbiochem. Factor Xa was iodinated by the IODO-GEN method to a specific activity of 0.5-1 μCi/μg of protein, with separation of free from protein-incorporated radioactivity by gel filtration on a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with collection of 0.5-ml fractions. For binding studies, CHO cells transfected with full-length EPR-1 cDNA(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), control vector pcDNA3 alone, or EPR-1-ICAM-1 chimera A1 or G3 were detached by treatment with EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, washed, diluted to 3 × 106/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Inc.) tissue culture medium, and further incubated (0.2 ml) with increasing concentrations of 125I-factor Xa (0.2-2 μg/ml) in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl2 for 15 min at 22°C. At the end of each incubation, free from cell-bound radioactivity was separated by centrifugation of aliquots of each reaction through a mixture of silicone oil (Dow Corning, New Bedford, MA) at 14,000 × g for 5 min with determination of cell-associated radioactivity in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa added at the start of the incubation and was subtracted from the total binding to calculate net specific binding, as described(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar binding experiments were carried out with CHO cells transfected with wild-type or six different single-residue mutagenized A1 constructs. For prothrombin activation studies, wild-type CHO cells or CHO cells transfected with full-length EPR-1 cDNA or the A1 or G3 chimera were seeded in 48-well plates at 4 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to the experiment. Cells were incubated in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) in the presence of increasing concentrations of factor Xa (0.1-1 μg/ml), 1.25 mM CaCl2, and 20 μg/ml prothrombin for 5 min at 22°C. Thrombin generated under the various conditions tested was quantitated at 22°C immediately after addition of a 50 μg/ml concentration of the thrombin-sensitive chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) by absorbance at a 405-nm wavelength on a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Background hydrolysis of S-2238 in the presence of factor Xa alone (8-14%) was subtracted from the absorbance determined under the various experimental conditions tested. Absorbance units were converted to units of thrombin/milliliter using a standard curve constructed with 2-fold serial increasing concentrations of bovine thrombin (Calbiochem) from 0.015 to 2 units/ml. The A1 sequence in EPR-1 (Pro120-Ala154) was duplicated by two partially overlapping synthetic peptides, AG1 (S123PGKPGNQNSKNEPP137) and AG2 (P136PKKRERERSSHCYP150). Authenticity and purity of the EPR-1 peptides were confirmed by amino acid composition and mass spectrometry. For peptide competition experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluency for 2-4 days prior to the assay. Two μg/ml factor Xa was separately preincubated with increasing concentrations (0.1-25 μM) of peptide AG1 or AG2 for 5 min at 22°C before addition to HUVEC monolayers and determination of prothrombin activation by S-2238 hydrolysis as described above. Functional characterization of EPR-1 expression on HUVEC by immunoblotting, Northern hybridization, and factor V/Va-independent binding of 125I-factor Xa will be reported elsewhere in detail.1 Three spatially separate and nonoverlapping regions of the EPR-1 extracellular domain (G2, Met1-Arg60; A1, Pro120-Ala154; and G3, Ala157-Glu221) were engineered in the frame of ICAM-1 as schematically represented in Fig. 1A. Although disruptive of the architecture of the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains of ICAM-1(15Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), insertion of the EPR-1 segments did not affect the epitope(s) recognized by the recently generated anti-ICAM-1 mAb 6E6(16Languino L.R. Duperray A. Joganic K.J. Fornaro M. Thornton G.B. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Flow cytofluorometric staining of the various EPR-1 transfectants with mAb 6E6 was carried out before each experiment and demonstrated that all the chimeric constructs used in this study were expressed at comparable levels on CHO cells. In vitro translation of the EPR-1-ICAM-1 chimeric constructs G2, A1, and G3 originated three polypeptides with the expected molecular sizes of ∼55.5, 45, and 56 kDa, respectively, thus confirming the existence of a continuous open reading frame throughout the ICAM-1 cDNA frame and the EPR-1 insertion (Fig. 1B). The epitope(s) recognized by two classes of anti-EPR-1 mAbs exhibiting different functional activities on lymphocyte activation 3M. A. Duchosal, A. L. Rothermel, P. McConahey, F. J. Dixon, and D. C. Altieri, submitted for publication. or vascular cell binding of factor Xa and prothrombin activation (12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) 1 were characterized in flow cytofluorometric experiments. Transfection of full-length wild-type ICAM-1 cDNA in CHO cells was associated with surface expression of a recombinant molecule genuinely recognized by anti-ICAM-1 mAb 6E6 (Fig. 2), in agreement with previous observations(16Languino L.R. Duperray A. Joganic K.J. Fornaro M. Thornton G.B. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, transient expression of the G2 chimera, containing the EPR-1 sequence Met1-Arg60, was associated with strong reactivity of the second generation anti-EPR-1 mAb 2E1 (6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with transfected cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, A1 chimeric transfectants expressing the EPR-1 sequence Pro120-Ala154 specifically bound the first generation of functionally inhibitory mAb 9D4(12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar, 17Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2969-2972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or B6 (Fig. 2).1 Confirming the specificity of the observed recognition, A1 or G3 transfectants failed to react with mAb 2E1, and, conversely, no reactivity of mAb B6 or 9D4 with G2 or G3 transfectants was observed under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Differences in fluorescence intensity in mAb binding presumably reflected a lower affinity for EPR-1 recognition of the first generation of cross-reacting mAb 9D4 or B6 (12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) as compared with that of mAb 2E1(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells transfected with wild-type EPR-1 cDNA bound 125I-factor Xa in a reaction specifically inhibited by a molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa and approaching saturation when 68 ± 5 ng/ml factor Xa was specifically associated with the cell surface (Fig. 3), in agreement with previous observations(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, wild-type CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone did not specifically bind 125I-factor Xa (Fig. 3). Under these experimental conditions, CHO cells expressing EPR-1 residues Pro120-Arg154 in the context of the A1 chimera specifically and saturably bound 125I-factor Xa in a reaction quantitatively indistinguishable from the binding isotherm observed with wild-type EPR-1 transfectants (Fig. 3) and completed with maximal specific association of 74 ± 13 ng/ml 125I-factor Xa with the cell surface (Fig. 3). In contrast, CHO cells expressing comparable levels of the G3 chimera, comprising EPR-1 residues Ala157-Glu221, did not specifically bind 125I-factor Xa under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3). The role of chimeric EPR-1 sequences in thrombin formation was investigated. In agreement with previous observations(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type EPR-1 transfectants promoted prothrombin activation in a factor Xa concentration-dependent manner, with the generation of ∼0.55 ± 0.06 units of thrombin/ml for saturating concentrations of factor Xa of 1 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Consistent with their inability to bind 125I-factor Xa (Fig. 3), control CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone did not significantly promote prothrombin activation at comparable concentrations of factor Xa added (Fig. 4). Under these experimental conditions, A1 chimeric transfectants generated increasing amounts of thrombin in a factor Xa concentration-dependent reaction quantitatively indistinguishable from the response observed with wild-type EPR-1 transfectants (Fig. 4). In contrast, G3 transfectants did not generate thrombin under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). Molecular dissection of the A1 sequence and assignment of critical residues implicated in factor Xa recognition were carried out in site-directed mutagenesis experiments. CHO transfectants expressing six variant forms of the A1 chimera carrying the following point mutations, Lys126 ⤒ Met, Gly128 ⤒ Ala, Asn129 ⤒ Ser, Asn131 ⤒ Ile, Lys133 ⤒ Ile, and Asn134 ⤒ Ser, were separately tested for their ability to bind 125I-factor Xa. Mutagenesis of Lys126, Gly128, Asn129, or Asn134 in the A1 sequence did not diminish the ability of the transfected cells to specifically bind 125I-factor Xa as compared with wild-type A1 transfectants (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 125I-factor Xa binding to A1 chimeric transfectants carrying an Asn131 ⤒ Ile substitution or a Lys133 ⤒ Ile substitution was decreased by 80 or 96%, respectively (Fig. 5A). Tentative prediction of secondary structure using the Chou-Fasman algorithm suggested that the Lys133 ⤒ Ile mutation, which nearly completely abolished EPR-1-factor Xa interaction (Fig. 5A), caused a profound structural rearrangement of the A1 interacting sequence, with disruption of a discrete reverse turn structure, as compared with the predicted conformation of wild-type EPR-1 (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory Asn131 ⤒ Ile mutation was apparently associated with a less profound structural change in the same reverse turn structure, while none of the other A1 mutations affected the conformation of the EPR-1 ligand-binding domain (data not shown). The potential contribution of EPR-1 sequences in vascular cell thrombin generation was investigated by testing the ability of two partially overlapping synthetic peptides duplicating the EPR-1 sequence Pro120-Ala154 to decrease prothrombin activation on HUVEC monolayers in the absence of exogenous factor V/Va. Preincubation of factor Xa with increasing concentrations of the AG1 peptide containing the amino-terminal A1 sequence S123PGKPGNQNSKNEPP137 completely inhibited prothrombin activation on HUVEC monolayers in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50∼ 1 μM (Fig. 6). Consistent with the crucial role of Asn131 and Lys133 in factor Xa recognition (Fig. 5), comparable concentrations of the AG2 peptide, duplicating the carboxyl-terminal A1 sequence P136PKKRERERSSHCYP150, did not diminish prothrombin activation on HUVEC monolayers under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 6). In this study, we have identified the ligand-binding site and functional epitope requirements of a novel vascular cell receptor for the clotting protease factor Xa, designated EPR-1(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular receptors for coagulation and fibrinolytic proteases have recently emerged as a novel class of modulators of the hemostatic balance as well as potent signal-transducing molecules in vascular and nonvascular cell types. In addition to the pleiotropic cellular functions mediated by thrombin (18Shuman M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and transduced by a G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor(3Coughlin S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), binding of urokinase to its receptor (4Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dan⊘ K. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) has been implicated in the modulation of macrophage gene expression(19Rao N.K. Shi G.-P. Chapman H.A. J. Clin.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of the anticoagulant protein S with the recently characterized Tyro-3 tyrosine kinase receptor (5Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejeski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) has been implicated in signal transduction and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation(5Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejeski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J.

A. 1992; 89: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As a fourth vascular cell protease receptor for factor Xa(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EPR-1 participates in thrombin formation (12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) and generation of intermediate products of factor IX activation (14Worfolk L.A. Robinson R.A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in lymphocyte activation mechanisms(8Altieri D.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The first functional EPR-1 domain identified here comprised the amino-terminal sequence Met1-Arg60 and contained the epitope of the second generation of anti-EPR-1 mAbs, i.e. mAb 2E1(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As judged from the partial overlap between this region and the sequence of a mAb 2E1-immunoreactive cDNA clone isolated from a phage T cell expression library(6Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the minimal epitope recognized by this class of anti-EPR-1 mAbs is predicted to be included between Ala48 and Arg60. Characterized by high hydrophilicity and antigenic index by Kyte-Doolittle analysis, this region is predicted by Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier algorithms to be structurally organized in two reverse turn structures, localized in a highly surface-exposed loop in the molecule. The importance of the mAb 2E1 epitope in EPR-1 is underscored by the profound immunosuppressive properties of this mAb, in vitro and in vivo. In these experiments and consistent with a more general role of EPR-1 and other protease receptors in lymphocyte activation mechanisms(8Altieri D.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), mAb 2E1 completely inhibited lymphocyte proliferation (IC50∼ 0.1 μg/ml), suppressed cytokine release, and blocked immunoglobulin production and B cell lymphomagenesis in a human severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model.3 The identification of this immunoregulatory epitope on EPR-1 may facilitate the rational design of advanced derivatives of mAb 2E1 or of synthetic peptidyl antagonists targeted at manipulating the immune response in vivo. The second functional domain of EPR-1 identified here corresponded to the sequence Pro120-Arg154 and contained a receptor-binding site for factor Xa. As judged by 125I-factor Xa binding parameters of Pro120-Arg154 chimeric transfectants versus wild-type EPR-1 transfectants, most, if not all, of the EPR-1-factor Xa interaction can be recapitulated by this recognition sequence. Consistent with this scheme, Pro120-Arg154 transfectants mediated prothrombin activation in a factor Xa concentration-dependent manner and were recognized by the first generation of anti-EPR-1 mAbs B6 and 9D4, previously characterized for their ability to block factor Xa association with leukocytes (12Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) or endothelium.1 The specificity of this recognition was also independently substantiated by the inability of other expressed extracellular regions in EPR-1, i.e. Ala157-Glu221, to bind factor Xa, to participate in prothrombin activation, or to associate with the functionally inhibitory mAb 9D4 or B6. Molecular dissection of the EPR-1 ligand binding sequence Pro120-Arg154 by single-amino acid mutagenesis identified Asn131 and Lys133 as crucial residues involved in factor Xa recognition. Interestingly, the Lys133 ⤒ Ile substitution, which completely abolished EPR-1-factor Xa interaction, was apparently associated with a profound structural change in this interacting domain, with disruption of a discrete reverse turn structure, as tentatively predicted by the Chou-Fasman algorithm of wild-type versus mutated EPR-1 sequences. Altogether, these data suggest that EPR-1-factor Xa interaction depends on the integrity of a discrete ligand-binding groove. As compared with the recognition of other protease receptors, this model is reminiscent of the ligand binding requirements of the urokinase receptor (23Pöllänen J.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as opposed to the proteolytic pathway of receptor activation mediated by thrombin (3Coughlin S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The identification of the EPR-1 sequence Pro120-Arg154 as a novel cellular binding site for factor Xa may have important pathophysiological implications for vascular cell assembly of proteolytic activity and thrombin formation. Consistent with the expression and function of EPR-1 on endothelium,1 a synthetic peptide duplicating the interacting motif S123PGKPGNQNSKNEPP137 dose-dependently inhibited thrombin formation on these cells in the absence of factor V/Va. That prothrombin activation on HUVEC could not be solely mediated by released factor V/Va (24Rodgers G.M. Shuman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was suggested earlier by the absence of factor V/Va on normal unperturbed endothelium (25Annamalai A.E. Stewart G.J. Hansel B. Memoli M. Chiu H.-C. Manuel D.W. Doshi K. Colman R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 6: 196-202Crossref Google Scholar) and/or by the lack of factor V transcript in these cells(26Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Moreover, cellular receptors for factor Xa, distinct from factor V/Va, were identified on HUVEC (27Rodgers G.M. Shuman M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. Kisiel W. Handley D. Drillings M. Bartos J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1910-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and implicated in ligand processing (29Nawroth P.P. McCarthy D. Kisiel W. Handley D. Stern D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and intracellular signal transduction with release of endothelial cell mitogens(30Gajdusek C. Carbon S. Ross R. Nawroth P. Stern D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data of synthetic peptidyl mimicry reported here suggest that under experimental conditions of unperturbed endothelium (25Annamalai A.E. Stewart G.J. Hansel B. Memoli M. Chiu H.-C. Manuel D.W. Doshi K. Colman R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 6: 196-202Crossref Google Scholar) and in the absence of detectable membrane expression of factor V/Va,1 most of the prothrombin activation potential of these cells may be recapitulated by the EPR-1 recognition of factor Xa and competitively inhibited by antagonists of the Pro120-Arg154 sequence, i.e. the AG1 peptide. This leads to the speculation that, although considerably less catalytically efficient than the prothrombinase complex coordinated by factor V/Va(31Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the EPR-1-factor Xa interaction may function as a low-level thrombin-generating system in the vasculature, thus providing an essential “first signal” for clotting(1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar), thrombomodulin-dependent anticoagulation pathways(32Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), or protease-dependent vascular cell signal transduction pathways. In summary, we have identified two spatially distinct structural domains in the factor Xa receptor (EPR-1) that are separately committed to the dual function of this receptor in the modulation of leukocyte activation (8Altieri D.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and factor Xa assembly on vascular cells. Elucidation of the complementary EPR-1 interacting sequence(s) in factor Xa will provide new insights into the potential pathophysiological role of this pathway in protease-dependent hemostatic and vascular cell signaling processes.

https://openalex.org/W1993203083,"A mutant influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA+8, having a carboxyl-terminal extension of 8 amino acids that included 4 aromatic residues, was internalized within 2 min of arriving at the cell surface and was degraded quickly by a process that was inhibited by ammonium chloride. Through second-site mutagenesis, the internalization sequence of HA+8 was found to closely resemble the internalization signals of the transferrin receptor or large mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Comparison of the intracellular traffic of HA+8 and a series of other HA mutants that differed in their rates of internalization revealed a relation between the amount of the protein on the plasma membrane at steady state and the internalization rate that would be predicted if most of each protein recycled to the cell surface. However, there was no simple correlation between the internalization rate and the rate of degradation, indicating that transport to the compartment where degradation occurred was not simply a function of the concentration of the proteins in early endosomes. The internal populations of both HA+8, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 1.9 h, and HA-Y543, which was degraded with a t1/2 of 2.9 h, were found by cell fractionation and density-shift experiments to reside in early endosomes with little accumulation in lysosomes. A fluid-phase marker reached lysosomes 3-4-fold faster than these proteins were degraded. Degradation of these mutant HAs involved a rate-determining step in early endosomes that was sensitive to some feature of the protein that depended upon sequence differences in the cytoplasmic domain unrelated to the internalization signal.

INTRODUCTIONCells receive nutrients, respond to the extracellular environment, and continually remodel their plasma membranes through the process of endocytosis. The different functions of endocytosis require that internalized proteins and lipids be sorted and delivered to different intracellular destinations. However, with the exception of the initial recognition of some proteins by components of clathrin-coated pits(1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), little is currently known about the mechanism by which various membrane proteins are recognized and sorted in the endocytic pathway. Following internalization, released ligands and fluid rapidly separate from the bulk of endocytosed membrane, most of which returns rapidly to the plasma membrane from which it came(2Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J.

At least initially, this recycling membrane appears in the form of tubules with limited internal volume(5Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Strous G.J.A. Lodish H.F. Schwartz A.L.

Gibson A. Shipman M. Miller K. Nature. 1990; 346: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Sorting of proteins in the fluid phase from membrane bound receptors can be explained by an iterative process of separating recycling membranes, which have a small volume and large surface area, from vesicles traveling farther along the endocytic pathway(3Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the sorting of membrane-bound proteins is more complex, and currently cannot be explained by a single, simple mechanism.The majority of plasma membrane proteins recycle after internalization (9Burgert H. Thilo L. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Raub T.J. Denny J.B. Roberts R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 165: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and mutations that drastically inhibit the internalization of receptors have no effect upon the ability of the mutant proteins to recycle(11McGraw T.E. Pytowski B. Arzt J. Ferrone C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenberger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 14Ward D.M. Ajioka R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8164-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lipids return to the surface at the same rate, suggesting that recycling of membrane proteins to the cell surface is non-selective (4Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It is likely that most plasma membrane proteins are degraded in lysosomes(15Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), an observation most easily explained if transport to lysosomes is also by a nonselective transport pathway. Delivery to lysosomes cannot be completely nonselective, however, since the rates of delivery to lysosomes can differ dramatically among different proteins(16Green S.A. Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which suggests that some proteins are specifically sorted to lysosomes. Thus, the relative contributions early in the endocytic pathway of specific recognition systems and of stochastic events that depend primarily upon protein concentration is currently uncertain, and this is particularly true for our understanding of the delivery of proteins to lysosomes.As an approach to understanding the features by which membrane proteins interact with the cellular sorting machinery in the endocytic pathway, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to construct gain-of-function mutant proteins with altered patterns of intracellular transport. We have introduced changes into a protein, the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), 1The abbreviations used are: HAinfluenza hemagglutininDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEGFepidermal growth factorendo Hendoglycosidase HHRPhorseradish peroxidaseMan-6-P/IGF II receptorthe large mannose 6-phosphate/insulin growth factor II receptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSBTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTftransferrinTfRtransferrin receptorHA wtwild type HA. that is highly mobile in the plasma membrane (17Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but is internalized much slower than the rate of bulk internalization of membrane through coated pits. We have identified a series of mutant HAs that are internalized at very different rates. One, HA-Y543, has a single amino acid change in the cytoplasmic domain 4 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, a substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 543(18Lazarovits J. Roth M. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When expressed in amounts that do not saturate the internalization capacity of CV-1 (19Ktistakis N.T. Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells(20Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), this protein is internalized as rapidly as some well characterized cell surface receptors (21Meittinen H.M. Rose J.K.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have identified several other mutant HAs that are internalized much faster than HA-Y543. One of these, HA+8, is internalized at 50-70%/min and binds essentially irreversibly to coated pits(25Fire E. Gutman O. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21075-21081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HA+8 is present only transiently in the plasma membrane and is degraded rapidly. The amino acid sequence that contributes the internalization signal of HA+8 is quite similar to those of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin growth factor II (Man-6-P/IGF II) receptor and the transferrin receptor, two proteins that are not degraded rapidly. To investigate the possibility that HA+8 contains information specifying rapid degradation, we compared the endocytic transport of HA-Y543, HA+8, and second-site mutants of both proteins. Our observations suggest that the rapid degradation of HA+8 is not primarily determined by its rate of internalization and are consistent with the interpretation that a rate-limiting step in degradation of mutant HAs is a specific recognition event that controls their transfer from early endosomes to later endocytic compartments that are probably lysosomes. Changes in the HA cytoplasmic sequences can influence this event independently of the internalization signal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Recombinant HAsEnzymes from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Life Technologies, Inc., or United States Biochemical Corp. were used according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. The cDNA encoding the A/Japan/305/57 (H2) HA contains a unique recognition site for the enzyme NdeI that overlaps the translational termination codon(26Gething M.-J. Bye J. Skehel J. Waterfield M. Nature. 1980; 287: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This site was digested with NdeI and repaired with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli polymerase and ligated. This introduced a duplication of 2 base pairs that caused a translation frameshift at the termination codon, extending the translational reading frame for 8 codons before the next termination occurred. A SalI to BamHI fragment bearing the HA+8 mutation was subcloned into the pkSVE vector(27Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recombinant SV40 virus stocks were prepared in CV-1 cells as described(28Doyle C. Roth M.G. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence or biochemical experiments, CV-1 cells were infected and incubated at 37°C for 24-36 h depending on the experiment.To truncate the sequence encoding the 8-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension of the HA+8 mutant, the gene encoding HA+8 was subcloned into mp18 and the codon TCA encoding Ser-544 was changed to the termination codon TGA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis(30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). The protein expressed from this mutant HA gene contained 4 additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus and was named HA+4. Second site mutants of HA+8 were made by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis on the same HA+8 template, and are named after the position and amino acid substitution made. Construction of the HA-Y543 mutant and second-site mutants of that protein has been previously reported(18Lazarovits J. Roth M. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type HA is referred to as HA wt. When referred to collectively, HA wt and HA mutants are called HAs.Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence TechniquesCV-1 monkey fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and passages between 22 and 32 were used for experiments. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Serum Plus (Hazleton, Lenexa, KS). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously on cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde at room temperature, and then permeabilized with methanol at −20°C for 3 min. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was used for all assays. In some experiments, cycloheximide was present at 100 μg/ml and chloroquine was added to a final concentration of 100 μM. For experiments in which HAs were co-localized with transferrin receptors (TfR), transferrin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Tf-FITC) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 20 min. Cells were then fixed as above and labeled with anti-HA serum and goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Texas Red. Specimens were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal laser scanning head. The amount of TF-FITC used in these experiments was adjusted so that in the final image there was no detectable signal from FITC in the red channel.Pulse-Chase Experiments and Assays for Folding, Exocytosis, and DegradationAt the appropriate time after infection with recombinant SV40 viruses, CV-1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine. A pulse of radiolabeled protein was initiated by subsequent incubation in the presence of Tran35S-label (ICN, Irvine, CA) and ended by removal of the labeling medium and addition of complete DMEM. For assays of folding and sensitivity to endoglycosidase H (endo H), a 3-min pulse of 1.0 mCi/ml was chased for times from 1 to 60 min and the assays were performed as described previously(32Lazarovits J. Shia S.P. Ktistakis N. Lee M.S. Bird C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4760-4767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the rate of degradation of HA proteins, cells were pulsed for 15 min with 0.6 mCi of Tran35S-label/ml and chased for intervals of 3-7 h in a CO2incubator in DMEM containing 10% Serum Plus. Duplicate samples were processed for each time point. For each sample, the amount of HA present was determined by immunoprecipitation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and phosphorimaging as described(32Lazarovits J. Shia S.P. Ktistakis N. Lee M.S. Bird C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4760-4767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the rate of appearance of HAs at the cell surface, the rate at which HA0 was cleaved into its disulfide-bonded subunits, HA1 and HA2, was measured. Cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with 0.6 mCi of Tran35S-label/ml and chased at 37°C for intervals between 15 and 180 min in serum-free DMEM containing trypsin at 10 μg/ml. After the chase, the medium was removed and residual trypsin was inactivated by addition of 100 μl of Serum Plus containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) at 100 μg/ml. The cells were then lysed and the amount of HAs present was determined as above. To measure the amount of HAs present at the cell surface at steady state, cells were pulse-labeled and chased in DMEM without trypsin for a period long enough for greater than 95% of the radiolabeled protein to have arrived at the cell surface and were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C in DMEM containing trypsin at 100 μg/ml. Inactivation of trypsin, lysis, and immunoprecipitation were as described above.Assay for the Arrival of HA+8 at the Cell SurfaceAn assay was devised to measure the extent of appearance of HA+8 at the cell surface under conditions where trypsin was prevented from entering the cells. Cells were pulse-labeled at 34 h post-infection for 5 min with 1 mCi of Tran35S-label/ml and chased for 20 min at 37°C in DMEM to allow all of the protein to trimerize. The cells were then incubated at 18°C for 2 h, to allow proteins to accumulate in the trans Golgi network. Cells were then shifted to 37°C for 12 min, an interval sufficient for the first proteins leaving the Golgi to arrive at the plasma membrane, and then were placed on ice and treated with medium containing trypsin at 100 μg/ml for 15 min to cleave HA0 at the cell surface into HA1 and HA2. The trypsin solution was removed, and the cells were treated with DMEM containing SBTI at 100 μg/ml at 4°C to inhibit the trypsin. After removal of the SBTI solution, one cell sample was lysed and immunoprecipitated and the amount of HAs that had arrived at the cell surface was determined as described above. DMEM at 37°C was added to the remaining samples, and they were incubated again at 37°C for 5 min, then placed on ice. The samples were treated with medium containing trypsin at 100 μg/ml to cleave the HA0 proteins that had arrived at the cell surface during the 5-min chase into HA1 and HA2. The procedure was repeated for a series of 5-min chases at 37°C conducted in the same manner. For each period of trypsinization, a control sample was not treated again with trypsin or trypsin inhibitor but was allowed to proceed through all subsequent incubations at 4°C and 37°C to demonstrate that trypsin had been completely inhibited by the SBTI treatment between each successive chase. At the end of the series of 37°C chases, the samples were lysed and immunoprecipitated, and the amount of HAs arriving at the cell surface during the experiment was determined by PAGE and densitometry.Internalization AssayAt 36 h after infection, cells were labeled with 0.6 mCi of Tran35S-label/ml for 15 min and chased for 80 min at 37°C. Anti-HA antibody was allowed to bind to HA present on the surface for 1 h on ice. Unbound antibody was removed by five washes in DMEM of 2 min each at 4°C, and cells were incubated in a shallow 37°C water bath for 0-16 min in DMEM containing 3% bicarbonate and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.3. After the chase, the medium was replaced with DMEM at 4°C containing trypsin at 100 μg/ml, to cleave HAs at the cell surface. After 1.5 h, the medium containing trypsin was removed and residual trypsin was inactivated by addition of DMEM containing SBTI at 100 μg/ml. Cells were lysed, and HAs that had initially bound antibodies at the cell surface were recovered by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose. PAGE and densitometry were employed to determine the amount of internalized (uncleaved HA0) present at each time point.Location of HA+8 in Endocytic MembranesCells expressing HA+8 or other HA mutants were labeled with 1-5 mCi/ml Tran35S-label for 15 min and chased for intervals varying from 2.5 to 5 h, depending upon the experiment. For some samples, 100 μg/ml leupeptin was included in the last 2.5 h of chase. To identify early endosomes, in some samples horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml was included in the medium at 37°C for 5 min. Cells were chilled on ice and homogenized with a stainless steel homogenizer and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant from the sample was mixed with a Percoll solution (final concentrations 17% Percoll, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) layered over a 2.5 M sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h. Gradients were collected as fractions from the top with a Buchler Auto Densi-flow IIC. Fractions were split and assayed for HRP activity (34Miettinen H.M. Matter K. Hunziker W. Rose J.K. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity(35Robbins A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1911-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the HA present was precipitated and quantified by PAGE and phosphorimaging.RESULTSHA+8, Containing 8 Additional Amino Acids at the Carboxyl Terminus, Exhibits Altered Intracellular TransportIn the course of investigating the effects of introducing tyrosines into the carboxyl terminus of HA, we noticed that a unique NdeI restriction endonuclease recognition site at the HA termination codon provided us with a simple method of changing the HA translational reading frame to extend the coding region for an additional 8 carboxyl-terminal amino acids with the sequence YDYKSFYN (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This sequence resembles closely the internalization signals identified for the Man-6-P/IGF II receptor and the transferrin receptor (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Two independently derived mutant HA genes containing this frameshift were isolated, and the proteins they encoded were expressed from recombinant SV40 virus vectors in CV-1 cells. These proteins proved to behave identically in all assays, excluding the possibility that an undetected second-site mutation could be responsible for the observations described in this report. Results with each isolate have been combined, and the proteins are referred to collectively as HA+8.Routine examination by immunofluorescence microscopy of CV-1 monkey fibroblasts infected for 24 h with a recombinant SV40 virus expressing HA+8 indicated that the changes in the HA+8 cytoplasmic domain had a profound effect on the steady-state distribution of the protein. Very little HA+8 was observed on the cell surface, with considerable punctate labeling of small vesicles (data not shown). After longer periods of infection when protein expression levels had risen dramatically, a significant amount of HA+8 was detected on the cell surface, an expression pattern similar to that observed for lysosomal membrane proteins expressed from recombinant vectors(36Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine if the vesicles containing HA+8 were derived from the endocytic pathway, cells expressing HA+8 or a second mutant HA that we have previously characterized, HA-Y543, were treated with cycloheximide for 2 or 6 h to allow the proteins to leave the exocytic pathway and then the cells were prepared for immunofluorescence (Fig. 1a). HA-Y543 has an internalization signal and undergoes internalization and recycling, with 60-80% of the protein at the cell surface and 20-40% internal at steady-state(18Lazarovits J. Roth M. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Ktistakis N.T. Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, HA-Y543 was present both at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and this pattern of location did not change during the 6-h treatment with cycloheximide, although the amount of HA-Y543 detected was observed to decrease (Fig. 1a, panel B). In contrast, HA+8 exhibited very little surface labeling after 2 h of treatment with cycloheximide, but was present in vesicles located throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a, panel C). After 6 h in cycloheximide, this pattern had changed. Significantly less HA+8 was detected and most of the protein was located in vesicles close to the nucleus (Fig. 1a, panel D). The loss of HA+8 from the cells was inhibited when 100 μM chloroquine was included in the medium during the final 3 h of the 6-h treatment with cycloheximide (data not shown). Clearly, HA+8 was either failing to reach the plasma membrane or was being efficiently removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis, and appeared to be degraded faster than HA-Y543 by a process sensitive to chloroquine.To determine if the punctate staining of cells expressing HA+8 indicated that the protein mainly localized to endocytic vesicles, cells expressing either HA+8 or HA-Y543 were treated with cycloheximide for 2 or 6 h, and for the final 20 min of treatment with the drug, Tf-FITC was included in the medium to label cellular compartments containing the TfR (Fig. 1b, panels A, C, E, and G). The cells were then fixed, and the HA proteins were localized with anti-HA antibody and a second antibody conjugated to Texas Red (panels B, D, F, and H). In Fig. 1b, paired images collected with FITC fluorescence to locate transferrin bound to its receptor (panels A, C, E, and G) and Texas Red fluorescence to locate HAs in the same cell (panels B, D, F, and H) are shown. After 2 h of drug treatment, there was extensive co-localization of both HA mutant proteins and the TfR. After 6 h in cycloheximide, HA-Y543 (panel D) continued to share compartments labeled with Tf-FITC (panel C), but many cells expressing HA+8 showed essentially no co-localization, as shown in panels G (TfR) and H (HA+8). In other cells there was some co-localization (data not shown), but much less than seen after 2 h of cycloheximide treatment. A simple interpretation of these results is that in the first hours after its synthesis, HA+8 resided in early endosomes that were in contact with recycling TfR. After several hours HA+8 moved to other compartments not occupied by the TfR, and was degraded.HA+8 Is a Properly Folded Trimeric HAThe results of these immunofluorescence experiments were consistent with two possibilities; either HA+8 was quantitatively transported to the cell surface and very rapidly internalized into early endosomes containing TfR, or only a portion of HA+8 ever reached the cell surface and the rest traveled by an intracellular route to early endosomes. Ultimately HA+8 moved out of endosomes to acidic, degradative organelles that are probably lysosomes. To determine the intracellular route of HA+8 transport and also whether the additional sequences of the HA+8 cytoplasmic domain had influenced folding of the protein in some way that made it unstable, we investigated HA+8 biosynthesis by pulse-chase protocols. The rate of folding of HA+8 into protease-resistant trimers was measured by two previously published assays (32Lazarovits J. Shia S.P. Ktistakis N. Lee M.S. Bird C. Roth M.G. J. Biol.

Although published studies show that GabP is relatively specific, recognizing the common α-amino acids with low affinity, recent work from this laboratory indicates that a number of synthetic compounds are high affinity transport inhibitors (50% inhibition at 5-100 μM). Here we present evidence that many of these structurally heterogeneous compounds not only inhibit transport but also function as alternative GabP substrates (i.e. a set of observations inconsistent with the idea that the core of the GabP transport channel exhibits rigid structural specificity for the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate). Transport of 4-aminobutyrate into Escherichia coli is catalyzed by gab permease (GabP). Although published studies show that GabP is relatively specific, recognizing the common α-amino acids with low affinity, recent work from this laboratory indicates that a number of synthetic compounds are high affinity transport inhibitors (50% inhibition at 5-100 μM). Here we present evidence that many of these structurally heterogeneous compounds not only inhibit transport but also function as alternative GabP substrates (i.e. a set of observations inconsistent with the idea that the core of the GabP transport channel exhibits rigid structural specificity for the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate). The gab gene cluster is required for metabolism of 4-aminobutyrate in Escherichia coli. The cluster consists of a regulatory gene, gabC, two structural genes (gabD and gabT) encoding the metabolic enzymes, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and glutamate:succinic semialdehyde transaminase, and a third structural gene (gabP), encoding the 4-aminobutyrate transporter (gab permease or GabP). The GabP is a hydrophobic, 466-residue polypeptide (7Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that is readily modeled as a transmembrane protein consisting of 12 transmembrane α-helical segments. The permease is active in whole cells as well as in rightside-out vesicles (3Kahane S. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and uptake of 4-aminobutyrate is stimulated by membrane potential and abolished by proton ionophores(7Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that a number of synthetic compounds are potent GabP inhibitors(8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5381-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An unanswered question is whether any of these inhibitors might in fact be transported substrates of GabP. Here, we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that GabP transports at least nine different substrate analogs. It is shown directly with radiolabeled compounds that two bulky and structurally distinct heterocyclic molecules are efficiently transported by the 4-aminobutyrate transporter expressed under control of a lac promoter. Transport of 3-piperidine carboxylic acid or 3-hydroxy-5-aminomethylisoxazole was dependent upon either the presence of plasmid-borne gabP or upon induction of gene expression with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Transport of either novel substrate was inhibited by the native substrate (4-aminobutyrate) over a range of concentrations consistent with the transport Km. Transport of several other inhibitors (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethylisoxazole, 4-amino-cis-2-butenoic acid, 3-piperidine carboxylic acid, cis-3-aminocyclohexyl carboxylic acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid, 3-aminopropanoic acid, 3-aminobutenoic acid) could not be demonstrated directly since these were unavailable in radiolabeled form. However, the above named compounds exhibited behavior consistent with the hypothesis that they can serve as counterflow substrates of the 4-aminobutyrate transporter (i.e. under appropriate conditions GabP can translocate these compounds across the membrane). Among the inhibitors tested, GabP exhibited some preference for translocation of compounds that mimic a nonextended conformation of 4-aminobutyrate (modeled by 4-amino-cis-butenoic acid) over those that mimic the extended conformation (modeled by 4-amino-trans-butenoic acid). Regardless, the data indicate that the GabP transport channel can recognize and/or translocate a far more diverse range of chemical structures than previously imagined. It may be possible to exploit this diversity to develop both genetic and biochemical approaches aimed at identifying amino acid residues that affect ligand recognition and translocation.

LB medium (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 1% NaCl) supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml) was used to grow the Escherichia coli strains SK45 and SK55 for use in experiments with cloned gabP. Cells grown overnight (16 h) were diluted 100-fold into fresh medium (approximately Klett 10) containing 1 mM IPTG to induce high level gabP expression. Cells were grown for three to four doublings (Klett 130-150 with number 42 blue filter). [3H]GABA or [3H]nipecotic acid transport was studied under conditions in which gabP was expressed from the lac-inducible plasmid, pSCK-472A, contained in E. coli strain SK55. Log phase cells were processed by washing twice with 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The cell pellet was resuspended in this buffer using 25-50% of the original culture volume such that the protein concentration was 1-2 mg/ml; such cells are referred to hereafter as “washed cells.” Transport reactions were initiated by adding 80 μl of washed cells with rapid vortex mixing to 20 μl of solution containing the radiolabeled substrate and other additions (conditions indicated in the figure legends). A metronome was used to reproducibly time short uptake reactions (2-20 s). Uptake was rapidly quenched by adding 1 ml of a “stop solution” (buffer containing 20 mM HgCl2) to the rapidly mixing reaction vessel. The “quenched” reaction was vacuum-filtered. The reaction vessel was then washed with 1 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mM HgCl2, and this was applied to the same filter. Finally, the filter was washed with 4 ml of buffer containing 5 mM HgCl2. The filter was dissolved in scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity (disintegrations per minute) was calculated by a Beckman LS3801 scintillation spectrometer using stored quench curves and automatic quench compensation (H number determination). Cytoplasmic water was taken as the difference between the total aqueous space, measured with [3H]H2O, and the non-cytoplasmic [14C]taurine space(1Heller K.B. Wilson T.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 253-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 2Wilson D.M. Putzrath R.M. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were separated from the bulk aqueous medium by centrifugation through a silicone oil mixture, which was empirically adjusted to an appropriate specific gravity (i.e. we mixed 7 parts 550 fluid with 3 parts 510 fluid, and after phase separation the dense fraction was harvested and used in the experiments). Disintegrations per minute for each isotope were calculated as described above. Cells utilized in this study contained about 5 μl of cytoplasmic water/mg of protein, such that the typical data point represents about 0.5-1.0 μl of cytoplasmic water and 0.1-0.2 mg of protein. The above measured values are roughly equivalent to 0.6-1.2 mg of cells (wet weight). Twice washed (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) cells (approximately 2000 Klett × ml or 3 mg of protein) were resuspended at room temperature in 5 ml of the same buffer containing 30 mM sodium azide. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the cells were centrifuged at 4°C and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer having either the same composition as the supernatant or with this buffer plus the preloaded substrate (10 mM). The cells were placed on ice until use. Counterflow was initiated by rapidly diluting 5 μl of the cells with 1 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 30 mM sodium azide and [3H]GABA as detailed in the figure legends. Counterflow was terminated by quenching with 1 ml of 100 mM HgCl2. The “quenched” reaction was vacuum-filtered. The reaction vessel was then washed with 1 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mM HgCl2, and this was applied to the same filter. Finally, the filter was washed with 4 ml of buffer containing 5 mM HgCl2. The filter was dissolved in scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity (disintegrations per minute) was quantitated as described above. The counterflow results have been expressed as a “GABA uptake ratio” to avoid any implication that the intracellular concentration of [3H]GABA is known in absolute terms. The GABA uptake ratio in poisoned cells is the [3H]GABA uptake achieved by preloaded SK55 cells divided by the average “equilibration” level of [3H]GABA uptake achieved by non-preloaded SK55 cells. Thus, the GABA uptake ratio for non-preloaded cells is theoretically unity (and in practice it is close to unity). The GABA uptake ratio is often less than unity for the SK45 strain since there is no basis (no GabP) for rapid equilibration in these cells. Values substantially greater than unity require coupling between efflux of the preloaded compound and influx of [3H]GABA. 2Transmembrane passage or “transport” of the preloaded compound is suggested by both the rising and the falling phases of the counterflow time course. The rising phase reflects trans-stimulation of uptake mediated by rapid exchange of the preloaded substrate for extracellular [3H]GABA. That the unlabeled compound can participate in the exchange reaction implies that it is a substrate capable of transmembrane passage via the same carrier (i.e. GabP) that transports [3H]GABA(10Wong P.T.S.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2524-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transient nature of intracellular [3H]GABA accumulation suggests additionally that the carrier (i.e. GabP) has the capacity (i) to catalyze net efflux of the preloaded substrate (reflected in the falling phase) and (ii) to transduce energy, available in the transmembrane gradient of preloaded substrate, to drive concentrative uptake of [3H]GABA (reflected in the peak “GABA uptake ratio” defined under “Experimental Procedures”). Nitrogen-limiting conditions induce in E. coli the ability to utilize 4-aminobutyrate as a source of carbon and nitrogen (3Kahane S. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zaboura M. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J.

This capability derives jointly from induction of the requisite metabolic enzymes as well as from induction of a permease that catalyzes accumulation of 4-aminobutyrate from the environment. Previous studies (3Kahane S. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) agree that the GabP exhibits biological specificity, rejecting common constituents from the cellular milieu (e.g. the 20 common α-amino acids, ornithine, putrescine) that exhibit at least superficial structural similarity to 4-aminobutyrate. On the other hand, studies (8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5381-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that a number of synthetic compounds (e.g.Fig. 1) are potent GabP inhibitors. Although these molecules bear some structural resemblance to the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate (compound 4), the degree of dissimilarity was sufficient to warrant speculation that some of these molecules (particularly the heterocycles) might act at an allosteric inhibitory site rather than within the GabP transport channel itself. The experimental evidence presented here fails to support this hypothesis for at least nine such inhibitors. Several lines of evidence suggest that both [3H]nipecotic acid (compound 7) and [3H]muscimol (compound 3) are transported quite specifically by GabP (Fig. 2 and 3, respectively). Transport of these compounds depended strongly upon either the presence of plasmid-borne gabP (Fig. 2) or upon specific induction of gabP expression by IPTG (Fig. 3). Transport of [3H]GABA, the native substrate, was likewise induced by IPTG in this expression system(8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, 10 μM GABA was found to inhibit transport of either [3H]nipecotic acid (Fig. 2, inset) or [3H]muscimol (Fig. 3, inset) by about 50%, an effect consistent with the published Km (10-12 μM) of the GabP for GABA(3Kahane S. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The observed transport of [3H]nipecotic acid and [3H]muscimol supports the proposal that these heterocyclic compounds occupy the GabP transport channel (rather than an allosteric site) to inhibit [3H]GABA uptake.Figure 3:The gabP dependence of muscimol uptake by E. coli K-12. The cells were grown in rich medium with (solid symbols) or without (open symbols) 1 mM IPTG to induce gabP expression. E. coli SK55 (•, ○) or SK45 (•, ○) cells were washed, resuspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and then exposed to 1 μM [3H]muscimol (0.4 μCi/ml) for the indicated times. [3H]muscimol (compound 3) uptake was rapidly quenched by the addition of a mercuric chloride stop solution. The cells were harvested by vacuum filtration, and radioactivity was quantitated as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). Inset, washed E. coli SK55 cells were exposed for 15 s to 1 μM [3H]muscimol (0.4 μCi/ml) along with the indicated concentrations of GABA prior to quenching with stop solution as described above. The broken line indicating 50% inhibition was calculated from the uptake velocity measured in the absence of GABA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additionally, it will be noted (Fig. 4) that nipecotic acid (compound 7) contains within its structure the basic elements of two open-chain amino acids, 5-aminopentanoic acid (compound 4) and 3-aminopropanoic acid (compound 10). Thus, nipecotic acid has the potential to be recognized by GabP in the context of either compound 4 or compound 10 (or both). Indeed, compounds 4 and 10 were found to inhibit [3H]nipecotic acid transport (Fig. 5) with IC50 values of 10 μM and 200 μM, respectively. These experiments are in accord with previous studies showing that 5-aminopentanoic acid and 3-aminopropanoic acid inhibit [3H]GABA transport with similar apparent affinities(8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A related and very important question is whether compounds 4 and 10 might in fact be transported GabP substrates.Figure 5:Inhibition of nipecotic acid uptake by open chain amino acids. E. coli SK55 cells were grown in LB medium containing 1 mM IPTG to induce gabP expression. The washed cells (in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) were exposed to 1 μM [3H]nipecotic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) plus the indicated concentrations of either compound 4 (5-aminopentanoic acid) (•), or compound 10 (3-aminopropanoic acid) (•, ○).

First, the use of counterflow in this context was validated by showing that known GabP substrates support transient [3H]GABA accumulation (counterflow) in metabolically poisoned SK55 cells (Fig. 6). Then the capacity of many other nonradiolabeled transport inhibitors to support GabP-mediated counterflow was investigated (see Fig. 7 for summary).Figure 7:Summary of Inhibitory potency and counterflow of GabP ligands. Dose-response curves were generated to assess the ability of each numbered compound to inhibit GabP-mediated transport in E. coli SK55. The inhibitory potency of compound 2, the native substrate, was assessed using 100 μM [3H]nipecotic acid as the substrate (compound 7). The remaining dose-response curves were generated to assess the ability of different compounds to inhibit transport of 10 μM [3H]GABA. These data have been arranged according to the inhibitor IC50 value, which is defined as the inhibitor concentration that reduces transport to 50% of the noninhibited control. Compounds represented by white bars behaved as counterflow substrates. Approximate peak values for counterflow GABA uptake ratio (defined under “Experimental Procedures”) were as follows: compound 2, 14-fold; compound 3, 14-fold; compound 4, 30-fold; compound 5, 22-fold; compound 7, 10-fold; compound 8, 30-fold; compound 9, 15-fold; compound 10, 3-fold; compound 11, 16-fold. In similar studies, no counterflow evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that the remaining compounds represented by dark bars are transportable by GabP.

Under what circumstances might the presence or absence of a counterflow phenomenon be misleading? A genuine substrate having poor affinity for the inwardly oriented carrier might not significantly entrap [3H]GABA entering from the outside, i.e. a small γ factor in the formalism of Wright (15Wright J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 854: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Alternatively, rapid degradation of a preloaded substrate could prevent observation of counterflow. However, it should be noted in this regard that GABA, clearly metabolized by GabT(16Dover S. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 165-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nevertheless survives metabolic degradation long enough to allow experimental demonstration of counterflow (Fig. 6). Other investigators (3Kahane S. Levitz R. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using thin layer chromatography to analyze the state of intracellular GABA have also concluded that there is little degradation over the course of a transport experiment. A positive counterflow result (and the associated trans-stimulation) is more difficult to explain as an artifact. Possibly, a nonsubstrate inhibitor molecule might be metabolized to a substrate capable of trans-stimulating [3H]GABA uptake. However, we doubt that such a fortuitous mechanism could occur frequently enough to make it an attractive artifactual explanation for the present results (Fig. 7) in which nine different compounds were shown to support counterflow. Certainly this artifactual mechanism is unattractive for compounds 2, 3, and 7 since direct methods have shown these to be GabP substrates. be used to implicate the GabP in the transport of other compounds that are not readily available in radioactive form(9King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5381-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that effective inhibitors are not always effective counterflow substrates (Fig. 7). Test compounds 18, 1, and 6 (all unsaturated) failed to support counterflow activity. Compound 18, 4-amino-trans-butenoic acid, was neither an inhibitor (Fig. 1), nor a counterflow substrate (Fig. 7), whereas its cis isomer (compound 11) was both a relatively potent inhibitor (Fig. 1) and a counterflow substrate (Fig. 7). In contrast, compounds 1 and 6 were relatively potent inhibitors (Fig. 1) but were not counterflow substrates (Fig. 7). Within this series of unsaturated test compounds, those that failed to support counterflow share a common structural element (Fig. 8). The carbonyl carbon and the amine moiety are in the trans configuration relative to the double bond that these analogs share in common. It will be noted that the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate (compound 2), rotates freely about the C2-C3 bond so that the molecule can assume conformations similar to either the cis or the trans isomers of 4-aminobutenoic acid. The profound functional differences between these conformationally restricted cis and trans isomers may imply something about the conformation(s) of GABA that are preferred by GabP. Indeed, with appropriate bond rotations, the electronegative atoms in 4-amino-cis-butenoic acid (compound 11) can be made nearly isosteric with those of another conformationally restricted GABA analog, cis-3-aminocyclohexyl carboxylic acid (Fig. 4, compound 8) so that either molecule might be imagined to dock (hydrogen bond) with the same complementary surface (e.g. GabP). 4The idea that GabP prefers a nonextended form of GABA may help to rationalize why compound 10 can be a substrate as well as why compounds 5 and 7 are preferred (8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5381-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) over compounds 14 and 15 (Fig. 7) even though the latter pair are more analogous to the extended conformation of GABA. Model building in fact substantiates that after appropriate rotations, the hydrogen bonding elements of compounds 4, 5, 7, and 10 can be made nearly isosteric with those of 4-amino-cis-butenoic acid (compound 11), a result consistent with the experimental observation that all five of these molecules are GabP substrates. Like compound 11 (4-amino-cis-butenoic acid), compound 8 (cis-3-aminocyclohexyl carboxylic acid) is not only a GabP inhibitor but also a counterflow substrate (Fig. 7). When preloaded into metabolically poisoned E. coli SK55, compound 8 stimulated a transient accumulation of [3H]GABA, which was not observed in non-preloaded cells. It will be noted (Fig. 4) that part of the compound 8 ring structure indeed mimics the native substrate, GABA (compound 2), which is a high affinity ligand (Fig. 2). The remainder of the compound 8 ring mimics 6-aminohexanoic acid (compound 12), a relatively nonpotent inhibitor (Fig. 7) of GabP. We found no evidence that compound 12 could drive [3H]GABA counterflow. Other nonradiolabeled compounds of interest are 5-aminopentanoic acid (compound 4) and 3-aminopropanoic acid (compound 10). As noted compound 4, a high-affinity GabP inhibitor (Fig. 5), can be recognized within the ring structure (Fig. 4) of the transported substrate, nipecotic acid (compound 7). The remainder of the nipecotic acid ring mimics compound 10, a moderately potent (Fig. 5) GabP inhibitor. Preloading of either compound 4 or compound 10 into metabolically poisoned SK55 cells resulted in transient accumulation of [3H]GABA and trans-stimulation of [3H]GABA uptake (Fig. 9). Thus, both 5-aminopentanoate and 3-aminopropanoate behave as though they are compounds that GabP can recognize, transport, and couple to a GABA counterflux. As mentioned, 5-aminopentanoate (compound 4) and 4-aminobutyrate (compound 2) are more potent GabP inhibitors (Fig. 7) than either the longer (6-aminohexanoate, compound 12) or the shorter (3-aminopropanoate, compound 10) open-chain amino acids(8King S.C. Fleming S.R. Brechtel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The separation distance between the amino and carboxyl groups could be a possible basis for the different inhibitory potencies. However, the behavior of these compounds in counterflow suggests that the hydrocarbon skeleton is also significant. Like 3-aminopropanoate (compound 10), 3-aminobutyrate (compound 9) is only a moderately potent GabP inhibitor (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the extra methyl group in compound 9 preserves the charge separation relative to compound 10 and improves counterflow substantially (Fig. 9). The observed transient accumulation of [3H]GABA and trans-stimulation of [3H]GABA uptake are consistent with the notion that both 3-aminobutyrate (compound 9) and 3-aminopropanoate (compound 10) are molecules that GabP can recognize, transport, and couple to a GABA counterflux. That GabP effectively recognizes compound 9 (3-aminobutyrate) is consistent with other evidence (see Fig. 8 and Footnote 4) that the permease prefers analogs that mimic a nonextended conformation of the native substrate, 4-aminobutyrate.4 Irrespective of detailed mechanism, the data presented here support a structure/function model in which numerous molecules having different sizes and shapes are capable of interacting with GabP either as inhibitory ligands or as transported substrates. Perhaps most significantly, the counterflow assay has provided the first evidence that several potent to moderately potent inhibitory compounds, unavailable in radiolabeled form, are likely to be transported substrates capable of traversing the core of the GabP transport channel. On the other hand, the counterflow assay also suggested that some potent inhibitors (compounds 1 and 6) that mimic the extended conformation of 4-aminobutyrate do not appear to be counterflow substrates. In short, a broad range of structurally and perhaps functionally distinct GabP ligands has been identified. The availability of these ligands may allow successful implementation of strategies to select substrate specificity mutants and/or strategies to permit the synthesis of successful active site probes (affinity labels). Thus, dual approaches (genetic and biochemical) to identifying amino acid residues important in the recognition and/or translocation of substrates now appear more feasible than would have been suggested by previous models, which indicated that GabP might be highly selective and unable to recognize alternative ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2106291301,"The core of the vacuolar targeting signal of yeast carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) is recognized by the receptor Vps10p and consists of four contiguous amino acid residues, Gln<sup>24</sup>-Arg-Pro-Leu<sup>27</sup>, near the amino terminus of the propeptide (Valls, L. A., Winther, J. R., and Stevens, T. H.(1990) <i>J. Cell Biol.</i> 111, 361-368; Marcusson, E. G., Horazdovsky, B. F., Cereghino, J. L, Gharakhanian, E., and Emr, S. D.(1994) <i>Cell</i> 77, 579-586). In order to determine the sequence specificity of the interaction with the sorting receptor, substitutions were introduced into this part of the propeptide by semirandom site-directed mutagenesis. The efficiency of vacuolar sorting by the mutants was determined by immunoprecipitation of CPY from pulse-labeled cells. It was found that amino acid residues Gln<sup>24</sup> and Leu<sup>27</sup> were the most important ones. While it appears that Gln<sup>24</sup> is essential for proper function, Leu<sup>27</sup> can be exchanged with the other hydrophobic amino acid residues, isoleucine, valine, and phenylalanine. Tolerance toward various substitutions for Arg<sup>25</sup> is fairly high, while substitution of Pro<sup>26</sup> for uncharged amino acid residues also resulted in only weak missorting. In addition to the low requirement for sequence conservation, the position of the targeting element relative to the amino terminus of the propeptide was analyzed and found not to be critical."
