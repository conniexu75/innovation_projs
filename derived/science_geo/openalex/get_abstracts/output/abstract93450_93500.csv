https://openalex.org/W1608000179,"The recA protein of Escherichia coli binds both single- (SS) and double-stranded (DS) DNA; however, the optimal conditions differ for interaction with these DNA substrates. Binding of DS DNA by recA protein is pH dependent (optimum near pH 6.2) and requires a nucleoside triphosphate (ATP) and divalent cation. Substitution of the 5'-O-3'-thiotriphosphate (ATP(gamma S)) for ATP leads to formation of stable complexes of recA protein and DNA that dissociate very slowly. Formation of these complexes is extremely sensitive to ionic strength and pH. However, once formed, the complexes resist changes in pH and high salt concentrations. SS DNA binds to recA protein in the absence of a nucleoside triphosphate, but recA protein-SS DNA complexes are stabilized by ATP(gamma S). At high recA protein/DNA ratios (1 recA protein monomer/30 nucleotides), these complexes sediment in sucrose gradients as large protein-DNA aggregates. Although ATP(gamma S) blocks dissociation of recA protein from DNA, ATP stimulates the release of recA protein from SS DNA. Hydrolysis of the ATP is not required for dissociation since it is also enhanced by ADP and certain nucleoside triphosphates that are not hydrolyzed by recA protein. recA protein binds with different affinities to ribohomopolymers and deoxyhomopolymers. It preferentially binds polydeoxythymidylate and polydeoxycytidylate but does not bind short oligonucleotides, indicating that there is a minimum size requirement for the binding step. The recA protein exists as a heterogeneous aggregate at pH 7.5 and at low ionic strength. At pH 6.2 in the presence of Mg2+, the protein sediments homogeneously as a dimer. At pH 6.2, ATP or ATP(gamma S) promotes an oligomerization of the recA protein which can be observed as filamentous structures by electron microscopy. Oligomerization is not induced by UTP, a nucleoside triphosphate that is efficiently hydrolyzed by the recA protein, but fails to stimulate efficiently recA protein-promoted annealing and assimilation of single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1503279779,"Adenylate cyclase of the membrane-rich fraction of 24-h cultured islets was inhibited by epinephrine via alpha-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine was inhibitory only when the enzyme was activated by GTP; the degree of inhibition was highly proportional to the degree of GTP activation. Adenylate cyclase of islets cultured with islet-activating protein (IAP), one of the pertussis toxins, was less susceptible to epinephrine inhibition. The degree of the inhibition was markedly reduced without changes in potency of the catecholamine and in GTP dependence after IAP treatment. None of the other kinetic properties of the enzyme including the affinity for substrate, sensitivity to guanine nucleotide and fluoride activation, and cholera toxin-induced modification of enzymic activity were affected by treatment of islets with IAP, suggesting that neither the catalytic nor the GTP-regulatory component of the membrane adenylate cyclase complex is the site of IAP action. Slight activation of the enzyme by glucagon or adenosine tended to be enhanced by IAP treatment. Thus, a mechanism whereby membrane receptors are linked to adenylate cyclase appears to be modified by exposure of islet cells to IAP."
https://openalex.org/W1534550817,"Hydrolysis of the meningococcal group A, B, and C, and Escherichia coli K92 polysaccharides by 60% aqueous hydrofluoric acid liberated various 1,2-diacylglycerols. These were extracted with chloroform, trimethylsilylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two 1,2-diacylglycerols were the major components isolated. In each polysaccharide, 80 to 90% dipalmitoyl glycerol and 10 to 20% distearoyl glycerol were identified. No monoacylglycerols or mixed diacylglycerols were noted. The presence of the hydrophobic end causes the polysaccharides to aggregate in a micellar form and may be the entity by which the polysaccharide remains attached to the outer membrane of the bacterium giving rise to the structure recognized as a capsule."
https://openalex.org/W2415966919,"Fractional volumes of lysosomal-vacuolar elements and long lived protein degradation were quantitatively correlated in rat livers perfused in the single pass mode with varying levels of plasma amino acids. Volumes were determined stereologically; degradation was measured in a second stage cyclic perfusion from the linear accumulation of valine in the presence of cycloheximide and was corrected for loss of short lived proteins. Livers exhibited a high degree of amino acid responsiveness; total protein degradation decreased sharply from 4.5 to 1.5%/h (basal) over an amino acid range of 0-10 times (10X) normal plasma concentrations; near basal values were achieved at 1X. Vacuoles containing undegraded cytoplasm (AVi) appeared immediately following stringent deprivation and by 7.5 min were converted to degradative forms (AVd); both autophagic populations attained steady state volumes by 20 min. With amino acid additions, AVi formation virtually ceased and AVd regressed rapidly (0.087 min-1). Cytoplasmic turnover, calculated from this rate constant and the increases over basal in fractional volumes of either AVi or degradative components, agreed quantitatively with corresponding rates of protein turnover. Predictions from these findings, together with evidence for intralysosomal protein pools in both deprived and basal states, account fully for the accelerated proteolysis and suggest that cytoplasm is also internalized by lysosomes under basal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1995907826,"A number of exported proteins in E. coli, both periplasmic proteins and proteins of the outer membrane, were examined to determine when removal of the ""signal sequence"" occurs in vivo. One protein was processed entirely cotranslationally (amp C beta-lactamase) and one was processed entirely post-translationally (TEM beta-lactamase). The others (maltose-binding protein, arabinose-binding protein, omp A protein, lam B protein and alkaline phosphatase) showed both modes of processing, although the amount of cotranslational processing varied considerably among the individual proteins of this class. When processing occurred cotranslationally, the proteolytic removal of the ""signal"" was a late event. For four of the proteins studied, processing was initiated only after the polypeptides had been elongated to approximately 80% of their full length."
https://openalex.org/W2016043909,"Damage to cellular DNA or interruption of chromosomal DNA synthesis leads to induction of the SOS functions in E. coli. The immediate agent of induction is the RecA protein, which proteolytically cleaves and inactivates repressors, leading to induction of genes they control. RecA protein modified by tif mutations allows expression of SOS functions in the absence of inducing treatments. We show here that tif-mutant RecA protein is more efficient than wild-type RecA protein in interacting with DNA and nucleoside triphosphate. This result suggests that formation of a complex with DNA and nucleoside triphosphate is the critical event that activates RecA protein to destroy repressors after SOS-inducing treatments, and that damage to cellular DNA promotes this reaction by providing single-stranded DNA or active nucleoside triphosphate or both. Since dATP is the most effective nucleoside triphosphate in promoting repressor cleavage, we suggest that it is the natural cofactor of recA protein in vivo."

It contains two tRNA genes, coding for tRNAlle (AUCU) and tRNAAla(GCGA), which are split by intervening sequences of 949 and 806 base pairs, respectively. Homology between the two introns suggests that they have a common origin."

https://openalex.org/W1606529311,"Shigella cytotoxin was purified from the culture medium of Shigella shigae 60 R and from the bacterial pellet by an extensive purification scheme involving chromatography on Cibachron Blue F3GA, chitin, and DEAE-cellulose columns, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and finally polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. In sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, purified toxin showed two bands, a heavy one with the molecular weight of 30,500 (A chain), and a broad band migrating near the dye front (B chain). The A chain was easily cleaved by proteases into two fragments, A1 (Mr = 27,500) and A2 (Mr = 3,000). These fragments were linked with a disulfide bridge (nicked toxin). The molecular weight of native toxin was estimated by the method of Ferguson to be 68,000 +/- 4,000. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the native toxin consists of one A chain and six to seven B chains, with each B chain having a molecular weight of congruent to 5,000. The isolated A and B chains were not toxic to cells nor did they bind to cells to a measurable extent. In a cell-free system, the A1 fragment strongly inhibited protein synthesis. The possibility that the B chains form the binding moiety of the toxin is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1577543390,"Human placenta insulin receptor was purified 11,000-fold to near homogeneity using DEAE-cellulose chromatography and affinity chromatography on insulin-Sepharose. Approximately 200 to 300 micrograms of purified receptor were obtained from a single placenta. In solution, the native receptor is a complex (Mr = 440,000) of an acidic, multi-subunit protein with a Mr of 350,000 and bound detergent accounting for the remainder of the mass. The receptor protein is asymmetric (f/f0 = 1.4) and consists of a single Coomassie blue staining polypeptide of Mr = 135,000. In addition to the 135,000-dalton polypeptide, two smaller polypeptides of Mr = 45,000 and 90,000 were observed upon autoradiography of 125I-labeled receptor subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These two smaller polypeptides did not stain with Coomassie blue but migrated with native receptor activity on isoelectric focusing gels and were coimmunoprecipitated with the 135,000-dalton polypeptide by anti-insulin receptor antibody. The 135,000-dalton subunit was specifically labeled by 125I-insulin using the bifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (P. F. Pilch, and M. P. Czech, (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3375-3381), suggesting that this component contains the insulin binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W189963534,"Both single- and double-stranded DNA stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by the recA protein of Escherichia coli. However, the reactions differ in their pH optima, response to recA protein concentration, salt sensitivity, and degree of inhibition by ADP, all of which reflect different requirements for the prehydrolytic binding of single- and double-stranded DNA by the RecA protein. Single- and double-stranded DNA stimulate hydrolysis of the same nucleoside triphosphates, principally (r,d)ATP and (r,d)UTP, suggesting that a single hydrolytic site is utilized in both single- and double-stranded DNA-dependent reactions. recA protein also catalyzes detectable ATP hydrolysis in the absence of exogenous DNA, although the rate is reduced 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. This DNA-independent hydrolysis shows the same nucleotide specificity at pH 6.2 and 7.5, although the rate of hydrolysis depends upon the pH."

https://openalex.org/W182408164,"The hypothesis that cytoplasmic protein in rat liver is internalized and degraded intralysosomally during basal or steady state turnover as well as in deprivation-accelerated states was tested by (a) determining the subcellular location of degradable protein in homogenates and (b) comparing the amounts of this protein pool with rates of long lived protein degradation in livers perfused under the above conditions. Greater than 95% of total proteolysis in homogenates, measured at 37 degrees C from free amino acid generation or the release of [14C]valine in previously labeled livers, was associated with particulate fractions, and it paralleled lysosomal markers closely during graded differential centrifugation after Triton WR-1339 loading. Because 14C-labeled cytosolic proteins were not degraded by intact isolated lysosomes at pH 6 or 7, the protein substrate must have been internalized by lysosomes prior to homogenization. Time courses of intralysosomal proteolysis from maximal deprivation down to and including basal were identical in shape, and each leveled off abruptly after 120-150 min. Although the velocities of proteolysis were reduced in vitro, estimates of the degradable protein pools were closely proportional to corresponding rates of long lived degradation in perfused livers. In absolute terms, they fit recent predictions of internalized cytoplasmic protein based on stereological measurements of lysosomal volumes."
https://openalex.org/W1549006969,"Abstract Purified recA protein, which is essential for genetic recombination of Escherichia coli, catalyzed ATP-dependent homologous pairing of double-stranded DNA and single-stranded fragments to form D-loops. When the double-stranded DNA was nicked circular DNA (form II) or linear DNA (form III), the reaction proceeded nearly linearly during 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. When the double-stranded DNA was superhelical (form I), anomalous kinetics was observed. This anomaly was suppressed by the addition of spermidine without affecting the final yield of D-loops. The formation of D-loops required stoichiometric amounts of recA protein, which were proportional to the concentration of single-stranded DNA but which were not affected by the concentration of double-stranded DNA. With form II or III DNA as the recipient for the formation of D-loops, the rate of the reaction was greatest when there was one monomer of recA protein/2-3 nucleotide residues of single-stranded DNA; larger amounts of single-stranded DNA inhibited the reaction. The formation of D-loops was half inhibited by 30 mM NaCl and by 0.6 mM ADP, one of the products of the reaction. The thermal stability of D-loops made by recA protein was the same as that of D-loops made by annealing. In addition to pairing linear single strands with duplex DNA, recA protein made joint molecules from single-stranded circular DNA and homologous form II or III DNA. According to these and previous observations (Cunningham, R. P., DasGupta, C., Shibata, T., and Radding, C. M. (1980) Cell 20, 223-235), rcA protein will stably pair two molecules of DNA if one of them is single-stranded or partially single-stranded and if either molecule has a free end."
https://openalex.org/W1668007667,"Abstract Radiolabeled fatty acids in dimethyl sulfoxide were applied topically to sex pheromone glands of young adult female Argyrotaenia velutinana. Glands treated with sodium [1-14C]acetate incorporated radiolabel into the sex pheromone components and into dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, octadecanoic, (Z)-11-tetradecenoic, and (E)-11-tetradecenoic fatty acyl moieties. In contrast, very little radiolabel was incorporated into unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acyl moieties and almost none into unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acyl moieties, although these moieties were abundant in the gland. A similar pattern of incorporation was observed for glands treated with [U-14C]hexadecanoic acid. In glands treated with [1-14C]hexadecanoic acid, a smaller proportion of the label was incorporated into the 14-carbon fatty acyl moieties than in glands treated with [U-14C]hexadecanoic acid, indicating that 14-carbon fatty acyl moieties arose from chain-shortening of hexadecanoyl moieties. In glands treated with [1-14C]tetradecanoic acid, (Z)-11-tetradecenoyl and (E)-11-tetradecenoyl moieties incorporated the most label, implicating (Z)-11 and (E)-11 desaturases specific for the tetradecanoyl chain. In glands treated with (Z)-11-[1-14C]tetradecenoic acid or (E)-11-[1-14C]tetradecenoic acid, very little label was incorporated into the other geometric isomer, implying that Z/E isomerases do not occur in the gland. In glands treated with (E)-11-[1-14C]tetradecenoic acid, much more label was incorporated into (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate than with the other substrates, showing that most of the labeled acetate arose from reduction and acetylation of the labeled fatty acyl moiety."
https://openalex.org/W2078436276,"Expression of the ovalbumin gene in chicken oviduct explant cultures requires the presence of a somatomedin-like peptide hormone in addition to estrogen. Insulin, proinsulin and multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA) are equally active substitutes for this peptide hormone, and maximal induction requires about 0.5 micrograms/ml; fetal calf serum can partially substitute for these factors. The equipotency of insulin and proinsulin indicates that insulin receptors are not involved, and the activity of MSA suggests that the active receptor is specific for somatomedins. The permissive effect of the peptide factor occurs within 1-2 hr and is required for the initiation of estrogen-mediated transcription on the ovalbumin gene. In contrast, transcription from the conalbumin gene is fully induced by estrogen in the presence or absence of peptide factors or serum, despite the fact that these two egg white genes are both transcribed in the same cells in response to the same steroid hormones. We suggest that the interaction of a somatomedin with its membrane-bound receptor generates an intracellular signal that interacts specifically with the ovalbumin gene."

https://openalex.org/W1969489828,"We have used an mRNA-dependent E. coli S-30 translation system to compare the translation efficiencies of two polycistronic transcripts of the galactose operon, the CRP-cAMP-dependent mRNA (P1) and the CRP-cAMP-independent mRNA (P2). The RNAs were prepared in vitro, quantitated by hybridization or gel analysis and translated in a cell free system. The specific protein products were measured, and their quantities were compared with the amount of input mRNA. Our results show that the P2 mRNA synthesizes epimerase, the 5'-proximal gene product of the gal operon, four times more efficiently than the P1 mRNA. The 5'-distal gene products, transferase and kinase, are translated with the same efficiency from both transcripts. Thus the ratio of epimerase to kinase synthesis is four times higher for the P2 mRNA than for the P1 mRNA. This change in epimerase to kinase ratio is identical to that observed in vivo when the cellular cAMP level falls and gal transcription is believed to switch from P1 to P2. We suggest that it is the differential translation efficiency of the epimerase gene on the two different gal transcripts that accounts for this discoordinate expression. Moreover, since the P2 mRNA differs from the P1 mRNA only by the addition of five nucleotides at the 5' terminus and these nucleotides are outside the ribosome binding region we determine for epimerase, the selective difference in the translation efficiency of epimerase is probably mediated by RNA conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1586905467,"[U-14C]Tyrosine-labeled noniodinated hog thyroglobulin was iodinated enzymatically and nonenzymatically (iodine, iodide-chloramine-T, pH 7.4, or iodine monochloride, pH 8.1). This led to similar levels of iodine incorporation as well as of thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodine monochloride at pH 5.5 formed iodotyrosine residues, but no hormone residues. The latter were formed when the iodinated thyroglobulin was brought to pH 8.5 and then treated with horseradish peroxidase and glucose-glucose oxidase in the absence of iodide and iodine monochloride. Enzymatic hydrolysates contained labeled hormone and pyruvic acid; acid hydrolysates labeled thyronine and acetic acid. (Treatment with acid converts hormone to thyronine and pyruvic to acetic acid.) After borohydride treatment, labeled alanine was present instead of pyruvic or acetic acid. The pyruvic acid/hormone, acetic acid/thyronine, alanine/hormone, and alanine/thyronine molar ratios always were 1, independently of the method of iodination. The reaction consists of an oxidation step and nonoxidative coupling and decomposition steps. The oxidation step may be either enzymatic or nonenzymatic. The decomposition step always leads to 1 dehydroalanine residue for each hormone residue synthesized. (Dehydroalanine residues appear in the various hydrolysates as acetic acid, pyruvic acid, and alanine, respectively.) Since proper alignment of 2 iodotyrosine residues is a prerequisite for coupling, a model is proposed according to which oxidation of hormonogenic iodotyrosine residues leads to a charge transfer complex which is the same zwitterion-biradical resonance hybrid no matter whether it resulted from a free radical (enzymatic) or an ionic (nonenzymatic) oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1985260709,"Abstract Secretion of amber fragments of an E. coli periplasmic protein, the maltose-binding protein, was studied to determine if the mature portion of the protein is required for its export across the cytoplasmic membrane. A fragment lacking 25â€“35 amino acid residues at the C terminus is secreted at normal levels, suggesting that this sequence is not required for secretion. This is in contrast to the results obtained with the periplasmic protein Î²-lactamase. In studying another fragment of one-third the molecular weight of the intact protein, we found that the majority of the fragment is not recovered from the periplasmic fraction. However, a small amount of secretion of this polypeptide was observed. This fragment is synthesized as a larger molecular weight form when cells are induced for the synthesis of a maltose-binding protein-Î²-galactosidase hybrid protein, which was previously shown to block the proper localization and processing of envelope proteins. This result is consistent with the idea that the larger form is a precursor with an unprocessed signal sequence, whereas in the absence of the hybrid protein the fragment is a processed mature form. Thus secretion of the smaller fragment may be occurring up to the point where the signal sequence is removed. That this fragment has passed through the cytoplasmic membrane is further supported by its accessibility to externally added trypsin. We suggest that the fragment may be secreted to the periplasm, but cannot assume a water-soluble conformation; the majority of the polypeptide may be associated with the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Thus the mature sequence of maltose-binding protein, at least its C-terminal two thirds, may not be required for its export across the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1565515078,"The complete amino acid sequence of elongation factor Tu of Escherichia coli has been established by sequencing overlapping cyanogen bromide and tryptic peptides. Sequence analysis of peptides was done primarily by solid-phase Edman degradation. Elongation factor Tu is a single chain polypeptide composed of 393 amino acids (Mr = 43,225). Its NH2 terminus is blocked with an acetyl group, as determined by mass spectroscopy, and lysine 56 is partially methylated. The cysteine residues associated with aminoacyl tRNA and guanosine nucleotide binding are located at positions 81 and 137, respectively. Although elongation factor Tu is coded for by two genes, the only site of microheterogeneity found was at the carboxyl terminus (residue 393), which is either glycine or serine. Comparison of the first 140 amino acids of elongation factor Tu and of elongation factor G shows a strong (31%) sequence homology. In addition, secondary structure calculations predict remarkable conformational similarities between the two proteins. The NH2-terminal region of elongation factor Tu appears to be composed of two beta-sheet domains connected by an exposed, alpha-helical bridge, which includes a 14-amino acid segment released by limited treatment with trypsin. Structural features of the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site are discussed in the light of sequence and other chemical and biochemical data."

https://openalex.org/W1528806452,"Our aim was to isolate from bacteria a flagellated, subcellular system whose content could be changed at will. Because the control of bacterial chemotaxis resides in the direction of rotation of the flagella, such a system would be ideal for the study of this control mechanism. By incubating bacteria with penicillin and then lysing them osmotically, we were able to isolate cell envelopes from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. These envelopes have the same sidedness and similar shape and dimensions as the original bacteria; they are practically free of cytoplasm; they are osmotically sensitive, having intact the cytoplasmic membrane and at least part of the cell wall; and they have flagella. This preparation was used to find out what is required to restore flagellar rotation, which had been lost during osmotic lysis. By visualizing the image of individual flagella with high intensity light microscopy or by tethering the cell envelopes, we found that adding artificial electron donors as an energy source is enough to restore rotation. This seems to indicate that no cytoplasmic components are required and that the proton electrochemical potential is indeed the driving force for flagellar rotation. However, the rotation was almost entirely counterclockwise, while in intact bacteria the flagella rotate in both directions. This may indicate that a cytoplasmic component is required to allow clockwise rotation. The significance of these results for the study of chemotaxis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1553542366,"Ribonucleotide reductase is responsible for the reduction of the 2'-hydroxy moiety of all four ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. The overall activity of the enzyme is regulated by the allosteric effectors ATP (activator) and dATP (inhibitor), and the enzyme's substrate specificity is also controlled by nucleotide effectors. For instance, wild type ribonucleotide reductase from mouse T-lymphoma (S49) cells requires dGTP as a positive effector for ADP reduction. This effect of dGTP causes a reciprocal inhibition of CDP reduction. The dGuo-L mutant cell line, resistant to growth inhibition by exogenous deoxyguanosine, contains a nucleotide-binding subunit, protein M1, that conveys to its CDP reductase an insensitivity to dGTP (and dTTP) inhibition. The dGuo-L protein M1 also shows a decreased capacity to use ADP as a substrate, and therefore, the regulation of the substrate specificity is altered in the mutant protein M1. Another mutant cell line, dGuo-200-1, is resistant to deoxyadenosine and its ribonucleotide reductase is abnormally resistant to inhibition by dATP. The isolated mutant protein M1 from dGuo-200-1 cells has a CDP reductase activity which is stimulated by dATP, unlike the wild type enzyme which is inhibited by dATP. It appears that this mutant enzyme has lost the capacity to distinguish between dATP and ATP, but is still sensitive to regulation by dGTP and dTTP. Thus, the site of protein M1 regulating overall activity is altered in the dGuo-200-1 mutant, while the site regulating substrate specificity is normal. These characteristics of the mutants provide genetic evidence for two independent allosteric domains of protein M1, each responsible for a different aspect of nucleotide sensitivity of ribonucleotide reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1487954089,"Using the technique of radiation inactivation we have previously shown that the insulin receptor in rat liver membranes is composed of at least two functional components: an insulin binding component and a component which acts as an affinity regulator ((1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3412-3419). In the present study, we have used this technique to examine whether insulin alters the size or structure of the insulin receptor. When insulin is bound to its receptor in liver membranes before radiation, there is a marked change in the inactivation profile. Analysis of the results of indicated that insulin binding to its receptor caused a decrease in the functional size of the insulin binding component from 115,000 to 76,000 and also diminished the interaction between the binding and regulatory components. The magnitude of these effects depended on the insulin concentration, and analogues of insulin with reduced receptor affinity show a reduced effect. Under these conditions, there was no change in the apparent size of the affinity regulator (about 260,000). These data suggest that the interaction of insulin with its receptor in situ produces a change in receptor structure which may be important in signal transmission."

Peptides were sequenced by solid-phase Edman degradation. Sequence analysis of these peptides completes the sequence of elongation factor Tu described in the companion article (Laursen, R.

https://openalex.org/W2115688162,"From a mutagenized population of mouse T-lymphoma cells (S49) in continuous culture a cell line has been isolated (Ullman, B., Gudas, L. J., Clift, S. M., Martin, D. W., Jr. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 1074-1978) with ribonucleotide reductase activity that is inhibited only 50% by concentrations of dGTP which abolish wild type enzyme activity. Ribonucleotide reductase activity from this dGuo-L cell line retains its normal sensitivity to dATP. The partial sensitivity/partial resistance of the ribonucleotide reductase suggests that the dGuo-L cell line is heterozygous for ribonucleotide reductase, possessing one normal allele and one allele which codes for a dGTP-resistant enzyme. Both homologous and heterologous mixing experiments between the separated nonidentical subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, protein M1 and protein M2, from wild type and dGuo-L cells showed that the dGTP- feedback sensitivity was governed by the source of the protein M1. A partial resolution of two dGuo-L protein M1 components was achieved by chromatography on dextran blue-Sepharose. In order to resolve the two dGuo-L protein M1 components more completely, we introduced into dGuo-L cells a second mutation which conferred resistance of the ribonucleotide reductase to dATP, while the original dGTP resistance was maintained. The chromatography of protein M1 from this latter clone, dGuo-L-Aphid-G5, on dATP-Sepharose resolved two kinetically distinct protein M1 components. The first component was sensitive to dGTP inhibition but stimulated by dATP; the second was absolutely refractory to dGTP but sensitive to dATP inhibition. This confirms the hypothesis that the dGuo-L parent is heterozygous for protein M1, containing one wild type and one mutant allele."

Both SS and DS DNA-dependent UTPase activities are nonlinearly dependent on recA protein concentration at pH 6 but the SS DNA-dependent reaction shows a linear dependence on enzyme concentration at pH 8. The Km for UTP in the SS DNA-dependent reaction decreases from 147 microM at pH 8 to 33 microM at pH 6. The Km for UTP in the DS DNA-dependent reaction is 247 microM at pH 6. In addition, the Hill coefficient for UTP in the SS DNA-dependent reaction decreases from 3.5 at pH 8 to 1.9 at pH 6, while in the DS DNA-dependent reaction, the Hill coefficient is 2.4 at pH 6. Thus, the UTPase activity of the recA protein differs from the ATPase activity of recA protein primarily in the pH dependence of KmUTP, Vmax, and response to enzyme concentration of the SS DNA-dependent hydrolysis reaction. These differences may be related to the inability of UTP to substitute effectively for ATP in recA protein-promoted annealing and assimilation of SS DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1572653683,"Chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase is rapidly and stoichiometrically inactivated by a substituted 4,6-diaminodihydrotriazine containing a terminal benzenesulfonylfluoride (DTBSF). The substrate dihydrofolate largely prevents the enzyme inhibition by DTBSF, whereas NADPH had no effect, indicating that the inhibitor is bound at or near the folate site. Using radiolabeled inhibitor between 1.0 and 1.2 mol was incorporated/mol of enzyme (Mr = 21,651), following treatment with 8 M urea at 75 degrees C. Digestion of the maleylated, radiolabeled inhibitor-enzyme complex with trypsin and subsequent gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 SF yielded a single major peak of radioactivity. The covalently modified limited tryptic peptide was subsequently purified to homogeneity using high performance liquid chromatography. The radiolabeled tryptic peptide had the following sequence: Asn-Glu-Tyr (DTBS)-Lys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Arg (residues 29-36). Automated Edman degradation of this peptide revealed that the radioactivity derived from the inhibitor was released at Step 3, identifying tyrosine-31 as the specific site of covalent attachment of the affinity label."

https://openalex.org/W130096882,"Abstract The time-dependent inactivation of D-serine dehydratase by alkylamines was characterized. Evidence is presented indicating that inactivation proceeds via a transimination reaction analogous to the first step in the catalytic pathway. The product of alkylamine attack, an alkylamine pyridoxal 5'-phosphate Schiff base, readily dissociated from D-serine dehydratase to produce inactive apoenzyme. Reaction with alkylamines was shown to be a convenient way of producing apoenzyme which can be reconstituted with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to fully active holoenzyme. Amino acids such as glycine and alanine, unlike alkylamines, did not resolve D-serine dehydratase but were competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The inability of amino acids to resolve D-serine dehydratase from its cofactor was attributed to a failure of the amino acid-cofactor Schiff base to dissociate from the enzyme. Transimination of D-serine dehydratase with its substrate D-serine was at least 3.5 X 10(5) times faster than a nonenzymic model transimination reaction and more than 70 million times faster than the reaction of the enzyme with 2-hydroxyethylamine, indicating that the carboxyl group of the substrate is an important structural determinant for catalysis of the transimination step in the catalytic pathway. An analysis of the inhibitory effect of potassium ion on the rate and extent of inactivation of D-serine dehydratase by alkylamines indicated that K+ binding increased the affinity of the enzyme for its cofactor by at least 13-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1970162347,"The semisynthesis of deshexapeptide insulin (DHI) from desoctapeptide insulin (DOI) reported earlier1 showed that DHI was biologically active. However, the product was not quite homogeneous, mainly due to the esterification side reaction and the following saponification2. Recently, the catalytic action of trypsin was successfully used in the preparation of human insulin from porcine insulin3. It was also used in the preparation of insulin analogues with substitutions of B24 or B25 phenylalanine by leucine4,5. Here, we report the synthesis of DHI from DOI and glycylphenylalanine through the catalytic action of trypsin. The product, purified by gel filtration and DEAE-Sephadex ion-exchange chromatography, showed insulin activity of 7.5 IU mgâˆ’1 in vivo and could be obtained in crystalline form."
https://openalex.org/W1581426924,"Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits and 70 S ribosomes were treated with 2-iminothiolane and oxidized to promote the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between neighboring proteins. After alkylation of the unreacted sulfhydryl groups, the mixture of ribosomal proteins was extracted with acetic acid and analyzed by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis in the first dimension and a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in the second. The analysis revealed only 3 protein dimers that contained ribosomal protein S1. The identification of the protein partner of protein S1 in each dimer was accomplished by radioiodination of the proteins extracted from the gel, 2-dimensional polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis, and radioautography. The results indicate that proteins S2, S10, and S18 are cross-linked to protein S1. No other cross-links involving S1 were detected."
https://openalex.org/W1586261795,"The in vivo incorporation of exogenous radioactive acetate into two proteins of Sindbis virus, the capsid protein and PE2, is described. Under appropriate labeling conditions, 40-50% of the label in the capsid protein is found in an N-acetyl group which constitutes the NH_2-terminal modification of this blocked protein. The incorporated radiolabeled acetate was useful in the purification and analysis of peptides derived from the NH_2-terminus of the capsid protein, and from these peptides the NH_2-terminal sequence of the protein was determined to be N-acetyl-Met-Asx-, with the asx group most likely asparagine. The analysis of a peptide derived from the NH_2-terminus of PE2 and containing 45% of the acetate-derived label in this protein leads us to conclude that at least a significant fraction of PE2 is also blocked by N-acetylation."
