https://openalex.org/W3203538421,"In vivo cell fate conversions have emerged as potential regeneration-based therapeutics for injury and disease. Recent studies reported that ectopic expression or knockdown of certain factors can convert resident astrocytes into functional neurons with high efficiency, region specificity, and precise connectivity. However, using stringent lineage tracing in the mouse brain, we show that the presumed astrocyte-converted neurons are actually endogenous neurons. AAV-mediated co-expression of NEUROD1 and a reporter specifically and efficiently induces reporter-labeled neurons. However, these neurons cannot be traced retrospectively to quiescent or reactive astrocytes using lineage-mapping strategies. Instead, through a retrograde labeling approach, our results reveal that endogenous neurons are the source for these viral-reporter-labeled neurons. Similarly, despite efficient knockdown of PTBP1 in vivo, genetically traced resident astrocytes were not converted into neurons. Together, our results highlight the requirement of lineage-tracing strategies, which should be broadly applied to studies of cell fate conversions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3111243436,"Despite remarkable clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer treatment, ICB benefits for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain limited. Through pooled in vivo CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in syngeneic TNBC mouse models, we found that deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 in cancer cells decreases secretion of macrophage-associated chemokines, reduces tumor macrophage infiltration, enhances anti-tumor immunity, and strengthens ICB response. Transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics analyses revealed that Cop1 functions through proteasomal degradation of the C/ebpδ protein. The Cop1 substrate Trib2 functions as a scaffold linking Cop1 and C/ebpδ, which leads to polyubiquitination of C/ebpδ. In addition, deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cop1 in cancer cells stabilizes C/ebpδ to suppress expression of macrophage chemoattractant genes. Our integrated approach implicates Cop1 as a target for improving cancer immunotherapy efficacy in TNBC by regulating chemokine secretion and macrophage infiltration in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3203890559,"We examine how the earnings, time use, and subjective wellbeing of different social groups changed at different stages/waves of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK). We analyze longitudinal data from the latest UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS) COVID study and the earlier waves of the UKHLS to investigate within-individual changes in labor income, paid work time, housework time, childcare time, and distress level during the three lockdown periods and the easing period between them (from April 2020 to late March 2021). We find that as the pandemic developed, COVID-19 and its related lockdown measures in the UK had unequal and varying impacts on people’s income, time use, and subjective well-being based on their gender, ethnicity, and educational level. In conclusion, the extent of the impacts of COVID-19 and COVID-induced measures as well as the speed at which these impacts developed, varied across social groups with different types of vulnerabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3204946529,"Adult stem cells maintain regenerative tissue structure and function by producing tissue-specific progeny, but the factors that preserve their tissue identities are not well understood. The small and large intestines differ markedly in cell composition and function, reflecting their distinct stem cell populations. Here we show that SATB2, a colon-restricted chromatin factor, singularly preserves LGR5+ adult colonic stem cell and epithelial identity in mice and humans. Satb2 loss in adult mice leads to stable conversion of colonic stem cells into small intestine ileal-like stem cells and replacement of the colonic mucosa with one that resembles the ileum. Conversely, SATB2 confers colonic properties on the mouse ileum. Human colonic organoids also adopt ileal characteristics upon SATB2 loss. SATB2 regulates colonic identity in part by modulating enhancer binding of the intestinal transcription factors CDX2 and HNF4A. Our study uncovers a conserved core regulator of colonic stem cells able to mediate cross-tissue plasticity in mature intestines."
https://openalex.org/W3203873265,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth became a vital resource to contain the virus's spread and ensure continuity of care of patients with a chronic condition, notably arterial hypertension and heart disease. This paper reports the experience based on a telehealth platform used at scale to manage chronic disease patients in the Italian community.Patients' health status was remotely monitored through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), resting or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, sleep oximetry, and cardiorespiratory polysomnography performed in community pharmacies or general practitioners' offices. Patients also monitored their blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, and lipids at home through a dedicated smartphone app. All data conveyed to the web-based telehealth platform were used to manage critical patients by doctors promptly. Data were analyzed and compared across three consecutive periods of 2 months each: i) before the national lockdown, ii) during the lockdown (from March 9 to May 17, 2020), and iii) after the end of the containment measures. Overall, 13,613 patients visited community pharmacies or doctors' offices. The number of overall tests dropped during and rose after the lockdown. The overall proportion of abnormal tests was larger during the outbreak. A significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal ECGs due to myocardial ischemia, contrasted by a significantly improved BP control, was observed. The number of home users and readings exchanged increased during the pandemic. In 226 patients, a significant increase in the proportion of SpO2 readings and a significant reduction in the entries for all other parameters, except BP, was observed. The proportion of abnormal SpO2 and BP values was significantly lower during the lockdown. Following the lockdown, the proportion of abnormal body weight or waist circumference values increased.Our study results support the usefulness of a telehealth solution to detect deterioration of the health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov at number NCT03781401."
https://openalex.org/W3204405103,"Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) are among the major public health problems globally, particularly in developing countries like Egypt. This study aimed to evaluate prevalence and risk factors associated with IPIs among preschool and school children in Egypt. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 996 randomly selected preschool and school-aged children in Gharbia governorate during January to April 2018. Stool specimens were examined for the presence of the parasite by direct smear and the formol-ether concentration methods. The overall prevalence of IPIs was 46.2%. Entamoeba histolytica and Ascaris lumbricoides were the most predominant parasites (12.7% per each). This is followed by Enterobius vermicularis (8.6%), Giardia lamblia (7.1%), Cryptosporidium parvum (1.5%), Heterophyes heterophyes (1.4%), Hymenolepis nana (0.7%), Hookworms (0.6%), Fasciola hepatica (0.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (0.4%). Infected children with no symptoms (26.8%) were significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) more frequent than those with medical complaint (19.4%). Socio-demographic predictors of IPIs were preschool age (OR = 4.9; P &lt; 0.001; 95%CI 3.3–7.3), living in rural dwellings (OR = 1.96; P &lt; 0.001; 95%CI 1.5–2.5), and belonging to a low-income family (OR = 4.7; P &lt; 0.001; 95%CI 2.3–9.3). The absence of safe drinking water, lack of hand washing (after soil contact, or before meals, or after toilet usage), and eating unwashed vegetables were risk factors for IPIs in the study region (OR = 1.3–6.9, P &lt; 0.001 – P = 0.05). Higher odds for exposure to potential zoonotic parasites were evident in children with pets in their homes for G . lambia and D . caninum (OR = 2.1–8.3; P = 0.02 – P = 0.04), children having household reared ruminants for C . parvum (OR = 10.4; P &lt; 0.001), and children that play with stray animals for E . histolytica and Hookworm (OR = 1.8–6.3; P = 0.04 – P = 0.05)compared to other children with no animal contact. The present study highlights the importance of periodic screening and treatment of IPIs in children, deworming companion animals, and public education for effective prevention of IPIs in children in Egypt."
https://openalex.org/W3204606755,"Timely and accurate diagnostics are essential to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but no test satisfies both conditions. Dogs can scent-identify the unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during infection by interrogating specimens or, ideally, the body of a patient. After training 6 dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 by scent in human respiratory secretions (in vitro diagnosis), we retrained 5 of them to search and find the infection by scenting the patient directly (in vivo screening). Then, efficacy trials were designed to compare the diagnostic performance of the dogs against that of the rRT-PCR in 848 human subjects: 269 hospitalized patients (COVID-19 prevalence 30.1%), 259 hospital staff (prevalence 2.7%), and 320 government employees (prevalence 1.25%). The limit of detection in vitro was lower than 10-12 copies ssRNA/mL. During in vivo efficacy experiments, our 5 dogs detected 92 COVID-19 positive patients among the 848 study subjects. The alert (lying down) was immediate, with 95.2% accuracy and high sensitivity (95.9%; 95% C.I. 93.6-97.4), specificity (95.1%; 94.4-95.8), positive predictive value (69.7%; 65.9-73.2), and negative predictive value (99.5%; 99.2-99.7) in relation to rRT-PCR. Seventy-five days after finishing in vivo efficacy experiments, a real-life study (in vivo effectiveness) was executed among the riders of the Metro System of Medellin, deploying the human-canine teams without previous training or announcement. Three dogs were used to examine the scent of 550 volunteers who agreed to participate, both in test with canines and in rRT-PCR testing. Negative predictive value remained at 99.0% (95% C.I. 98.3-99.4), but positive predictive value dropped to 28.2% (95% C.I. 21.1-36.7). Canine scent-detection in vivo is a highly accurate screening test for COVID-19, and it detects more than 99% of infected individuals independent of key variables, such as disease prevalence, time post-exposure, or presence of symptoms. Additional training is required to teach the dogs to ignore odoriferous contamination under real-life conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3204446710,"Collagens are the most abundant proteins in the body and comprise the basement membranes and stroma through which cancerous invasion occurs; however, a pro-neoplastic function for mutant collagens is undefined. Here we identify COL11A1 mutations in 66 of 100 cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs), the second most common U.S. cancer, concentrated in a triple helical region known to produce trans-dominant collagens. Analysis of COL11A1 and other collagen genes found that they are mutated across common epithelial malignancies. Knockout of mutant COL11A1 impairs cSCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Compared to otherwise genetically identical COL11A1 wild-type tissue, gene-edited mutant COL11A1 skin is characterized by induction of β1 integrin targets and accelerated neoplastic invasion. In mosaic tissue, mutant COL11A1 cells enhanced invasion by neighboring wild-type cells. These results suggest that specific collagens are commonly mutated in cancer and that mutant collagens may accelerate this process."
https://openalex.org/W3202352678,"Obesity is a global health problem that is often related to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Chronic low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) is a hallmark of obesity. Previously, during a search for differentially expressed genes in WAT of obese mice, we identified glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), of which expression was robustly induced in pathologically expanded WAT. Here, we investigated the role of GPNMB in obesity-related metabolic disorders utilizing GPNMB-deficient mice. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), GPNMB-deficient mice showed body weight and adiposity similar to those of wild-type (WT) mice. Nonetheless, insulin and glucose tolerance tests revealed significant obesity-related metabolic disorders in GPNMB-KO mice compared with WT mice fed with HFD. Chronic WAT inflammation was remarkably worsened in HFD-fed GPNMB-KO mice, accompanied by a striking increase in crown-like structures, typical hallmarks for diseased WAT. Macrophages isolated from GPNMB-KO mice were observed to produce more inflammatory cytokines than those of WT mice, a difference abolished by supplementation with recombinant soluble GPNMB extracellular domain. We demonstrated that GPNMB reduced the inflammatory capacity of macrophages by inhibiting NF-κB signaling largely through binding to CD44. Finally, we showed that macrophage depletion by addition of clodronate liposomes abolished the worsened WAT inflammation and abrogated the exacerbation of metabolic disorders in GPNMB-deficient mice fed on HFD. Our data reveal that GPNMB negatively regulates macrophage inflammatory capacities and ameliorates the WAT inflammation in obesity; therefore we conclude that GPNMB is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3203544822,"Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a core component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-methyltransferase complex, along with VIRMA, CBLL1, ZC3H13 (KIAA0853), RBM15/15B, and METTL3/14, which generate m6A, a key RNA modification that affects various processes of RNA metabolism. WTAP also interacts with splicing factors; however, despite strong evidence suggesting a role of Drosophila WTAP homolog fl(2)d in alternative splicing (AS), its role in splicing regulation in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here we demonstrate using RNAi coupled with RNA-seq that WTAP, VIRMA, CBLL1, and ZC3H13 modulate AS, promoting exon skipping and intron retention in AS events that involve short introns/exons with higher GC content and introns with weaker polypyrimidine-tract and branch points. Further analysis of GC-rich sequences involved in AS events regulated by WTAP, together with minigene assay analysis, revealed potential G-quadruplex formation at splice sites where WTAP has an inhibitory effect. We also found that several AS events occur in the last exon of one isoform of MSL1 and WTAP, leading to competition for polyadenylation. Proteomic analysis also suggested that WTAP/CBLL1 interaction promotes recruitment of the 3'-end processing complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the WTAP complex regulates AS and alternative polyadenylation via inhibitory mechanisms in GC-rich sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3203413157,"Molecular biomarkers are promising tools to be routinely used in clinical psychiatry. Among psychiatric diseases, major depression disorder (MDD) has gotten attention due to its growing prevalence and morbidity.We tested some peripheral molecular parameters such as serum mature Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (mBDNF), plasma C-Reactive Protein (CRP), serum cortisol (SC), and the salivary Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), as well as the Pittsburgh sleep quality inventory (PSQI), as part of a multibiomarker panel for potential use in MDD diagnosis and evaluation of disease's chronicity using regression models, and ROC curve.For diagnosis model, two groups were analyzed: patients in the first episode of major depression (MD: n = 30) and a healthy control (CG: n = 32). None of those diagnosis models tested had greater power than Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-6. For MDD chronicity, a group of patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD: n = 28) was tested across the MD group. The best chronicity model (p < 0.05) that discriminated between MD and TRD included four parameters, namely PSQI, CAR, SC, and mBDNF (AUC ROC = 0.99), with 96% of sensitivity and 93% of specificity.These results indicate that changes in specific biomarkers (CAR, SC, mBDNF and PSQI) have potential on the evaluation of MDD chronicity, but not for its diagnosis. Therefore, these findings can contribute for further studies aiming the development of a stronger model to be commercially available and used in psychiatry clinical practice."

Chlorhexidine (a widely used topical non-antibiotic antimicrobial compound) coatings on silica nanoparticles capable of prolonged drug release have been successfully developed and characterised. Such nanocarriers were incorporated into commercial formulation PMMA bone cement (Cemex), without adversely affecting the mechanical performance. Moreover, the bone cement containing the developed nanocarriers showed superior antimicrobial activity against different bacterial species encountered in PJI, including clinical isolates already resistant to gentamicin. Cytocompatibility tests also showed non inferior performance of the bone cements containing chlorhexidine releasing silica nanocarriers to the equivalent commercial formulation."
https://openalex.org/W3204544239,"In this research, eight local mung bean ( Vigna radiata ) varieties were analyzed for their performance against two levels of CdCl 2 solution (0.3 and 0.5 mM) alone and priming with gibberellic acid (GA 3 ) (100 μM), salicylic acid (SA) (50 μM) and proline (5 mM) solution prior to Cd exposure. Mung bean seedlings were analyzed for disturbance in cytological, morphological, biochemical and enzymatic parameters under cadmium stress. For cytological studies, 48 h grown mung bean seedlings root tips were used to prepare slides and studied for percent mitotic index (MI%) and to calculate percent C-mitosis, laggard, sticky and fragmented chromosomes, pictures were captured by a Nikon camera (DS-Fi 1 Japan) attached with a microscope. One-week grown mung seedlings were studied for growth traits, malondialdehyde (MDA), protein, proline and antioxidant enzymes. ANOVA and DMR test of this research revealed that all the tested mung bean varieties and treatments were significantly different regarding mitotic index and number of chromosomal aberrations. Both the Cd treatments exhibited increased total chromosomal aberrations with different types and a maximum decrease in MI%. In pretreated samples, GA 3 , SA and proline serve as mitigating agents that reduce mutagenic effects of Cd in mung bean by increasing MI% and decreasing chromosomal aberrations as compared to non-pretreated samples. Both the Cd treatments showed a decrease in all growth traits. Total proteins were also found to be significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in all genotypes. Cd treatment increased the activities of all antioxidant enzymes tested. Cd caused oxidative damage as indicated by elevated levels of MDA content in treated samples in comparison to control. Proline content levels were also high in Cd treated seedlings indicating stress. Results demonstrated that pretreatment with phytohormones and proline before Cd were found to improve all morphological parameters, by altering antioxidant enzymes activities along with a decrease in MDA and proline contents as well. It was further noticed that the performance of GA 3 was better at 0.3 mM Cd treatment while SA was found to be a good mitigating agent at 0.5 mM Cd stress in all tested mung bean varieties. This research concluded less deleterious effects of Cd on AZRI-2006 while more sensitivity to NM-51 towards Cd. Priming with phytohormones and proline is a user-friendly, economical, and simple mitigation strategy to reduce Cd toxicity in plants and get better yield from contaminated lands."
https://openalex.org/W3203724578,"Major gaps remain in our knowledge of the early history of Homo sapiens in Wallacea. By 70-60 thousand years ago (ka), modern humans appear to have entered this distinct biogeographical zone between continental Asia and Australia. Despite this, there are relatively few Late Pleistocene sites attributed to our species in Wallacea. H. sapiens fossil remains are also rare. Previously, only one island in Wallacea (Alor in the southeastern part of the archipelago) had yielded skeletal evidence for pre-Holocene modern humans. Here we report on the first Pleistocene human skeletal remains from the largest Wallacean island, Sulawesi. The recovered elements consist of a nearly complete palate and frontal process of a modern human right maxilla excavated from Leang Bulu Bettue in the southwestern peninsula of the island. Dated by several different methods to between 25 and 16 ka, the maxilla belongs to an elderly individual of unknown age and sex, with small teeth (only M1 to M3 are extant) that exhibit severe occlusal wear and related dental pathologies. The dental wear pattern is unusual. This fragmentary specimen, though largely undiagnostic with regards to morphological affinity, provides the only direct insight we currently have from the fossil record into the identity of the Late Pleistocene people of Sulawesi."
https://openalex.org/W3202345756,"Photoreceptive inputs to the teleost brain are perceived as image of the visual world and as photo-modulation of neuroendocrine and neuronal signals. The retina and pineal organ are major receptive organs with projections to various parts of the brain, but in the past decades deep brain photoreceptors have emerged as candidates for photoreceptive inputs, either independent or in combination with projections from light sensory organs. This study aimed to test the effects of narrow bandwidth light using light-emitting diodes technology on brain neural activity through putative opsin stimulation in Atlantic salmon. The expression of c-fos , a known marker of neural activity, was compared in situ between dark-adapted salmon parr and following light stimulation with different wavelengths. c-fos expression increased with duration of light stimulation and the strongest signal was obtained in fish exposed to light for 120 minutes. Distinct and specific brain regions were activated following dark to light stimulation, such as the habenula, suprachiasmatic nucleus, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The c-fos expression was overlapping with photoreceptors expressing melanopsin and/or vertebrate ancient opsin, suggesting a potential direct activation by light. Interestingly in the habenula, a distinct ring of vertebrate ancient opsin and melanopsin expressing cells is overlapping with c-fos expression after neural activation. Salmon exposed to different spectra had neural activation in similar brain regions. The most apparent difference was melanopsin expression in the lateral cells of the lateral tuberal nuclus in the hypothalamus, which appeared to be specifically activated by red light. Light-stimulated neuronal activity in the deep brain was limited to subpopulations of neurons, mainly in regions with neuronal modulation activity, retinal and pineal innervations and known presence of nonvisual photoreceptors. The overlapping expression patterns of c-fos and nonvisual opsins support direct light stimulation of deep brain photoreceptors and the importance of these systems in light induced brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W3202400879,"Heme, a near ubiquitous cofactor, is synthesized by most organisms. The essential step of insertion of iron into the porphyrin macrocycle is mediated by the enzyme ferrochelatase. Several ferrochelatases have been characterized, and it has been experimentally shown that a fraction of them contain [2Fe-2S] clusters. It has been suggested that all metazoan ferrochelatases have such clusters, but among bacteria, these clusters have been most commonly identified in Actinobacteria and a few other bacteria. Despite this, the function of the [2Fe-2S] cluster remains undefined. With the large number of sequenced genomes currently available, we comprehensively assessed the distribution of putative [2Fe-2S] clusters throughout the ferrochelatase protein family. We discovered that while rare within the bacterial ferrochelatase family, this cluster is prevalent in a subset of phyla. Of note is that genomic data show that the cluster is not common in Actinobacteria, as is currently thought based on the small number of actinobacterial ferrochelatases experimentally examined. With available physiological data for each genome included, we identified a correlation between the presence of the microbial cluster and aerobic metabolism. Additionally, our analysis suggests that Firmicute ferrochelatases are the most ancient and evolutionarily preceded the Alphaproteobacterial precursor to eukaryotic mitochondria. These findings shed light on distribution and evolution of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in ferrochelatases and will aid in determining the function of the cluster in heme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3203868297,"This study aimed to assess potential feeding effect of camel milk curd mass and its mixes to experimental rat's blood serum biochemical parameters, enzymatic activity and the peptide toxicity. Fifty healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 10 each). Each group was fed with camel milk pure curd mass and its mixes for 16 days. At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed to collect the samples from the blood serum. Blood serum biochemical parameters total protein, cholesterol, glucose, albumin, triglycerides; the enzymatic activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase were determined on the A25 automatic analyser, and peptide toxicity analysed by the reference method. The statistical data have shown no significant differences in body weight gain in all groups. Total protein decreased in group II, IV, and V; however, it increased in group III compared to the control group. Cholesterol grew up in group II and it slightly increased in group V, dropped in groups III and IV compared to group I result. Glucose increased in groups II, III, IV compared to group I; still, group V results show a slight decrease. Albumin decreased in group IV, yet in group V it increased than the group I result. Simultaneously, groups II and III results were changed with less percentage. Triglyceride grew up in groups II, V, and it dropped significantly in groups III, IV compared to the control group. De Ritis ratio of enzymes in groups II, III, and IV fluctuated between 1.31 and 0.98 IU/L; however, group V demonstrated significant data versus group I. Diets peptide toxicity in all groups was lower than control group data. The experimental results indicated that curd mass from camel milk could be used as a pure or with additives and it did not discover the observed side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3204524037,"The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence and nature of immune-related endocrine adverse events (irAEs) among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab. Methods: The study group included 35 patients (15 women, 20 men, 65.8 ± 7.1 years) with NSCLC in stage IIIB (n = 16, 45.7%) and IV (n = 19,54.3%) who were treated with nivolumab. Results: Of the studied patients, 34.3% (n = 12) developed endocrine irAEs (irAE group): 22.9% (n = 8) hyperthyroidism and 8.6% (n = 3) hypothyroidism, and in one case, hypophysitis was observed. The median irAEs onset time was 2 months. In the group of patients with thyroid disorders, permanent hypothyroidism eventually developed in 58.3%. The severity of the analyzed irAEs ranged from mild to moderate (Grade 1–2); the case of hypophysitis was estimated as Grade 3. The comparison of progression-free survival time (PFS) between the two groups showed longer PFS in patients in the irAE group (p = 0.021). Patients with irAE were treated significantly longer with nivolumab and they received more doses of nivolumab, however in Cox analysis we did not find patients with irAE to experience progression later than patients without them. Conclusions: Nivolumab therapy is associated with an increased risk of endocrine adverse effects, particularly thyroid dysfunction. Endocrine adverse effects can be successfully treated pharmacologically and usually do not require discontinuation of immunotherapy. The relationship between a better cancer prognosis in patients who developed endocrine irAE has not been found."
https://openalex.org/W3204589344,"Prostate cancer (PCa) that progresses after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains incurable. The underlying mechanisms that account for the ultimate emergence of resistance to ADT, progressing to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), include those that reactivate androgen receptor (AR), or those that are entirely independent or cooperate with androgen signaling to underlie PCa progression. The intricacy of metabolic pathways associated with PCa progression spurred us to develop a metabolism-centric analysis to assess the metabolic shift occurring in PCa that progresses with low AR expression. We used PCa patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to assess the metabolic changes after castration of tumor-bearing mice and subsequently confirmed main findings in human donor tumor that progressed after ADT. We found that relapsed tumors had a significant increase in fatty acids and ketone body (KB) content compared with baseline. We confirmed that critical ketolytic enzymes (ACAT1, OXCT1, BDH1) were dysregulated after castrate-resistant progression. Further, these enzymes are increased in the human donor tissue after progressing to ADT. In an in silico approach, increased ACAT1, OXCT1, BDH1 expression was also observed for a subset of PCa patients that relapsed with low AR and ERG (ETS-related gene) expression. Further, expression of these factors was also associated with decreased time to biochemical relapse and decreased progression-free survival. Our studies reveal the key metabolites fueling castration resistant progression in the context of a partial or complete loss of AR dependence."
https://openalex.org/W3203173536,"Alternative splicing of the gene MAPT produces several isoforms of tau protein. Overexpression of these isoforms is characteristic of tauopathies, which are currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases. Though non-canonical functions of tau have drawn interest, the role of tau isoforms in these diseases has not been fully examined and may reveal new details of tau-driven pathology. In particular, tau has been shown to promote activation of transposable elements-highly regulated nucleotide sequences that replicate throughout the genome and can promote immunologic responses and cellular stress. This study examined tau isoforms' roles in promoting cell damage and dysregulation of genes and transposable elements at a family-specific and locus-specific level. We performed immunofluorescence, Western blot and cytotoxicity assays, along with paired-end RNA sequencing on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells infected with lentiviral constructs of tau isoforms and treated with amyloid-beta oligomers. Our transcriptomic findings were validated using publicly available RNA-sequencing data from Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and control human samples from the Accelerating Medicine's Partnership for AD (AMP-AD). Significance for biochemical assays was determined using Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests and false discovery rate. Transcriptome analysis was conducted through DESeq2 and the TEToolkit suite available from the Hammell lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Our analyses show overexpression of different tau isoforms and their interactions with amyloid-beta in SH-SY5Y cells result in isoform-specific changes in the transcriptome, with locus-specific transposable element dysregulation patterns paralleling those seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Locus-level transposable element expression showed increased dysregulation of L1 and Alu sites, which have been shown to drive pathology in other neurological diseases. We also demonstrated differences in rates of cell death in SH-SY5Y cells depending on tau isoform overexpression. These results demonstrate the importance of examining tau isoforms' role in neurodegeneration and of further examining transposable element dysregulation in tauopathies and its role in activating the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3203203632,"This paper uses data from a community cross-sectional survey to examine the factors that are associated with justification of physical violence against women. Results indicate that respondents who were married at the time of the survey were less likely (OR = 0.29; CI = 0.17-0.52) to agree that it is justified for a man to physically assault his partner that their counterparts who were single. The likelihood to justify physical violence was less likely to happen among respondents with primary education (OR = 0.49; CI = 0.39-0.62), secondary education (OR = 0.40; CI = 0.31-0.53) and vocation or tertiary education (OR = 0.28; CI = 0.19-0.41) than among respondents with no education. Protestants were less likely (OR = 0.77; CI = 0.64-0.94) to justify physical violence than the Catholics. Respondents who were not formally employed were more likely (OR = 1.66; CI = 1.32-2.08) to justify physical violence than their counterparts who were in formal employment in the last three months preceding the survey. Respondents who agreed that it is okay for a man to control his partner's movements (OR = 1.27; CI = 1.04-1.55), it is okay for a man to have sex with his wife anytime (OR = 2.28; CI = 1.87-2.78), alcohol is the main reason for violence against women (OR = 1.67; CI = 1.33-2.10), men need sex more than women (OR = 1.57; CI = 1.23-1.99) and women know where to obtain support in case of violence (OR = 1.42; CI = 1.00-2.02) were more likely to justify physical violence than respondents who disagreed. The likelihood to justify physical violence was less among respondents who agreed that: violence is not the only way to deal with disagreements (OR = 0.54; CI = 0.33-0.86), it is possible for men to stop violence (OR = 0.62; CI = 0.47-0.82) and it is acceptable for a woman to ask her partner to use a condom (OR = 0.61; CI = 0.51-0.73) than their counterparts who disagreed. There is need to increase investment in social norms change programmes in order to strengthen contestation of tolerance of physical violence among men and women in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W3202293178,"Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are very commonly prescribed for prevention of serious vascular events, but are also associated with serious medication-related bleeding. Mitigation of harm is believed to require high-quality OAC management. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for optimal OAC management from the perspective of patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Methods Using a qualitative descriptive study design, we conducted five focus groups, three with patients and caregivers and two with health care providers, in two health regions in Southwestern Ontario. An expert facilitator led the discussions using a semi-structured interview guide. Each session was digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymized. Transcripts were analyzed in duplicate using conventional content analysis. Results Forty-two (19 patients, 7 caregivers, and 16 providers including physicians, nurses and pharmacists) participated. More than half of the patients received OAC for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (57.9%) and the majority (94.7%) were on chronic therapy (defined as &gt;3 years). Data analysis organized codes describing barriers and facilitators into 4 main themes—medication-related, patient-related, provider-related, and system-related. Barriers highlighted were problems with medication access due to cost, patient difficulties with adherence, knowledge and adjusting their lifestyles to OAC therapy, provider expertise, time for adequate communication amongst providers and their patients, and health care system inadequacies in supporting communications and monitoring. Facilitators identified generally addressed these barriers. Conclusions Many barriers to optimal OAC management exist even in the era of DOACs, many of which are amenable to facilitators of improved care coordination, patient education, and adherence monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3202823169,"This study aims to measure the efficacy of drinking water in terms of the economic impacts and risk of illness involved in using perilous water sources. Socio-economic factors were also considered. A multidisciplinary approach was employed to analyze the data, including the cost of illness (COI), regression technique, and irrigation water efficiency methods. The primary data set consisted of 210 peri-urban and urban households. It was found that the average cost of illness was higher in peri-urban ($10.79 USD) areas, while willingness to pay for quality water was higher in urban residents. Social status, income, and family size was positively associated with the cost of illness, while education, the source of drinking water (ground water and others), and awareness about safe drinking were negatively associated with the cost of illness. Furthermore, urban residents were more efficient in terms of conveyance and water use. This is one of the first studies to apply irrigation water efficiency methods to measure drinking water efficiency. The results are timely and important with both practical and social implications, including guiding policy framework. It is suggested that family planning programs be made more effective to control family size. The filtration plants to enhance drinking water quality be installed in the central places of each town/division/union council. A public-private partnership could work to provide affordable quality drinking water."
https://openalex.org/W3202960137,"In breast cancer the transcription factor SOX4 has been shown to be associated with poor survival, increased tumor size and metastasis formation. This has mostly been attributed to the ability of SOX4 to regulate Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). However, SOX4 regulates target gene transcription in a context-dependent manner that is determined by the cellular and epigenetic state. In this study we have investigated the loss of SOX4 in mammary tumor development utilizing organoids derived from a PyMT genetic mouse model of breast cancer. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to abrogate SOX4 expression, we found that SOX4 is required for inhibiting differentiation by regulating a subset of genes that are highly activated in fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSC). In this way, SOX4 re-activates an oncogenic transcriptional program that is regulated in many progenitor cell-types during embryonic development. SOX4-knockout organoids are characterized by the presence of more differentiated cells that exhibit luminal or basal gene expression patterns, but lower expression of cell cycle genes. In agreement, primary tumor growth and metastatic outgrowth in the lungs are impaired in SOX4KO tumors. Finally, SOX4KO tumors show a severe loss in competitive capacity to grow out compared to SOX4-proficient cells in primary tumors. Our study identifies a novel role for SOX4 in maintaining mammary tumors in an undifferentiated and proliferative state. Therapeutic manipulation of SOX4 function could provide a novel strategy for cancer differentiation therapy, which would promote differentiation and inhibit cycling of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W3203218656,"Proliferating cells coordinate histone and DNA synthesis to maintain correct stoichiometry for chromatin assembly. Histone mRNA levels must be repressed when DNA replication is inhibited to prevent toxicity and genome instability due to free non-chromatinized histone proteins. In mammalian cells, replication stress triggers degradation of histone mRNAs, but it is unclear if this mechanism is conserved from other species. The aim of this study was to identify the histone mRNA decay pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine the mechanism by which DNA replication stress represses histone mRNAs. Using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, we show here that histone mRNAs can be degraded by both 5' → 3' and 3' → 5' pathways; however, replication stress does not trigger decay of histone mRNA in yeast. Rather, replication stress inhibits transcription of histone genes by removing the histone gene-specific transcription factors Spt10p and Spt21p from histone promoters, leading to disassembly of the preinitiation complexes and eviction of RNA Pol II from histone genes by a mechanism facilitated by checkpoint kinase Rad53p and histone chaperone Asf1p. In contrast, replication stress does not remove SCB-binding factor transcription complex, another activator of histone genes, from the histone promoters, suggesting that Spt10p and Spt21p have unique roles in the transcriptional downregulation of histone genes during replication stress. Together, our data show that, unlike in mammalian cells, replication stress in yeast does not trigger decay of histone mRNAs but inhibits histone transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3202251114,"Objective To analyze trends in urinary tract infection hospitalization (cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis and non-specified UTI) among patients over 65 years in Spain from 2000–2015. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study using the Spanish Hospitalization Minimum Data Set (CMBD), with codifications by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). We collected data on sex, age, type of discharge, main diagnosis, comorbid diagnosis, length of stay, and global cost. All the hospitalizations were grouped by age into three categories: 65–74 years old, 75–84 years old, and 85 years old and above. In the descriptive statistical analysis, crude rates were defined as hospitalizations per 1,000 inhabitants aged ≥65. To identify trends over time, we performed a Joinpoint regression. Results From 2000–2015, we found 387,010 hospitalizations coded as UTIs (54,427 pyelonephritis, 15,869 prostatitis, 2643 cystitis and 314,071 non-specified UTI). The crude rate of hospitalization for UTIs between 2000 and 2015 ranged from 2.09 in 2000 to 4.33 in 2015 Rates of hospitalization were higher in men than in women, except with pyelonephritis. By age group, higher rates were observed in patients aged 85 years or older, barring prostatitis-related hospitalizations. Joinpoint analyses showed an average annual percentage increase (AAPC) in incidence rates of 4.9% (95% CI 3.2;6.1) in UTI hospitalizations. We observed two joinpoints, in 2010 and 2013, that found trends of 5.5% between 2000 and 2010 (95% CI 4.7;6.4), 1.5% between 2010 and 2013 (95% CI -6.0;9.6) and 6.8% between 2013 and 2015 (95% CI -0.3;14.4). Conclusions The urinary infection-related hospitalization rate in Spain doubled during the period 2000–2015. The highest hospitalization rates occurred in men, in the ≥85 years old age group, and in non-specified UTIs. There were increases in all types of urinary tract infection, with non-specified UTIs having the greatest growth. Understanding these changing trends can be useful for health planning."
https://openalex.org/W3202283796,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is as a highly aggressive and heterogeneous hematological malignancy. MiR-20a-5p has been reported to function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in several tumors, but the clinical significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-20a-5p in AML cells have not been fully understood. In this study, we found miR-20a-5p was significantly decreased in bone marrow from AML patients, compared with that in healthy controls. Moreover, decreased miR-20a-5p expression was correlated with risk status and poor survival prognosis in AML patients. Overexpression of miR-20a-5p suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in two AML cell lines (THP-1 and U937) using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, miR-20a-5p overexpression attenuated tumor growth in vivo by performing tumor xenograft experiments. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot demonstrated that protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (PPP6C) as a target gene of miR-20a-5p was negatively regulated by miR-20a-5p in AML cells. Furthermore, PPP6C knockdown imitated, while overexpression reversed the effects of miR-20a-5p overexpression on AML cell proliferation, cell cycle G1/S transition and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-20a-5p/PPP6C represent a new therapeutic target for AML and a potential diagnostic marker for AML therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3202571648,"Dysregulated expression of the secretory protein renalase can promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) growth in animal models. We characterized renalase expression in premalignant and malignant PDAC tissue and investigated whether plasma renalase levels corresponded to clinical PDAC characteristics. Renalase immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of renalase in normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, PDAC precursor lesions, and PDAC tissues. Associations between pretreatment plasma renalase and PDAC clinical status were assessed in patients with varied clinical stages of PDAC and included tumor characteristics, surgical resection in locally advanced/borderline resectable PDAC, and overall survival. Data were retrospectively obtained and correlated using non-parametric analysis. Little to no renalase was detected by histochemistry in the normal pancreatic head in the absence of abdominal trauma. In chronic pancreatitis, renalase immunoreactivity localized to peri-acinar spindle-shaped cells in some samples. It was also widely present in PDAC precursor lesions and PDAC tissue. Among 240 patients with PDAC, elevated plasma renalase levels were associated with worse tumor characteristics, including greater angiolymphatic invasion (80.0% vs. 58.1%, p = 0.012) and greater node positive disease (76.5% vs. 56.5%, p = 0.024). Overall survival was worse in patients with high plasma renalase levels with median follow-up of 27.70 months vs. 65.03 months (p &lt; 0.001). Renalase levels also predicted whether patients with locally advanced/borderline resectable PDAC underwent resection (AUC 0.674; 95%CI 0.42–0.82, p = 0.04). Overall tissue renalase was increased in both premalignant and malignant PDAC tissues compared to normal pancreas. Elevated plasma renalase levels were associated with advanced tumor characteristics, decreased overall survival, and reduced resectability in patients with locally advanced/borderline resectable PDAC. These studies show that renalase levels are increased in premalignant pancreatic tissues and that its levels in plasma correspond to the clinical behavior of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3203490343,"The roles of natural and anthropogenic factors in contributing to the organization of biodiversity at large and small scales have long been challenging to disentangle, and doing so has never been attempted for the island province of Hainan in China based on patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of endemic plants on the island as a function of anthropogenic and natural variables based on non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and generated generalized linear models (GLMs). We found that the highest phylogenetic diversity (1006) and the lowest mean phylogenetic distance (515.5) was in the provincial capital, Haikou. The NMDS analyses indicated that taxonomic diversity was significantly correlated with industrial revenue (p = 0.006) and population (p = 0.004). Furthermore, most phylogenetic diversity indices were strongly correlated with population and agricultural revenue, while the sampled natural environmental variables were not significantly correlated with plant diversity indices. These findings indicate that anthropogenic factors are the main present-day driving forces of plant diversity in Hainan, though we did detect a significant latitudinal diversity gradient of richness that likely reflects the historical roles of natural environmental factors in the organization of biodiversity on the island. Overall, our results are alarming for biodiversity of the island and indicate that conservation and sustainable use of endemic plant species must be made a critical priority."
https://openalex.org/W3204443300,"Understanding signaling pathways that regulate pancreatic β-cell function to produce, store, and release insulin, as well as pathways that control β-cell proliferation, is vital to find new treatments for diabetes mellitus. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling is involved in a broad range of β-cell functions. The canonical TGF-β signaling pathway functions through intracellular smads, including smad2 and smad3, to regulate cell development, proliferation, differentiation, and function in many organs. Here, we demonstrate the role of TGF-β/smad2 signaling in regulating mature β-cell proliferation and function using β-cell-specific smad2 null mutant mice. β-cell-specific smad2-deficient mice exhibited improved glucose clearance as demonstrated by glucose tolerance testing, enhanced in vivo and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased β-cell mass and proliferation. Furthermore, when these mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce hyperglycemia, they again showed improved glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. In addition, ex vivo analysis of smad2-deficient islets showed that they displayed increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and upregulation of genes involved in insulin synthesis and insulin secretion. Thus, we conclude that smad2 could represent an attractive therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W3204518398,"Nutritional manipulations early in life have been shown to influence growth rate and elicit long lasting effects which in turn has been found to impact lifespan. Therefore, we studied the long-term effects of pre-weaning dietary restriction implemented by litter expansion (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 pups per dam: LS4, LS6, LS8, LS10, LS12) on male and female C57BL/6J mice. After weaning, these mice were fed ad libitum a commercial lab chow for the 15-month duration of the study. The male mice from large litter size (LS12) were significantly leaner and had reduced total fat mass compared to the normal size litters (LS 6) starting from weaning through to 15 months of age. Male LS10 & 12 mice also showed significant reduction in their fat depot masses at 15 months of age: gonadal, subcutaneous, and brown fat whereas the females did not mimic these findings. At 9 months of age, only male LS12 mice showed improved glucose tolerance and male LS12 mice also showed improved insulin tolerance starting at 5 months of age. In addition, we found that the male LS8, 10 & 12 mice at 15 months of age showed significantly reduced IGF-1 levels in the serum and various other organs (liver, gastrocnemius and brain cortex). Interestingly, the female LS8, 10, 12 mice showed a different pattern with reduced IGF-1 levels in serum, liver and gastrocnemius but not in the brain cortex. Similarly, the litter expanded mice showed sex specific response to levels of FGF21 and adiponectin with only the male mice showing increased FGF21 and adiponectin levels at 15 months of age. In summary, our data show that, litter expansion results in long-lasting metabolic changes that are age and sex dependent with the male mice showing an early and robust response compared to female mice."
https://openalex.org/W3202586606,"Background The Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM) assesses the patients’ individual risk for postsurgical intrahospital death based on preoperative parameters. We hypothesized that mortality predicted by the POSPOM varies depending on the level of postoperative care. Methods All patients age over 18 years undergoing inpatient surgery or interventions involving anesthesia at a German university hospital between January 2006, and December 2017, were assessed for eligibility for this retrospective study. Endpoint was death in hospital following surgery. Adaptation of the POSPOM to the German coding system was performed as previously described. The whole cohort was divided according to the level of postoperative care (normal ward vs. intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 24 h vs. later than 24 h, respectively). Results 199,258 patients were finally included. Observed intrahospital mortality was 2.0% (4,053 deaths). 9.6% of patients were transferred to ICU following surgery, and mortality of those patients was increased already at low POSPOM values of 15. 17,165 patients were admitted to ICU within 24 h, and these patients were older, had more comorbidities, or underwent more invasive surgery, reflected by a higher median POSPOM score compared to the normal-ward group (29 vs. 17, p &lt;0.001). Mortality in that cohort was significantly increased to 8.7% (p &lt;0.001). 2,043 patients were admitted to ICU later than 24 h following surgery (therefore denoted unscheduled admission), and the median POSPOM value of that group was 23. Observed mortality in this cohort was highest (13.5%, p &lt;0.001 vs. ICU admission &lt;24 h cohort). Conclusion Increased mortality in patients transferred to high-care wards reflects the significance of, e.g., intra- or early postoperative events for the patients’ outcome. Therefore, scoring systems considering only preoperative variables such as the POSPOM reveal limitations to predict the individual benefit of postoperative ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W3202863672,"With the constant surge of strawberry cultivation and human demand, widespread concern has been expressed about the severe soil and plant health problems caused by continuous strawberry cropping, particularly monocropping in greenhouses. Effective microorganisms (EM) and Bacillus subtilis (BS) have been extensively commercialized as biological control agents (BCAs) to promote plant growth and yield enhancement. However, their effects on soil microbes are obscure. To regulate the microbial community in continuous cropping strawberry soils, we developed four soil amendments based on these two BCAs by adding low and high contents of compost. The amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal ribosomal markers was applied to study the response of the soil microbiome structure. We noticed a sharp increase in bacterial diversity after adding EM-treated high compost and BS-treated low compost, while there was no significant change in fungal diversity among treatments. Through taxonomic classification and FUNGuild analysis, we found that the application of soil amendments resulted in a significant decline in the relative abundance of fungal plant pathogens (Rhizopus, Penicillium and Fusarium) in the soils; accordingly, the metabolic functions of a range of detrimental fungi were inhibited. Correlation analysis indicated that soil microbial community was indirectly driven by soil physicochemical properties. Co-occurrence networks revealed that soil amendments contributed to the connectivity of bacterial network, and EM-treated with high compost was the most complex and balanced. Collectively, EM-treated high compost and BS-treated low compost can well regulate the microbial community structure and thus maintain soil health."

From biological systems to environmental modifications, from quantum fields to high energy collisions, or from the number of contacts one person has, on average, to the flux of vehicles in the streets of urban centres, all these complex, non-linear problems are better understood under the light of the scale-free network’s properties. A few mechanisms have been found to explain the emergence of scale invariance in complex networks, and here we discuss a mechanism based on the way information is locally spread among agents in a scale-free network. We show that the correct description of the information dynamics is given in terms of the q-exponential function, with the power-law behaviour arising in the asymptotic limit. This result shows that the best statistical approach to the information dynamics is given by Tsallis Statistics. We discuss the main properties of the information spreading process in the network and analyse the role and behaviour of some of the parameters as the number of agents increases. The different mechanisms for optimization of the information spread are discussed."

Nodulating plants and their N-fixing symbionts may play a role in increasing Martian soil fertility. On Earth, clover ( Melilotus officinalis ) forms a symbiotic relationship with the N-fixing bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti ; clover has been previously grown in simulated regolith yet without bacterial inoculation. In this study, we inoculated clover with S . meliloti grown in potting soil and regolith to test the hypothesis that plants grown in regolith can form the same symbiotic associations as in soils and to determine if greater plant biomass occurs in the presence of S . meliloti regardless of growth media. We also examined soil NH 4 concentrations to evaluate soil augmentation properties of nodulating plants and symbionts. Greater biomass occurred in inoculated compared to uninoculated groups; the inoculated average biomass in potting mix and regolith (2.23 and 0.29 g, respectively) was greater than the uninoculated group (0.11 and 0.01 g, respectively). However, no significant differences existed in NH 4 composition between potting mix and regolith simulant. Linear regression analysis results showed that: i) symbiotic plant-bacteria relationships differed between regolith and potting mix, with plant biomass positively correlated to regolith-bacteria interactions; and, ii) NH 4 production was limited to plant uptake yet the relationships in regolith and potting mix were similar. It is promising that plant-legume symbiosis is a possibility for Martian soil colonization."

If untreated, there may be detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of the woman and to her baby. There is a need for improved tools and approaches that can be easily and broadly implemented to effectively detect depression during the perinatal period. Early identification of depression during pregnancy is an important first step towards connecting women to treatment and preventing continued depression into the postpartum or beyond. This report provides preliminary findings from a pilot study of a digital screening app for perinatal depression expiring potential for app reach, engagement, and user demographics and mental health symptoms. With mainly passive recruitment efforts, we collected cross-sectional mental health data on over 700 women during the perinatal period, including women across over 30 countries. We report on mean depression scores among women during pregnancy and the postpartum as well as on constructs that are commonly comorbid with depression, including anxiety, sleep dysregulation, and perceived stress. Over half of the women during pregnancy and over 70% of women in the postpartum had a depression score indicative of clinical depression. Future research directions for this work and potential for public health impact are discussed, including longitudinal data collection and analyses of symptomology over time and embedding evidence-based digital therapeutics into the app as a means to increase access to mental health services."
https://openalex.org/W3204461818,"Catechol-estrogens can cause genetic mutations and to counteract their oncogenicity, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is capable of neutralizing these reactive compounds. In this study, we determined the functional effects and regulation of COMT in prostate cancer. Both the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens demonstrated a reduction of COMT expression in prostate cancer. Also, western analyses of prostate cancer cell lines show COMT levels to be minimal in DuPro and DU145 and thus, these cells were used for further analyses. Re-expression of COMT led to suppressed migration ability (wound healing assay) and enhanced apoptosis (flow cytometric analyses), and when challenged with 4-hydroxyestradiol, a marked reduction of cell proliferation (MTT assay) was observed. Xenograft growth in athymic mice also resulted in inhibition due to COMT. As a mechanism, western analyses show cleaved CASP3 and BID were increased whereas XIAP and cIAP2 were reduced due to COMT. As COMT expression is low in prostate cancer, its regulation was determined. Databases identified several miRNAs capable of binding COMT and of these, miR-195 was observed to be increased in prostate cancer according to TCGA. Real-time PCR validated upregulation of miR-195 in clinical prostate cancer specimens as well as DuPro and DU145 and interestingly, luciferase reporter showed miR-195 capable of binding COMT and overexpressing miR-195 could reduce COMT in cells. These results demonstrate COMT to play a protective role by activating the apoptosis pathway and for miR-195 to regulate its expression. COMT may thus be a potential biomarker and gene of interest for therapeutic development for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3204963560,"The zinc finger transcription factor Mxr1p regulates the transcription of genes involved in methanol, acetate, and amino acid metabolism of the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris (a.k.a. Komagataella phaffii) by binding to Mxr1p response elements in their promoters. Here, we demonstrate that Mxr1p is a key regulator of ethanol metabolism as well. Using transcriptomic analysis, we identified target genes of Mxr1p that mediate ethanol metabolism, including ALD6-1 encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase. ALD6-1 is essential for ethanol metabolism, and the ALD6-1 promoter harbors three Mxr1p response elements to which Mxr1p binds in vitro and activates transcription in vivo. We show that a nine-amino acid transactivation domain located between amino acids 365 and 373 of Mxr1p is essential for the transactivation of ALD6-1 to facilitate ethanol metabolism. Mxr1N250, containing the N-terminal 250 amino acids of Mxr1p, localized to the nucleus of cells metabolizing ethanol dependent on basic amino acid residues present between amino acids 75 and 85. While the N-terminal 400 amino acids of Mxr1p are sufficient for the activation of target genes essential for ethanol metabolism, the region between amino acids 401 and 1155 was also required for the regulation of genes essential for methanol metabolism. Finally, we identified several novel genes whose expression is differentially regulated by Mxr1p during methanol metabolism by DNA microarray. This study demonstrates that Mxr1p is a key regulator of ethanol metabolism and provides new insights into the mechanism by which Mxr1p functions as a global regulator of multiple metabolic pathways of P. pastoris."
https://openalex.org/W3203114688,"Background Supervision by surgical specialists is beneficial because they can impart skills to district hospital-level surgical teams. The SURG-Africa project in Zambia comprises a mentoring trial in selected districts, involving two provincial-level mentoring teams. The aim of this paper is to explore policy options for embedding such surgical mentoring in existing policy structures through a participatory modeling approach. Methods Four group model building workshops were held, two each in district and central hospitals. Participants worked in a variety of institutions and had clinical and/or administrative backgrounds. Two independent reviewers compared the causal loop diagrams (CLDs) that resulted from these workshops in a pairwise fashion to construct an integrated CLD. Graph theory was used to analyze the integrated CLD, and dynamic system behavior was explored using the Method to Analyse Relations between Variables using Enriched Loops (MARVEL) method. Results The establishment of a provincial mentoring faculty, in collaboration with key stakeholders, would be a necessary step to coordinate and sustain surgical mentoring and to monitor district-level surgical performance. Quarterly surgical mentoring reviews at the provincial level are recommended to evaluate and, if needed, adapt mentoring. District hospital administrators need to closely monitor mentee motivation. Conclusions Surgical mentoring can play a key role in scaling up district-level surgery but its implementation is complex and requires designated provincial level coordination and regular contact with relevant stakeholders."

Bioinformatic analysis of four coronavirus datasets representing previous outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV), as well as SARS-CoV-2, revealed evidence of diverse host factors that appear to be coopted to facilitate virus-induced suppression of interferon-induced innate immunity, promotion of viral replication and subversion and/or evasion of antiviral immune surveillance.

https://openalex.org/W3204574281,"The first symptoms of schizophrenia (SCHZ) are usually observed during adolescence, a developmental period during which first exposure to psychoactive drugs also occurs. These epidemiological findings point to adolescence as critical for nicotine addiction and SCHZ comorbidity, however it is not clear whether exposure to nicotine during this period has a detrimental impact on the development of SCHZ symptoms since there is a lack of studies that investigate the interactions between these conditions during this period of development. To elucidate the impact of a short course of nicotine exposure across the spectrum of SCHZ-like symptoms, we used a phencyclidine-induced adolescent mice model of SCHZ (2.5mg/Kg, s.c., daily, postnatal day (PN) 38-PN52; 10mg/Kg on PN53), combined with an established model of nicotine minipump infusions (24mg/Kg/day, PN37-44). Behavioral assessment began 4 days after the end of nicotine exposure (PN48) using the following tests: open field to assess the hyperlocomotion phenotype; novel object recognition, a declarative memory task; three-chamber sociability, to verify social interaction and prepulse inhibition, a measure of sensorimotor gating. Phencyclidine exposure evoked deficits in all analyzed behaviors. Nicotine history reduced the magnitude of phencyclidine-evoked hyperlocomotion and impeded the development of locomotor sensitization. It also mitigated the deficient sociability elicited by phencyclidine. In contrast, memory and sensorimotor gating deficits evoked by phencyclidine were neither improved nor worsened by nicotine history. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that nicotine history, restricted to a short period during adolescence, does not worsen SCHZ-like symptoms evoked by a phencyclidine-induced mice model."
https://openalex.org/W3126857239,"This paper uses newly available data from Web of Science on publications matched to researchers in Survey of Doctorate Recipients to compare the quality of scientific publication data collected by surveys versus algorithmic approaches. We illustrate the different types of measurement errors in self-reported and machine-generated data by estimating how publication measures from the two approaches are related to career outcomes (e.g., salaries and faculty rankings). We find that the potential biases in the self-reports are smaller relative to the algorithmic data. Moreover, the errors in the two approaches are quite intuitive: the measurement errors in algorithmic data are mainly due to the accuracy of matching, which primarily depends on the frequency of names and the data that was available to make matches, while the noise in self reports increases over the career as researchers' publication records become more complex, harder to recall, and less immediately relevant for career progress. At a methodological level, we show how the approaches can be evaluated using accepted statistical methods without gold standard data. We also provide guidance on how to use the new linked data."

Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic approved to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). This study evaluated lefamulin anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro in a lipopolysaccharide-induced lung neutrophilia model in which mouse airways were challenged with intranasal lipopolysaccharide. Lefamulin and comparators azithromycin and dexamethasone were administered 30min before lipopolysaccharide challenge; neutrophil infiltration into BALF and inflammatory mediator induction in lung homogenates were measured 4h postchallenge. Single subcutaneous lefamulin doses (10‒140mg/kg) resulted in dose-dependent reductions of BALF neutrophil cell counts, comparable to or more potent than subcutaneous azithromycin (10‒100mg/kg) and oral/intraperitoneal dexamethasone (0.5/1mg/kg). Lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and GM-CSF), chemokine (CXCL-1, CXCL-2, and CCL-2), and MMP-9 levels were significantly and dose-dependently reduced in mouse lung tissue with lefamulin; effects were comparable to or more potent than with dexamethasone or azithromycin. Pharmacokinetic analyses confirmed exposure-equivalence of 30mg/kg subcutaneous lefamulin in mice to a single clinical lefamulin dose to treat CABP in humans (150mg intravenous/600mg oral). In vitro, neither lefamulin nor azithromycin had any relevant influence on lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine/chemokine levels in J774.2 mouse macrophage or human peripheral blood mononuclear cell supernatants, nor were any effects observed on IL-8‒induced human neutrophil chemotaxis. These in vitro results suggest that impediment of neutrophil infiltration by lefamulin in vivo may not occur through direct interaction with macrophages or neutrophilic chemotaxis. This is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of neutrophilic lung infiltration and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine concentrations by clinically relevant lefamulin doses. This anti-inflammatory activity may be beneficial in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or severe inflammation-mediated lung injury, similar to glucocorticoid (eg, dexamethasone) activity. Future lefamulin anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activity studies are warranted to further elucidate mechanism of action and evaluate clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W3203300448,"Background We aim to overcome limitations of previous clinical and population-based studies by merging a clinical registry to routinely-collected healthcare data, and to specifically describe differences in clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization and costs between interferon beta formulations for multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods We included 850 patients with MS treated with interferon beta formulations, from 2015 to 2019, seen at the MS Clinical Care and Research Centre (Federico II University of Naples, Italy) and with linkage to routinely-collected healthcare data (prescription data, hospital admissions, outpatient services). We extracted and computed clinical outcomes (relapses, 6-month EDSS progression using a roving EDSS as reference), persistence (time spent on a specific interferon beta formulation), adherence (medication possession ratio (MPR)), healthcare resource utilization and costs (annualized hospitalization rate (AHR), costs for hospital admissions and DMTs). To evaluate differences between interferon beta formulations, we used linear regression (adherence), Poisson regression (AHR), mixed-effect regression (costs), and Cox-regression models (time varying variables); covariates were age, sex, treatment duration, baseline EDSS and adherence. Results Looking at clinical outcomes, rates of relapses and EDSS progression were lower than studies run on previous cohorts; there was no differences in relapse risk between interferon beta formulations. Risk of discontinuation was higher for Betaferon®/Extavia® (HR = 3.28; 95%CI = 2.11, 5.12; p&lt;0.01). Adherence was lower for Betaferon®/Extavia® (Coeff = -0.05; 95%CI = -0.10, -0.01; p = 0.02), and Avonex® (Coeff = -0.06; 95%CI = -0.11, -0.02; p&lt;0.01), when compared with Rebif® and Plegridy® (Coeff = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.01, 0.16; p = 0.02). AHR and costs for MS hospital admissions were higher for Betaferon®/Extavia® (IRR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.01, 5.55; p = 0.04; Coeff = 14.95; 95%CI = 1.39, 28.51; p = 0.03). Conclusions We have showed the feasibility of merging routinely-collected healthcare data to a clinical registry for future MS research, and have confirmed interferon beta formulations play an important role in the management of MS, with positive clinical outcomes. Differences between interferon beta formulations are mostly driven by adherence and healthcare resource utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3204163232,"We studied the impact of infrastructure networks on relict floodplain forest along three stretches of the Upper Rhine (Kembs-Efringen-Kirchen, Strasbourg-Kehl and Beinheim-Iffezheim) and the Inn-Danube (Mulheim-Obernberg, Passau-Ingling and Engelhartszell-Jochenstein), each on the border between two countries. We analysed land use patterns within a 500 m wide buffer area along the main channel using photo-interpretation and compared the situations between the 1950s, 1980’s and 2010’s. Temporal changes were assessed with transition matrices and selected spatial metrics, including fragmentation indices. Over this period, forest area remained similar at three sites, increased slightly at two sites and decreased at one site. However, on average, 12.5% of floodplain forest had changed location (range: 7.3% (Engelhartszell-Jochenstein)– 26.5% (Kembs-Efringen-Kirchen)). The natural development of unmanaged areas and agricultural abandonment after World War II has led to the emergence of young riparian forests along rivers. In the Upper Rhine region, the results showed asymmetry in these two factors, with unmanaged natural areas most important on the French side and agricultural abandonment on the German side. Along the Inn-Danube, agricultural abandonment has led to an increase or stagnation of floodplain forest areas. In most cases, development of transport infrastructure between the 1950s and 2010s has caused fragmentation of the forest area, reducing the relict forest to a patchy green corridor with reduced functionality and interfacing. To go further and improve the management of these relict forests, we have to investigate the interdependency between practices related to infrastructure operation and the role that biodiversity plays for stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W3204531675,"Otolith shape has previously been used to identify ecotypes within the Icelandic cod (Gadus morhua) stock, using DST profiles to validate the results. Fish otolith shape variation has repeatedly been found to be largely determined by growth rate. To examine the effect of growth rate on the relationship between otolith shape and cod ecotypes (using the Pan I genotype as a proxy for ecotype), 826 archived sagittal otoliths collected over a 58 year sampling period were retrieved, the individual growth rate calculated, and otolith shape described using both Normalized Elliptic Fourier transform and Discrete Wavelet transform. Discriminant functions of otolith shape successfully classified ecotype, whether using Fourier or Wavelet descriptors, but only when excluding a heterozygous genotype from the analysis. The otolith shape variability of this genotype lowered the classification success, while otolith shape, in turn, was significantly affected by growth rate and cohort. Growth rate differences previously reported for the ecotypes were present, but were less marked than expected and indeed, growth rate variance attributable to ecotype identity was dwarfed by cohort- and location-related variance in growth. Such a strong effect of growth rate suggests that cod ecotype discrimination based on otolith shape is sensitive to both temporal and spatial variations in growth, which can mask the effect of ecotype-related growth rate differences on otolith shape."
https://openalex.org/W3204887163,"Introduction In this study correlations between care burden, depression, and personality at intrapsychic level in caregivers of Alzheimer’s disease patients were evaluated. Materials and methods Caregivers: n.40. Tests: Social-schedule; CBI; BDI; SASB-Structural-Analysis of Social Behaviours- Form-A- intrapsychic behaviours (8 Cluster); ECOG. Patients:MMSE. Statistical analysis: Chi-squared test; Anova one way F test; Pearson’s R coefficient. Results Correlations: CBI-total and NPI(p &lt; .001); CBI-total—ECOG (p = .042); CBI-total—BDI(p&lt; .001); CBI- total-SASB-Cl7(p = .014); SASB-CL8(p&lt;0.000); BDI and SASB-Cl 2 (p = .018), SASB-Cl 3 (p = .004), SASB-Cl7(p &lt; .000), SASB-CL8 (p &lt; .000). High CBI is correlated with high depression, neuropsychiatry symptoms, low cognitive patient’s functions. Caregivers have the following intrapsychic behaviors: poor self-care, poor ability to take care of themselves; they exercise control over themselves and do not consider and/or ignore their basic needs at emotional and physical levels. These intrapsychic behaviours are indicators of depression (SASB Model) and are correlated with high care burden–CBI and high depression-CDQ. Discussion Care burden is closely related to the depression and individual personality (intrapsychic experience) of the caregiver. This may reveal a source of strength and may suggest areas of multidimensional and psychotherapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3202394746,"Tracheal stenosis is a refractory and recurrent disease induced by excessive cell proliferation within the restricted tracheal space. We investigated the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which mediates a broad range of intracellular signal transduction processes in tracheal stenosis and the therapeutic effect of the MEK inhibitor which is the upstream kinase of ERK. We histologically analyzed cauterized tracheas to evaluate stenosis using a tracheal stenosis mouse model. Using Western blot, we analyzed the phosphorylation rate of ERK1/2 after cauterization with or without MEK inhibitor. MEK inhibitor was intraperitoneally injected 30 min prior to cauterization (single treatment) or 30 min prior to and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after cauterization (daily treatment). We compared the stenosis of non-inhibitor treatment, single treatment, and daily treatment group. We successfully established a novel mouse model of tracheal stenosis. The cauterized trachea increased the rate of stenosis compared with the normal control trachea. The phosphorylation rate of ERK1 and ERK2 was significantly increased at 5 min after the cauterization compared with the normal controls. After 5 min, the rates decreased over time. The daily treatment group had suppressed stenosis compared with the non-inhibitor treatment group. p-ERK1/2 activation after cauterization could play an important role in the tracheal wound healing process. Consecutive inhibition of ERK phosphorylation is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for tracheal stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W3203438237,"Purpose Limited work has been performed for the implementation of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in breast cancer surveillance imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between two different DBT implementations in breast cancer surveillance imaging, for patients with a personal history of breast cancer. Method The DBT implementations investigated were: (1) 2-view 2D digital mammography and 2-view DBT (2vDM&amp;2vDBT) (2) 1-view (cranial-caudal) DM and 1-view (mediolateral-oblique) DBT (1vDM&amp;1vDBT). Clinical performance of these two implementations was assessed retrospectively using observer studies with 118 sets of real patient images, from a single imaging centre, and six observers. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) using the Jack-knife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROC) analysis were evaluated. Results Results suggest that the two DBT implementations are not significantly different in terms of sensitivity, specificity and AUC. When looking at the two main different lesion types, non-calcifications and calcifications, and two different density levels, no difference in the performance of the two DBT implementations was found. Conclusions Since 1vDM&amp;1vDBT exposes the patient to half the dose of 2vDM&amp;2vDBT, it might be worth considering 1vDM&amp;1vDBT in breast cancer surveillance imaging. However, larger studies are required to conclude on this matter."
https://openalex.org/W3204489582,"In our planned study, we shall empirically study the assessment of cited papers within the framework of the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic. We are interested in the question whether citation decisions are (mainly) driven by the quality of cited references. The design of our study is oriented towards the study by Teplitskiy, Duede [10]. We shall undertake a survey of corresponding authors with an available email address in the Web of Science database. The authors are asked to assess the quality of papers that they cited in previous papers. Some authors will be assigned to three treatment groups that receive further information alongside the cited paper: citation information, information on the publishing journal (journal impact factor), or a numerical access code to enter the survey. The control group will not receive any further numerical information. In the statistical analyses, we estimate how (strongly) the quality assessments of the cited papers are adjusted by the respondents to the anchor value (citation, journal, or access code). Thus, we are interested in whether possible adjustments in the assessments can not only be produced by quality-related information (citation or journal), but also by numbers that are not related to quality, i.e. the access code. The results of the study may have important implications for quality assessments of papers by researchers and the role of numbers, citations, and journal metrics in assessment processes."
