https://openalex.org/W2094405563,"An all-polymer semiconductor integrated device is demonstrated with a high-mobility conjugated polymer field-effect transistor (FET) driving a polymer light-emitting diode (LED) of similar size. The FET uses regioregular poly(hexylthiophene). Its performance approaches that of inorganic amorphous silicon FETs, with field-effect mobilities of 0.05 to 0.1 square centimeters per volt second and ON-OFF current ratios of &gt;10 6 . The high mobility is attributed to the formation of extended polaron states as a result of local self-organization, in contrast to the variable-range hopping of self-localized polarons found in more disordered polymers. The FET-LED device represents a step toward all-polymer optoelectronic integrated circuits such as active-matrix polymer LED displays."

https://openalex.org/W2046353863,"The spatial relation between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in living HeLa cells was analyzed at high resolution in three dimensions with two differently colored, specifically targeted green fluorescent proteins. Numerous close contacts were observed between these organelles, and mitochondria in situ formed a largely interconnected, dynamic network. A Ca 2+ -sensitive photoprotein targeted to the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane showed that, upon opening of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 )–gated channels of the ER, the mitochondrial surface was exposed to a higher concentration of Ca 2+ than was the bulk cytosol. These results emphasize the importance of cell architecture and the distribution of organelles in regulation of Ca 2+ signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2136595562,"The conductance of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was found to be quantized. The experimental method involved measuring the conductance of nanotubes by replacing the tip of a scanning probe microscope with a nanotube fiber, which could be lowered into a liquid metal to establish a gentle electrical contact with a nanotube at the tip of the fiber. The conductance of arc-produced MWNTs is one unit of the conductance quantum G 0 = 2 e 2 / h = (12.9 kilohms) –1 . The nanotubes conduct current ballistically and do not dissipate heat. The nanotubes, which are typically 15 nanometers wide and 4 micrometers long, are several orders of magnitude greater in size and stability than other typical room-temperature quantum conductors. Extremely high stable current densities, J &gt; 10 7 amperes per square centimeter, have been attained."

However, an aversively conditioned masked target can elicit an emotional response from subjects without being consciously perceived. Here we study the mechanism of this unconsciously mediated emotional learning. We measured neural activity in volunteer subjects who were presented with two angry faces, one of which, through previous classical conditioning, was associated with a burst of white noise. In half of the trials, the subjects' awareness of the angry faces was prevented by backward masking with a neutral face. A significant neural response was elicited in the right, but not left, amygdala to masked presentations of the conditioned angry face. Unmasked presentations of the same face produced enhanced neural activity in the left, but not right, amygdala. Our results indicate that, first, the human amygdala can discriminate between stimuli solely on the basis of their acquired behavioural significance, and second, this response is lateralized according to the subjects' level of awareness of the stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2017965567,"Vibrational spectra for a single molecule adsorbed on a solid surface have been obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunneling spectra for an isolated acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) molecule adsorbed on the copper (100) surface showed an increase in the tunneling conductance at 358 millivolts, resulting from excitation of the C-H stretch mode. An isotopic shift to 266 millivolts was observed for deuterated acetylene (C 2 D 2 ). Vibrational microscopy from spatial imaging of the inelastic tunneling channels yielded additional data to further distinguish and characterize the two isotopes. Single-molecule vibrational analysis should lead to better understanding and control of surface chemistry at the atomic level."

An aspartate residue apart from the O 2 reduction site exchanges its effective accessibility to the matrix aqueous phase for one to the cytosolic phase concomitantly with a significant decrease in the pK of its carboxyl group, on reduction of the metal sites. The movement indicates the aspartate as the proton pumping site. A tyrosine acidified by a covalently linked imidazole nitrogen is a possible proton donor for the O 2 reduction by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2079833473,"Combinatorial screening of electrochemical catalysts by current-voltage methods can be unwieldy for large sample sizes. By converting the ions generated in an electrochemical half-cell reaction to a fluorescence signal, the most active compositions in a large electrode array have been identified. A fluorescent acid-base indicator was used to image high concentrations of hydrogen ions, which were generated in the electrooxidation of methanol. A 645-member electrode array containing five elements (platinum, ruthenium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium), 80 binary, 280 ternary, and 280 quaternary combinations was screened to identify the most active regions of phase space. Subsequent ""zoom"" screens pinpointed several very active compositions, some in ternary and quaternary regions that were bounded by rather inactive binaries. The best catalyst, platinum(44)/ruthenium(41)/osmium(10)/iridium(5) (numbers in parentheses are atomic percent), was significantly more active than platinum(50)/ruthenium(50) in a direct methanol fuel cell operating at 60 degreesC, even though the latter catalyst had about twice the surface area of the former."

https://openalex.org/W2010159589,"The ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors contains a transcriptional activation function (AF-2) that mediates hormone-dependent binding of coactivator proteins. Scanning surface mutagenesis on the human thyroid hormone receptor was performed to define the site that binds the coactivators, glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1). The residues involved encircle a small surface that contains a hydrophobic cleft. Ligand activation of transcription involves formation of this surface by folding the carboxyl-terminal alpha helix against a scaffold of three other helices. These features may represent general ones for nuclear receptors."

The mutations are linked to transcription initiation, but non-Ig promoters are permissible for the mutation process; thus, other genes expressed in mutating B cells may also be subject to somatic hypermutation. Significant mutations were not observed in c- MYC , S14 , or α-fetoprotein ( AFP ) genes, but BCL-6 was highly mutated in a large proportion of memory B cells of normal individuals. The mutation pattern was similar to that of Ig genes."

Three biologically important mutations in Usher syndrome type IIa patients were identified in a gene ( USH2A ) isolated from this critical region. The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted size of 171.5 kilodaltons that has laminin epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type III motifs; these motifs are most commonly observed in proteins comprising components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes and in cell adhesion molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2115184998,"The AXR1 (auxin-resistant) protein, which has features of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, is required for normal response to the plant hormone auxin in Arabidopsis thaliana . ECR1 functions together with AXR1 to activate members of the RUB/NEDD8 family of ubiquitin-related proteins. Extracts from mutant seedlings lacking AXR1 did not promote formation of the RUB-ECR1 thiolester, indicating that AXR1 is the major activity in this tissue. AXR1 was localized primarily to the nucleus of dividing and elongating cells, suggesting that the targets of RUB modification are nuclear. These results indicate that auxin response depends on RUB modification of one or more nuclear proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1536878050,"Checkpoint controls ensure that events of the cell-division cycle are completed with fidelity and in the correct order. In budding yeast with a mutation in the motor protein dynein, the mitotic spindle is often misaligned and therefore slow to enter the neck between mother cell and budding daughter cell. When this occurs, cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm into two) is delayed until the spindle is properly positioned. Here we describe mutations that abolish this delay, indicating the existence of a new checkpoint mechanism. One mutation lies in the gene encoding the yeast homologue of EB1, a human protein that binds the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, a tumour suppressor. EB1 is located on microtubules of the mitotic spindle and is important in spindle assembly. EB1 may therefore, by associating with microtubules, contribute to the sensor mechanism that activates the checkpoint. Another mutation affects Stt4, a phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase. Cold temperature is an environmental stimulus that causes misalignment of the mitotic spindle in yeast and appears to activate this checkpoint mechanism."

The xanthophyll cycle is implicated in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from excessive light. Two new sequences for violaxanthin de-epoxidase from tobacco andArabidopsis are described. Although the mature proteins are well conserved, the transit peptides of these proteins are divergent, in contrast to transit peptides from other proteins targeted to the thylakoid lumen. Sequence analyses of both violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase establish the xanthophyll cycle enzymes as members of the lipocalin family of proteins.

The xanthophyll cycle is comprised of de-epoxidation and epoxidation interconversions of three xanthophylls (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin), catalyzed by two enzymes that are localized on opposite sides of the thylakoid membrane. Violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) 1The abbreviation used is: VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase. 1The abbreviation used is: VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase. is localized in the lumen of thylakoids and catalyzes de-epoxidation of violaxanthin in the presence of ascorbate and an acidic lumen, the latter formed by the light-induced proton pump (1Yamamoto H.Y.

Zeaxanthin epoxidase is localized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and catalyzes the epoxidation of zeaxanthin in the dark or under low light intensities (6Hager A. Ber. Dtsch. Bot.

The reaction is optimal near pH 7.5, and the enzyme utilizes oxygen, ferredoxin, and FAD as co-substrates (6Hager A. Ber. Dtsch. Bot. Ges. 1975; 88: 27-44Google Scholar, 7Siefermann D. Yamamoto H.Y.

A role for zeaxanthin was first described in 1987 by Demmig et al. (11Demmig B. Winter K. Krüger A. Czygan F.-C. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 218-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against the adverse effects of excessive light. Recent evidence demonstrates that accumulation of both antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin, along with the transthylakoid pH gradient, mediates the non-radiative dissipation of excess energy as heat (12Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Photosynth.

The xanthophyll cycle is thought to have evolved early in the development of higher plants as it is present in all plants examined thus far (18Demmig-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Pervaiz and Brew (19Pervaiz S. Brew K. Science. 1985; 228: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Pervaiz S. Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) first identified a group of proteins, based on sequence homology, that have a common role in binding and transport of small hydrophobic molecules. These proteins, designated the lipocalins, represent a diverse group of proteins from the animal kingdom (for review see Ref. 21Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) and recently from a prokaryote (22Barker A. Manning P.A. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These lipocalin proteins have a common tertiary structure of an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel, and only one protein to date displays catalytic activity. We report that violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase are members of the lipocalin family. To our knowledge, they are the first lipocalins described from plants and only the second reported to demonstrate enzymatic activity. The deduced polypeptide sequences of three VDE proteins are compared, and the transit peptides are analyzed against other thylakoid lumen proteins. A cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a pooled sample of young tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) leaves using the Timesaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated into λZAPII (Stratagene). TheArabidopsis cDNA library (designated as λPRL2) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. The library was derived from pooled mRNA of various tissues of the Columbia wild type of Arabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. The cDNA libraries were screened using a random primed32P-labeled probe prepared from the coding region of the lettuce violaxanthin de-epoxidase cDNA (23Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed according to Church and Gilbert (24Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar) using a hybridization and washing temperature of 55 °C. Strongly hybridizing cDNAs were excised according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both strands of cDNA were sequenced completely using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. Violaxanthin de-epoxidase cDNAs were isolated and sequenced from Arabidopsis and tobacco. Analysis of the deduced polypeptide sequences of mature VDE proteins indicates high conservation among dicotyledonous plants (Fig. 1). Tobacco VDE shares 91.6 and 89.8% similarity and 82.6 and 82.0% identity with the Arabidopsisand lettuce VDE proteins, respectively. In the mature proteins only nine amino acid positions have different amino acids in all three proteins. All three proteins have a cysteine-rich domain, a lipocalin signature, and a highly charged domain as described previously for the lettuce VDE (23Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The 13 cysteine residues that were reported for the lettuce sequence are invariant in all three proteins. Cysteines are functionally important because dithiothreitol is an inhibitor of VDE (25Yamamoto H.Y. Kamite L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Partial inhibition of VDE activity with low dithiothreitol concentrations results in an accumulation of antheraxanthin (13Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) suggesting that there is more than one disulfide linkage related to activity. One difference between the amino acid sequences is that the lettuce and Arabidopsis VDE have a highly charged peptide repeat (Glu-Val-Glu-Lys) whereas the tobacco sequence does not (underlined sequences in Fig. 1). The significance of this duplication is unknown because it does not appear to affect enzyme activity. Earlier analysis demonstrated that the lettuce VDE transit peptide is a typical bipartite type with an N-terminal portion representing a transit peptide for targeting to the chloroplast stroma followed by a short hydrophobic thylakoid targeting signal peptide-like domain at the C-terminal end of the peptide (23Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Also, the cleavage site for the lettuce VDE was determined from the N-terminal sequence of purified VDE from lettuce (27Rockholm D.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A comparison of the transit peptides for the three VDE proteins reveals no strong overall homology in primary structure except for the N- and C-terminal ends (Fig. 1). The transit peptides have a mean (±S.D.) percent similarity and identity of 49.3 ± 4.1 and 24.8 ± 2.2, respectively. We performed sequence comparisons on transit peptides from six plastocyanin, six 23-kDa polypeptides, and five 33-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II; all are proteins targeted to the thylakoid lumen. Mean percent similarities of 73.4 ± 7.3, 70.4 ± 8.7, and 80.4 ± 4.4 and mean percent identities of 60.6 ± 7.7, 60.4 ± 8.7, and 63.4 ± 5.8 were calculated for plastocyanin and 23- and 33-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex, respectively. In addition, the transit peptides for three zeaxanthin epoxidases, a protein targeted to the chloroplast stroma, have a mean percent similarity and identity of 77.5 ± 12.4 and 70.1 ± 15.4, respectively. The values for similarity and identity among the VDE transit peptides are significantly lower than for the other transit peptides discussed, indicating that the VDE transit peptides are more divergent between plant species. Despite this divergence in the primary structure, the hydropathy profiles for the transit peptides are quite similar (Fig. 2). The transit peptides are mostly hydrophilic except for the C-terminal end, which has a characteristic short hydrophobic region. Another difference is the variable lengths of VDE transit peptides. It was reported earlier that similar proteins in different organisms have comparable transit peptide lengths (29De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, six plastocyanin sequences, five 33-kDa polypeptides, and six 23-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II, all lumenal proteins, have transit peptide lengths of 66–72, 79–85, and 73–82 residues, respectively. However, the three transit peptides for VDE have a range of 113–134 amino acids. Not only are the VDE transit peptides more variable in length, but they are overall significantly longer than the transit peptides from the other lumenal proteins compared above. Two very short regions of local homology are observed in the VDE transit peptides at both ends of the peptide (Fig. 1). At the N terminus all three VDE transit peptides start with a Met-Ala dipeptide. Earlier analysis of 26 transit peptides of stromal proteins revealed that 85% had this same N-terminal dipeptide (30Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Moreover, 18 thylakoid lumen proteins from various dicot plants including plastocyanin and the 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II show this same N-terminal Met-Ala dipeptide. This dipeptide probably signals the removal of the N-terminal methionine (30Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 31Flinta C. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Von Heijne G. Eur. J.

Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic proteins lose their N-terminal methionine co- or post-translationally by a methionine aminopeptidase, especially when the methionine is followed by an alanine. The resulting N-terminal alanine can then be modified by acetylation (31Flinta C. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 32Huang S. Elliott R.C. Liu P.-S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee J.-H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At the cleavage site for the three VDE transit peptides, all exhibit a short homologous region having a consensus sequence of (Ala/Val)-Asp-Ala↓Val-Asp. This fits the consensus pattern for the cleavage site in the precursors of proteins of the thylakoid lumen (Ala-X-Ala↓) and is the same type of cleavage site identified in bacterial signal peptides (30Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 33Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). In addition, the thylakoid lumen protein plastocyanin not only has a very similar consensus (Ala-(Met/Leu)-Ala↓hydrophobic-(Asp/Glu)) as VDE but also has a similar N terminus of the mature protein starting with a hydrophobic residue followed by an acidic residue. While performing a data base search, we identified an almost identical alignment of the Arabidopsis VDE cDNA with a genomic clone containing the Arabidopsis syntaxin-relatedKNOLLE gene (GenBank accession no. U39452). This gene maps to chromosome 1 in Arabidopsis and is located next to the g5957 restriction fragment length polymorphism marker (34Lukowitz W. Mayer U. Jürgens G. Cell. 1996; 84: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). TheArabidopsis VDE gene is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the KNOLLE gene and is in the opposite orientation. According to the polyadenylation sites of both genes, there is at most 141 nucleotides separating the two genes. In addition, we identified an identical match to Arabidopsis VDE in a large genomic fragment from Arabidopsis chromosome 1 recently released to the data base (GenBank accession no. AC003981). It contains the entire VDE sequence along with the promoter. According to the sequence alignments between the cDNA and genomic DNA, the VDE gene contains four introns ranging in size from 77 to 265 nucleotides. Prior analysis of the deduced polypeptide sequence of lettuce VDE identified a lipocalin signature motif (23Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the polypeptide sequences from tobacco and Arabidopsis have this motif as well. The lipocalins are a group of diverse proteins characterized by their ability to bind small hydrophobic (lipophilic) molecules (19Pervaiz S. Brew K. Science. 1985; 228: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,20Pervaiz S. Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although they were originally thought to function only as transport proteins, members of this group have a wide range of roles including retinol transport, cryptic coloration, olfaction, pheromone transport, enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandins, immunomodulation, and regulation of cell homeostasis (21Flower D.R.

North A.C.T. Attwood T.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), x-ray crystallographic structures of lipocalins exhibit a highly conserved folding pattern (36Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A.

Biol. 1987; 198: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Based on these structures, the lipocalin fold is characterized as a single eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 3) with the overall shape resembling a flattened cone-shaped barrel or calyx (37Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar,39Huber R.

The β-barrel encloses an internal ligand binding site and also encloses the bound hydrophobic molecule and minimizes solvent contact (20Pervaiz S. Brew K. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Attwood T.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because the xanthophyll cycle enzymes have a common substrate (antheraxanthin), it is reasonable to consider that zeaxanthin epoxidase may have a similar tertiary structure to VDE. The zeaxanthin epoxidase gene was recently identified from an abscisic acid-deficient mutant of Nicotiana plumbagnifolia that was impaired in zeaxanthin epoxidation (40Marin E. Nussaume L. Quesada A. Gonneau M. Sotta B. Hugueney P. Frey A. Marion-Poll A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The resulting zeaxanthin epoxidase cDNA was also used to isolate cDNAs from pepper (10Bouvier F. D'Harlingue A. Hugueney P. Marin E. Marion-Poll A. Camara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28861-28867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and tomato (41Burbidge A. Grieve T. Terry C. Corlett J. Thompson A. Taylor I. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1749-1750Google Scholar). A motif search using the GCG sequence analysis software was performed with the three deduced polypeptide sequences for zeaxanthin epoxidase, but no lipocalin signature motif was detected. However, after closer examination of the sequences, a lipocalin signature motif can be identified in all three sequences. The lipocalin motif in the zeaxanthin epoxidase sequences has some slight differences that are not accounted for by the consensus sequence for the lipocalin signature motif. The lipocalins are classified as kernel or outlier based on homology of three motifs from three structurally conserved regions of the lipocalin fold (21Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 35Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Attwood T.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 42Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Attwood T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The three structurally conserved regions are localized in: (a) the first β-strand and a short 310-helix preceding this β-strand; (b) portions of the sixth and seventh β-strands including the connecting loop; and (c) a portion of the eighth β-strand including the loop and part of the C-terminal α-helical structure (Fig. 3). In the folded protein these three regions are in close proximity to one another and are localized on one side of the barrel (21Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 42Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Attwood T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The first and largest group is known as the kernel lipocalins and shares homology in all three motifs whereas the other group is known as the outlier lipocalins and is more divergent because significant homology is only observed in motif I (the lipocalin signature). Outlier lipocalins exhibit weaker homology in motifs II and III in contrast to the kernel lipocalins. Sequence alignments of the motifs in a number of lipocalins from diverse species including mammalian, crustacean, insect, and prokaryote illustrate this homology (Fig. 3). Motif I is well conserved in all sequences with the key features of an invariant Gly followed by a positively charged residue in most cases and an invariant Trp followed by a residue with a ring structure. Included in these comparisons are two outlier proteins (human α1-acid glycoprotein and rat von Ebner's gland protein) exhibiting homology in motif I but somewhat less homology in motifs II and III. Also included in this motif comparison is the enzyme prostaglandin D synthase, the only known lipocalin to date to have catalytic activity. Here we introduce violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase to the lipocalin family. They are the first lipocalins identified from plants and are unique in that they also have catalytic activity. These enzymes of the xanthophyll cycle share homology in the structurally conserved regions especially in motif I with the invariant Gly and Trp present. Homology in motifs II and III is much weaker than in kernel lipocalins, suggesting that these enzymes would fall in the class of outlier lipocalins. To further analyze whether the xanthophyll enzymes fit the overall structure of the lipocalin model, the distances between the three motifs were compared for the various lipocalin proteins. Both kernel and outlier lipocalins have the same characteristics with respect to the spacing of the motifs. Typically, the distances between motifs I and II range from 65 to 73 amino acids whereas the range between motifs II and III is 10–17 amino acids (Fig. 4). The tobacco VDE fits the pattern of other lipocalins with distances of 72 and 15 amino acids between motifs I and II and motifs II and III, respectively. The main difference between VDE and the other lipocalins is the long C-terminal tail following motif III. Secondary structure predictions using the PHDsec program (43Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 44Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 45Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar) detected six β-strands in the tobacco VDE within the region spanning the lipocalin motifs. Secondary structure predictions using this program also detected six β-strands in retinol-binding protein, a lipocalin protein known to have eight β-strands within the region spanning the lipocalin motifs as determined by x-ray crystallography (36Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Åqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich N-terminal portion of VDE is predicted to consist of α-helices, and the C-terminal tail with its high concentration of glutamic acid residues is predicted to be a series of long α-helices. Partial protonation of these glutamic acid residues near pH 5.0, the optimal pH for VDE activity (2Hager A. Planta. 1969; 89: 224-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 46Bratt C.E. Arvidsson P.-O. Carlsson M. Åkerlund H.-E. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), may play a role in binding to the thylakoid membrane (23Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Zeaxanthin epoxidase, however, is different in that the distance between motifs I and II is 103 amino acids, much greater than the range for the lipocalin proteins (Fig. 4). This suggests that zeaxanthin epoxidase could have more than eight β-strands or possibly longer loop structures. The distance between motifs II and III falls into the range of the other lipocalins. The PHDsec program for secondary structure (43Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 44Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 45Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar) predicts eight β-strands within the region spanning the lipocalin motifs for tobacco zeaxanthin epoxidase, two more than was detected for tobacco VDE and retinol-binding protein. The remaining N- and C-terminal regions of the tobacco zeaxanthin epoxidase are predicted to consist of both α-helices and β-strands with a predominance of α-helices. Although zeaxanthin epoxidase fits the description of a lipocalin protein based on motif homology, the distance between motifs I and II suggests the protein may have a somewhat modified structure. Nearly two decades ago, a narrow well-like cavity structure was proposed for the active site of VDE based on activity against various substrates (5Yamamoto H.Y. Higashi R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Substrates with all-trans configurations in the acyclic polyene chain (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, neoxanthin, and diadinoxanthin) were all de-epoxidized by VDE whereas no de-epoxidation was observed with substrates having a 9-cisconfiguration. This suggests the putative β-barrel structure is narrow, allowing only the entry of all-trans pigments. Based on the length of the xanthophyll substrates in the 9-cisconfiguration, the length of the cavity was approximated minimally at 30 Å deep (5Yamamoto H.Y. Higashi R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This is within reason because the x-ray crystallographic structures of the lipocalin proteins insecticyanin and retinol-binding protein indicate that both are approximately 40 Å deep (36Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Åqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 38Holden H.M. Rypniewski W.R. Law J.H. Rayment I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The evolutionary implications of the β-barrel structure suggest that it may be well suited for small hydrophobic molecules because the barrel internally provides a hydrophobic environment for the ligand. For example, analysis of x-ray crystal structures shows that the binding pocket of insecticyanin is decidedly hydrophobic (38Holden H.M. Rypniewski W.R. Law J.H. Rayment I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and the binding pocket for retinol-binding protein is composed of both hydrophobic and uncharged residues (36Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Åqvist J. Sundelin J. Eriksson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Analysis of the xanthophyll enzymes to determine the amino acid residues important in binding and catalytic activity to help further our understanding of the role of these enzymes in photoprotection in plants is now warranted."

Polyamines are autoregulated through induction of antizyme, which represses both the rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase and cellular polyamine transport. In the present study we demonstrate that agmatine, a metabolite of arginine via arginine decarboxylase (an arginine pathway distinct from that of the classical polyamines), also serves the dual regulatory functions of suppressing polyamine biosynthesis and cellular polyamine uptake through induction of antizyme. The capacity of agmatine to induce antizyme is demonstrated by: (a) an agmatine-dependent translational frameshift of antizyme mRNA to produce a full-length protein and (b) suppression of agmatine-dependent inhibitory activity by either anti-antizyme IgG or antizyme inhibitor. Furthermore, agmatine administration depletes intracellular polyamine levels to suppress cellular proliferation in a transformed cell line. This suppression is reversible with polyamine supplementation. We propose a novel regulatory pathway in which agmatine acts as an antiproliferative molecule and potential tumor suppressor by restricting the cellular polyamine supply required to support growth.

We propose a novel regulatory pathway in which agmatine acts as an antiproliferative molecule and potential tumor suppressor by restricting the cellular polyamine supply required to support growth. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are required for DNA replication, proliferation, and cell homeostasis (1Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J.

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; ADC, arginine decarboxylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is the first rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis and one of the most highly regulated eukaryotic enzymes. Cellular polyamine transporters are stimulated by many of the same factors that induce ODC activity, and similarly, enhanced cellular polyamine uptake occurs both in normal but rapidly proliferating cells (4Janne J. Raina A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1966; 20: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in tumor cell lines (5Moulinoux J.P. Quemener V. Khan N.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 773-783PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bogle R.G. Mann G.E. Pearson J.D. Morgan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C776-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holley J.L. Mather A. Wheelhouse R.T.

Cells in vivo can acquire polyamines released into the circulation by other cells, dietary sources, and gut flora. Polyamines have been demonstrated to play an important role in the transformation process. Conversely, polyamine depletion results in growth arrest (9Quemener V. Blanchard Y. Chamaillard L. Havouis R. Cipolla B. Moulinoux J.P. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 443-448PubMed Google Scholar, 10Aziz S.M. Gillespie M.N. Crooks P.A. Tofiq S.F. Tsuboi C.P. Olson J.W. Gosland M.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular polyamine concentrations are autoregulated by the induction of the protein antizyme (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Antizyme is the only known endogenous protein that binds to ODC, inhibiting activity and accelerating its degradation (12Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis, antizyme has recently been shown to concurrently suppress polyamine transporter(s) (13Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of ODC activity, however, has been shown to result in compensatory cellular polyamine uptake (6Bogle R.G. Mann G.E. Pearson J.D. Morgan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C776-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beneficial therapeutic intervention must therefore address both polyamine transport as well as biosynthesis (for review see Ref. 15Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The metabolism of arginine to agmatine by ADC has only recently been demonstrated in mammals (16Li G. Regunathan S. Barrow C.J. Eshraghi J. Cooper R. Reis D.J. Science. 1994; 263: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). As agmatine and polyamines are structurally analogous polycationic molecules derived from distinct arginine-dependent pathways (6Bogle R.G. Mann G.E. Pearson J.D. Morgan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C776-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the ADC metabolite agmatine may play a role in regulating intracellular polyamines. Herein we report concurrent suppression of both polyamine biosynthesis and transport by agmatine. This occurs primarily via induction of antizyme and results in attenuated proliferation in a transformed cell line. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. We were unable to detect impurities by HPLC analysis in agmatine purchased from Aldrich. Sigma agmatine was found to have 3–8% impurities. All cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection except MCT (mouse kidney proximal tubule) (17Haverty T.P. Kelly C.J. Hines W.H. Amenta P.S. Watanabe M. Harper R.A. Kefalides N.A.

Pathol. 1992; 140: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar), JS-1 (human Schwann tumor) (20Kimura H. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. Nature. 1990; 348: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and ENDO (rat glomerular endothelial) (21Laulajainen T. Julkunen I. Haltia A. Knuutila S. Miettinen A. Holthofer H. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories). Experiments were performed when incubation of cell cultures in 10-cm dishes reached ∼80–95% confluence, unless otherwise noted. Cells were washed and resuspended in ODC reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA) and homogenized by polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was assayed for ODC activity as described (22Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured (6-well plates) in the absence or presence of 1 mm agmatine for the indicated times (see Fig. 2). Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline prior to a 15-min incubation with 0.5 μCi ml−1 12.5 nm [3H]putrescine (NEN Life Science Products) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Five cold washes of phosphate-buffered saline terminated the incorporation. Cells were lysed with 1 n NaOH and counted in a β scintillation counter. Fusion antizyme mRNAs were used in a reticulocyte lysate assay as described previously (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Frameshift efficiencies were calculated from the radioactivities of frameshift and termination bands with a BAS 2000 image analyzer. MCT cells were incubated with 5 mm agmatine and 1 mmaminoguanidine for 24 h. Aminoguanidine was used to inhibit serum diamine oxidase, an enzyme that metabolizes agmatine. Preparation of ODC, anti-antizyme antibody, and antizyme inhibitor methodology were as described previously (23Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 15,000 (see Fig. 4 A) or 5000 (see Fig. 4 D) MCT cells/well on a 96-well plate were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm agmatine and 0.05 mm putrescine for 24 or 48 h as indicated in the figures. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added 16 h prior to harvesting in an automated multiwell harvester and β scintillation counting. Cell counting (see Fig. 4 B) was performed by plating 50,000 MCT cells/well of a 24-well plate in the absence or presence of agmatine (concentrations indicated in the figure legend). Cells were collected and counted in a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion to identify viable cells. MCT cells (10-cm plate) were incubated with [3H]agmatine (10 μCi/10 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% fetal calf serum; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) for a 2-h incubation period. Cells were washed, collected, scraped, lysed, and prepared for HPLC as described below. Cellular extracts were deproteinated prior to derivatization (AccQ-Fluor kit, Waters Corp.) and HPLC elution on a C18 reverse phase column (ODS Hypersil 3 μm). The HPLC flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the elution gradient was as follows: 5% A 0–3 min, 7% A 3–10 min, 7–30% a 10–30 min, and 30–50% A 30–35 min. Buffer A was supplied in the AccQ-Fluor kit, and buffer B was HPLC grade acetonitrile. Polyamines were detected by fluorescence as per AccQ-Fluor kit instructions (see Fig. 4 C) or radioactivity assessed for [3H]agmatine conversion (not shown). Because the kidney is a principal site of ADC activity, we performed these experiments in a mouse kidney proximal tubule cell line, MCT (17Haverty T.P. Kelly C.J. Hines W.H. Amenta P.S. Watanabe M. Harper R.A. Kefalides N.A. Neilson E.G. J Cell Biol. 1988; 107(4): 1359-1368Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This transformed cell line demonstrates elevated constitutive ODC activity and diminished ADC activity compared with freshly isolated proximal tubule cells. 2J. Satriano, unpublished observation. These aspects make the MCT cell line an appropriate model system for observing the effects of agmatine supplementation on ODC activity and intracellular polyamine levels. Exogenous agmatine administration to MCT cells for 18 h resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of ODC activity (Fig. 1 A). Agmatine was not toxic at these or higher concentrations as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Agmatine purchased from either Aldrich or Sigma yielded comparable results. The effects on ODC activity were evident following a 30-min lag period (Fig. 1 B). Because agmatine is distributed by the plasma and can be concentrated in tissues (34), we examined whether its effects are cell type-specific. Fig. 1 Cdemonstrates the efficacy of exogenous agmatine administration for 18 h in suppressing ODC activity in multiple immortalized or transformed cell lines. The rapid polyamine transport observed in MCT cells as determined by [3H]putrescine uptake is indicative of active polyamine transporters (Fig. 2, 0 h of agmatine preincubation). To determine whether agmatine affects polyamine transporters, cells were preincubated in the presence of agmatine and then shifted to agmatine-free medium containing [3H]putrescine. Extracellular agmatine was removed during the labeled uptake period of this experiment to demonstrate suppression of transporters and avoid potential competitive effects of agmatine with [3H]putrescine (Fig. 2). Polyamines autoregulate their intracellular concentrations through the induction of antizyme, which suppresses both polyamine biosynthesis and transport. It has been demonstrated that polyamine induction of antizyme is not primarily a transcriptional event but rather occurs by a distinct mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We utilized a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay to examine whether agmatine can directly induce a +1 translational frameshift of antizyme mRNA in vitro. These results are depicted in Fig. 3 A. The frameshift efficiency, and therefore the effectiveness of producing full-length, functional antizyme by 4 mm agmatine, was comparable with that of 4 mm putrescine and 0.5 mm spermidine. These concentrations of the canonical polyamines represent at or near maximal effective concentrations for this assay as previously established (11Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We have found that the effect of agmatine on frameshift efficiencies was dose-dependent (not shown). We next examined whether antizyme induction is required for the effect of agmatine on ODC. Purified ODC enzymatic activity was markedly inhibited in the presence of agmatine-treated (MCT) cell extracts. The ODC inhibitory activity of agmatine-treated cell extracts was precipitated with the anti-antizyme antibody but not with control IgG (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, addition of highly purified antizyme inhibitor (24Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) also attenuated the inhibitory effect of the cell extracts (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results demonstrate that agmatine is capable of inducing antizyme. Intracellular polyamines are maintained in reserve, allowing passage through several cell cycles before polyamine depletion limits further cell division (25Davis R.H. Morris D.R. Coffino P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 280-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation in MCT cells exhibited no change between untreated and agmatine-treated cells by 24 h (Fig. 4 A). However, by 48 h agmatine-treated cells demonstrated a dramatic inhibition in the rate of DNA synthesis relative to control (Fig. 4 A). Decreased cellular proliferation in agmatine-treated cells, as verified by cell counting, was maintained throughout a 10-day experiment (Fig. 4 B). To further define the effects of agmatine on intracellular polyamine levels, we analyzed intracellular polyamine levels by HPLC. We first determined that the induction of antizyme was not due to a conversion of agmatine to polyamines. MCT cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of [3H]agmatine, which corresponds to the time of near maximal inhibition of ODC activity by agmatine. We observed no conversion of [3H]agmatine to any of the polyamines at this time by HPLC determination (not shown). We then determined the effects of agmatine on intracellular polyamine levels after 24–48 h of administration, corresponding to the time points of the [3H]thymidine experiment. In the absence of agmatine, MCT cells demonstrated a significant spermidine peak. Intracellular spermidine is markedly reduced in cells exposed to agmatine for 24 (41%) or 48 h (82%) (Fig. 4 C). Putrescine levels are also significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial reduction in total intracellular polyamine levels. To determine the specificity of the inhibitory effects of agmatine, we administered a low dose of putrescine concurrently with agmatine and examined [3H]thymidine incorporation at 48 h. Putrescine effectively prevented agmatine inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation at 48 h, thereby demonstrating specificity of the inhibition and supporting the conclusion that agmatine effects are the result of polyamine limitation (Fig. 4 D). Polyamines are required components for both protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and polyamine biosynthesis is regulated throughout the course of the cell cycle (26Fredlund J.O. Johansson M.C. Dahlberg E. Oredsson S.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Linden M. Anehus S. Langstrom E. Baldetorp B. Heby O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Antizyme, through its ability to suppress both the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ODC and polyamine transporters, is an effective endogenous mechanism for limiting intracellular polyamine levels. This unique, two-pronged negative feedback system of antizyme was thought to be exclusively induced by cellular polyamine accumulation. In this study we demonstrate induction of antizyme by an arginine-dependent pathway distinct from that of polyamine biosynthesis, with resultant suppression of polyamine biosynthesis and transport (Fig. 5). Inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis and transport by agmatine resulted in suppression of proliferation in a transformed cell line (Fig. 4,A and B). Recent studies have suggested a correlation of agmatine binding to imidazoline (I2) receptors with the selective inhibition of proliferation of cultured primary vascular smooth muscle cells (28Regunathan S. Youngson C. Raasch W. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1272-1282PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, inhibition of ODC activity was demonstrated in membrane-free preparations, which could not be attributed to a receptor-dependent mechanism. Agmatine exerted its maximum effects on proliferation at 1 mm (Fig. 4 B). The capacity of agmatine to frameshift antizyme mRNA to produce a full-length protein was also observed at 1 mm. Although maximum frameshift efficiencies were at 4 mm (Fig. 3 A), 1 mm may be sufficient to block ODC and polyamine transport causing maximal growth inhibition. Differences between the effect of agmatine in the frameshift and proliferation assays may also reflect differing concentrations of agmatine in the medium and in the cells. We are currently investigating how agmatine is transported and accumulated within the cell. Although we cannot entirely exclude potential nonantizyme-mediated effects by agmatine, antizyme is required for suppression of ODC activity (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, effects on proliferation were shown to be reversed if putrescine was administered concurrently with agmatine (Fig. 4 D), thus supporting the premise of cellular polyamine limitation as the inhibitory mechanism. Although this latter result may initially appear inconsistent with the findings of concurrent agmatine inhibition of polyamine transport, it should be noted that inhibition of cellular uptake was neither complete nor immediate, requiring at least 2 h for maximum effect (Fig. 2), allowing cellular putrescine to accumulate in these cells over this period. Our results also demonstrate that agmatine, at doses causing cellular polyamine depletion, does not act as a precursor of the canonical polyamines in terms of supporting cell proliferation (Fig. 4). The findings of this study corroborate earlier studies reaffirming the necessity of polyamines in maintaining a transformed state. When ODC activity is induced in tissues such as liver and kidney following a hyperplastic or hypertrophic stimulus, there is a concurrent reduction in ADC activity. 3J. Satriano, V. Vallon, D. Schwartz, C. J. Kelly, and R. C. Blantz, manuscript in preparation. We observed similar reciprocal changes in the transformed proximal tubule cell line, MCT, compared with freshly isolated proximal tubule cells.3 Such correlations suggest a physiologic role for ADC metabolites in the control of cellular proliferation and as potential tumor suppressors. ADC activity could also serve to divert arginine from arginase, thereby limiting substrate for ODC and effectively compounding the effects of agmatine. Targeted gene disruption of ADC would be an important step in further understanding the functional importance of this pathway. We thank Drs. E. G. Neilson (MCT and mMC), H. Holthofer (ENDO), A.

https://openalex.org/W1987027605,"Delivery of the initiator methionine transfer RNA (Met-tRNA i Met ) to the ribosome is a key step in the initiation of protein synthesis. Previous results have indicated that this step is catalyzed by the structurally dissimilar translation factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes—initiation factor 2 (IF2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), respectively. A bacterial IF2 homolog has been identified in both eukaryotes and archaea. By using a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical studies, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae IF2 homolog is shown to function in general translation initiation by promoting Met-tRNA i Met binding to ribosomes. Thus, the mechanism of protein synthesis in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is more similar than was previously realized."

Unless the effects of β3 on receptor properties are as striking as those of α5, the range of tests to be carried out is likely to be extensive. In addition, there may be differences in triplet receptor assembly between oocytes and cell lines (12Fucile S. Barabino B. Palma E. Grassi F. Limatola C. Mileo A.M. Alemà S. Ballivet M. Eusebi F. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2433-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), e.g. α3β4 receptors expressed in oocytes differ in their channel properties from α3β4 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells (13Lewis T.M.

Until it has been established which of the heterologous expression systems is closer to native neurones for each combination, it is desirable that these tests should be carried out both in oocytes and in cell lines.We have investigated which β3-containing triplet combinations assemble by inserting into the β3 subunit a reporter mutation, V273T. This mutation converts the hydrophobic residue in the middle of the pore-lining second transmembrane domain (TM2) into a hydrophilic residue. In the nicotinic receptors in which this type of mutation has been tested (α7 (14Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J. Devillers-Thiéry A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.

This shift was found to increase regularly with the number of mutated subunits incorporated (15Labarca C. Nowak M. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H. Nature. 1995; 376: 415-516Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and is likely to result from changes in the gating equilibrium constant due to destabilization of the closed state, although there may also be a contribution by the desensitized state becoming conducting (14Revah F.

Addition of cRNA for the β3WT subunit to α3 and β4 did not produce a detectable shift in the ACh concentration-response curve (see Fig. 1 and TableI), but when β3V273T was added instead of the β3WT, a pronounced leftward shift in the ACh concentration-response curve was observed. This suggests that the mutated β3 subunit is incorporated into the expressed receptor.Table IEffect of the V273T β3 mutation on concentration-response curves to ACh and nicotine in oocytesAChNicotineEC50(n)I maxn HEC50 (n)I maxI max(% I max for ACh)n HμmnAμmnAα3β4180 ± 17.01430 ± 4251.81 ± 0.0970.3 ± 9.0414 ± 14644.7 ± 2.31.98 ± 0.14(7)(7)(7)(5)(5)(5)(5)α3β4 + β3WT258 ± 50.61510 ± 4041.50 ± 0.0695.9 ± 21.0617 ± 17539.6 ± 3.31.70 ± 0.23(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)α3β4 + β3 V273T42.6 ± 2.3214.4 ± 40.31.25 ± 0.0419.4 ± 0.9166 ± 54.473.0 ± 1.11.40 ± 0.06(9)(5)(9)(5)(5)(5)(3)Parameter estimates were obtained by fitting separately the individual concentration-response curves. Values that were well defined were then used to find the means ± S.D. shown in the table. Open table in a new tab The next question is, what proportion of the receptors expressed after injection of α3, β4, and β3 do actually contain β3? The results in Table I and Fig. 1 were all obtained by injection of cRNAs for these subunits in a ratio of 1:1:20. We can obtain an estimate of the proportion of current due to triplet receptors by fitting the ACh concentration-response curves with the sum of two Hill equations, the first of which is supposed to represent pair receptors and therefore has its EC50 and Hill slope (n H) fixed at the values already determined in oocytes expressing α3β4 alone (180 μm and 1.81, respectively (Table I)). Fig. 1 B shows four concentration-response curves from oocytes injected with α3, β4, and β3V273T cRNAs in the ratio 1:1:1. The fit shown (see legend) gives an estimate of the fraction of current carried by triplet channels as 61 ± 4.3% (n = 4) with 2-unit likelihood intervals (roughly 95% confidence) of 54% to 73%. The EC50 andn H values estimated for the mutant triplet receptor (2nd component in Fig. 1 B) were 37.7 ± 3.6 μm and 1.31 ± 0.09 for the 1:1:1 injections with β3V273T, very close to the values obtained by a two-component fit of the 1:1:20 injections (41.8 ± 6.5 μm, 1.22 ± 0.06). When the cRNAs were injected in the ratio 1:1:20, fitting two components produced only a slight improvement (0.5 log likelihood units) over a single component, so it was not possible to estimate the fraction attributable to the second component (for either β3WT or β3V273T), but the results were consistent with a large proportion of the receptors being triplets.A change in gating for receptors containing the mutant subunit would also be expected to change the agonist efficacy, the maximum open probability, and therefore the maximum agonist response. Whether the change in maximum response is big enough to be detected will depend on whether efficacy increases or decreases and on the agonist efficacy in the wild-type receptor. If the mutation shifts the equilibrium toward the open state of the bound receptor (as in our case), efficacy should increase, but an increase in the maximum agonist response would be noticeable only if the wild-type maximum open probability was well below 1, i.e. if the agonist is a partial agonist (21Colquhoun D. Black J.W. Jenkinson D.H. Gershkowitz V.P. Perspectives in Hormone Receptor Classification. Liss, New York1987: 103-114Google Scholar). While little is known of the actual efficacy of nicotinic agonists on neuronal receptors, nicotine is a good example of a possible partial agonist on α3β4, as it elicits a maximum response which is only 44.7 ± 2.3% of that to ACh (see Fig. 2). The maximum response to nicotine (as a fraction of the ACh maximum) is nearly doubled by the mutation, fulfilling the prediction (see α3β4β3WT versus α3β4 β3V273T in Table I and in Fig. 2). Clearly, changes in agonist channel block and in desensitization (following the V273T mutation) may contribute to this effect, and further work is necessary to exclude this possibility.Figure 2Incorporation of the β3 subunit into a functional nicotinic receptor is also demonstrated by the increase in the maximum response to nicotine in oocytes injected with α3β4 + β3V273T. A, responses to increasing concentrations of ACh and to a near-maximum concentration of nicotine, in oocytes injected with α3β4, α3β4 + β3WT, or α3β4 + β3V273T. Calibration bars are 50 nA and 40 s.

Each oocyte provided an ACh and a nicotine concentration-response curve. Data were fitted as in Fig. 1, after normalization to the fitted maximum of the ACh concentration-response curve in each oocyte. Note the increase in the maximum response to nicotine (relative to the maximum ACh response) for α3β4 + β3V273T (see TableI).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We have shown that the β3 subunit can be incorporated into a functional α3β4β3 recombinant nicotinic receptor. While β3 is expressed in several areas of the nervous system which lack α3 and β4, the β3 subunit is also abundant in sensory ganglia, which are rich in α3 and β4 subunits. The nicotinic receptors of sensory ganglia (which are potential targets for nicotinic analgesia (22Bannon A.W. Decker M.W. Holladay M.W. Curzon P. Donnelly-Roberts D. Puttfarcken P.S. Bitner R.S.

The reporter mutation approach used here will allow rapid screening of other subunit combinations containing β3 and will establish which of these can form functional receptors. In addition, the optimal cRNA ratios needed to ensure that the majority of assembled receptors are triplets can be determined. Once combination and optimal conditions have been identified by expression of the mutant, the wild-type triplet can be expressed heterologously to characterize the pharmacological and biophysical properties of the resulting receptor. Furthermore, if in neuronal nicotinic receptors, as in muscle receptors, the EC50 shift produced by the hydrophilic mutation in the middle of TM2 is proportional to the number of mutated subunits (15Labarca C. Nowak M. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H. Nature. 1995; 376: 415-516Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar,16Filatov G. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar), this approach can also be extended to the question of the stoichiometry of triplet receptors. Finally, as the mid-TM2 Leu (or Val) motif is present in all subunits belonging to the 4-transmembrane domain receptor superfamily, the method can readily be extended to other receptor types. Molecular cloning has brought to light an unsuspected multitude of subunits that are the building blocks of ligand-gated ion channels.

Until it has been established which of the heterologous expression systems is closer to native neurones for each combination, it is desirable that these tests should be carried out both in oocytes and in cell lines. We have investigated which β3-containing triplet combinations assemble by inserting into the β3 subunit a reporter mutation, V273T. This mutation converts the hydrophobic residue in the middle of the pore-lining second transmembrane domain (TM2) into a hydrophilic residue. In the nicotinic receptors in which this type of mutation has been tested (α7 (14Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J. Devillers-Thiéry A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.

This shift was found to increase regularly with the number of mutated subunits incorporated (15Labarca C. Nowak M. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H. Nature. 1995; 376: 415-516Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and is likely to result from changes in the gating equilibrium constant due to destabilization of the closed state, although there may also be a contribution by the desensitized state becoming conducting (14Revah F.

We found that expressing β3V273T together with the α3 and β4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes changes the pharmacological properties of the α3β4 recombinant nicotinic receptor, suggesting that the β3V273T subunit is incorporated into a functional α3β4β3V273Treceptor. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have expressed in Xenopus oocytes the α3β4 combination alone or together with wild type β3 (β3WT) or mutant β3 (β3V273T). Addition of cRNA for the β3WT subunit to α3 and β4 did not produce a detectable shift in the ACh concentration-response curve (see Fig. 1 and TableI), but when β3V273T was added instead of the β3WT, a pronounced leftward shift in the ACh concentration-response curve was observed. This suggests that the mutated β3 subunit is incorporated into the expressed receptor.Table IEffect of the V273T β3 mutation on concentration-response curves to ACh and nicotine in oocytesAChNicotineEC50(n)I maxn HEC50 (n)I maxI max(% I max for ACh)n HμmnAμmnAα3β4180 ± 17.01430 ± 4251.81 ± 0.0970.3 ± 9.0414 ± 14644.7 ± 2.31.98 ± 0.14(7)(7)(7)(5)(5)(5)(5)α3β4 + β3WT258 ± 50.61510 ± 4041.50 ± 0.0695.9 ± 21.0617 ± 17539.6 ± 3.31.70 ± 0.23(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)(5)α3β4 + β3 V273T42.6 ± 2.3214.4 ± 40.31.25 ± 0.0419.4 ± 0.9166 ± 54.473.0 ± 1.11.40 ± 0.06(9)(5)(9)(5)(5)(5)(3)Parameter estimates were obtained by fitting separately the individual concentration-response curves.

Open table in a new tab The next question is, what proportion of the receptors expressed after injection of α3, β4, and β3 do actually contain β3? The results in Table I and Fig. 1 were all obtained by injection of cRNAs for these subunits in a ratio of 1:1:20. We can obtain an estimate of the proportion of current due to triplet receptors by fitting the ACh concentration-response curves with the sum of two Hill equations, the first of which is supposed to represent pair receptors and therefore has its EC50 and Hill slope (n H) fixed at the values already determined in oocytes expressing α3β4 alone (180 μm and 1.81, respectively (Table I)). Fig. 1 B shows four concentration-response curves from oocytes injected with α3, β4, and β3V273T cRNAs in the ratio 1:1:1. The fit shown (see legend) gives an estimate of the fraction of current carried by triplet channels as 61 ± 4.3% (n = 4) with 2-unit likelihood intervals (roughly 95% confidence) of 54% to 73%. The EC50 andn H values estimated for the mutant triplet receptor (2nd component in Fig. 1 B) were 37.7 ± 3.6 μm and 1.31 ± 0.09 for the 1:1:1 injections with β3V273T, very close to the values obtained by a two-component fit of the 1:1:20 injections (41.8 ± 6.5 μm, 1.22 ± 0.06). When the cRNAs were injected in the ratio 1:1:20, fitting two components produced only a slight improvement (0.5 log likelihood units) over a single component, so it was not possible to estimate the fraction attributable to the second component (for either β3WT or β3V273T), but the results were consistent with a large proportion of the receptors being triplets.A change in gating for receptors containing the mutant subunit would also be expected to change the agonist efficacy, the maximum open probability, and therefore the maximum agonist response. Whether the change in maximum response is big enough to be detected will depend on whether efficacy increases or decreases and on the agonist efficacy in the wild-type receptor. If the mutation shifts the equilibrium toward the open state of the bound receptor (as in our case), efficacy should increase, but an increase in the maximum agonist response would be noticeable only if the wild-type maximum open probability was well below 1, i.e. if the agonist is a partial agonist (21Colquhoun D. Black J.W. Jenkinson D.H. Gershkowitz V.P. Perspectives in Hormone Receptor Classification. Liss, New York1987: 103-114Google Scholar). While little is known of the actual efficacy of nicotinic agonists on neuronal receptors, nicotine is a good example of a possible partial agonist on α3β4, as it elicits a maximum response which is only 44.7 ± 2.3% of that to ACh (see Fig. 2). The maximum response to nicotine (as a fraction of the ACh maximum) is nearly doubled by the mutation, fulfilling the prediction (see α3β4β3WT versus α3β4 β3V273T in Table I and in Fig. 2). Clearly, changes in agonist channel block and in desensitization (following the V273T mutation) may contribute to this effect, and further work is necessary to exclude this possibility.We have shown that the β3 subunit can be incorporated into a functional α3β4β3 recombinant nicotinic receptor. While β3 is expressed in several areas of the nervous system which lack α3 and β4, the β3 subunit is also abundant in sensory ganglia, which are rich in α3 and β4 subunits. The nicotinic receptors of sensory ganglia (which are potential targets for nicotinic analgesia (22Bannon A.W. Decker M.W. Holladay M.W. Curzon P. Donnelly-Roberts D. Puttfarcken P.S. Bitner R.S.

The reporter mutation approach used here will allow rapid screening of other subunit combinations containing β3 and will establish which of these can form functional receptors. In addition, the optimal cRNA ratios needed to ensure that the majority of assembled receptors are triplets can be determined. Once combination and optimal conditions have been identified by expression of the mutant, the wild-type triplet can be expressed heterologously to characterize the pharmacological and biophysical properties of the resulting receptor. Furthermore, if in neuronal nicotinic receptors, as in muscle receptors, the EC50 shift produced by the hydrophilic mutation in the middle of TM2 is proportional to the number of mutated subunits (15Labarca C. Nowak M. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H. Nature. 1995; 376: 415-516Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar,16Filatov G. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar), this approach can also be extended to the question of the stoichiometry of triplet receptors. Finally, as the mid-TM2 Leu (or Val) motif is present in all subunits belonging to the 4-transmembrane domain receptor superfamily, the method can readily be extended to other receptor types.

Single-chain fragment-variable anti-idiotypes competed with the type III carbohydrate for binding to type-specific antibodies and elicited, in mice, the production of protective immunoglobulins reacting against the type III polysaccharide. Moreover, maternal immunization with soluble or phage-displayed fragments protected neonatal mice against streptococcal infection. These data indicate that recombinant anti-idiotypic antibodies may be useful in developing protein images of relevant carbohydrate epitopes and, ultimately, in preventing infections by encapsulated bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2015422987,"Src family protein-tyrosine kinases possess several modular domains important for regulation of catalytic activity and interaction with potential substrates. Here, we explore interactions between the SH2 domain of Hck, a Src family kinase, and substrates containing SH2 domain-binding sites. We have synthesized a series of peptide substrates containing a high affinity SH2 domain binding site, (phospho)Tyr-Glu-Glu-Ile. We show that the presence of this sequence in a peptide results in a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation rate of a second tyrosine located at the N terminus. Enhanced phosphorylation is not a consequence of stimulation of enzymatic activity by C-terminal tail displacement but is imparted instead by a 10-fold reduction in the K m of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide when compared with a control. The isolated catalytic domain of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl does not show a preference for the pYEEI motif-containing peptide; however, the preference is restored when the SH2 domain of Src is introduced into Abl. Furthermore, enhanced phosphorylation is dependent on the distance between SH2 domain-binding site and phosphorylatable tyrosine, with the minimum distance requirement being seven amino acids. Reversing the orientation of the pYEEI motif with respect to the substrate sequence decreases phosphorylation by down-regulated Hck, but both orientations are utilized equally well by activated Hck. We discuss the possible implications of these results for processive phosphorylation of substrates in vivo by Src family kinases.

We discuss the possible implications of these results for processive phosphorylation of substrates in vivo by Src family kinases. There are presently nine identified members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. These enzymes are widely expressed in many tissues and are involved in the conversion of extracellular signals into cellular responses (see Ref. 1Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar for review). The primary structure of Src family kinases reveals a highly modular organization shared among all members. In addition to the kinase catalytic domain that is responsible for enzymatic activity, Src family kinases possess noncatalytic modules termed Src homology domains (SH2 and SH3). SH2 and SH3 domains mediate specific intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that are important for signal transduction; SH2 domains recognize short peptide motifs containing phosphotyrosine, and SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sequences (2Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 3Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). For Src family kinases, SH2 and SH3 domains have both a negative and a positive regulatory role in tyrosine kinase activity. The negative regulatory role arises from intramolecular contacts between the SH2 and SH3 domains and the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. The structural basis for repression of catalytic activity has recently been elucidated by crystal structures of the down-regulated forms of Src and Hck (4Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar,5Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Src family kinases at a C-terminal regulatory site by another protein kinase (designated Csk) leads to inhibition. This inhibition is caused by an intramolecular interaction between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain (6Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 8Laudano A.P.

A. 1991; 88: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A polyproline type II helix is formed by the linker connecting the SH2 domain to the catalytic domain, and this polyproline type II helix serves as a docking site for the SH3 domain. This SH3 interaction appears to regulate kinase activity directly; addition of a high affinity SH3 ligand to down-regulated Hck causes maximal activation (10Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). SH2 and SH3 domains also have a positive influence on non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. SH2- and SH3-mediated interactions with other proteins are important for at least two reasons: first, they target the tyrosine kinases to specific subcellular locations, and second, they assist the kinases in recognizing certain cellular substrates (11Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Flynn D.C. Leu T.H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Processive phosphorylation by Src family kinases is when phosphorylation of a substrate by the catalytic domain creates a site that is recognized by the associated SH2 domain; binding to the SH2 domain increases the local concentration of substrate, allowing the catalytic domain to phosphorylate additional sites. Several proteins have been proposed to be phosphorylated processively by non-receptor tyrosine kinases. One such protein is the focal adhesion protein p130CAS. This protein possesses a Src SH2 domain-binding site near its C terminus (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 15Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Binding of Src to this region is thought to promote phosphorylation of p130CAS at multiple sites closer to the N terminus (15Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of p130CAS has been demonstrated in vitro using a mutant form of Abl containing the Crk SH2 domain (16Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lymphocyte-specific Src family kinase Lck phosphorylates several tyrosine residues in the ζ chain of the T-cell receptor. Each ζ chain contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs with the consensus YXX(I/L)X 6–8YXX(I/L) (where X is any amino acid) arrayed in tandem (17DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutation of amino acids involved in phosphotyrosine recognition in the SH2 domain of Lck reduces receptor hyperphosphorylation and signal transduction, consistent with a processive phosphorylation model (18Lewis L.A. Chung C.D. Chen J. Parnes J.R. Moran M. Patel V.P. Miceli M.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2292-2300PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations for the Src family kinases, the mechanistic details of processive phosphorylation have not been examined closely. Sequence requirements for the interaction between the SH2 domains of Src family kinases and potential substrates are not well understood. In this report, we have tested a basic principle of the processive phosphorylation model by asking whether a high affinity SH2 binding sequence on a substrate enhances phosphorylation of other sites on the same substrate. Using a series of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, we show that the SH2 binding sequence indeed enhances phosphorylation of the substrate. We also report the results of experiments aimed at determining the optimal spacing and orientation of the SH2 domain-binding site relative to the potential phosphorylation site.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis were used to confirm the identity of the final products. The concentrations of peptide stock solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Richmond, VA). Expression and purification of C-terminally phosphorylated Hck is described elsewhere (4Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). To obtain C-terminally dephosphorylated Hck, the enzyme was treated with Yersiniaprotein-tyrosine phosphatase, as described previously (10Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H.

Autophosphorylation of Tyr411 (Tyr416 of c-Src) was performed by incubation of the enzyme (5 mg/ml) on ice for 1 h in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 2 mm ATP (10Moarefi I.

Initial rates of reaction were measured in duplicate, and kinetic constants were determined by fitting to the hyperbolic velocity versus [substrate] plots using the program MacCurve Fit. The sequences of the synthetic peptides used in these experiments are presented in TableI. The phosphopeptides contain an optimal Src SH2 domain-binding sequence: (phospho)Tyr-Glu-Glu-Ile. This sequence is derived from the polyoma virus middle T antigen, which forms a 1:1 complex with c-Src in cells (26Courtneidge S.A. Smith A.E. Nature. 1983; 303: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The pYEEI sequence has been demonstrated to bind with high affinity to the Src SH2 domain (27Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

The phosphorylation site sequences on these peptides correspond to a phosphorylation sequence (Glu-Asp-Ala-Ile-Tyr) that we obtained using synthetic peptide libraries (25Till J.H. Annan R.S.

The number in parentheses indicates the length of the spacer between phosphotyrosine (or phenylalanine) and tyrosine. The amino acid listed first in the name indicates the N-terminal sequence element; i.e. in Y(11)pY the substrate sequence is N-terminal to the SH2 domain binding sequence. To determine whether introduction of an SH2 domain binding site would lead to increased phosphorylation of additional tyrosines within the same peptide, we compared Y(11)pY with its control Y(11)F using C-terminally phosphorylated Hck. We observed a strong preference for Y(11)pY, the peptide containing the SH2 domain binding motif (Fig. 1). In principle, the presence of a high affinity SH2 domain binding site in multiply phosphorylated substrates could facilitate phosphorylation in two ways. First, the pYEEI motif could increase the enzymatic activity of Src family kinases through the displacement of the C-terminal negative regulatory site from the SH2 domain. Second, SH2 domain-pYEEI interactions could promote the further phosphorylation of other tyrosines within the same substrate by raising the effective local concentration of potential phosphorylation sites near the catalytic domain. To discriminate between these possibilities, we performed experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1 using two enzymes where activation by C-terminal tail displacement is not possible: (i) v-Src, which lacks the C-terminal tail, and (ii) Hck that had been dephosphorylated at Tyr522 (Tyr527 of c-Src) and pre-activated by incubation with ATP. SH2 domain activators, such as the pYEEI peptide, do not activate these enzymes. Both v-Src and dephosphorylated Hck showed increased phosphorylation of Y(11)pY over Y(11)F (data not shown). To clarify further the mechanism of the enhanced phosphorylation of Y(11)pY, we performed initial rate kinetic studies using Hck that had been dephosphorylated at Tyr522 in the C-terminal tail and allowed to autophosphorylate at Tyr411. The results are shown in Table II. Similar values of V max were observed for Y(11)pY and Y(11)F. However, introduction of an SH2 domain-binding site in Y(11)pY reduces the K m of the peptide substrate 10-fold, thus increasing the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of the enzyme 10-fold as well. The high affinity interaction between the SH2 domain of Hck and the pYEEI motif of Y(11)pY presumably gives the substrate an advantage because of its high local concentration in proximity to the catalytic domain.Table IIKinetic parameters of peptidesPeptideK mV maxk cat/K mμmμmol/min/mgm−1min−1Y(11)pY69 ± 113.0 ± 0.12.6 × 106Y(11)F680 ± 903.4 ± 0.33.0 × 105pY(12)Y72 ± 52.7 ± 0.22.2 × 106Steady state kinetic parameters were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” using C-terminally dephosphorylated (preactivated) Hck. Open table in a new tab Steady state kinetic parameters were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” using C-terminally dephosphorylated (preactivated) Hck. We carried out experiments to confirm the importance of the SH2 domain in the observed enhanced phosphorylation of Y(11)pY. We first tested for phosphorylation of Y(11)pYversus Y(11)F using the catalytic domain of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl (AblCAT). Because of the absence of an SH2 domain in this construct, we predicted that AblCAT would not discriminate between Y(11)pY and Y(11)F. Fig. 2 A shows that, as expected, the isolated catalytic domain of Abl did not preferentially phosphorylate Y(11)pY. In fact, AblCAT favored the phenylalanine control peptide, Y(11)F, over Y(11)pY. We next tested for enhanced phosphorylation of Y(11)pY using a chimeric Abl protein (lacking the SH3 domain) in which the SH2 domain of Abl had been replaced with the SH2 domain of Src (SrcSH2-AblCAT) (13Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The results, shown in Fig. 2 B, indicate that indeed SrcSH2-AblCAT favored Y(11)pY, the peptide containing the Src SH2 domain-binding motif pYEEI. Thus the order of substrate preference of SrcSH2-AblCAT is reversed from that of AblCAT. These observations also indicate that the SH2 domains of kinases can influence the substrate specificity of their associated catalytic domains. This result has precedent in studies of mutant forms of Abl in vivo, where replacement of the SH2 domain of Abl with SH2 domains from various proteins modifies the substrate specificity of this tyrosine kinase (13Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We varied the spacing between the phosphotyrosine and the phosphorylatable tyrosine to assess the minimum distance required for enhanced phosphorylation to occur. We tested peptides of various lengths (Table I) using C-terminally dephosphorylated (pre-activated) Hck. Fig. 3 shows that there is a length dependence to the observed enhanced phosphorylation of pYEEI-containing peptides. For example, when the spacer is reduced to 7 amino acids, as in Y(7)pY, the rate of phosphorylation is reduced when compared with the longer peptide Y(11)pY but is still above Y(11)F or Y(3)F, the phenylalanine controls. However, when the spacer is further reduced to 3 amino acids, as in Y(3)pY, the enhanced phosphorylation is no longer observed, and the phosphorylation rates approach those of the control peptides, Y(11)F and Y(3)F. These results indicate that in order for SH2 domain-binding motifs to confer an advantage to substrates, there must be a minimum distance between the phosphotyrosine and the tyrosine. These spacer lengths are consistent with the 9–11-residue spacers observed between phosphorylated tyrosines in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of TCR ζ chains (17DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the observed dependence on spacer length is that phosphorylation occurs while the peptide remains bound to the SH2 domain. In the crystal structure of down-regulated Src, the distance between Tyr527 and the active site is approximately 35 Å (5Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). If the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides adopt a fully extended conformation, each residue would be expected to span ≈3.7 Å (29Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1979: 66-107Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the distance of 12 residues between phosphotyrosine and tyrosine in Y(11)pY could potentially span 12 × 3.7 Å = 44.4 Å, enough to reach from the SH2 domain to the active site. In contrast, the shorter spacers in Y(7)pY or Y(3)pY should not be long enough to reach from the SH2 domain to the active site. However, the exact position of the SH2 domain with respect to the catalytic domain in an activated Src family kinase is currently unknown. To examine the effect of reversing the orientation between the substrate tyrosine and the SH2 domain-binding site, we produced peptide substrates containing the pYEEI motif (or FEEI control) N-terminal to the tyrosine (Table I). Fig. 4 shows a comparison between Y(11)pY and pY(12)Y using down-regulated Hck. There is a preference for Y(11)pY, the peptide containing the phosphotyrosine at the C- terminus. Both peptides were phosphorylated more efficiently than F(12)Y, the control lacking an SH2 domain-binding site at the N terminus (data not shown). The preference for Y(11)pY over pY(12)Y is consistent with the structure of down-regulated Hck (4Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), where the phosphotyrosine-containing tail of Hck binds to the SH2 domain in an orientation that places the N terminus of the tail closer to the catalytic domain than the C terminus. We performed initial rate kinetic studies on pY(12)Y using C-terminally dephosphorylated (preactivated) Hck. The results are summarized in Table II. Surprisingly, this form of Hck phosphorylated pY(12)Y and Y(11)pY with roughly equal catalytic efficiency; the values forK m and V max of the peptides are comparable. Therefore, the position of the SH2 domain-binding site with respect to the substrate tyrosine appears not to be important for activated Hck but may be relevant for activation of down-regulated Hckin vivo. In this regard, we note that the Src SH2 domain-binding site in p130CAS is located C-terminal to the region containing multiple Src phosphorylation motifs (15Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Using a synthetic peptide model system, we report here that substrates containing high affinity binding sites for Src family kinase SH2 domains display enhanced phosphorylation at additional sites on the substrate. These experiments on processive phosphorylation suggest that the SH2 domain plays an important role in substrate recognition for non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Based on studies with peptide libraries, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of different peptide sequences by the Src kinase domain correlates with the binding of the sequences to the Src SH2 domain (30Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Poner B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that the two domains co-evolved to allow the catalytic domain to create sites that will be recognized by the associated SH2 domain (3Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The in vivo substrate specificity of Src family tyrosine kinases reflects both the intrinsic specificity of the kinase catalytic domains and the effective local concentrations of protein substrates. In many cases, the distribution of potential substrates is influenced by interactions with noncatalytic regions of the enzymes such as SH2 and SH3 domains. Previous studies have demonstrated that molecules that bind with high affinity to the SH2 or SH3 domains of Src family kinases can disrupt the relatively low affinity intramolecular interactions, leading to enzyme activation (10Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 31Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of protein-protein interactions in the cell can lead to signaling through active Src kinases. Our data imply that the most productive interactions may occur when these high affinity ligands are present together with potential phosphorylation sites on the same molecule,i.e. in the case of processive phosphorylation. This would impart an additional level of specificity in substrate recognition. We thank Drs. John Kuriyan and Frank Sicheri (Rockefeller) for samples of purified Hck and Dr. Bruce Mayer (Harvard Medical School) for the SrcSH2-AblCAT baculovirus expression construct and for a critical reading of the manuscript."

Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the yet unidentified β- and γ-secretases leads to the generation of the amyloidogenic Aβ peptides. Recent data suggest that all of the known mutations leading to early onset familial AD alter the processing of APP such that increased amounts of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ are generated by a γ-secretase activity.

APP undergoes a series of proteolytic processing steps in the biosynthetic and/or endocytic pathway. α- and γ-Secretase cleavages generate the non-amyloidogenic peptide, p3, whereas β- and γ-secretase cleavages lead to the production of the amyloidogenic Aβ peptide (Fig. 1). A number of different mutations in APP have been identified that lead to rare forms of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). All of these mutations appear to alter the proteolytic processing of the precursor, increasing the total production of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ, Aβ42 (for review see Ref. 2Selkoe D.J. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Despite intensive study of APP processing, none of the secretase activities has been definitively identified, purified, or cloned, although many enzymes have been proposed as potential secretases (for review see Ref. 3Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Amyloid. 1994; 1: 263-280Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Secretase candidates have been difficult to identify because specific inhibitors are not generally available and it is unclear to which protease classes β- and γ-secretases belong. In addition, it is not known whether β- and γ-secretases are each just one enzyme or are a collection of different enzymes. For example, it has been suggested, but not proven, that γ-secretase cleavages at positions 40 and 42 are carried out by different proteases (4Citron M. Diehl T.S. Gordon G. Biere A.L. Seubert P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28655-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Finally, more than 10 years after the cloning of APP it is still puzzling how γ-secretase cleaves APP within the transmembrane domain (6Kang J. Lemaire H. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). Recently, Brown and Goldstein (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar) noted numerous similarities between the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) site 2 protease (S2P) and the γ-secretase(s). Based on these similarities, they hypothesized that either the S2P may be the γ-secretase or that the two proteases may be closely related (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). The substrate of the S2P, SREBP, is initially synthesized as an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound precursor. Following a two-step cleavage, the cytosolic domain of SREBP is released and targeted to the nucleus where it transcriptionally regulates genes containing the sterol regulatory element (SRE), including numerous genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (8Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The similarities between the S2P and γ-secretase are provocative. First, the substrates (SREBP and APP) of both enzymes are cleaved uniquely within the transmembrane domain (9Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10Tischer E. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Second, both S2P and γ-secretase enzymes catalyze the second cleavage of an obligatory two-step cleavage reaction. Third, both enzymes appear to be ubiquitously expressed (as are the substrates). Finally, processing of SREBP is regulated by a six to eight transmembrane domain protein, SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein) (11Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Dominant missense mutations in SCAP have been shown to alter SREBP processing (11Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Dominant missense mutations in both PS1 and PS2 account for the most common forms of FAD, and both in vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that these mutations in PS1/PS2 somehow alter γ-secretase activity and lead to increased production of Aβ42 (for review see Ref. 16Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurons from PS1 knock-out mice appear to have dramatically reduced γ-secretase activity, suggesting that PS1 may be an activator of γ-secretase (17De Strooper B. Saftig P.

In this communication we show that over-expression of human (hu) S2P does not enhance secretion of Aβ from 293 cells, suggesting that either the S2P is not the γ-secretase or that the activity is not rate-limiting for processing APP to Aβ. Furthermore, we show that CHO M19 clones process transfected hu APPsw to Aβ; both Aβ40 and Aβ42 are generated in proportions indistinguishable from those produced by the wild-type CHO clones. Finally, we confirm that our CHO M19 clones are auxotrophs and that they do not express detectable S2P mRNA. These results definitively show that the S2P is not required for γ-secretase processing of APP to Aβ40 and Aβ42.

After confirming the DNA sequence, the APPsw fragment (HindIII-XmnI) was subcloned to generate pBCB/APPsw695 (23Bartley T.D. Bogenberger J. Hunt P. Li Y.S. Lu H.S. Martin F. Chang M.S. Samal B. Nichol J.L. Swift S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The APPsw695 cDNA (HindIII-NotI) was subcloned into pCMVi (Cell & Molecular Technologies) to generate pCMVi/APPsw695. pRc/Neo was derived from pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). It contains the pRc/CMV 1524-bp neomycin resistance expression cassette (KpnI-SalI) fused to the pRc/CMV 2178-bp vector backbone (SalI-XhoI fragment). PCR primers for the amplification of codons 1–519 of the human S2P (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

PCR amplification was performed with random primed human fetal brain cDNA as template. The product was digested with XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) between the XbaI and BamHI (blunt) sites to generate S2P/pcDNA3.1. A derivative of 293 cells (Cell & Molecular Technologies Inc.) was co-transfected with pCMVi-APPsw695 and pRSV-Puro by the calcium phosphate method (24Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Individual puromycin-resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for high APP production by Western dot-blot with monoclonal antibody 22C11 (Boehringer). APPsw 293 clone 101 was used in all experiments reported here; similar results were obtained with clone 117. Wild-type CHO K1 (CHO WT) and CHO M19 cells (19Chin J. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6304-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chang T.Y. Hasan M.T. Chin J. Chang C.C.Y. Spillane D.M. Chen Jun Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with pBCB/APPsw695 and pRc/Neo or with pRc/Neo alone using the polyamine LT-1 (Mirus). Individual G418 resistant colonies were expanded and assayed for high APP production by Western blot with antibody 22C11. 293 cells over-expressing APPsw (clone 101) were transiently transfected with S2P/pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1, or a β-galactosidase-containing vector using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293 clone 101 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 1% pen/strep/gln containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. CHO clones were grown in F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Tris-Bicine urea gels were used to resolve Aβ40 and Aβ42 as described (25Klafki H.W. Wiltfang J. Staufenbiel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using synthetic peptides from Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. as standards. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (26Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.-W. Staufenbiel M. Hüther G. Rüther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For 293 cells over-expressing APPsw and transiently transfected with human S2P or vector control, 20 μl of 24-h conditioned medium was analyzed on Tris-Bicine urea gels. Following transfer, the blot was boiled in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and blocked for 2 h in 5% milk. The blot was probed overnight with 10 μg/ml 6E10 (Senetek), washed, and then treated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The blot was washed, incubated with streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and exposed to ECL film. For CHO clones, 48-h conditioned medium samples were collected from nearly confluent plates. One-ml samples were immunoprecipitated overnight with 10 μg of 4G8 (Senetek) and analyzed on gels/Westerns as described above. S2P mRNA expressed during transient transfection experiments was quantified using solution hybridization to [35S]UTP riboprobes (27Linenberger M.L. Jacobsen F.W. Bennett L.G. Broudy V.C. Martin F.H. Abkowitz J.L. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1104-1114PubMed Google Scholar). Riboprobes corresponding to hu S2P amino acids 437–519 and 250–321 (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) in both sense and antisense orientations were used to quantify the S2P mRNA. cDNA template generated with random primers and total cellular RNA from CHO M19 and WT clones was used to amplify S2P or α-tubulin by PCR. Codons 254–519 of S2P (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) were amplified with sense, 5′-GTT GGG GTG CTC ATC ACT GAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAT TAC CGT GCT GTA ACC ATC CAG-3′, primers yielding a product of 790 bases. α-Tubulin was amplified with sense, 5′-AAG AAG TCC AAG CTG GAG TTC TC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTG GTG TTG CTC AGC ATG CAC AC-3′, primers yielding a product of 700 base pairs. To test the hypothesis that the S2P may be identical to the APP γ-secretase, we generated 293 cells stably expressing human APP695 with the Swedish mutation (APPsw) (28Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). If S2P is the same enzyme as the γ-secretase, transient over-expression in cells containing substrate (e.g. APP-over-expressing cell lines) could lead to an increase in the production of either Aβ40, Aβ42, or both. Analysis of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 secretion from 293 cells transiently transfected with S2P by quantitative urea-gel/Western blot was carried out on conditioned media samples (Fig. 2). Synthetic Aβ40and Aβ42 peptides are well separated by this gel system with Aβ42 migrating faster than Aβ40 (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5), and our linear range of detection is from about 20 pg to 10 ng. Because this gel system does not separate peptides strictly on the basis of size, it is possible to identify the bands only by co-migration with known peptide standards (and by antibody specificity). (Some of the slower migrating bands in the conditioned media samples are dimers of the 40 and 42 peptides, but others, both slower and faster migrating in Figs. 2 and 3 B, have not been identified by us, but see Ref. 26Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.-W. Staufenbiel M. Hüther G. Rüther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar.)Figure 3CHO M19 cells that lack S2P expression generate Aβ. A, cell lysates from CHO M19 and CHO WT clones stably expressing APPsw from pBCB/APPsw695 contain both endogenous (APP751/770) and APPsw695. Non-ionic detergent extracts containing 25 μg of total protein from the indicated clones were loaded in each lane. B, 48-h conditioned media samples immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 4G8 were separated on a Tris-Bicine/urea gel to resolve Aβ40 and Aβ42. Aβ40 and Aβ42 synthetic peptides (500 pg of each) were run separately in lanes 8 and9, respectively, or were mixed and immunoprecipitated together (lane 7) to serve as migration standards for the experiment. Medium from CHO WT or CHO M19 clones stably transfected with the control vector (pBCB) or expressing APPsw are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) APPsw-expressing 293 cells, transiently transfected with either vector control (Fig. 2, lane 1) or a β-galactosidase-containing vector (lane 3), secrete Aβ40 and Aβ42 in a ratio of about 10:1 as expected (29Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 32: 10272-10278Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Transient expression of human S2P in these cells (lane 2) did not lead to any detectable increase in Aβ40 or Aβ42production nor to a change in the ratio of the two Aβ species (Fig. 2, compare lane 2 to control lanes 1 and3). These results suggest that over-expression of S2P does not lead to increased γ-secretase activity in these cells. To show that the S2P cDNA was being expressed during this transient assay, we first determined that the transient transfection efficiency in this experiment was about 80% (based on β-galactosidase expression; data not shown). Next we performed a quantitative solution hybridization assay to detect S2P mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 27Linenberger M.L. Jacobsen F.W. Bennett L.G. Broudy V.C. Martin F.H. Abkowitz J.L. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1104-1114PubMed Google Scholar) in the same cells from which the conditioned media were collected. This assay revealed that S2P transfected cells contained on average about 800 copies of S2P mRNA, whereas untransfected cells contained less than 20 copies per cell; nonetheless, no change in Aβ40 or Aβ42production could be detected (Fig. 2). Recent data indicate that the cholesterol auxotroph CHO M19 contains a deletion spanning most, if not all, of the S2P gene and thus represents a cellular S2P gene knock-out (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). If the activity of S2P is responsible for the γ-secretase generation of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 from APP, then the CHO M19 cells should be unable to generate Aβ40 and/or Aβ42. Because endogenous production of Aβ is very low in CHO cells, and it is not recognized by the 6E10 antibody used in our gel assay, both CHO WT and CHO M19 cells (19Chin J. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6304-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chang T.Y. Hasan M.T. Chin J. Chang C.C.Y. Spillane D.M. Chen Jun Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were stably transfected with pBCB/APPsw695 which encodes hu APPsw. Individual geneticin-resistant clones, which secreted roughly equivalent amounts of hu APPs and vector control clones for CHO WT and CHO M19, were selected for further analysis (Fig. 3 A). Most non-neuronal cell lines, including these CHO cells, express the 751 or 770 splice variants of APP. Endogenous intracellular APP expressed by these cells is detected as the upper band in extracts from all clones (Fig. 3 A). It is well separated from the smaller APPsw which is detected in all of the pBCB/APPsw695 transfected clones (lower band in lanes 2, 3,5, and 6) but not in the vector control clones (lanes 1 and 4). Conditioned media from these six clones were collected and concentrated by immunoprecipitation and the hu Aβ40 and hu Aβ42 production was analyzed on the urea-gel/Western described above (Fig. 3 B). As expected, CHO WT clones expressing the APPsw processed and secreted hu Aβ40 and hu Aβ42 at a ratio of about 10:1 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 3). The CHO M19 clones also processed and secreted hu Aβ40 and hu Aβ42 in a ratio of about 10:1 and at a level reflecting total hu APPsw expression (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). These data demonstrate directly that the S2P-deficient CHO M19 cells are not deficient in γ-secretase activity. Following the collection of the conditioned media used above, we incubated these cultures in serum-free media to confirm that the CHO M19 clones lack S2P expression. We found that all of the CHO M19 clones died in serum-free media (within 24–48 h) as would be expected for cholesterol auxotrophs, whereas the CHO WT clones remained attached and appeared healthy for many days (data not shown). Furthermore, we used RT-PCR to demonstrate that only the CHO WT clones express mRNA for the S2P (Fig. 4). α-Tubulin-specific primers were used as a positive control, and RT-PCR generated a product of the expected 700 base pairs in CHO WT (lanes 1-3) and CHO M19 clones (lanes 4-6). In contrast, the S2P specific primers led to the generation of a 790-base pair fragment in the CHO WT clones (lanes 7-9), but no product was generated from cDNA derived from any of the CHO M19 clones (lanes 10-12). Similarly, Northern blot analysis for S2P expression showed that CHO WT cells expressed the ∼4-kilobase S2P transcript, CHO M19 cells were negative (data not shown). S2P stands out among the many proteases suggested to be γ-secretase because it has several properties that make it an ideal candidate. Only S2P and γ-secretase have been postulated to cleave substrates within the membrane in vivo (6Kang J. Lemaire H. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar, 9Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). S2P is widely expressed as is γ-secretase. S2P activity is (indirectly) enhanced by a transmembrane protein, SCAP, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and γ-secretase activity appears to require another endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein, PS1 (17De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). We therefore directly tested the hypothesis that the γ-secretase is the same enzyme as the SREBP S2P (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). First we show that over-expression of the recently cloned S2P in cells expressing APPsw does not lead to any enhancement of the production of Aβ40 or Aβ42 (Fig. 2) suggesting that either the S2P is not the γ-secretase or that γ-secretase activity is not limiting. The immediate substrates of γ-secretase are the ∼10- and ∼12-kDa C-terminal fragments (CTFs) generated by α- and β-secretase cleavage of APP, respectively (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 30Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Using antibodies that recognize these CTFs, we can detect both of these substrates in the 293 APPsw-expressing cells (data not shown), thus it would appear that the generation of additional Aβ (and p3) by over-expression of the authentic γ-secretase could occur in these cells. Although we did not directly show that the S2P protein was enzymatically active in our transfected 293 cells, using a similar protocol, Rawson et al. (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) documented that S2P cleavage was restored and cholesterol auxotrophy of M19 cells was corrected in CHO cells expressing S2P. Because over-expression of the S2P mRNA in 293 cells did not lead to generation of additional Aβ40 or Aβ42 we conclude that it is unlikely to be the same enzyme as the γ-secretase. Second, using S2P-deficient CHO M19 (9Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19Chin J. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol.

Lipidol. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) we show here that these cells process transfected hu APPsw to both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Neither the amount nor the ratio of Aβ40 or Aβ42 produced by the mutant CHO M19 clones is different from that produced by the CHO WT clones. Based on these experimental results we conclude that the SREBP S2P is not identical to the γ-secretase enzyme(s) responsible for the generation of the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Although the similarities between γ-secretase and the S2P are intriguing, there are a few differences. First, the substrates have different membrane insertion topology; APP is a type 1, single transmembrane protein (C terminus is cytosolic, N terminus is lumenal) whereas SREBP has two transmembrane domains (both N and C termini are cytosolic). Second, although it is not known how PS1 and/or PS2 regulate γ-secretase activity (direct versus indirect), it is clear that SCAP directly interacts with and regulates the SREBP site 1 protease (18Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); thus the S2P cleavage is only indirectly regulated by SCAP. Perhaps, as originally suggested by Brown and Goldstein (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar), the S2P and γ-secretase(s) are members of the same protease family. Rawsonet al. (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) recently cloned the S2P, and although they found numerous related genes from different organisms (human, hamster,Sulfolobus sp., Drosophila sp., Caenorhabditis elegans,and Schistosoma mansoni), the S2P appears to be a novel member of a new family of metalloproteases. The cDNA encoding the S2P contains the signature sequence (HEXXH) of zinc metalloproteases; however it does not belong to any of the well recognized protease families (31Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 32Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequences suggests that the S2P is a polytopic membrane protein with four or five transmembrane domains; even the hydrophilic active site, HEXXH, appears to be buried in a very hydrophobic region of the protein. These features, along with a serine repeat of variable length (in different species) and a cysteine-rich domain, may be hallmarks of this new family. Finding S2P related proteases based on these motifs or by direct homology screening may yet provide a fruitful end to the search for the elusive γ-secretase(s).

https://openalex.org/W2029589602,"Abstract The interaction of inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP) with oxygenated human adult hemoglobin (Hb) was investigated at 25 °C. The affinity of IHP for oxygenated Hb is strongly pH-dependent, and potentiometric measurements of proton uptake and release upon IHP addition have shown that over the range between pH 8.0 and pH 6.0 in oxygenated Hb there are three groups of residues that change their pK a values after IHP addition, likely because of their interaction with negative charges of the heterotropic effector. On the basis of previous calculations on the electrostatic properties of human Hb (Matthew, J. B., Hanania, G. I. H., and Gurd, F. R. N. (1979)Biochemistry 18, 1919–1928; Lee, A. W.-m., Karplus, M., Poyart, C., and Bursaux, E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1285–1301), two of these groups might be Val1β and His143β, which are located in the β1β2 dyad axis, where they have been also proposed to interact with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, whereas the third group does not appear easily identifiable. Calorimetric measurements of the heat associated with IHP binding at different pH values over the same range indicate that IHP binding is mostly enthalpy-driven at pH 7."
