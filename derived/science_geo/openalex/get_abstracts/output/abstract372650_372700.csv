IntroductionDuring oxygenic photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy for all higher forms of life on Earth. This process is driven by a photosynthetic apparatus within the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. The photochemical functions are performed by two photosystems: Photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). 4The abbreviations used are: PSI and -IIPhotosystems I and IILHCI and -IIlight-harvesting complexes I and IIβ-DMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideβ-DTMn-dodecyl-β-d-thiomaltosideChlchlorophyllTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePEGpolyethylene glycolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolBCRβ-carotene. These photosystems are multisubunit complexes that consist of protein and non-protein components, and drive light-dependent electron transfer reactions, resulting in the formation of high energy products: ATP and NADPH (1Nelson N. Ben-Shem A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 2Fromme P. Grotjohann I. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2008; 45: 33-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PSII catalyzes light-driven oxidation of water, providing electrons to PSI via the plastoquinone pool, the cytochrome b6f complex, and the water-soluble electron carrier plastocyanin. This electron transfer is coupled to the increase of a transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient (proton motive force), which powers ATP-synthase for phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. PSI catalyzes light-driven electron transport from plastocyanin at the inner face of the membrane (lumen) to ferredoxin on the outside of the membrane (stroma). The reduced ferredoxin is subsequently used for NADPH production, which provides the reducing power for the conversion of carbon dioxide to organic molecules. Although PSII is unique in its ability to extract electrons from water, PSI is arguably the most efficient photoelectric apparatus in nature, exhibiting a quantum efficiency of almost 100% in its utilization of light for electron transport (3Nelson N. Yocum C.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The ability of PS to convert sunlight energy is highly dependent on the precise spatial arrangement of the protein subunits and the relative positions of the cofactors. Therefore, understanding these mechanisms at a molecular level requires detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional arrangement of these complexes. However, PSI and PSII coordinate numerous pigments and comprise at least 19 protein subunits each, most of which transverse the photosynthetic membrane several times, presenting a formidable challenge for structural analysis (4Iwata S.

In the field of PSI research, the crystal structure of PSI from thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus provided a breakthrough toward understanding the unprecedented high quantum yield of PSI in light capture and electron transfer (12Guskov A.

The x-ray structure at 2.5-Å resolution revealed a PSI trimer, in which each monomer is composed of 12 protein subunits and 96 chlorophylls, and provided detailed insights into the molecular architecture of this complex (14Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In PSI from higher plants, our previous crystal structure of the PSI core complex together with its light-harvesting complex (LHCI) at 4.4-Å resolution showed an exquisitely organized monomeric complex of 16 protein subunits and 167 chlorophyll molecules (15Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), as well as two proteins that are not present in the cyanobacteria counterpart, namely PsaG and PsaH, and four proteins of the light-harvesting complex (Lhca1 through Lhca4). However, the low resolution structural data allowed identification of only the main structural elements, and important features were unavailable, such as the identity and conformation of the amino acid side chains. By intense analysis of plant biochemistry and systematic investigation of membrane protein crystallization procedures, we improved purification methods and optimized the crystallization conditions for plant PSI, which enabled the recent determination of the x-ray crystal structure at 3.4-Å resolution, by merging data from 10 different crystals (16Amunts A. Drory O. Nelson N. Nature. 2007; 447: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, the peripheral parts of the complex, including the LHCI, were poorly resolved, therefore prompting us to collect more complete data. The improved crystal structure reported here was determined from three independent and relatively complete data sets exhibiting monoclinic P21 symmetry with the β angle of ∼91.2°. A picture at near atomic detail of 12 of 18 protein subunits is presented. The positions of 3159 amino acids were assigned, as were those of 173 chlorophylls (145 revealing the orientation of the Qx and Qy transition dipolar moments), 15 carotenoids, 2 phyloquinones, and 3 Fe4S4 clusters, providing the most detailed picture of a plant PSI current available.In this report, we evaluate the critical steps involved in obtaining better structural information. We emphasize the straightforward biochemical procedure, which could be extrapolated and utilized in improving other plant membrane complex purification and crystallization protocols, as well as crystallographic aspects. From the improved crystal structure, we also examine the network of contacts among the PSI subunits and discuss the unique structural elements of plant PSI in respect to functional design.

https://openalex.org/W2132453544,"Understanding foreign speech is difficult, in part because of unusual mappings between sounds and words. It is known that listeners in their native language can use lexical knowledge (about how words ought to sound) to learn how to interpret unusual speech-sounds. We therefore investigated whether subtitles, which provide lexical information, support perceptual learning about foreign speech. Dutch participants, unfamiliar with Scottish and Australian regional accents of English, watched Scottish or Australian English videos with Dutch, English or no subtitles, and then repeated audio fragments of both accents. Repetition of novel fragments was worse after Dutch-subtitle exposure but better after English-subtitle exposure. Native-language subtitles appear to create lexical interference, but foreign-language subtitles assist speech learning by indicating which words (and hence sounds) are being spoken."
https://openalex.org/W1992131445,"The conserved tryptophan in position 13 of TM-VI (Trp-VI:13 or Trp-6.48) of the CWXP motif located at the bottom of the main ligand-binding pocket in TM-VI is believed to function as a rotameric microswitch in the activation process of seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptors. Molecular dynamics simulations in rhodopsin demonstrated that rotation around the chi1 torsion angle of Trp-VI:13 brings its side chain close to the equally highly conserved Phe-V:13 (Phe-5.47) in TM-V. In the ghrelin receptor, engineering of high affinity metal-ion sites between these positions confirmed their close spatial proximity. Mutational analysis was performed in the ghrelin receptor with multiple substitutions and with Ala substitutions in GPR119, GPR39, and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor as well as the NK1 receptor. In all of these cases, it was found that mutation of the Trp-VI:13 rotameric switch itself eliminated the constitutive signaling and strongly impaired agonist-induced signaling without affecting agonist affinity and potency. Ala substitution of Phe-V:13, the presumed interaction partner for Trp-VI:13, also in all cases impaired both the constitutive and the agonist-induced receptor signaling, but not to the same degree as observed in the constructs where Trp-VI:13 itself was mutated, but again without affecting agonist potency. In a proposed active receptor conformation generated by molecular simulations, where the extracellular segment of TM-VI is tilted inwards in the main ligand-binding pocket, Trp-VI:13 could rotate into a position where it obtained an ideal aromatic-aromatic interaction with Phe-V:13. It is concluded that Phe-V:13 can serve as an aromatic lock for the proposed active conformation of the Trp-VI:13 rotameric switch, being involved in the global movement of TM-V and TM-VI in 7TM receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2095555449,"Galectin-1, a β-galactoside-binding protein highly expressed in the thymus, induces apoptosis of specific thymocyte subsets and activated T cells. Galectin-1 binds to N- and O-glycans on several glycoprotein receptors, including CD7, CD43, and CD45. Here we show that galectin-1 signaling through CD45, which carries both N- and O-glycans, is regulated by CD45 isoform expression, core 2 O-glycan formation and the balance of N-glycan sialylation. Regulation of galectin-1 T cell death by O-glycans is mediated through CD45 phosphatase activity. While galectin-1 signaling in cells expressing low molecular weight isoforms of CD45 requires expression of core 2 O-glycans (high affinity ligands for galectin-1), galectin-1 signaling in cells expressing a high molecular weight isoform of CD45 does not require core 2 O-glycans, suggesting that a larger amount of core 1 O-glycans (low affinity ligands for galectin-1) is sufficient to overcome lack of core 2 O-glycans. Furthermore, regulation of galectin-1 signaling by α2,6-sialylation of N-glycans is not solely dependent on CD45 phosphatase activity and can be modulated by the relative expression of enzymes that attach sialic acid in an α2,6- or α2,3-linkage. Thus, N- and O-glycans modulate galectin-1 T cell death by distinct mechanisms, and different glycosylation events can render thymocytes susceptible or resistant to galectin-1. Galectin-1, a β-galactoside-binding protein highly expressed in the thymus, induces apoptosis of specific thymocyte subsets and activated T cells.

A functional immune response requires a T cell repertoire that can both recognize pathogens and ignore self. During T cell development in the thymus, thymocytes that either inadequately recognize foreign antigens or are self-reactive are purged by processes termed positive or negative selection, respectively (1Hogquist K.A. Baldwin T.A. Jameson S.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Positive and negative selection are complex processes controlled by a number of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. Both positive and negative thymocyte selection are regulated by galectin-1, an endogenous lectin expressed by thymic epithelial cells (2Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A.

Galectin-1 preferentially binds to lactosamine sequences (Galβ1,4GlcNAc) on both N- and O-glycans, and thus can bind to a wide variety of T cell surface glycoproteins that bear these glycans. In addition, our laboratory has shown that galectin-1 can bind to a glycoprotein receptor, CD43, bearing only core 1 O-glycans and lacking lactosamine sequences; in this case, low affinity/high avidity binding to a highly abundant but less preferred glycan ligand, Galβ1,3GalNAc, is sufficient to induce T cell death (6Hernandez J.D.

CD45 is estimated to comprise up to 10% of lymphocyte cell surface proteins, and the CD45 intracellular phosphatase domain contributes the majority of tyrosine phosphatase activity in T cells (16Thomas M.L.

Galectin-1 binding to CD45 reduces CD45 phosphatase activity, an effect that appears to be essential for galectin-1 death of CD45-expressing T cells (12Amano M. Galvan M. He J. Baum L.G. J. Biol.

Lett. 1999; 67: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. The extracellular domain of CD45 is variable, with different CD45 isoforms expressed on different lymphocyte subsets at distinct developmental stages. The extracellular domain of CD45 can include 1, 2, or 3 additional domains, termed A, B, and C, which are encoded by exons 4, 5, and 6 in the CD45 gene (16Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A, B, and C domains all contain numerous serine and threonine residues (in mouse, 13, 13, and 16 residues, respectively (16Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), so that CD45 isoforms including these domains bear additional O-glycans; the number of O-glycans on CD45 can vary significantly among different isoforms (19Furukawa K. Funakoshi Y. Autero M. Horejsi V. Kobata A. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thymocytes and mature T cells express low molecular weight isoforms of CD45, typically CD45R0 (no additional domains), CD45RA, and CD45RB. Thus T cells have relatively fewer O-glycans compared with B cells, which express full-length CD45RABC with the full complement of O-glycans (20Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y.

CD45 also bears abundant N-glycans, most of which are found on the membrane proximal region of the molecule, which is common to all CD45 isoforms.

Additionally, immature cortical thymocytes bear core 2 O-glycans, created by core 2 O-GlcNAc transferase (C2GnT); C2GnT expression is reduced in mature medullary thymocytes, concurrent with up-regulation of ST3Gal-I expression in this subset (2Baum L.G.

Similarly, there is higher binding of Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) to mature thymocytes compared with immature thymocytes, indicating increased decoration of glycans with α2,6-linked sialic acid on these cells. Knock-out of either ST3Gal-I or α2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal-I), both of which preferentially decorate glycans on mature thymocytes, results in aberrant thymocyte development and loss of cells from specific thymocyte subsets (32Priatel J.J.

However, it is not clear how these precise glycan modifications regulate galectin-1 signaling through CD45 during T cell death, nor how galectin-1 binding to different CD45 isoforms may be affected by glycosylation. In the present work, we have found that galectin-1 signaling via CD45 is regulated by both the relative abundance and the type of O-glycans on different CD45 isoforms, suggesting a mechanism by which T and B cells are differentially controlled in similar environments. The balance of α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acid on N-glycans influences galectin-1 binding to T cells and thymocytes, and removal of α2,6-linked sialic acids from N-glycans on mature thymocytes is sufficient to render the cells susceptible to galectin-1 death. Thus, thymocyte and T cell susceptibility to galectin-1 is controlled both by developmentally regulated glycosylation as well as by expression of specific glycoforms of CD45.

Thymocytes were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 10 mm GlutaMAX, 2.5 mg/liter glucose, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Fisher Scientific), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.l mg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 5% CO2. All flow cytometry was done at the UCLA Johnsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility on the BD FACScan or BD LSR I. Galectin-1 death assays were performed essentially as described (40Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Baum L.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in complete DMEM with galectin-1 (20 μm unless otherwise noted) in 1.2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT, Fisher Scientific) or buffer control for 4.5 h. Cells were disaggregated with 0.1 m β-lactose (Agros), washed in annexin-V binding buffer, and stained with annexin-V FITC or annexin-V PE (Molecular Probes) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Invitrogen). T200RABC and T200C817S cells were stained with annexin-V PE (Invitrogen) and 7-AAD. Percent cell death was calculated by normalizing the % of cells that are annexin-V+ in treated samples to % of cells that are annexin-V+ in buffer control and 100%. In galectin-1 death assays with bpV(phen) phosphatase inhibitor (Calbiochem) (11Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J.

Then galectin-1 or buffer control was added, and cells were incubated and assayed as above. Thymocytes were assayed for death with bpV(phen) essentially as described for cell lines above, with the following exceptions. 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 10 μm bpV(phen) for 3 h, followed by incubation with DTT or galectin-1. Thymocytes were stained with CD4-FITC (Biolegend), CD8a-PE (Biolegend), and 7-AAD, and 5 μl CountBright Absolute Counting beads (Invitrogen) were added to each sample. 750 beads were collected per sample. Thymocytes were gated into DN, DP, CD4, and CD8 subsets by CD4-FITC and CD8a-PE staining. Percent cell loss was calculated by finding the percent reduction in live cell counts per cell type per sample in galectin-1-treated versus buffer-treated control samples. For neuraminidase assays, thymocytes were resuspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in 100 units/ml Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella typhimurium LT2 neuraminidase (New England Biolabs), or buffer control (50 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, pH 6.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. Sialic acid removal was verified by flow cytometric analysis with SNA or MAA lectin (see below). Thymocytes were then resuspended in RPMI at 2.5 × 106/ml with galectin-1 or buffer control for 4.5 h. Galectin-1 or buffer control-treated thymocytes were then stained with CD4-FITC, CD8a-PE, 7-AAD, and CountBright Beads as above, and assayed for cell loss. For phenotyping of cell lines, 2 × 105 cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) and incubated with 0.2 μg of antibody for 1 h. Antibodies used were: 30-F11-FITC (BD Biosciences) for CD45, Rat IgG2b/κ-FITC (Biolegend), CD43 1B11-PE (Biolegend) for core 2 O-glycans, and rat IgG2a/κ-PE (Biolegend). For T200RABC or T200C817S cells, 30-F11-biotin (BD Biosciences) and Rat IgG2b/κ-biotin (BD Biosciences) were used to assay CD45 expression. Biotinylated 30-F11 or isotype control stains were bound by streptavidin-PerCP (BD Biosciences). For lectin phenotyping of cell lines, 2 × 105 cells were blocked with 1% BSA and then stained with 1 μg/106 cells BSA-biotin, PNA-biotin, MAA-biotin, or 0.3 μg/106 cells SNA-biotin (Vector Labs). Cells were washed and bound lectin was detected with 5 μg/ml streptavidin-FITC (Jackson IR). For lectin phenotyping of thymocytes, 1 × 106 thymocytes were stained with lectins as above, except that biotinylated lectins were detected with 5 μg/ml streptavidin-PerCP (BD Biosciences). Thymocytes were co-stained with CD4-FITC (Biolegend) and CD8a-APC (BD Biosciences) to allow gating of DN, DP, CD4, and CD8 populations. For galectin-1 binding, 5 × 105 cells were suspended in PBS with the indicated amount of galectin-1-biotin for 10 min with or without 50 mm β-lactose. Cells were washed in PBS and then stained in 5 μg/ml streptavidin-FITC. Mean fluorescence intensity was corrected for autofluorescence for each cell type. 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 250 μl of complete DMEM and 20 μm galectin-1 and 1.2 mm DTT or buffer control (in triplicate). Cells were incubated in round bottom 96-well plates for 15 min or the indicated times, washed twice with 1× TBS, then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal CA-630, Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma)). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min. 1 part lysate was mixed with 9 parts phosphatase assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50 nm okadaic acid, and 10 mm pNpp) with or without 40 μm bpV(phen) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Equal volume 1 m NaOH (Sigma) was then added to stop the pNpp reaction. Samples were plated in duplicate and were read on a colorimetric spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus) at A415. A415 readings were normalized to blank and background activity readings for each cell type (except T200C817S in supplemental Fig. S1, which was normalized to background activity of T200RABC control). 106 cells were washed in PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were assayed for protein concentration by Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad), and diluted to 1 mg/ml protein. 100 μg of protein lysate was mixed with 10 μl of protein G beads (Pierce) and 1 μg of goat anti-mouse CD45 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) or 1 μg of goat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C.

This proliferation and IGF1 synthesis requires the estrogen receptor (ER), which binds directly to target DNA sequences (estrogen-responsive elements or EREs), or interacts with other transcription factors, such as AP1, to impact transcription. We observe neither uterine growth nor an increase in Igf1 transcript in a mouse with a DNA-binding mutated ER alpha (KIKO), indicating that both Igf1 regulation and uterine proliferation require the DNA binding function of the ER. We identified several potential EREs in the Igf1 gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed ER alpha binding to these EREs in wild type but not KIKO chromatin. STAT5 is also reported to regulate Igf1; uterine Stat5a transcript is increased by estradiol (E(2)), but not in KIKO or alpha ERKO uteri, indicating ER alpha- and ERE-dependent regulation. ER alpha binds to a potential Stat5a ERE. We hypothesize that E(2) increases Stat5a transcript through ERE binding; that ER alpha, either alone or together with STAT5, then acts to increase Igf1 transcription; and that the resulting lack of IGF1 impairs KIKO uterine growth. Treatment with exogenous IGF1, alone or in combination with E(2), induces proliferation in wild type but not KIKO uteri, indicating that IGF1 replacement does not rescue the KIKO proliferative response. Together, these observations suggest in contrast to previous in vitro studies of IGF-1 regulation involving AP1 motifs that direct ER alpha-DNA interaction is required to increase Igf1 transcription. Additionally, full ER alpha function is needed to mediate other cellular signals of the growth factor for uterine growth."
https://openalex.org/W2154840175,"Upon activation, ERKs translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process is required for the induction of many cellular responses, yet the molecular mechanisms that regulate ERK nuclear translocation are not fully understood. We have used a mouse embryo fibroblast ERK1-knock-out cell line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ERK1 to probe the spatio-temporal regulation of ERK1. Real time fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed that ERK1 nuclear accumulation increased upon serum stimulation, but the mobility of the protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm remained unchanged. Dimerization of ERK has been proposed as a requirement for nuclear translocation. However, ERK1-Δ4, the mutant shown consistently to be dimerization-deficient in vitro, accumulated in the nucleus to the same level as wild type (WT), indicating that dimerization of ERK1 is not required for nuclear entry and retention. Consistent with this finding, energy migration Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements in living cells did not detect dimerization of GFP-ERK1-WT upon activation. In contrast, the kinetics of nuclear accumulation and phosphorylation of GFP-ERK1-Δ4 were slower than that of GFP-ERK1-WT. These results indicate that the differential shuttling behavior of the mutant is a consequence of delayed phosphorylation of ERK by MEK rather than dimerization. Our data demonstrate for the first time that a delay in cytoplasmic activation of ERK is directly translated into a delay in nuclear translocation.

In this kinase cascade, Raf phosphorylates only MEK, and MEK phosphorylates only ERK, whereas ERK is able to phosphorylate many substrates in nearly all cell compartments (1Yoon S. Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Noncatalytic activation of a few partners by c-Raf is well documented, but the biological outcomes of the ERK pathway are predominantly driven by the kinase activity, as evidenced, for example, by chemical inhibition (reviewed in Ref. 2Kohno M. Pouyssegur J. Ann. Med. 2006; 38: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ERK is primarily located in the cytoplasm of resting cells, although overexpression results in cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (3Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L’Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that in the course of physiological signal transduction, ERK accumulates in the nucleus after acute stimulation of the cell (3Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L’Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 4Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of ERK is required for cell cycle entry. Thus, retention of ERK in the cytoplasm alters neither ERK kinase activity nor phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates, whereas ERK-dependent transcription and cell proliferation are blocked (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates the Phe-Gly nucleoporins Nup50, Nup153, and Nup154, reducing importin-β-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport (6Kosako H. Yamaguchi N. Aranami C.

This observation would expand the role of ERK nuclear entry to include the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of certain classes of proteins while crossing the nucleopore. mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase fluorescence correlation spectroscopy energy migration Förster resonance energy transfer fluorescence recovery after photobleaching fluorescence intensity per mobile object extracellular signal-regulated kinase green fluorescent protein wild type human ERK1 deleted from Pro193–Asp196 mouse embryo fibroblasts leptomycin B Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. MEK functions as the cytoplasmic anchor for ERK such that MEK co-overexpression maintains the cytoplasmic localization of overexpressed ERK, whereas saturating levels of the ERK-binding site of MEK abrogates ERK export from the nucleus (7Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MEK is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a consequence of active export out of the nucleus mediated by its nuclear export sequence. MEK binds to inactive ERK in resting cells (8Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The natural regulation of ERK translocation has also been demonstrated by differential expression of cytoplasmic anchors such as PEA15 (9Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A.

Keyse S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1830-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or Vanishing (13Sur R. Ramos J.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the stimulation-induced nuclear accumulation of ERK requires the synthesis of short lived nuclear anchors (14Volmat V. Camps M. Arkinstall S. Pouysségur J. Lenormand P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, regulation of ERK nuclear translocation is an essential feature of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. The precise mechanism of ERK transport across the nuclear pore is not fully understood. ERK lacks a nuclear localization sequence, leading to the suggestion that ERK may enter by a piggyback mechanism via binding to nuclear localization sequence-containing proteins (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization sequence-dependent mechanisms require energy for Ran-dependent cycling of importins (15Terry L.J. Shows E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 2007; 318: 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, reconstituted import assays have shown that ERK can bind directly to FXFG sequences of nucleoporin in the lumen of the nuclear pore complex, indicating that it may enter the nucleus in the absence of energy sources or cytosolic factors (16Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Point mutations of ERK revealed that inactive and active ERK interact with nucleoporins via different domains; thus, both active and inactive ERK can be transported across the nuclear pore in an energy-independent fashion (18Yazicioglu M.N. Goad D.L. Ranganathan A. Whitehurst A.W. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28759-28767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it has also been proposed that active transport of ERK may also occur and that it requires dimerization of the protein driven by phosphorylation of the TEY activation loop (19Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Indeed, in a reconstituted import assay, thiophosphorylated ERK2 import increased in the presence of energy (20Ranganathan A. Yazicioglu M.N. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15645-15652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations suggest a role for both an energy-dependent (presumably via dimerization) and an energy-independent mechanism (via direct binding to nucleoporins) in ERK cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. Surprisingly, the role of ERK dimerization in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has proven to be controversial. Two distinct “dimerization mutants” have been used in several studies as follows: the mutation of histidine 176 to glutamic acid plus four leucines to alanines (H176E,L333A,L336A,L341A,L344A or H176E L4A mutant) or the removal of histidine 176 and three adjacent amino acids (deletion 174–177 or Δ4 mutant). Initially, both mutants were shown to not dimerize in vitro and to not accumulate in the nucleus (19Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and later it was demonstrated that they remained monomeric in vitro at physiological salt concentrations (21Wilsbacher J.L. Juang Y.C. Khokhlatchev A.V. Gallagher E. Binns D. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13175-13182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, further studies using the H176E L4A mutant indicated its translocation to be normal (unless fused to β-galactosidase) (22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although others found another replacement mutant, H176A L4A, to accumulate even in starved cells (24Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); this mutant without the glutamic charge was not tested in vitro for its capacity to dimerize. Moreover, dimerization could not be detected in live cells through FRET measurements between co-expressed yellow fluorescent protein-ERK and cyan fluorescent protein-ERK (23Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that ERK dimerization plays a role in the activation of cytoplasmic substrates but not nuclear substrates (25Casar B. Pinto A. Crespo P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In parallel investigations focused on the nature and functional role(s) of ERK interactions with mitochondria, it was determined that dimerization of human ERK1 was favored in the mitochondria, also occurred in the nuclei, but was hardly detectable in the cytosol of HeLa cells (26Galli S. Jahn O. Hitt R. Hesse D. Opitz L. Plessmann U. Urlaub H. Poderoso J.J. Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In view of these and other somewhat disparate assessments of ERK dimerization, we examined in detail the dimerization mutant ERK1-Δ4 because several studies have reported that the related mutation in ERK2 leads to abnormal nuclear translocation (19Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 22Adachi M. Fukuda M.

In attempts to retain a normal cytoplasmic localization of ERK transfected to high levels of expression, several studies have resorted to co-expression of MEK (22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Horgan A.M. Stork P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although others have imaged cells expressing very low levels of ERK (28Costa M. Marchi M. Cardarelli F. Roy A. Beltram F. Maffei L. Ratto G.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4952-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ERK co-expressed with MEK generally displays an abnormally short persistence in the nucleus following stimulation, ranging from 10 to 40 min (23Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Horgan A.M. Stork P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Furuno T. Hirashima N. Onizawa S. Sagiya N. Nakanishi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4416-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) instead of several hours in the case of endogenous ERK. In our studies, we used a mouse embryo fibroblast ERK1-knock-out cell line (MEFERK1−/− (30Pagès G. Guérin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)). The lack of endogenous ERK1 allowed us to transfect MEFERK1−/− cells with GFP-ERK1 while maintaining the MEK-ERK balance and ensuring that every ERK1 in the cell is GFP-tagged. Using this system, we examined ERK1 localization, cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation, and dimerization in live cells using fluorescence microscopy techniques. Our results demonstrate that the mutant displays delayed kinetics of nuclear entry/shuttling but no differences in overall nuclear accumulation. These real time measurements in ERK1 knock-out cells help to reconcile previous discrepancies between studies with ERK “dimerization mutants,” by emphasizing that the differences in mutant and WT ERK are subtle, and the ability to resolve these differences is dependent on the time scale of the measurements. We also found that mutation of the dimerization motif delayed ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that the mutant is less efficiently phosphorylated by MEK. Our study reveals that dimerization of ERK is not required for nuclear entry but rather that the efficient activation of ERK by MEK is the key determinant of rapid nuclear translocation. Full-length cDNA of human ERK1 subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to remove the codons for amino acids Pro193–Asp196 and generate ERK1-Δ4. GFP-ERK1-WT and GFP-ERK1-Δ4 were generated by PCR cloning of human ERK1 or human ERK1-Δ4 into PCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) followed by ligation into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector from Clontech. Mouse embryo fibroblast ERK1 knock-out cells (MEFERK1−/− (30Pagès G. Guérin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)) were cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transient transfections were used within 48 h. For microscopy, cell monolayers were cultured in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY). Cells were starved (0 or 0.1% serum) for 4–12 h. Live cell imaging was carried out in Tyrode’s buffer with 20 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and samples were maintained at 34–36 °C by an objective heater (Bioscience Tools). For immunofluorescence, transfected cells were plated on coverslips and fixed with methanol at −20 °C at different time points after addition of 10% serum. Anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 and goat anti-mouse-Cy3 secondary were from Sigma. Fluorescence imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) were performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a 63× 1.2 NA water objective or 63× 1.4 NA oil objective. GFP was excited and bleached using a 488-nm laser line. Photobleaching of a region of interest was achieved by increasing the laser to 95% power. To determine the recovery time for the bleach experiments, images were background-subtracted, and post-bleach curves were fit to Equation 1,I[t]=Io+A(1-exp(-t/τ))(1) where Io is an offset; A is the amplitude; t is time, and τ is the characteristic recovery time. Live cell anisotropy measurements for detection of energy migration Förster resonance energy transfer (emFRET or homo-FRET) were carried out with a Zeiss LSM 510-META confocal laser scanning microscope incorporating a polarization beam splitter so as to simultaneously record the parallel (I‖) and perpendicular (I⊥) polarized emission signals. GFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected using 505–530-nm bandpass filters. Images were acquired using a 63× 1.2 NA oil objective with a confocal slice thickness of 1 μm. Anisotropy (r) was calculated from r = (I‖ − GI⊥)/(I‖ + 2GI⊥), where G is the correction factor for the difference in the sensitivity of the two detectors. G = I‖/I⊥ was determined from a sample with r = 0 (in our case, fluorescein in aqueous solution). For more details, see Refs. 31Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Barisas B.G. Heintzmann R. Post J.N. Lidke K.A.

Image Process. 2005; 14: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was performed with an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE200, Nikon) using the 488-nm line (narrow pass interference filter, CVI-Melles Griot) of an argon ion laser (Ion Laser Technology) as the excitation source. The beam intensity was stabilized with a laser amplitude stabilization system (Conoptics). Fluorescence emission was detected with a photon-counting avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Digital signal correlation was performed using a Flex02-03D auto/cross-correlator (Correlator). A 60×, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Zeiss) was used. Correlation data at times shorter than that corresponding to the laser stabilization feedback frequency (∼200 kHz) were discarded. The beam waist, w0, measured using a variation of the knife-edge scan method (33Schneider M.B. Webb W.W. Appl. Optics. 1981; 20: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was 0.266 μm. The axial acceptance was determined to be 4 μm, by scanning a thin fluorescent film in z. FCS correlation curves were fit with MATLAB using the Gaussian acceptance approximation (34Elson E.L. Magde D. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 1-27Crossref Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) shown in Equation 2,G(τ)=1N(1+ττo)-1(1+k-2ττo)-1/2(2) where N is the number of diffusing species in the sample volume; τo is the diffusion time, and k is a fixed parameter that accounts for the differing axial and lateral dimensions of the sample volume. All measurements were performed with a laser irradiance estimated as ∼4 kilowatts/cm2 in the sample plane from measurements with an optical power meter (model S110, Thorlabs) and estimations of the image field. Increasing the laser intensity 2-fold had a negligible effect on τo, demonstrating that neither photophysical saturation nor photobleaching biased the measurements (see supplemental Table S1). This result was also consistent with prior reports of the photobleaching sensitivity of FCS (35Widengren J. Rigler R. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 857-879PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dittrich P. Malvezzi-Campeggi F. Jahnz M. Schwille P. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The low illumination intensity used for FCS precluded the population of the enhanced GFP triplet state (37Haupts U. Haupts C. Oesterhelt D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3834-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Brightness (F/N), the average fluorescence intensity (F) divided by the number of molecules in the observation volume (N), a quantity determined from the fluorescence fluctuations, was used to monitor the aggregation state of ERK. The number of molecules (N) per volume was used to calculate GFP-ERK concentration. Because the axial acceptance of the FCS measurements was larger than the height of the cells, we performed electron microscopy measurements of starved MEFERK1−/− cells, leading to estimates of nuclear and cytoplasmic thickness, 2.2 ± 0.4 and 1.7 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. The calculations of concentration were corrected accordingly. CCL39 (Chinese hamster lung cell) fibroblasts were stably transfected with pcDNA3-GFP-ERK1 or pcDNA3-GFP-ERK1-Δ4. After selection with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), cells were grown 3 weeks to stabilize expression at low levels, and GFP-expressing cells were sorted with a FACS-ARIA (BD Biosciences). Cells were grown to confluency in DMEM incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and then for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Three hours prior to stimulation, cells were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM lacking sodium bicarbonate (catalogue no. 1280, Invitrogen) and supplemented with 25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were stimulated with a large volume to reach 10% serum final concentration, and were then washed rapidly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins from lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide 29:1 gels), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P from Millipore). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected with the monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody M8159 from Sigma. Total ERK was detected with rabbit serum E1B 1:3000 (38Lefloch R. Pouysségur J. Lenormand P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 511-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Promega, and chemiluminescence was used to detect immunoreactive bands on autoradiography film to obtain high resolution images and with the Gnome detector from Syngene (United Kingdom) to quantify the data. Monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK was purchased from Sigma (M8159) and used at 1:500. Anti-ERK1 antibody R2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (catalogue number 06-182, immunopeptide consisting of the last 35 amino acids of rat ERK1), diluted 1:1000. Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit from Molecular Probes. The study of ERK nuclear translocation has classically required fluorescent tagging of the transfected molecules and often the co-expression of MEK to avoid saturation of cytoplasmic anchors. Tagging can alter the mechanism of translocation, and in addition, the co-expression of MEK has often led to a shorter than expected duration of ERK nuclear localization (23Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3832-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Horgan A.M. Stork P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Furuno T. Hirashima N. Onizawa S. Sagiya N. Nakanishi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4416-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially characterized ERK1 nuclear translocation using untagged ERK1 in MEFERK1−/− cells devoid of endogenous ERK1, presuming that the endogenous MEK was available to allow normal localization of transfected ERK. Furthermore, we compared translocation of ERK1-WT with that of the dimerization mutant ERK1-Δ4. The supplemental Fig. S1 demonstrates that anti-ERK1 antibody (R2) bound efficiently to ERK1 in wild type MEF cells, whereas no signals were obtained in MEFERK1−/−. This is the first demonstration of an ERK1-specific antibody that can be used to study ERK1 subcellular localization without cross- labeling of ERK2. Furthermore, ERK1 transfected into MEFERK1−/− cells was detected readily with our anti-ERK1 R2 antibody (supplemental Fig. S2), and the time course of nuclear translocation closely mimicked that of endogenous ERK1 in WT MEF cells (data not shown). Indeed, transfected ERK1-WT could be detected in the nucleus within 5 min after stimulation, and nuclear accumulation persisted for several hours, still being maximal after 2 h of stimulation (supplemental Fig. S2). Surprisingly, ERK1-Δ4 behaved similarly to ERK1-WT. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, at 10 min the ERK1-Δ4 was already localized in the nucleus, where it was present for at least 2 h, as in the case of ERK1-WT. To probe for differences between WT and mutant, we blocked protein synthesis prior to stimulation to impede synthesis of nuclear anchors. In the presence of cycloheximide, both ERK1-WT and ERK1-Δ4 failed to accumulate in the nucleus by 2 h post-stimulation (supplemental Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that in cells lacking endogenous ERK1, both ERK1-WT and ERK1-Δ4 behave like endogenous ERK1. The “snapshot” immunofluorescence studies did not reveal differences between the behavior of ERK1-WT and ERK1-Δ4. Considering that the differences may have been subtle, and therefore requiring finer temporal resolution, we resorted to GFP fusion proteins of ERK1 for real time microscopy studies. To verify that adding the 27-kDa GFP to the 44-kDa ERK does not affect the properties of ERK1, we performed control experiments indicating that GFP-ERK1-WT mimicked the nucleocytoplasmic localization patterns of endogenous ERK. Fig. 1, upper row, shows that GFP-ERK1-WT localized to the cytosol in resting cells. As expected, serum addition triggered rapid nuclear translocation within 13 min, and GFP-ERK1-WT was retained in the nucleus for 2 h post-stimulation. This result was in agreement with those gained in experiments tracking endogenous ERK1 in wild type MEF cells and untagged ERK1 transfected in MEFERK1−/− (supplemental Fig. S2). At 3 h post-stimulation, GFP-ERK1-WT nuclear accumulation was markedly diminished (Fig. 1). We also evaluated the activation of total ERK by following the kinetics of dual phosphorylation by MEK (Fig. 1, 2nd row). Cells were starved for 12 h to avoid decreasing expression of transfected ERK; in these cells, the level of phosphorylated ERK was low in both transfected and untransfected cells (Fig. 1, 0 min, 2nd row). Hence, both endogenous ERK2 and GFP-ERK1-WT were maintained inactive in the cytoplasm in the starved cells. Upon stimulation, phosphorylated ERK increased markedly in all cells and accumulated rapidly in the nucleus (Fig. 1, 13 min, 2nd row). The higher signal in transfected cells at 13 and 60 min reveals that both the short and long term nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated GFP-ERK1-WT closely paralleled the localization of endogenous phospho-ERK2 in the nontransfected MEFERK1−/− cells. As reported previously (14Volmat V. Camps M. Arkinstall S. Pouysségur J. Lenormand P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GFP-ERK1-WT was sequestered in the nucleus even after dephosphorylation had occurred (Fig. 1, 120 and 180 min, 1st row), as evidenced by the persistent nuclear GFP signal and loss of phospho-ERK (120 and 180 min, 2nd row). Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of the GFP tag did not alter either the subcellular localization or the activation patterns of ERK1. We studied the real time dynamics of GFP-ERK1 in living cells. Cells overexpressing GFP-ERK1 to a high degree showed the expected accumulation of GFP-ERK1 in the nucleus even in the starved state (as reported previously (3Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G.

It induces potent growth-inhibitory responses in normal cells but promotes migration and invasion of cancer cells. Smads mediate the TGF-β responses. TGF-β binding to the cell surface receptors leads to the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in their C terminus as well as in the proline-rich linker region. The serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the linker region are followed by the proline residue. Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, recognizes phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs. Here we show that Smad2/3 interacts with Pin1 in a TGF-β-dependent manner. We further show that the phosphorylated threonine 179-proline motif in the Smad3 linker region is the major binding site for Pin1. Although epidermal growth factor also induces phosphorylation of threonine 179 and other residues in the Smad3 linker region the same as TGF-β, Pin1 is unable to bind to the epidermal growth factor-stimulated Smad3. Further analysis suggests that phosphorylation of Smad3 in the C terminus is necessary for the interaction with Pin1. Depletion of Pin1 by small hairpin RNA does not significantly affect TGF-β-induced growth-inhibitory responses and a number of TGF-β/Smad target genes analyzed. In contrast, knockdown of Pin1 in human PC3 prostate cancer cells strongly inhibited TGF-β-mediated migration and invasion. Accordingly, TGF-β induction of N-cadherin, which plays an important role in migration and invasion, is markedly reduced when Pin1 is depleted in PC3 cells. Because Pin1 is overexpressed in many cancers, our findings highlight the importance of Pin1 in TGF-β-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells.

Interestingly, these three same sites, Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208, in the Smad3 linker region are also phosphorylated by ERK in response to EGF treatment and Ser-208 is the best ERK phosphorylation site in Smad3 (29Matsuura I.

However, due to the lack of specific phosphopeptide antibodies against each of the putative phosphorylation sites and the lack of mapping of the phosphorylation sites by other methods, the exact sites in the Smad2 linker region that are phosphorylated in response to TGF-β or EGF remain to be determined. Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that recognizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs in certain proteins and catalyzes prolyl cis/trans isomerization (39Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z.

The prolyl isomerization induces conformational changes, leading to distinct effects in different target proteins, such as increased stability, increased turnover, alteration of the sensitivity to phosphatases, alteration in subcellular localizations, and altered enzymatic activities, and enabling protein-protein interactions (39Lu K.P.

Because the Thr-179, Ser-204, and Ser-208 phosphorylation sites in Smad3 are followed by the proline residue, they constitute putative Pin1 binding sites. It is possible that certain or all of these sites serve as the Pin1-binding site(s) when they are phosphorylated. Recently, Nakano et al. (53Nakano A. Koinuma D. Miyazawa K. Uchida T. Saitoh M.

We show in this report that Pin1 binds to Smad2/3 in a TGF-β-dependent manner and that the phosphorylated Thr-179-proline is the major binding site for Pin1 in Smad3 in response to TGF-β. We further show that knockdown of Pin1 does not have a significant effect on TGF-β-induced growth-inhibitory response, as analyzed in the human HaCaT keratinocytes. On the contrary, knockdown of Pin1 in human PC3 prostate cancer cells significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced cell migration and invasion. Our study uncovered an important role of Pin1 in TGF-β-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion.

The Escherichia coli cell envelope contains an inner plasma membrane, a stress-bearing peptidoglycan layer, and an asymmetric outer membrane consisting of a phospholipid inner monolayer and an outer monolayer composed of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 2The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideUnd-Pundecaprenyl monophosphateGlcNAc-P-P-UndGlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenolGalNAc-P-P-UndGalNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenolMSmass spectroscopyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

O-antigens are, thus, the dominant feature of the bacterial cell surface and constitute important determinants of virulence and pathogenicity (5Law D. J. Appl.

Currently, E. coli strains with more than 180 individual O-serotypes, attributed to unique O-antigen structures, have been identified (8Stenutz R. Weintraub A. Widmalm G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 382-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). O-antigen repeat units are pre-assembled on the cytosolic face of the inner membrane attached to undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-P-P). The lipid-linked repeat units diffuse transversely (flip-flop) to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and are polymerized before transport to the outer membrane and ligation to LPS. Most heteropolymeric O-antigen repeat units have either N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) at the reducing terminus, and it has been assumed that the biosynthesis of the lipid intermediates is initiated by the transfer of GlcNAc-P or GalNAc-P from their respective sugar nucleotide derivatives to Und-P catalyzed by WecA (3Samuel G.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the conclusion that WecA catalyzes the synthesis of GalNAc-P-P-Und is based on genetic studies (12Wang L. Reeves P.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3545-3551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no direct enzymological evidence demonstrating that WecA utilizes UDP-GalNAc as a GalNAc-P donor. E. coli O157 is an enterohemorrhagic strain responsible for approximately two-thirds of all recent cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome and poses serious human health concerns (5Law D. J. Appl.

E. coli O157 synthesizes an O-antigen containing the repeating tetrasaccharide with the structure (4-N-acetyl perosamine → fucose → glucose → GalNAc) (14Perry M.B. MacLean L. Griffith D.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have investigated the initiating reaction of E. coli O157 O-antigen subunit assembly to determine whether GalNAc-P-P-Und synthesis is catalyzed by WecA or by some previously undescribed mechanism. The evidence presented here shows that GalNAc-P-P-Und is not synthesized by GalNAc-P transfer from UDP-GalNAc catalyzed by WecA but rather by the reversible epimerization of the 4-OH of GlcNAc-P-P-Und catalyzed by a novel epimerase encoded by the Z3206 gene in E. coli O157. Thus, this paper describes a novel biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of an important bacterial cell surface component as well as a new biosynthetic route for the synthesis of GalNAc-P-P-Und.

The Z3206 gene was amplified from E. coli O157:H45 by PCR with oligonucleotides Z3206-Fw and Z3206-RvHA (AAACCCGGGATGAACGATAACGTTTTGCTC and AAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTCAGAAACAAACGTTATGTC; restriction sites are underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with SmaI and XbaI and ligated into SmaI-XbaI cleaved pMLBAD vector (17Lefebre M.D. Valvano M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5956-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This resulted in plasmid pMLBAD:Z3206 encoding Z3206 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag. The gne gene was amplified from pACYCpgl (18Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M. North S.J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Wren B.W. Aebi M. Science. 2002; 298: 1790-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), encoding Campylobacter jejuni pgl cluster, with oligonucleotides gne-Fw and gne-RV (AAACCATGGATGAAAATTCTTATTAGCGG and AAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGCACTGTTTTTCCCAATC; restriction sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and ligated into the same sites of pMLBAD to generate plasmid pMLBAD:gne, which encodes Gne with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag (Table 1). E. coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 0.6% NaCl) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Arabinose-inducible expression was achieved by adding arabinose at a final concentration of 0.02–0.2% (w/v) to E. coli cells grown up to an A600 of 0.05–0.4. The same amount of arabinose was added again 5 h post-induction, and incubation continued for 4–15 h. Total E. coli cell extracts were prepared for immunodetection analysis using cells at a concentration equivalent to 1 A600 unit that were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS loading buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μl were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Periplasmic extracts of E. coli cells were prepared by lysozyme treatment (20Feldman M.F. Wacker M. Hernandez M. Hitchen P.G. Marolda C.L. Kowarik M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Valvano M.A. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3016-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and 10 μl of the final sample (corresponding to 0.2 A600 units of cells) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After being blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, sample was immunostained with the specific antiserum (21Aebi M. Gassenhuber J. Domdey H. te Heesen S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-AcrA (18Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M. North S.J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Wren B.W.

Detection was carried out with ECLTM Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For the preparation of membrane fractions, bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, once with cold water, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose. The cells were resuspended to a density of ∼200 A600 units/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, quickly resuspended in 40 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and placed on ice. After 10 min the cells were homogenized with 15 strokes with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sucrose to a final concentration of 0.25 m. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and cell envelopes were recovered by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA and again sedimented at 40,000 × g and resuspended in the same buffer to a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. Membrane fractions were stored at −20 °C until needed. Reaction mixtures for the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-Und and GalNAc-P-P-Und contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 40 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm 5′AMP, E. coli membrane fraction (50–200 μg of membrane protein, and either 5 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc/GalNAc (500–2500 dpm/pmol) or purified [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und/[3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und (2000 dpm/pmol, dispersed in 1% Triton X-100, final concentration 0.1%) in a total volume of 0.05 ml. After incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and the total lipid extract containing [3H]HexNAc-P-P-undecaprenols was prepared as described previously (22Waechter C.J. Kennedy J.L. Harford J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After partitioning, the organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 1 ml CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and an aliquot (0.2 ml) was removed, dried in a scintillation vial, and analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a Packard Tri-Carb 2100 TR liquid scintillation spectrometer. To determine the rate of synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und or [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und, the lipid extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in a small volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and spotted on a 10 × 20-cm borate-impregnated Baker Si250 silica gel plate, and the plate was developed with CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O, 0.2 m sodium borate (65:25:2:2). Individual glycolipids were detected with a Bioscan AR2000 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan, Washington, D. C.). The biosynthetic rates for each glycolipid were calculated by multiplying the total amount of radioactivity in [3H]GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-Und by the percentage of the individual [3H] glycolipids. E. coli cells were cultured with vigorous shaking in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–1. [3H]GlcNAc was added to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml, and the incubation was continued for 5 min at 37 °C. The incorporation of radiolabel into glycolipids was terminated by the addition of 0.5 gm/ml crushed ice, and the cultures were thoroughly mixed. The bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline two times, resuspended by vigorous vortex mixing in 10 volumes (cell pellet) of methanol, and sonicated briefly with a probe sonicator at 40% full power. After sonication, 20 volumes of chloroform were added, and the extracts were mixed vigorously and allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min. The insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation, and the pellet was re-extracted with a small volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) twice. The combined organic extracts were then processed as described below. GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-Und was extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and freed of water-soluble material by partitioning as described elsewhere (22Waechter C.J. Kennedy J.L. Harford J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The organic extract was then dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the bulk glycerophospholipids were destroyed by deacylation in toluene/methanol (1:3) containing 0.1 n KOH at 0 °C for 60 min. The deacylation reaction was neutralized with acetic acid, diluted with 4 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and washed with 1/5 volume of 0.9% NaCl. The organic (lower) phase was washed with ⅓ volume of CHCl3, CH3OH, 0.9% NaCl (3:48:47), and the aqueous phase was discarded. The organic phase was diluted with sufficient methanol to accommodate the residual aqueous phase in the organic phase and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (5 ml) equilibrated with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) and then eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) containing 20 mm ammonium acetate. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and monitored for either radioactivity or GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-Und using an anisaldehyde spray reagent (23Dunphy P.J. Kerr J.D. Pennock J.F. Whittle K.J. Feeney J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 136: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) after resolution by thin layer chromatography on borate-impregnated silica plates (as described earlier). GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-Und elute in fractions 3–10. These fractions were combined, supplemented with sufficient CHCl3 and H2O to give a final composition of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:2:1), and partitioned. The aqueous layer was aspirated, and the organic layer was dried under a stream of nitrogen, spotted on a Quantum 1 thin layer plate (silica gel G, not borate-impregnated), and developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4). GlcNAc/GalNAc-lipid zones were located by staining with iodine vapors and by comparison with radioactive marker lipids (if nonradioactive lipids were being purified) or detected by Bioscanning if radiolabeled GlcNAc/GalNAc-lipids were present. The desired zones were scraped from the plate, loaded into a Pasteur pipette, equipped with a glass wool plug, and washed sequentially with 2 column volumes of CH3OH and then with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:35:6) (∼10 column volumes). The eluate was adjusted to CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:2:1) by the addition of CHCl3 and H2O, and the phases were separated by a brief centrifugation. The aqueous layer was discarded, and the lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen, spotted on a borate-impregnated Quantum 1 thin layer plate, and developed with CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O, 0.2 m sodium borate (65:25:2:2). GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-Und were located by exposure of the TLC plate to iodine vapors and by comparison to radioactive marker lipids and recovered from the silica gel as described above, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C until use. Silica gel thin layer plates were impregnated with sodium borate by briefly immersing the plates in 2.5% Na2B4O7·10 H2O in 95% methanol as described by Kean (24Kean E.L. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 449-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The borate-impregnated TLC plates were dried overnight at room temperature and stored in a vacuum desiccator over Drierite until use. Immediately before chromatography, the plates were activated by heating briefly (∼10–15 min) to 100 °C. Whatman No. 1 paper was impregnated with sodium borate by dipping 20 × 30-cm sheets of Whatman 1 paper in 0.2 m Na2B4O7·10 H2O. The Whatman No. 1 paper sheets were pressed firmly between two sheets of Whatman No. 3MM paper and allowed to dry at room temperature for several days, as described by Cardini and Leloir (25Cardini C.E. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycans of the individual glycolipids were characterized by descending paper chromatography after release by mild acid hydrolysis. The GlcNAc/GalNAc lipids were dried under a stream of nitrogen in a conical screw-cap tube and heated to 100 °C, 15 min in 0.2 ml of 0.01 m HCl. After hydrolysis the samples were applied to a 0.8-ml mixed-bed ion-exchange column containing 0.4 ml of AG50WX8 (H+) and 0.4 ml AG1X8 (acetate form) and eluted with 1.5 ml water. The eluate was dried under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in a small volume of H2O (0.02 ml), spotted on a 30-cm strip of borate-impregnated Whatman No. 1 paper, and developed in descending mode with butanol/pyridine/water (6:4:3) for 40–50 h. After drying, the paper strips were cut into 1-cm zones and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation spectrometry. GlcNAc and GalNAc standards were detected using an aniline-diphenylamine dip reagent (26Schwimmer S. Bevenue A. Science. 1956; 123: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Glycan products were converted to their corresponding alditols by reduction with 0.1 m NaBH4 in 0.1 m NaOH (final volume 0.1 ml) after mild acid hydrolysis as described above. After incubation at room temperature overnight, the reactions were quenched with several drops of glacial acetic acid and dried under a stream of nitrogen out of methanol containing 1 drop of acetic acid, several times. The alditols were dissolved in water, desalted by passage over 0.5-ml columns of AG50WX8 (H+) and AG1X8 (acetate), dried under nitrogen, and spotted on 30-cm strips of Whatman No. 3MM paper. The Whatman No. 3MM strips were developed overnight in descending mode with ethyl acetate, pyridine, 0.1 m boric acid (65:25:20), dried, cut into 1-cm zones, and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation spectrometry. GlcNAcitol and GalNAcitol standards were visualized using a modification of the periodate-benzidine dip procedure (27Gordon H.T. Thornburg W. Werum L.N. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 849-855Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The paper strips were dipped in acetone, 0.1 m NaIO4 (95:5), allowed to air dry for 3 min, and then dipped in acetone/acetic acid/H2O/o-tolidine (96:0.6:4.4:0.2 gm). Alditols containing cis-diols stained as yellow spots on a blue background. Purified glycolipids were analyzed using an ABI/MDS Sciex 4000 Q-Trap hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer with an ABI Turbo V electrospray ion source (ABI/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada). In brief, samples were infused at 10 μl/min with ion source settings determined empirically, and MS/MS information was obtained by fragmentation of the molecular ion in linear ion trap mode. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) after precipitation of membrane proteins with deoxycholate and trichloroacetic acid according to the Pierce Biotechnology bulletin “Eliminate Interfering Substances from Samples for BCA Protein Assay.” Samples were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation spectrometry in a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation spectrometer after the addition of 0.5 ml of 1% SDS and 4 ml of Econosafe Economical Biodegradable Counting Mixture (Research Products International, Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). To determine whether E. coli WecA will utilize UDP-GalNAc as a GalNAc-P donor to form GalNAc-P-P-Und, membrane fractions from E. coli strains K12, PR4019, a WecA-overexpressing strain, and O157, which synthesize a tetrasaccharide O-antigen repeat unit with GalNAc at the reducing terminus presumably initiated by the synthesis of GalNAc-P-P-Und, were incubated with UDP-[3H]GalNAc. As seen in Table 2, no labeled glycolipids were detected after the incubation with UDP-[3H]GalNAc.TABLE 2Synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc/GalNAc-P-P-undecaprenol in E. coli membrane fractions using either UDP-[3H]GlcNAc or UDP-[3H]GalNAc as substrateSource of membranesSugar nucleotide added[3H]Glycolipid formedGlcNAc-P-P-UndGalNAc-P-P-Undpmol/mgK12UDP-[3H]GlcNAc6.4<0.01K12UDP-[3H]GalNAc<0.01<0.01PR4019UDP-[3H]GlcNAc44<0.01PR4019UDP-[3H]GalNAc<0.01<0.01O157UDP-[3H]GlcNAc1.50.5O157UDP-[3H]GalNAc<0.01<0.01 Open table in a new tab Moreover, neither the addition of exogenous Und-P to incubations with membranes from PR4019, the WecA-overexpressing strain, or the addition of cytosolic fractions from O157 cells resulted in the formation of GalNAc-P-P-Und from UDP-GalNAc (data not shown). These results demonstrated that UDP-GalNAc is not a substrate for WecA and suggested that GalNAc-P-P-Und is formed by an alternative mechanism. When membranes from strain K12 were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und was synthesized as expected (13Rush J.S. Rick P.D. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, when membranes from strain O157 were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, in addition to [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und, a second labeled lipid shown to be [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und (see below) was observed. When the time course for the formation of the two glycolipids was examined, the incorporation of radioactivity into [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Und (Fig. 1, O) occurred more quickly and to a higher extent than into [3H]GalNAc-P-P-Und (Fig. 1, ●), compatible with a precursor-product relationship (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Proposed biosynthetic pathway for the formation of GalNAc-P-P-Und from GlcNAc-P-P-Und.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observation that E. coli O157 membranes do not utilize UDP-GalNAc as a GalNAc-P donor for the synthesis of GalNAc-P-P-Und prompted us to propose an alternative biosynthetic pathway for the formation of GalNAc-P-P-Und illustrated in Fig. 2. In this scheme GlcNAc-P-P-Und is formed by the transfer of GlcNAc-P from UDP-GlcNAc, catalyzed by WecA, and then GlcNAc-P-P-Und is epimerized by the action of a previously undescribed 4-epimerase to produce GalNAc-P-P-Und. The research described in this report was designed to test this hypothesis and to identify the novel GlcNAc 4-epimerase (E. coli O157 Z3206) catalyzing the formation of GalNAc-P-P-Und. Consistent with the additional O157-specific glycolipid product detected in Fig. 1, as GalNAc-P-P-Und, it was stable to mild alkaline methanolysis (toluene/methanol 1:3, containing 0.1 n KOH, 0 °C, 60 min), retained by DEAE-cellulose equilibrated in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), and eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) containing 20 mm ammonium acetate as reported previously for [3H]GlcNAc1–2-P-P-Dol (28Waechter C.J. Harford J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2109990111,"General opioid receptor antagonists reduce food intake and body weight in rodents, but the contributions of specific receptor subtypes are unknown. We examined whether genetic deletion of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) in mice alters metabolic physiology. KOR-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-energy diet (HED) for 16 wk. KO mice had 28% lower body weight and 45% lower fat mass when compared to WT mice fed an HED. No differences in caloric intake were found. An HED reduced energy expenditure in WT mice, but not in KO mice. KOR deficiency led to an attenuation of triglyceride synthesis in the liver. Malonyl CoA levels were also reduced in response to an HED, thereby promoting hepatic beta-oxidation. Glycemic control was also found to be improved in KO mice. These data suggest a key role for KORs in the central nervous system regulation of the metabolic adaptation to an HED, as we were unable to detect expression of KOR in liver, white adipose tissue, or skeletal muscle in WT mice. This study provides the first evidence that KORs play an essential physiological role in the control of hepatic lipid metabolism, and KOR activation is a permissive signal toward fat storage.-Czyzyk, T.

https://openalex.org/W2085725940,"The ubiquitously expressed family of alpha-actinins bridges actin filaments to stabilize adhesions, a process disrupted during growth factor-induced migration of cells. During the dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, actinins are phosphorylated on tyrosines, although the consequences of this are unknown. We expressed the two isoforms of human alpha-actinin in murine fibroblasts that express human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and found that both alpha-actinin 1 (ACTN1) and alpha-actinin 4 (ACTN4) were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after stimulation with EGF, although ACTN4 was phosphorylated to the greater extent. This required the activation of Src protein-tyrosine kinase and p38-MAPK (and phosphoinositide trisphosphate kinase in part) but not MEK/ERK or Rac1, as determined by inhibitors. The EGF-induced phosphorylation sites of ACTN4 were mapped to tyrosine 4, the major site, and tyrosine 31, the minor one. Truncation mutagenesis showed that the C-terminal domains of ACTN4 (amino acids 300-911), which cross-link the actin binding head domains, act as an inhibitory domain for both actin binding and EGF-mediated phosphorylation. These two properties were mutually exclusive; removal of the C terminus enhanced actin binding of ACTN4 mutants while limiting EGF-induced phosphorylation, and conversely EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ACTN4 decreased its affinity to actin. Interestingly, a phosphomimetic of tyrosine 265 (which can be found in carcinoma cells and lies near the K255E mutation that causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) demonstrated increased actin binding activity and susceptibility of ACTN4 to calpain-mediated cleavage; this variant also retarded cell spreading. Remarkably, either treatment of cells with low concentrations of latrunculin A, which has been shown to depolymerize F-actin, or the deletion of the actin binding domain (100-252 amino acids) of ACTN4Y265E restored EGF-induced phosphorylation. An F-actin binding assay in vitro showed that Y4E/Y31E, a mimetic of diphosphorylated ACTN4, bound F-actin slightly compared with wild type (WT). Importantly, the EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ACTN4 at tyrosine 4 and 31 significantly inhibited multinucleation of proliferating NR6WT fibroblasts that overexpress ACTN4. These results suggest that EGF regulates the actin binding activity of ACTN4 by inducing tyrosyl-directed phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1987584447,"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains are zoonotic pathogens responsible for a range of severe human disease. The repertoire of virulence determinants promoting EHEC disease is encoded on both the main chromosome and virulence plasmid. We examined a multiply antibiotic-resistant O26 EHEC strain for carriage of resistance genes on the virulence plasmid. The EHEC virulence plasmid containing a complex antibiotic-resistance gene locus, designated as pO26-CRL, was purified from EHEC O26:H(-) (patient with hemorrhagic colitis) and subjected to shotgun-sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Determination of the 111,481-bp sequence of pO26-CRL revealed genes encoding a functional enterohemolysin operon (ehxCABD), STEC-specific extracellular serine protease (espP), putative EHEC adhesin (toxB), catalase/peroxidase (katP), and myristoyl transferase (msbB) involved in lipid A synthesis. A 22,609-bp Tn21 derivative is inserted within the conjugal transfer gene traC and encodes resistance to trimethoprim, streptomycin, sulfathiozole, kanamycin, neomycin, beta-lactams, and mercuric chloride. Plasmid pO26-CRL is nonconjugative but is mobilizable. This is the first report of an EHEC virulence plasmid containing a complex antibiotic resistance locus, and raises the concern that antibiotic use will coselect for virulence determinants, leading to increased disease potential in both commensal and pathogenic E. coli populations.-Venturini, C., Beatson, S.

Cosmc represents the first ER chaperone identified to be required for folding of a glycosyltransferase. Proteins correctly fold into unique functional three-dimensional structures within very crowded intracellular environments, including the cytoplasm and the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumBSAbovine serum albuminβ4-GalTβ1–4-galactosyltransferaseCosmccore 1 β3-GalT-specific molecular chaperoneGal-3galectin-3GalNAcN-acetylgalactosamineGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineGnHClguanidinium hydrochlorideHPChuman protein CATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

In cultured cells lacking Cosmc, inactive T-synthase forms oligomeric aggregates in the ER and is eventually degraded by ubiquitin-dependent pathways in the cytosolic proteasome (16Ju T. Aryal R.P.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16613-16618Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cosmc appears to bind directly to T-synthase and to ATP (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which Cosmc participates in correct folding of the T-synthase, and the possibility that Cosmc is specific for folding of the T-synthase, have not been explored. To aid in understanding this interesting chaperone system, here we describe an in vitro reconstitution approach to explore Cosmc interactions with the unfolded T-synthase. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of T-synthase should lead to a greater appreciation of human diseases and disorders involving altered expression and activity of the T-synthase and potential new therapeutic strategies for Tn antigen-related diseases. GalNAc-α-phenyl, UDP-Gal, GlcNAc-β-S-pNp, β4-GalT from bovine milk, and firefly luciferase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. GRP78 (BiP) protein (active) was purchased from Abcam.

For constructing plasmids for encoding E152K mutated form of Cosmc, a fragment from the digestion of the plasmid encoding the soluble form of the 6×His-tagged Cosmc, as described (16Ju T. Aryal R.P.

Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The construct was confirmed by sequencing and termed 6×His-msCosmc. Soluble T-synthase was made by co-expressing N-terminal HPC4 epitope-tagged soluble T-synthase (HPC4-sT-syn) as described (26Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) with wild-type full-length Cosmc as described (25Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) in Hi-5 cells using the Baculovirus system. After 96 h of post-infection in Hi-5 cells, the medium was collected, and the epitope-tagged protein was absorbed on HPC4 antibody-conjugated Ultralink resin, washed, and eluted with elution buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Using Centricon 10-kDa cut-off membranes, protein was concentrated in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 30 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. Both 6×His-sCosmc and 6×His-msCosmc were made as described (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reducing SDS-PAGE was carried out followed by Coomassie Blue staining to determine purity (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were imaged on FluorChem Camera (Alpha Innotech), and the density of the bands was quantified using software FluorChemTM V.5.0.2.4 (Alpha Innotech). Recombinant HPC4-sT-syn and β4-GalT (∼0.25 μg in 32 μl) were denatured by heating over time at ∼54 °C or 62 °C, respectively in 10 mm HEPES buffer pH 7.8 containing 12 mm MgCl2 then cooled to room temperature. Renaturation was initiated by the addition of 6×His-sCosmc and ATP to a final concentration of ∼2.27 μm and 5 mm, respectively, in the reconstitution buffer except in Fig. 1, E and F, where the amount of 6×His-sCosmc and BiP were both at a final concentration of 1.8 μm. After preincubation at room temperature for 45 min, T-synthase activity was measured using the methods used previously except varying the concentration of UDP-Gal to 0.2 mm final concentration and without Triton-X100 (26Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, E and F preincubation was carried out at room temperature for 75 min, and T-synthase activity was measured. β4-GalT activity was determined using pNP-β-S-GlcNAc as the acceptor as described (28van Die I. van Tetering A. Schiphorst W.E. Sato T. Furukawa K. van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Relative T-synthase or β4-GalT activities were calculated using 100% as the activity of the untreated enzymes. HPC4-sT-syn (35 μg) was denatured in 1 ml of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GnHCl), pH 7.2 for 90 min at room temperature. The sample was concentrated to ∼70 μl using Centricon 10,000 cutoff membranes. The sample was diluted 100 times in reconstitution buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8) then 34-μl aliquots of the diluted sample were used for reconstitution reactions. Reconstitution was initiated by the addition of 6×His-sCosmc and ATP where the final concentration was 2.27 μm and 5 mm, respectively. Parallel control reconstitution experiments were initiated either by the addition of BSA or galectin-3 where the final concentration was 2.27 μm and 5 mm ATP, respectively. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at room temperature followed by assay for T-synthase activity. Approximately 10 nm commercial luciferase (firefly) in the reconstitution buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer containing 12 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.8) was denatured at 43 °C for 7 min and cooled to room temperature. Both ATP and BiP were added to a final concentration of 5 mm and 1.8 μm, respectively. Renaturation was carried out for ∼75 min, and the luciferase activity was immediately measured by the addition of 100 μl of assay reagents. The light produced was measured by a Top Count NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter. Luciferase activities were calculated using 100% as the activity of the untreated enzymes. Reconstitution of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn was carried out at 37 °C. For each reaction, 0.25 μg in 32 μl of recombinant HPC4-sT-syn was denatured by heat at ∼54 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 12 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.8 for 2 min and cooled to 37 °C. For reconstitution at 37 °C, 6×His-sCosmc, ATP, and other T-synthase reagents preincubated at 37 °C were added. Reconstitution of HPC4-sT-syn was carried out simultaneously for different time points, and the renaturation stopped at different times by diluting the reaction ∼15 times with cold water, following by assays for T-synthase activity. To investigate whether the chaperone function of Cosmc can be measured in vitro, we expressed recombinant soluble 6×His-tagged Cosmc (6×His-sCosmc) and HPC4-tagged soluble T-synthase (HPC4-sT-syn), and purified each to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1A), of apparent molecular mass of 35 and 39 kDa, respectively. Note that to generate the enzymatically active HPC4-sT-syn in Hi-5 insect cells, we co-expressed the HPC4-sT-syn with a construct encoding full-length, membrane-bound Cosmc, which insects lack. Because the full-length Cosmc is not secreted it does not contaminate preparations of the co-expressed HPC4-sT-syn. To generate the 6×His-sCosmc, we expressed a construct encoding that protein alone in Hi-5 cells. For these in vitro renaturation studies, we denatured HPC4-sT-syn either thermally or chemically. The denaturation status of HPC4-sT-syn was monitored by assaying T-synthase activity after being heated over time or being treated with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GnHCl) for 90 min, as shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. Treatments with either heat or GnHCl caused significant loss of enzyme activity. In exploring the ability of Cosmc to restore activity to denatured HPC4-sT-syn, the renaturation assay was initiated by the addition of purified 6×His-sCosmc into the denatured enzyme, which was followed by assaying enzyme activity. This involved measuring product formation with the donor UDP-[3H]Gal toward the acceptor GalNAcα1-O-phenyl (29Ju T. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Incubation with 6×His-sCosmc caused significant restoration of activity of denatured HPC4-sT-syn either by heat treatment or GnHCl (Fig. 1, D and G, respectively). Whereas addition of 6×His-sCosmc induced significant restoration of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn, addition of a control protein, recombinant galectin-3, at equal amounts to 6×His-sCosmc had no effect on restoring the activity (Fig. 1D). Human galectin-3 was chosen as one of the controls, because like Cosmc it is also a non-glycosylated recombinant protein, and has a similar size (∼30 kDa) to Cosmc (30Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T. Gitt M.A. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K. Leffler H. Liu F.T. Lotan R. Mercurio A.M. Monsigny M. Pillai S. Poirer F. Raz A. Rigby P.I. Rini J.M.

Immunol. 2008; 180: 3091-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Importantly, addition of recombinant human BiP, a general ER chaperone, did not promote the renaturation of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn (Fig. 1E). Addition of BiP did not inhibit the reconstitution of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn by 6×His-sCosmc (Fig. 1E), indicating that BiP-containing buffer lacks inhibitory activity in the renaturation process. By contrast, addition of BiP to heat-denatured luciferase (Fig. 1F) caused partial restoration of luciferase activity, and BiP alone lacks contaminating luciferase activity (Fig. 1F). For HPC4-sT-syn denatured by GnHCl treatment, incubation with 6×His-sCosmc also caused restoration of activity, whereas addition of control proteins, BSA, or galectin-3, had little effect (Fig. 1G). We examined Cosmc-dependent renaturation of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn over the time of heating. The results showed that the longer HPC4-sT-syn was heated, there was a reduction of the amount of restoration of enzyme activity by the same amount of 6×His-sCosmc (Fig. 1H). This reduction is likely caused by precipitation of denatured T-synthase with prolonged heating. 6×His-sCosmc alone had no contaminating T-synthase enzyme activity (Fig. 1, D, E, and G), but we observed that at time 0 before heating, the addition of 6×His-sCosmc to the recombinant HPC4-sT-syn led to elevated enzyme activity. This is likely to be due to the presence of some partly denatured HPC4-sT-syn in the starting preparation purified from insect cells. These results strongly support the conclusion that Cosmc functions as a chaperone for the denatured T-synthase, and it can act independently of other co-chaperones in this in vitro assay. To further characterize the role of 6×His-sCosmc in the reconstitution of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn, we performed in vitro reconstitution experiments of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn (0.18 μm) with varying concentrations of 6×His-sCosmc. The ability of 6×His-sCosmc to aid in reconstitution of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn was concentration dependent (Fig. 2A). In this in vitro assay, significant restoration of HPC4-sT-syn activity occurred when the molar ratio of 6×His-sCosmc and HPC4-sT-syn was ∼1:1 (∼0.14 μm 6×His-sCosmc), as shown in Fig. 2A. We also measured the time dependence of restoration of activity of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn by 6×His-sCosmc. In this experiment, HPC4-sT-syn was denatured by treatment at ∼54 °C for 2 min, and then incubated at 37 °C with 6×His-sCosmc in the presence of all components of the HPC4-sT-syn activity assay for the indicated times. Therefore, the renaturation and measurement of HPC4-sT-syn activity was carried out simultaneously. Within the first 5 min, which was the minimal feasible time for conducting this type of experiment, we observed that maximum HPC4-sT-syn activity was regained (Fig. 2B). The results show that inactive HPC4-sT-syn regained activity within 5 min after the addition of 6×His-sCosmc. Cosmc with Glu (E) to Lys (K) mutation at position 152 (E152K) was originally identified in a patient with Tn syndrome (25Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of this mutated Cosmc with human HPC4-sT-syn in insect cells indicated that 6×His-msCosmc (E152K) has little ability to function as a chaperone in a cell expression system for forming active T-synthase (25Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To investigate the characteristics of mutated Cosmc in vitro, we expressed and purified the tagged, soluble form of mutated Cosmc (6×His-msCosmc) in Hi-5 cells (Fig. 3B). 6×His-msCosmc (∼35kDa) is not as stable as wild-type 6×His-sCosmc and appears to be partly degraded (∼50%) to a smaller form (∼27 kDa). Therefore, the SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue-stained gel shown in Fig. 3B utilized twice as much 6×His-msCosmc (8 μg) compared with 6×His-sCosmc (4 μg). A scan of the gel shows that the amount of material at ∼35 kDa in size for both 6×His-msCosmc (lane 2) and 6×His-sCosmc (lane 3) are similar. Using this preparation of 6×His-msCosmc, we compared its ability to 6×His-sCosmc to assist renaturation of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn, and tested the effect over time. To compensate for the partial degradation observed for 6×His-msCosmc, we used twice the concentration of 6×His-msCosmc as compared with 6×His-sCosmc. Whereas 6×His-sCosmc was effective in assisting renaturation of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn, 6×His-msCosmc was weakly active and had no significant activity in restoring HPC4-sT-syn activity heated for 3 min or more (Fig. 3C). These results show that mutated Cosmc is not as effective as soluble wild-type Cosmc in this in vitro assay in assisting refolding activity of T-synthase. Our previous study showed that Cosmc, but not the T-synthase, has ATP binding activity (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a possible ATP-dependent chaperone function for the human Cosmc. It is interesting that in prior studies, the mouse homolog of Cosmc (NP_067525), which was studied before the function of Cosmc was identified, was also reported to have ATP binding activity (32Inoue S. Sano H. Ohta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To explore whether ATP has any effect in the renaturation of heat-denatured T-synthase by Cosmc, we studied the effects of 6×His-sCosmc in vitro in the presence of ATP, the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, and buffer without nucleotide. The 5 mm final concentration of nucleotide were chosen in this in vitro experiment because that amount was used in reconstitution of denatured luciferase by Hsp70 chaperone system (33Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We first investigated the role of ATP where the 6×His-sCosmc concentration was ∼12-times higher than the concentration of HPC4-sT-syn. There was not a significant difference between the reconstitution of HPC4-sT-syn in the three different conditions (Fig. 4A). To further explore the potential effect of ATP, we varied the concentrations of 6×His-sCosmc in the presence of ATP and ATPγS as indicated. The data showed that neither ATP nor ATPγS had a significant difference in the restoration of activity of denatured HPC4-sT-syn (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that Cosmc does not require ATP for the folding of T-synthase in this in vitro assay. To further examine whether Cosmc is specific to the T-synthase, we investigated the nature of its specificity in vitro by conducting reconstitution experiments for another partially denatured enzyme in parallel to the experiments conducted with denatured HPC4-sT-syn. To this end, we selected the well-studied enzyme UDPGal:GlcNAc β1–4-galactosyltransferase (β4-GalT) (34Narimatsu H. Sinha S. Brew K. Okayama H. Qasba P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 4720-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Curr.

Like T-synthase, β4-GalT is also a Golgi-localized β-glycosyltransferase, uses the same donor substrate UDP-Gal, and is also an inverting β-galactosyltransferase. The in vitro reconstitution reaction was initiated by addition of either 6×His-sCosmc or galectin-3 to heat-denatured β4-GalT, and the activity of this enzyme was assayed. No reconstitution of denatured β4-GalT by either 6×His-sCosmc or galectin-3 was observed, whereas in parallel control experiments, 6×His-sCosmc was effective in restoring partial activity of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn (Fig. 5A). We further investigated the ability of Cosmc to function as a potential chaperone for β4-GalT, which was heated over time in the expectation that a diversity of intermediate folded forms might be present ranging from slightly unfolded to fully unfolded forms. The β4-GalT was heated over time at 62 °C, which resulted in time-dependent loss of its activity (Fig. 5B). However, addition of 6×His-sCosmc or galectin-3 had no significant effect on restoring activity of the β4-GalT. Taken together, these results show that Cosmc is specific for the T-synthase and is not able to restore activity of a related Golgi β-galactosyltransferase. Cosmc is the first known ER molecular chaperone required for expression of a glycosyltransferase that functions in the Golgi apparatus, but the mechanism of its action has not been clear. Recently, we reported that ER-localized Cosmc can be co-immunoprecipitated with T-synthase (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that Cosmc might play a direct role in the biosynthesis of the active form of T-synthase by interacting with newly synthesized nonnative T-synthase. The studies described here provide novel information as to how this ER chaperone functions and show that Cosmc directly interacts with partly unfolded and inactive T-synthase to partially restore enzyme activity. We showed previously that expression of active T-synthase in cells requires ER-localized Cosmc (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Ju T. Cummings R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16613-16618Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and the lack of Cosmc function results in inactive T-synthase aggregates (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The biochemical studies and the in vitro functional assays using purified 6×His-sCosmc show that Cosmc can restore activity from inactive forms of T-synthase following a brief period (<5 min) of incubation, that the addition of ATP had no effect in this assay format, and that restoration in vitro occurs independently of other chaperones/co-chaperones. Importantly, addition of the general ER chaperone BiP did not restore the activity of heat-denatured T-synthase, whereas BiP does support renaturation of luciferase. It has been shown previously that recombinant Hsc70 can support in vitro refolding of heat-denatured luciferase (38Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 6×His-msCosmc E152K cannot restore the denatured HPC4-sT-syn in vitro as efficiently as 6×His-sCosmc and 6×His-sCosmc does not effect restoration of activity for another well-characterized β-galactosyltransferase (β4-GalT). Overall, our results provide experimental evidence in vitro that Cosmc is a specific chaperone for folding and maturation of the T-synthase. Moreover, these studies have a broad impact in understanding the expression of Tn and sialyl-Tn (22Brockhausen I. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 23Itzkowitz S.H. Bloom E.J. Kokal W.A. Modin G. Hakomori S. Kim Y.S.

Med. 1997; 75: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) which is associated with mutations in Cosmc and consequent deficiency of active T-synthase in human diseases, such as Tn syndrome (25Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and human tumors (20Ju T. Lanneau G.S. Gautam T. Wang Y. Xia B. Stowell S.R. Willard M.T. Wang W. Xia J.Y. Zuna R.E.

Schreiber H. Science. 2006; 314: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The approach taken here is modeled after studies on other chaperones showing their ability to restore the activity of thermally or chemically denatured substrate. Typically, the ability of a chaperone to restore activity to denatured substrates can result in restoration of from 1–2% to nearly 80% of initial activity. For example, the small heat shock protein α/β crystallin causes ∼14% restoration of a client protein citrate synthase and addition of ATP enhances that to 25% (39Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Treatment of the Rubisco enzyme with 6 m GnHCl results in considerable loss of secondary structure, and addition of chaperone Cpn60 (GroEL) with its co-chaperone Cpn10 (GroES) can rescue its enzymatic activity up to ∼80% of initial (40Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Additionally, chaperones such as Hsp70 or its prokaryotic homolog DnaK/DnaJ and GroEL-GroES, can reactivate both thermally and chemically denatured substrates (40Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 41Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

We observed that 6×His-sCosmc can cause up to ∼75% restoration of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn activity depending on how long the protein has been heat-treated (Fig. 1, D and H), and that it could restore ∼30% of activity to HPC4-sT-syn denatured by GnHCl treatment (Fig. 1G). Thus, Cosmc restoration of activity to denatured T-synthase is relatively similar to that seen for other chaperones with other clients in vitro, and probably reflects the heterogeneity of misfolded forms of the enzyme generated by these denaturing conditions. Whereas Cosmc can restore the activity of denatured T-synthase activity independently of other co-chaperones in vitro, it is possible that co-chaperones play an important role in vivo within the crowded environment of the ER regulating the kinetics of T-synthase refolding in vivo. We previously reported that inactive oligomeric T-synthase accumulating in cells in the absence of Cosmc is associated with GRP78 (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas other chaperones may associate with T-synthase, their interactions appear to be non-productive in helping to form active enzyme, but may be important in ER stress responses or eliminating/removing the inactive and oligomeric T-synthase from the ER lumen. Future studies are required to examine the chaperone folding complex and assess whether co-chaperones may function with Cosmc. Some known chaperones require co-chaperones and others do not. For example, chaperones like Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 require co-chaperones for their functional cycle (5Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), whereas small heat shock proteins Hsp18.1, Hsp17.7, Hsp27, and Hsp25 do not require co-chaperones and can function independently as molecular chaperones (43Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The E152K mutated form of Cosmc found in Tn syndrome patients appears to lack any significant activity in vivo, because there is no detectable activity of T-synthase in the patient (25Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 45Crew V.K. Singleton B.K. Green C. Parsons S.F. Daniels G. Anstee D.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2008; 142: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mutated Cosmc is expressed. Therefore, we tested whether this mutated Cosmc can restore the activity of denatured T-synthase using our in vitro reconstitution experiment. Clearly, whereas the 6×His-msCosmc could not restore the activity of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn as efficiently as 6×His-msCosmc (Fig. 3C), there was a small but detectable level of restored activity. It is possible, but unlikely, that 6×His-msCosmc (E152K) generated recombinantly in insect cells might differ structurally or in other respects from the protein expressed in vivo, or that the 6×His tag might contribute in some indirect way to this partial functionality of the mutated Cosmc. The mutated protein expressed in vivo might not be folded correctly, localize differently, interact with different interacting partner/s, or the steady state level of the protein could be lower, resulting in its no detectable function in vivo. We previously reported that Cosmc binds to ATP-Sepharose, and can be cross-linked to [α-32P]azido-ATP (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ability of Cosmc to bind ATP is consistent with prior reports showing that the mouse homolog of Cosmc also appears to have ATP binding activity (32Inoue S. Sano H. Ohta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The functional cycles of many chaperones for assisting protein folding are enhanced by their interaction with nucleotides such as ATP/ADP (5Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 46Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ATP is not required in vitro for the renaturation of heat-denatured HPC4-sT-syn (Fig. 5A). Consistent with our data, several other ATP-independent chaperones have been identified, including Hsp47 (47Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), small Hsp (48Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calnexin (49Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), SecB (50Randall L.L. Hardy S.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and α-crystallin (51Marini I. Moschini R. Del Corso A. Mura U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the role, if any, of ATP in Cosmc function remains to be determined. It is possible that ATP binding by Cosmc may be important in a cycle of binding and release of T-synthase in vivo, through interactions with other proteins or perhaps co-chaperones. The studies described here show that inactive and partly misfolded T-synthase can be partly restored to active form by incubation with 6×His-sCosmc and suggest that Cosmc activity is specific for T-synthase and not active toward another inverting β-galactosyltransferase. In other studies, we have generated mice deficient for Cosmc and found that embryonic cells from such null animals completely lack T-synthase activity but have apparently other normal protein glycosylation except for loss of core 1 O-glycans. 3Y. Wang, T. Ju, and R. D. Cummings, unpublished observations. The experimental results here are consistent with such observations and imply the apparently specific requirement of Cosmc for forming active T-synthase. Experiments are underway using mutants of Cosmc and T-synthase to define the molecular sites responsible for Cosmc/T-synthase intermolecular interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1973928364,"The relationship between the mechanisms that control an organism's lifespan and its ability to respond to environmental challenges are poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, an insulin-like signaling pathway modulates lifespan and the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens via a common mechanism involving transcriptional regulation by the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. The C. elegans germ line also modulates lifespan in a daf-16-dependent manner. Here, we show that the germ line controls the innate immune response of C. elegans somatic cells to two different Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to the insulin-like signaling pathway, the germ line acts via distinct signaling pathways to control lifespan and innate immunity. Under standard nematode culture conditions, the germ line regulates innate immunity in parallel to a known p38 MAPK signaling pathway, via a daf-16-independent pathway. Our findings indicate that a complex regulatory network integrates inputs from insulin-like signaling, p38 MAPK signaling, and germ line stem cells to control innate immunity in C. elegans. We also confirm that innate immunity and lifespan in C. elegans are distinct processes, as nonoverlapping regulatory networks control survival in the presence of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria. Finally, we demonstrate that the p38 MAPK pathway in C. elegans is activated to a similar extent by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, suggesting that both can induce the nematode innate immune response."

HPLC and mass spectrometry demonstrated its stability in serum beyond 24 h. M33 was found to be very selective for gram-negative bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 0.3 to 3 µΜ for multidrug resistant clinical isolates of several pathogenic species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. M33 neutralized LPS derived from P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, and prevented TNF-α release from LPS-activated macrophages, with an EC50 of 3.8e-8 M and 2.8e-7 M, respectively, as detected by sandwich ELISA. M33 activity was also tested in sepsis animal models. It averted septic shock symptoms due to Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa in doses compatible with clinical use (5–25 mg/kg).

https://openalex.org/W1989362657,"Thiazole synthase in Escherichia coli is an alphabeta heterodimer of ThiG and ThiH. ThiH is a tyrosine lyase that cleaves the C alpha-C beta bond of tyrosine, generating p-cresol as a by-product, to form dehydroglycine. This reactive intermediate acts as one of three substrates for the thiazole cyclization reaction catalyzed by ThiG. ThiH is a radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) enzyme that utilizes a [4Fe-4S](+) cluster to reductively cleave AdoMet, forming methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. Analysis of the time-dependent formation of the reaction products 5'-deoxyadenosine (DOA) and p-cresol has demonstrated catalytic behavior of the tyrosine lyase. The kinetics of product formation showed a pre-steady state burst phase, and the involvement of DOA in product inhibition was identified by the addition of 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase to activity assays. This hydrolyzed the DOA and changed the rate-determining step but, in addition, substantially increased the uncoupled turnover of AdoMet. Addition of glyoxylate and ammonium inhibited the tyrosine cleavage reaction, but the reductive cleavage of AdoMet continued in an uncoupled manner. Tyrosine analogues were incubated with ThiGH, which showed a strong preference for phenolic substrates. 4-Hydroxyphenylpropionic acid analogues allowed uncoupled AdoMet cleavage but did not result in further reaction (C alpha-C beta bond cleavage). The results of the substrate analogue studies and the product inhibition can be explained by a mechanistic hypothesis involving two reaction pathways, a product-forming pathway and a futile cycle."

These enzymes are involved in the synthesis of a wide array of secondary metabolites that have diverse biological roles, including iron sequestration and antimicrobial, insecticidal, and antiviral activity (1Finking R.

In general, NRPSs are modular, with each module catalyzing the incorporation of one amino acid substrate into the growing peptide. NRPS modules are, in turn, made up of independently folding functional domains that catalyze the individual reactions of peptide synthesis.

Despite low sequence similarity, this superfamily shows a high degree of structural and functional conservation (6Yonus H. Neumann P. Zimmermann S. May J.J. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32484-32491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Members of the superfamily activate carboxylic acids by an adenylation reaction, utilizing ATP and forming an enzyme-bound adenylate intermediate. In most cases, these enzymes subsequently catalyze the formation of a thioester bond to either a CoA molecule or a 4′ppant prosthetic group. Members of the superfamily play roles in the biosynthesis and degradation of an array of important primary and secondary metabolites. Different members of the superfamily activate diverse substrates ranging from very small carboxylic acids such as acetate (7Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to very large substrates such as 2-amino-9,10-epoxy-8-oxodecanoic acid (8Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.A.

Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P.

Furthermore, the previously determined structures of members of the acetyl-CoA synthetase-like superfamily bind and activate small and medium sized substrates, and it is expected that the binding pockets for larger substrates are substantially different (13Schwecke T.

The mutualistic relationship between the fungal endophytes of the Epichloë-Neotyphodium complex and the agronomic grasses that they colonize plays a vital role in the pastoral agriculture of many parts of the world by improving the tolerance of grass plants to abiotic and biotic stresses (21Gimenez C.

SidN is essential for the maintenance of the mutualistic character of this relationship, and the details of the cloning and characterization of sidN will be reported elsewhere. 6L. J. Johnson, M. Christensen, A. Koulman, G. A. Lane, K. Fraser, R. D. Johnson, G. T. Bryan, and S. Rasmussen, manuscript in preparation. Recently, attempts have been made to predict the specificities of the adenylation domains of siderophore synthetases using methods such as homology modeling and inspection of the predicted substrate binding pocket residues (13Schwecke T. Göttling K. Durek P. Dueñas I. Käufer N.F. Zock-Emmenthal S. Staub E. Neuhof T. Dieckmann R. von Döhren H. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Bushley K.E. Ripoll D.R. Turgeon B.G. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 328Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These studies have predicted that the third adenylation domain of the three-module siderophore synthetases bind and activate the AHO residues and that these domains have a larger binding pocket than has previously been characterized (13Schwecke T. Göttling K. Durek P. Dueñas I. Käufer N.F. Zock-Emmenthal S. Staub E. Neuhof T. Dieckmann R. von Döhren H. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Bushley K.E. Ripoll D.R. Turgeon B.G. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 328Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, experimental confirmation of these predictions has been hampered by technical difficulties in producing soluble protein of eukaryotic adenylation domains in heterologous expression systems (13Schwecke T. Göttling K. Durek P. Dueñas I. Käufer N.F. Zock-Emmenthal S. Staub E. Neuhof T. Dieckmann R. von Döhren H. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have expressed, purified, and determined the three-dimensional structure of the third adenylation domain of SidN (SidNA3) from Neotyphodium lolii Lp19 at 2.0 Å resolution. We have also biochemically characterized this domain, confirming that SidNA3 adenylates the large nonproteogenic amino acid, Nδ-cis-anhydromevalonyl-Nδ-hydroxy-l-ornithine (cis-AMHO). In addition, this amino acid has been confirmed as a component of the fungal siderophore using mass spectroscopy. This is the first reported structure of a eukaryotic NRPS domain and thus provides details of the architecture of the specificity-determining pocket for eukaryotic adenylation domains. The structure and biochemistry of SidNA3 also extend our knowledge of the large acetyl-CoA synthetase-like superfamily for which there are only a handful of structures despite their diversity and ubiquity in nature. The SidNA3 domain was amplified from N. lolii Lp19 genomic DNA and cloned using the Gateway® system (Invitrogen) into the pDest17 expression vector (Invitrogen). A two-step nested PCR protocol was used to introduce the sequence for a recombinant tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site into the PCR product to enable removal of the polyhistidine fusion tag (23Moreland N. Ashton R. Baker H.M. Ivanovic I. Patterson S. Arcus V.L. Baker E.N. Lott J.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli RosettaTM (DE3) cells by electroporation. Expression was performed at 18 °C in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium (24Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar). The expressed protein (in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The polyhistidine fusion tag was removed by digestion with recombinant tobacco etch virus protease. The cleaved SidNA3 protein was purified by subtraction immobilized metal affinity chromatography and then further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoadTM 16/60 SuperdexTM 75 pg column (GE Healthcare) with 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol as the running buffer. Seleno-methionine-substituted protein was prepared by the same protocol except that PASM-5052 medium (24Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar) was used as the expression medium. A liquid culture of Epichloë festucae strain Fl1 was grown for ∼2 weeks at 22 °C in modified Mantle media (25Mantle P.G. Nisbet L.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 93: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with yeast extract replaced with 0.6 μm thymine. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation and freeze-dried, and 50 g of the dried material was extracted with methanol (500 ml). The extract was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, reconstituted in MilliQ water (200 ml), and eluted through a solid phase extraction cartridge (1 g, Isolute ENV+, International Sorbent Technology). The cartridge was washed with water (10 ml), and a siderophore fraction was eluted with methanol (10 ml). The fraction was evaporated to dryness and stored at 0 °C and reconstituted in 1:1 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid for infusion into a hybrid ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using static nanospray electrospray ionization in +ve mode. The spray voltage was 5.0 kV, and the capillary temperature was 225 °C. Collision-induced dissociation of isolated parent ions was carried out with a collision energy of 60 units. cis-AMHO was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of fusigen (EMC Microcollections) (26Diekmann H. Zähner H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 3: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A solution of fusigen was adjusted to pH 12.0 using 1 n NaOH and incubated at room temperature for 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The solution was neutralized with 1 n HCl. The resulting cis-AMHO was purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a Luna 3-μm C18(2) 100-Å 150 × 3-mm column (Phenomenex) and a water/acetonitrile gradient (no ion-pairing agent) of 0–22% over 20 min using a 0.3 ml min−1 flow rate. Separation was performed on a System Gold instrument (Beckman Coulter), and detection was via absorbance at 220 nm. The cis-AMHO had a retention time of ∼13 min. The cis-AMHO was dried using a Vacufuge Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf) to remove the acetonitrile and redissolved to the required concentration in water prior to use. The release of inorganic pyrophosphate was assayed using an EnzChek® pyrophosphate assay kit (Invitrogen) (27Upson R.H. Haugland R.P. Malekzadeh M.N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out at 30 °C in 100-μl volumes in a 96-well microtiter plate. Each reaction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.25 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 0.03 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1 μm SidNA3, 0.2 mm amino acid substrate. Following a 20-min incubation to remove contaminating pyrophosphate and phosphate, the reaction was initiated by addition of the amino acid substrate. The 360 nm absorbance was monitored using an EnVision® 2104 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), reading every 2½ min. The initial rates for steady-state kinetics were measured using the same method except that 0.4 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside and 2 mm ATP were used together with varying amounts of the amino acid substrate, cis-AMHO. For the steady-state kinetics measurements, two replicates were performed for each concentration, and absorbance readings were made every 10 s. Crystallization was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Initial crystallization trials were conducted with drops consisting of 100 nl each of protein (8 mg ml−1 in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm CoA) and precipitant solutions. The initial crystals grew in 25.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.17 m ammonium sulfate, and 15% glycerol. Extensive optimization of the crystallization conditions and micro-seeding resulted in diffraction-quality crystals with the best crystals growing in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 13–14% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.01–0.02 m ammonium sulfate, and 15% glycerol using protein at 5 mg ml−1 in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2–5 mm CoA. The crystallization behavior of the seleno-methionine-substituted protein was identical to that of native protein. Data collection was performed on flash-cooled crystals at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA. One high resolution dataset and one multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset from seleno-methionine-substituted protein crystals were collected and used for structure determination. The data were processed with MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; (No. 26)Google Scholar) and SCALA (29Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3661) Google Scholar). AutoSharp (30Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Doublié S. Macromolecular Crystallography Protocols. Vol. 2.. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2007: 215-230Google Scholar) was used to determine phase information from multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion. Nineteen seleno-methionine sites were found with a figure of merit for phasing of 0.37. There were two molecules per asymmetric unit, but density was only present for one of the two C-terminal domains. Automatic model building was carried out using RESOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) through the PHENIX AutoBuild wizard (32Terwilliger T.C. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Afonine P.V.

Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) followed by manual building in Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and refinement using phenix.refine (34Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. CCP4 Newsletter. 2005; 42 (Contribution 8)Google Scholar). The high resolution dataset and experimental phases from the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset were used. Restrained individual coordinates, restrained isotropic B-factors, and TLS parameters were refined with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints applied to the N-terminal domains. For the TLS refinement, three TLS groups consisting of each of the two N-terminal domains and the ordered C-terminal domain were defined. The final model included a total of 903 residues out of the expected 1124 residues per asymmetric unit (of the missing 221 residues, 136 were from the missing C-terminal domain). Chain A (N-terminal domain only) consisted of residues 13–40, 46–179, and 183–421, and chain B (N- and C-terminal domains) consisted of residues 12–40, 46–180, 183–426, 430–456, 465–482, and 487–535. The single C-terminal domain that was modeled appears to be mobile with weak density and a high average B-factor of 77.9 Å2 compared with 30.9 Å2 for the N-terminal domain in the same molecule (chain B). In the final model, 96.2% of the residues lie in favored regions, and 3.6% of the residues lie within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. There is just one Ramachandran outlier in each chain, which is Gly-322. This residue lies at the entrance to the amino acid binding pocket.

Using GOLD (35Cole J.C. Nissink J.W. Taylor R. Alvarez J. Shoichet B. Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 379-415Google Scholar), the ligand was docked into an area of the SidNA3 structure with a radius of 7–8 Å centered on the binding pocket and using the “Detect Cavity” option. The “Standard default settings” genetic algorithm parameters and the default parameters of the ChemScore (36Eldridge M.D. Murray C.W. Auton T.R. Paolini G.V. Mee R.P. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar) scoring function were used. Ten docking runs were performed for each ligand model, and the top three solutions were kept. Successful expression and purification of the third adenylation domain of SidN (SidNA3) were achieved by making a range of constructs that were tested for soluble protein expression. Optimization of the N- and C-terminal borders of the domain was of particular importance as differences of just 14 amino acids at either end of the construct lead to either soluble or insoluble protein expression (37Meekhof A.E. Hamill S.J. Arcus V.L. Clarke J. Freund S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Initially, longer constructs of the SidNA3 domain exhibited a strong tendency to form large soluble aggregates, as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Subsequent optimization of the construct borders and of the purification and storage buffer conditions yielded protein that was suitable for biochemical characterization and crystallization. The final 61-kDa SidNA3 protein domain was comprised of residues 2270–2826 of SidN. Evidence that SidN incorporates AMHO residues was provided by mass spectrometric examination of the siderophore produced by SidN from E. festucae Fl1. For these studies, E. festucae Fl1 was used as a model organism for producing the siderophore after mass spectroscopy showed that the siderophores produced by sidN from N. lolii Lp19 and E. festucae Fl1 are identical. 7A. Koulman and G. A. Lane, unpublished data. Furthermore, a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the SidNA3 domain from E. festucae Fl1 shows 99% identity to that from N. lolii Lp19. A siderophore-rich fraction was obtained from an extract of the supernatant of an E. festucae Fl1 culture grown under iron-depleted conditions using solid phase extraction (38McCormack P. Worsfold P.J. Gledhill M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The fraction was examined by high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry on a hybrid ion-trap ion cyclotron mass spectrometer. On infusion into the electrospray ionization source, an ion of m/z 1083.53405 ([MH]+, C46H75N12O18, calculated mass 1083.53168) was observed. This ion was not detected in samples from cultures of E. festucae Fl1 in which the sidN gene had been knocked out by gene replacement.5 Collision-induced dissociation of this species in the ion-trap spectrometer gave major product ions from neutral losses of 112.05040 (anhydromevalonyl moiety, C6H8O2, calculated mass 112.05188), 130.07472 (hydroxyornithyl moiety, C5H10N2O2, calculated mass 130.07368), and 242.12498 (AMHO moiety, C11H18N2O4, calculated mass 242.12611), and water. These results show that the acyl group of the three AHO residues in the SidN-produced siderophore is anhydromevalonyl. The anhydromevalonyl group can exist as either the cis or trans isomer, but the mass spectrometry results do not provide any information on which isomer is present in the SidN siderophore. Further work to fully characterize the siderophore, using high resolution NMR, is currently underway. Previous studies have predicted that the third adenylation domain of the three-module siderophore synthetases adenylate the AHO residues (13Schwecke T. Göttling K. Durek P. Dueñas I. Käufer N.F.

Does the isomerase enzyme RPE65 operate via nucleophilic addition at C11 of the all-trans substrate, or via a carbocation mechanism? To determine this, we modeled the RPE65 substrate cleft to identify residues interacting with substrate and/or intermediate. We find that wild-type RPE65 in vitro produces 13-cis and 11-cis isomers equally robustly. All Tyr-239 mutations abolish activity. Trp-331 mutations reduce activity (W331Y to ∼75% of wild type, W331F to ∼50%, and W331L and W331Q to 0%) establishing a requirement for aromaticity, consistent with cation-π carbocation stabilization. Two cleft residues modulate isomerization specificity: Thr-147 is important, because replacement by Ser increases 11-cis relative to 13-cis by 40% compared with wild type. Phe-103 mutations are opposite in action: F103L and F103I dramatically reduce 11-cis synthesis relative to 13-cis synthesis compared with wild type. Thr-147 and Phe-103 thus may be pivotal in controlling RPE65 specificity. Also, mutations affecting RPE65 activity coordinately depress 11-cis and 13-cis isomer production but diverge as 11-cis decreases to zero, whereas 13-cis reaches a plateau consistent with thermal isomerization. Lastly, experiments using labeled retinol showed exchange at 13-cis-retinol C15 oxygen, thus confirming enzymatic isomerization for both isomers. Thus, RPE65 is not inherently 11-cis-specific and can produce both 11- and 13-cis isomers, supporting a carbocation (or radical cation) mechanism for isomerization. Specific visual cycle selectivity for 11-cis isomers instead resides downstream, attributable to mass action by CRALBP, retinol dehydrogenase 5, and high affinity of opsin apoproteins for 11-cis-retinal.

By virtue of its conjugated double bonds, retinol can exist in several isomeric forms, of which the all-trans, 9-cis, 11-cis, and 13-cis isomers are relevant in animals. While 11-cis-retinal is the only physiological ligand for opsins, 9-cis-retinal can make a pigment, isorhodopsin, with rod opsin (24Hubbard R. Wald G. J. Gen.

Its only known physiological utility is in the Rpe65−/− mouse, where 9-cis-retinal, probably arising by thermal isomerization, forms the isorhodopsin responsible for its tiny level of light sensitivity (26Fan J.

The 13-cis retinoids, formed readily by thermal isomerization, are also found in the retina of certain knock-out models (27Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P.

The mechanism of isomerization of retinol in the vertebrate visual cycle is controversial. In principle, specificity of isomerization may be due entirely to the activity of isomerase itself (29Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Cañada F.J. Rando R.R.

Two alternative mechanisms of retinol isomerization have been proposed: one involving addition of a nucleophile to C11 (29Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Cañada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the other a carbocation-mediated mechanism (35McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A retinyl carbocation acquires a delocalized bond order upon protonation (Fig. 1A), e.g. via loss of palmitate anion from retinyl palmitate. A mechanism involving a radical cation intermediate (Fig. 1B) is an alternative possibility. Although isomerization to 11-cis-retinol only might be the most elegant scenario, we have found (unpublished observations) that, in the in vitro visual cycle system we employed (8Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinols are produced equally robustly. Also, analysis of retinoids in Rdh5−/− mice suggests a “leaky” isomerase capable of producing both 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinols (27Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4275-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Golczak M. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Is this a legitimate characteristic of RPE65? We analyzed RPE65 isomerase activity to provide answers to these important questions. In this report we show that RPE65 is indeed a leaky retinol isomerase and that this feature is consistent with a carbocation mechanism of action in RPE65 retinol isomerase activity. QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for mutagenesis of the RPE65 open reading frame cloned in pVitro2 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA). Primer sequences for mutagenesis are given in supplemental Table S1. Mutants were verified by sequence analysis of DNA minipreps (Northwoods DNA, Solway, MN). Validated mutant and wild-type plasmids were purified by Qiagen purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cell culture methods and transient transfection protocols were previously published (8Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 3 × 107 293-F (Invitrogen) cells were transfected with 30 μg of pVitro2 plasmid (containing RPE65 (wild type or mutant) and CRALBP open reading frames) and 30 μg of pVitro3 (Invivogen) plasmid (containing lecithin-retinol acyl transferase and retinol dehydrogenase 5) open reading frames in the presence of 40 μl of 293fectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen), all in a total volume of 30 ml. 24 h after transfection, all-trans-retinol was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm, and the cells were cultured for a further 7 h and then harvested for analysis. Culture fractions of 20-ml volumes of transfected 293-F cells were centrifuged, and cells were harvested and retinoids extracted and saponified as previously described (8Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Isomeric retinols were analyzed on 5-μm particle Lichrospher (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) normal phase columns (2 × 250 mm) on an isocratic HPLC system equipped with a diode-array UV-visible detector (Agilent 1100/1200 series, Agilent Technologies, New Castle, DE), following Landers and Olson (36Landers G.M. Olson J.A. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 438: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as modified by us (8Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was followed, with modifications, to synthesize [15-2H,18O]all-trans-retinol (Fig. 1C). To 200 μl of 3 mg/ml all-trans-retinal in acetonitrile was added 250 μl of acetonitrile, 150 μl of H218O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 4 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid, with stirring overnight at room temperature. The next day, 10 mg of solid NaBD4 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added, while stirring briefly, and the vial was put on ice for 20 min. The reaction was extracted with 2 × 1 ml of hexane, and the extracts were pooled, dried, redissolved in hexane, and fractionated by normal phase HPLC as described above with n-octanol replaced by chloroform (85.4% n-hexane, 11.2% ethyl acetate, 2% 1,4-dioxane, 1.4% chloroform), and the all-trans-retinol peak was collected and quantified. The labeled all-trans-retinol was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 10 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetone (0.5 m) and analyzed by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) method (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in positive ion reflective mode, modified from Wingerath et al. (37Wingerath T. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Stahl W. Analyt. Biochem. 1999; 272: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A pulsed nitrogen laser with a wavelength of 337 nm was used. Ions were accelerated to a kinetic energy of 20 keV. The following instrument parameters were used: guide wire, 0.002%; grid voltage, 80%; and delay time, 250 ns. Exchange was invariably complete (supplemental Fig. S1) as seen by the presence only of major all-trans-retinol species of molecular mass 289.45, and a minor m+1 species of 290.45 (ascribed to stochastic occurrence of 13C) on MALDI-TOF analysis (supplemental Fig. S1B). The purified [15-2H,18O]all-trans-retinol was added in ethanol to cultures to a final concentration of 2.5 μm, transfected as above with constructs containing either wild-type or mutant RPE65 for 7 h. Retinol isomers were extracted from cells as above, purified by normal phase HPLC as for labeled retinol standard, dried under vacuum for 10 min, mixed with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (0.5 m), and analyzed by MALDI-TOF, as above. Expression levels of RPE65 were quantitated by fluorescent Western blot. Cell pellets (∼2 × 106 cells) from 1-ml culture aliquots were lysed in 150 μl of CytoBuster detergent (Novagen) containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was harvested for SDS-PAGE analysis. Denatured samples were separated on 12% BisTris NuPage (Invitrogen) gels along with ECL-plex Rainbow protein standard markers (Amersham Biosciences) and electrotransferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-RPE65 (1:4,000) and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-CRALBP (1:20,000, gift of Dr. John Saari). Secondary antibodies used were Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse ECLplex fluorescent antibodies (both 1:2,500, Amersham Biosciences). Processed blots, following manufacturer's protocols, were scanned in a Typhoon 9410 scanner (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated using ImageQuant TL image analysis software. Wild-type and mutant RPE65 levels were normalized to co-expressed CRALBP levels, and mutant levels were calculated relative to wild-type RPE65 expression (set at 100%). A three-dimensional model of all-trans-retinyl palmitate was obtained using the PRODRG program (38Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4189) Google Scholar). The model was aligned at the ester bond with the 15,15′ bond of the apocarotenal substrate modeled in the ACO structure (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and transferred to the RPE65 structure modeled from ACO using the Swiss-Pdb viewer as previously described (39Redmond T.M. Weber C.H. Poliakov E. Yu S. Gentleman S. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). The position of all-trans-retinyl palmitate was then manually adjusted to minimize clashes with the predicted RPE65 structure. Orientation of the retinyl moiety in the substrate cleft was based on the experimental findings of a requirement for aromaticity at aa 331 commensurate with cation-π stabilization of the retinoid intermediate. An assemblage of aromatic and non-aromatic residues lines the substrate-binding cleft of ACO and may interact with substrate (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We modeled RPE65 on the ACO template (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2A). Paralogous residues found in RPE65 that are mostly identical or conserved include (RPE65 residues in parentheses): Phe-69 (Phe-61), Phe-113 (Phe-103), Trp-149 (Thr-147), Phe-236 (Tyr-239), and Tyr-322 (Trp-331). (For alignment see supplemental Fig. S2B.) We also identified Tyr-275 of RPE65 as being in the predicted RPE65 tunnel adjacent to Phe-61 and Phe-103, although there is no aromatic paralog in ACO (supplemental Fig. S2B). β-Carotene cleavage by BCMO1 requires the binding of both β-ionone rings of β-carotene in the substrate cleft, unlike ACO where the β-ionone ring is postulated not to enter due to a bottleneck in the opening (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Because RPE65 is more homologous to BCMO1 (∼40% identity) than ACO (∼26% identity), the β-ionone ring of the retinyl ester could conceivably lie at either end of the substrate cleft. Furthermore, NinaB is capable of accepting not only β-ionone rings but epsilon rings and hydroxylated versions of both (20von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We predict that the β-ionone ring of the substrate of RPE65 also enters the cleft and that the retinoid polyene backbone interacts with Trp-331. This proposed orientation is based on the mutagenesis data for Trp-331 (see below) and places the 11–12 bond (Fig. 2B, arrow) of the retinyl ester adjacent to Trp-331 to accommodate the proposed cation-π interaction of the retinoid polyene backbone with this residue, while the ester C–O bond is in register with the iron ligand (Fig. 2B, arrowhead). The residues Thr-147, Phe-103, and Tyr-239 would be predicted to interact closer toward the ester bond of the retinyl ester substrate. We undertook mutagenesis experiments on these residues to determine the role they play in the mechanism of RPE65. Phe-69 (RPE65 paralog: Phe-61) is located in the substrate cleft of ACO (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and is part of the highly conserved FDG motif in the family (F and D are invariant, G almost so). We made F61Y, F61W, and F61L mutants. Phe appears to be an essential residue at aa 61, because activity of both F61L and F61W was abolished, while normalized activity of F61Y was reduced to 13.7% of wild type (Table 1). Despite these severe reductions in activity, protein expression, although reduced, was not abolished (Table 1). We also interrogated Tyr-275, predicted to be nearby. Y275F retained 44% of wild-type activity, normalized to protein expression, whereas Y275W and Y275I were totally inactive, although all three were expressed at roughly 30% of wild type (Table 1). These data suggest that aromaticity at both 61 and 275 is required, but that steric considerations may disqualify tryptophan.TABLE 1Effects of mutations on RPE65 isomerase activity and protein expressionMutant11-cis-Retinol productionExpressionActivity normalized to expressionnaNumber of replicates.%WTbMutant activity is normalized to and represented as % of wild-type RPE65 isomerase activity ± S.D.%WTcMutant expression is normalized to and represented as % of wild type RPE65 expression ± S.D.%WTdMutant isomer production is normalized to protein expression and expressed as % of wild type activity ± S.D.F61L1.02 ± 1.1838.65 ± 14.73<0.14F61Y7.57 ± 0.5756.03 ± 7.6613.7 ± 2.64F61W1.28 ± 1.4722.5<0.14Y275F14.44 ± 0.3733.77 ± 6.644 ± 8.34Y275W027.65 ± 8.004Y275I029.12 ± 7.804Y239W021.6 ± 9.6403Y239F017.8603Y239L014.7403Y239S017.65 ± 10.2403Y239T027.98 ± 8.2403Y239C017.32 ± 5.4603Y239D0003W331Y26.72 ± 2.2633.74 ± 10.4774 ± 17.13W331F8.34 ± 2.6417.86 ± 3.453 ± 6.53W331L021.1 ± 3.5303W331Q0NDeND, not determined.03T147W026.05 ± 6.6406T147Y010.55 ± 5.5506T147V010.95 ± 4.8306T147A12.63 ± 0.2434.00 ± 12.4612.6 ± 0.23T147C20.18 ± 3.6943.22 ± 9.6620.2 ± 3.73T147G30.02 ± 2.7797.8 ± 20.229.9 ± 2.83T147S84.00 ± 5.7998.7 ± 11.284 ± 5.86a Number of replicates.b Mutant activity is normalized to and represented as % of wild-type RPE65 isomerase activity ± S.D.c Mutant expression is normalized to and represented as % of wild type RPE65 expression ± S.D.d Mutant isomer production is normalized to protein expression and expressed as % of wild type activity ± S.D.e ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Trp-331 is conserved in RPE65, and to address its potential role, we replaced it with other aromatic residues: W331Y (its paralog in BCMO1 and ACO) and W331F. We also made W331L (conserving hydrophobicity) and W331Q (its paralog in BCMO2) and measured isomerase activity. Interestingly, W331Y activity was reduced to ∼75% when normalized to wild-type expression, whereas W331F was reduced to ∼50% of wild type when normalized, but W331L and W331Q were completely inactive (Table 1 and Fig. 3). These data suggest that aromaticity at this residue is of importance in the catalytic activity of RPE65. It is interesting to note at this point that W > Y > F in the pi-binding energy series of the aromatic residues, consistent with observed activity of the mutants compared with wild type. Tyr-239 in RPE65 is paralogous to the partially conserved Phe-236 of ACO (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) located in the latter's carotenoid-binding cleft, and a tyrosine is the paralog in all metazoan examples. To discern the role of Tyr-239 in the mechanism of RPE65, we made substitutions with aromatic or hydrophobic residues. All mutations, Y239W, Y239F, and Y239L, led to complete loss of activity (Table 1). Similarly, replacement with hydroxyl/thiol-containing residues, Y239S, Y239T, and Y239C, abolished activity, as did Y239D, a human Leber congenital amaurosis 2 mutation (Table 1). Although all of these mutants (except Y239D) exhibited a reduction in expression, protein was still produced. Only with Y239D was expression absent. Taken together, these data point to an absolute and unique requirement for a tyrosine at residue 239 of RPE65. In contrast, Tyr-235, the paralogous residue in BCMO1 can be changed to other aromatics without major loss of activity. 4Poliakov, E., Gentleman, S., Chander, P., Cunningham, F. X., Jr., Grigorenko, B. L., Nemuhin, A. V., and Redmond, T. M. (2009) BMC Biochem. 10, 31. In the ACO structure (22Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), Trp-149, adjacent to the fixing Glu-150, is predicted to be within 4 Å of the β-ionone ring of the apocarotenal substrate. Its paralog in RPE65 is Thr-147, adjacent to the paralogous glutamate (Glu-148), which forms a hydrogen bond with the iron-coordinating His-241. The isomerase activity of the T147W mutant (paralogous to ACO) was abolished, as was that of T147Y (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). Expression levels of both mutations were reduced (T147Y > T147W (Table 1)). To further determine the role of Thr-147 we made serine, cysteine, alanine, glycine, and valine mutants. Only T147V was completely inactive, whereas the others showed some degree of activity (Fig. 4A and Table 1). T147G had a marked reduction in isomerase activity (∼30%, Table 1), but its exp"

Here, we investigated the functional role of WOX1 and transcription factors in the delayed loss of axotomized neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in rats.Sciatic nerve transection in rats rapidly induced JNK1 activation and upregulation of mRNA and protein expression of WOX1 in the injured DRG neurons in 30 min. Accumulation of p-WOX1, p-JNK1, p-CREB, p-c-Jun, NF-kappaB and ATF3 in the nuclei of injured neurons took place within hours or the first week of injury. At the second month, dramatic nuclear accumulation of WOX1 with CREB (>65% neurons) and NF-kappaB (40-65%) occurred essentially in small DRG neurons, followed by apoptosis at later months. WOX1 physically interacted with CREB most strongly in the nuclei as determined by FRET analysis. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the complex formation of p-WOX1 with p-CREB and p-c-Jun in vivo. WOX1 blocked the prosurvival CREB-, CRE-, and AP-1-mediated promoter activation in vitro. In contrast, WOX1 enhanced promoter activation governed by c-Jun, Elk-1 and NF-kappaB. WOX1 directly activated NF-kappaB-regulated promoter via its WW domains. Smad4 and p53 were not involved in the delayed loss of small DRG neurons.Rapid activation of JNK1 and WOX1 during the acute phase of injury is critical in determining neuronal survival or death, as both proteins functionally antagonize. In the chronic phase, concurrent activation of WOX1, CREB, and NF-kappaB occurs in small neurons just prior to apoptosis. Likely in vivo interactions are: 1) WOX1 inhibits the neuroprotective CREB, which leads to eventual neuronal death, and 2) WOX1 enhances NF-kappaB promoter activation (which turns to be proapoptotic). Evidently, WOX1 is the potential target for drug intervention in mitigating symptoms associated with neuronal injury."

The molecular events that drive interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) production during Th1 development are well understood, but mechanisms that silence this cytokine during Th2 polarization are not clear. In this study, we find that the tbx21 gene encoding the Th1 master regulator T-bet is a direct target of the transcriptional repressor Ikaros. In Th2 cells, which do not express T-bet, strong Ikaros binding could be detected at the endogenous tbx21 promoter, whereas this gene was not occupied by Ikaros in T-bet-expressing Th1 cells. Inhibition of Ikaros DNA binding activity during Th2 polarization resulted in loss of Ikaros promoter occupancy, increased T-bet expression, and inappropriate T-bet-dependent production of IFN gamma. Ikaros was also required for epigenetic imprinting of the ifn gamma locus during Th2 polarization, and loss of Ikaros function in vivo led to an inappropriate Th1 response to the parasite Shistosoma mansoni. These studies demonstrate that Ikaros, a factor with an established role in lymphocyte development, also regulates the development of peripheral T helper responses."

Membrane remodeling affects endocytosis, vesicle budding, and cargo selection. The F-BAR family presents a novel family of proteins, which little is known about their in vivo function. We investigated the physiological role of CIP4, by creating Cip4-null mice through homologous recombination. Compared with their wild-type littermates, the Cip4-null mice displayed lower early post-prandial glucose levels. Adipocytes isolated from Cip4-null mice exhibited increased [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with cells from wild-type mice. The enhanced insulin sensitivity was not due to higher levels of insulin or phospho-Akt, a critical player in insulin signaling. However, higher glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels were detected in muscle membrane fractions in Cip4-null mice under insulin stimulation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Cip4-null mice demonstrated decreased transferrin uptake, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, and horseradish peroxidase uptake, indicating that CIP4 affects multiple modes of endocytosis. These studies demonstrate a physiological role for CIP4 in endocytosis leading to a whole animal phenotype."

Mammalian RNase H2 is a heterotrimeric complex of the RNase H2A, RNase H2B, and RNase H2C proteins that are all required for proper function and activity. Mutations in the human RNase H2 genes cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. We have determined the crystal structure of the three-protein mouse RNase H2 enzyme complex to better understand the molecular basis of RNase H2 dysfunction in human autoimmunity. The structure reveals the intimately interwoven architecture of RNase H2B and RNase H2C that interface with RNase H2A in a complex ideally suited for nucleic acid binding and hydrolysis coupled to protein-protein interaction motifs that could allow for efficient participation in multiple cellular functions. We have identified four conserved acidic residues in the active site that are necessary for activity and suggest a two-metal ion mechanism of catalysis for RNase H2. An Okazaki fragment has been modeled into the RNase H2 nucleic acid binding site providing insight into the recognition of RNA.DNA junctions by the RNase H2. Further structural and biochemical analyses show that some RNase H2 disease-causing mutations likely result in aberrant protein-protein interactions while the RNase H2A subunit-G37S mutation appears to distort the active site accounting for the demonstrated substrate specificity modification."

We have examined a set of SHH holoprosencephaly point mutations that encode a mutated carboxyl-terminal domain of SHH (2Hehr U. Gross C. Diebold U. Wahl D. Beudt U. Heidemann P. Hehr A. Mueller D.

During the processing of SHH into SHH-Np, this carboxyl-terminal domain functions to regulate the covalent addition of cholesterol to its amino-terminal domain and subsequent cleavage of full-length SHH (Fig. 1A for a schematic of the various forms of HH described here). We engineered these SHH holoprosencephaly mutations, SHH-D222N, SHH-T267I, SHH-G290D, SHH-A373T, and SHH-P424A, into a human SHH cDNA construct. Plasmids expressing these SHH holoprosencephaly mutations, wt SHH, or a control plasmid, were transfected into Bosc cells, a human embryonic kidney cell derivative (17Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8392-8406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), and the abundance and processing of the mutant proteins were examined from cell lysates. The processing pattern of three SHH holoprosencephaly mutants, SHH-D222N, SHH-T267I, and SHH-A373T, was significantly different from that of wt SHH, showing an increased abundance of their full-length form (SHH-F) and a corresponding decrease in their processed SHH-Np form (Fig. 1B). Thus, three of the five SHH holoprosencephaly mutations examined showed accumulation of full-length SHH and decreased SHH-Np. Next we estimated the activity of these SHH mutants by co-culturing cells expressing these mutant proteins with NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing a SHH-dependent luciferase reporter gene (8Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, two of the processing-deficient mutants, SHH-D222N and SHH-A373T, exhibited an activation of the SHH reporter gene ∼65% of wt SHH. Together these results confirm the importance of the SHH carboxyl-terminal domain to the processing and activity of SHH. The observed levels of SHH-D222N and SHH-A373T activity were unexpected. The simplest explanation for this result was that the full-length form of these proteins, which appears to be the predominant form, is active. However, this surprising outcome might also result from some low abundance processed form of SHH-Np inefficiently produced from the mutant full-length SHH, as is observed for SHH-A373T. To distinguish between these possibilities, we engineered a SHH mutant that is unable to process into SHH-Np, SHH-U, by mutating the highly conserved Cys198 that is absolutely essential for full-length SHH processing (18Roelink H. Porter J.A. Chiang C. Tanabe Y. Chang D.T. Beachy P.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 445-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 19Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We expressed SHH-U, SHH-D222N, SHH-T267I, and wt SHH in Bosc cells and examined the ability of these mutant proteins to process into their SHH-Np forms (Fig. 2A). Consistent with what has been previously described for SHH-U (18Roelink H. Porter J.A. Chiang C. Tanabe Y. Chang D.T. Beachy P.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 445-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), the ability of this mutant to process into its SHH-Np form is completely attenuated, whereas the SHH-D222N mutant yields some small amount of its processed form. We next examined the activity of SHH-U by co-culturing cells expressing various SHH mutants with cells expressing a SHH-dependent luciferase reporter gene (supplemental Fig. S1). Cells expressing SHH-U were able to activate the SHH pathway ∼44% as well as wt SHH. Thus, although the SHH-U mutant is unable to convert into its processed SHH-Np form, it still exhibits significant levels of SHH activity when measured in co-culture assay. Consistent with this activity in a cell-cell contact assay, SHH-U localized to the plasma membrane of these cells (supplemental Fig. S2). To further validate the ability of SHH-U to activate the SHH pathway, we compared its activity to wt SHH using a cellular lysate assay (9Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Goetz J.A. Robbins D. Bell S.M. Reprod. Toxicol. 2005; 19: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which allows us to compare wt SHH and SHH-U under conditions where we could easily determine the linear range of our assay. The ability of different amounts of cell lysate from wt SHH transfected Bosc cells to activate cells expressing a SHH-dependent luciferase reporter gene was first used to determine the linearity of this assay (supplemental Fig. S3A). Activation of the SHH reporter gene by wt SHH-containing cell lysate was inhibited by the SHH antagonist cyclopamine (20Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Incardona J.P. Gaffield W. Kapur R.P. Roelink H. Development. 1998; 125: 3553-3562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3B), consistent with this assay being specific for SHH. Lysates from Bosc cells transfected with plasmids expressing SHH-U, SHH-D222N, SHH-T267I, wt SHH, or a plasmid control were normalized to total protein content (Fig. 2A) and assayed for SHH activity (Fig. 2B) under conditions where this assay was linear (supplemental Fig. S3A). SHH-U and SHH-D222N activated the SHH pathway to ∼70% of wt SHH, whereas SHH-T267I exhibited only minimal levels of activity. Our results suggest that the full-length form of SHH is capable of signaling. However, one could still argue that a small amount of full-length SHH is being proteolytically clipped in a nonspecific manner to reveal an active SHH fragment. To further confirm that full-length SHH can itself activate the SHH pathway, we immunoprecipitated SHH-U using two unrelated antibodies targeted to its carboxyl-terminal domain and determined its activity. The specificity of the antibodies used in this analysis was validated by evaluating their ability to immunoprecipitate full-length SHH, but not SHH-Np, from the lysate of Bosc cells expressing wt SHH or SHH-U (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S4 show results for different antibodies). The various immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies to the amino-terminal domain of SHH. This result verified that the antibodies used here can specifically immunoprecipitate full-length SHH but not SHH-Np. We next determined the activity of these various immunoprecipitates by assaying their ability to activate the SHH- dependent luciferase reporter gene. The SHH-U immunoprecipitate activated SHH signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S4B), giving up to 3–5-fold more activity than a similar immunoprecipitate from control cell lysate or from immunoprecipitates using nonspecific antibodies. Moreover, the immunoprecipitate from lysates of wt SHH-expressing cells, in which the full-length SHH species is less abundant, resulted in less activity. The decreased activity observed in this latter control is consistent with the activity we describe here being derived from full-length SHH and not from some SHH fragment associating nonspecifically with the SHH carboxyl-terminal antibodies. Taken together these results confirm that the full-length form of SHH has the ability to activate SHH signaling. If the activity of SHH-U we observe is derived from the full-length protein, we would expect to observe SHH-U interact with the SHH receptor PATCHED (PTC). We could then monitor this direct interaction as PTC-dependent endocytosis using antibodies to the SHH carboxyl-terminal domain and PTC (22Incardona J.P. Lee J.H. Robertson C.P. Enga K. Kapur R.P. Roelink H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We first expressed a control plasmid, GFP, SHH-U, or the SHH receptor PTC in individual populations of Bosc cells and then verified that these distinct populations of cells only showed reactivity to antibodies directed against the proteins they were engineered to express (Fig. 3A, top three rows). We then co-cultured these different cell populations expressing control plasmid, GFP, SHH-U, or PTC (Fig. 3A, bottom two rows). Our results show that SHH-U is specifically taken up by PTC-expressing cells when SHH-U-expressing cells are physically associated with PTC-expressing cells ∼75% of the time (Fig. 3A, fourth row from top, and 3B) but not by GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3A, bottom row, and 3B). This result suggests that SHH-U can interact with PTC in a functional manner. Consistent with this suggestion, the SHH inhibitory 5E1 monoclonal antibody was also able to attenuate the PTC-dependent endocytosis of SHH-U (supplemental Fig. S5). SHH plays an important role in the dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube, regulating cell fate through the induction or repression of homeodomain transcription factors such as Nkx2.2 and Pax6 (23Jessell T.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Thus, the extent to which these transcription factors are regulated by ectopically expressed SHH can serve as an indicator of SHH activity in vivo. Therefore, we electroporated SHH-U, wt SHH, or a control plasmid into one side of the developing chick neural tube to determine whether SHH-U exhibited activity in this in vivo system (supplemental Fig. S6). Consistent with our in vitro data, SHH-U expression resulted in ectopic repression of the normal expression of Pax6 when compared with the nonelectroporated contralateral side of the neural tube (supplemental Fig. S6, O and T). SHH-U was also able to induce the ectopic expression of Nkx2.2 in more dorsal regions of the neural tube than observed in the contralateral control half of the neural tube (supplemental Fig. S6, N and S). The ability of SHH-U to regulate the expression of Pax6 and Nkx2.2 was ∼50% of that of wt SHH, when approximately equal amounts of expression plasmid were electroporated into a chick neural tube (Table 1). However, when the amount of wt SHH or SHH-U expressed was compared with the level of endogenous chicken SHH expression in the floor plate and neural tube, using the anti-SHH 5E1 monoclonal antibody, we noted that wt SHH appears to be more highly expressed than SHH-U (supplemental Fig. S6, compare C and H with M and R). This observation was similar to our in vitro observations (Fig. 2C), which also shows that wt SHH is more highly expressed than SHH-U. Based on this differential expression of wt SHH and SHH-U, we assume that the regulation of Nkx2.2 and Pax6 expression by SHH-U represents an underestimate of its inherent activity relative to wt SHH. These results demonstrate that SHH-U also has substantial activity in an in vivo setting, ectopically regulating the expression of two homeodomain genes normally regulated by SHH in the neural tube.TABLE 1SHH-U induces different cell fates in the developing neural tubeSHH constructsNkx2.2 inductionPax6 repressionTotal embryos%%wt SHH796828SHH-U483225 Open table in a new tab If the activity of full-length HH protein is physiologically relevant, one might expect to observe its differential accumulation in various tissues. To test this prediction we examined distinct tissues for their relative amounts of full-length HH proteins. First we decided to probe adult rabbit gastric glands for the presence of full-length SHH, in which full-length SHH has been suggested to play a role in the maintenance of gastric function (11Zavros Y.

Cell lysates were generated from these primary tissues, followed by immunoblot analyses. Our results show that under conditions in which the levels of SHH-Np are normalized, increased levels of full-length SHH were found in gastric gland tissue relative to limb bud tissue (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the ratio of different SHH species may be differentially regulated. To explore the evolutionary conservation of such differential processing, we performed a similar analysis on Drosophila tissues. Thus, we collected Drosophila embryos and imaginal disc tissue from third instar larvae and compared the ratio of full-length HH protein to HH-Np by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4B). Our results show that full-length HH proteins are the dominant species of HH during fly embryonic development, in which multiple species of HH co-migrate at the molecular size of full-length HH. Consistent with these immunoreactive proteins being full-length HH, these bands were absent in lysate from embryos deficient in hh (hhac). In contrast, HH-Np was the dominant species of HH in imaginal disc tissue, although full-length HH was still observed in this tissue. Collectively, these results show that the accumulation of full-length HH protein is consistent with it playing a physiologically relevant role, albeit in a spatially and temporally defined manner. To determine whether the inherent activity of full-length HH proteins was evolutionarily conserved, we examined the activity of analogous Drosophila HH mutants during eye development, where HH is thought to act predominantly in a localized manner (26Pappu K.S. Chen R. Middlebrooks B.W. Woo C. Heberlein U. Mardon G. Development. 2003; 130: 3053-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using an eye-specific GAL4 driver, we expressed UAS constructs hh-U (15Chu T. Chiu M. Zhang E. Kunes S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), wt hh (16Burke R. Nellen D. Bellotto M. Hafen E. Senti K.A. Dickson B.J. Basler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and hh-N (16Burke R. Nellen D. Bellotto M. Hafen E. Senti K.A. Dickson B.J. Basler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) (analogous to SHH-U, wt SHH, and SHH-N (Fig. 1A)) in the eye imaginal disc and examined their ability to rescue the ommatidia development defect found in hh1 mutant Drosophila (27Heberlein U. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 913-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 28Huang Z. Kunes S. Cell. 1996; 86: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because the summation of individual ommatida development within each adult eye gives a quantitative determinant of HH activity, we were able to quantify the relative activity of these various HH proteins by determining the number of developed ommatidia per retina in transgenic flies (Fig. 5A). From these analyses we observed that the ommatida and lamina developmental defects of these mutant flies (Fig. 5A, second column) were substantially rescued by the expression of hh-U (Fig. 5A, fourth column), wt hh (Fig. 5A, third column), and hh-N (Fig. 5A, last column). Notably, the ability of HH-U and wt HH to rescue ommatidia development was quite similar. Moreover, hh-N expression resulted in more correctly developed ommatida (Fig. 5A, last column), consistent with this in vivo activity assay not being saturated for HH. The inability of the HH-U protein to be processed into HH-Np in vivo was verified by immunoblotting imaginal discs removed from the various transgenic flies (Fig. 5B). These results also clearly demonstrate the ability of full-length HH proteins to activate some aspects of HH signaling in vivo, without the requirement to process full-length HH to its cholesterol-modified HH-Np form. In addition, these results show that the inherent activity of full-length HH proteins is evolutionarily conserved, implicating the importance of this novel HH activity to its function. The well accepted model of HH biogenesis suggests that the cholesterol-modified, processed form of HH, HH-Np, is the only known active HH species. Contrary to this model, our results suggest that full-length unprocessed HH proteins also exhibit substantial levels of activity. We speculated that the two most likely reasons for our results are that the full-length unprocessed HH proteins retain some substantial level of activity or that we were observing the activity of some small undetectable amount of inefficiently processed HH-Np. We favor the former model because of our analyses of HH-U proteins, which are unable to process into their cholesterol-modified forms. However, it remains possible that these full-length HH-U proteins are subject to some small amount of nonspecific proteolytic cleavage that liberates an active amino-terminal product, which would then be responsible for the bulk of activity we observe here. Our results are not consistent with this latter hypothesis for three main reasons: 1) the quantitative nature of the assays used here, both in vitro and in vivo, to determine the activity of the full-length HH proteins are inconsistent with the majority of the activity observed being contributed by a small undetectable fraction of the protein, 2) we were able to specifically immunoprecipitate active SHH-U using two distinct antibodies to the SHH carboxyl-terminal domain, and 3) the holoprosencephaly mutant SHH-T267I, which should be subject to the same putative nonspecific proteolytic clipping as SHH-U and SHH-D222N, exhibited negligible activity. Contrary to the results presented here, it has been previously suggested that full-length HH proteins are not active (18Roelink H. Porter J.A. Chiang C. Tanabe Y. Chang D.T. Beachy P.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 445-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 19Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. Beachy P.A.

We do not know the reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the results of the various groups involved but speculate that the level of expression and type of assay used may be important to visualize the activity of full-length HH proteins. Our ability to assay the activity of HH-U proteins was limited to assays that involved cell-cell contact, with the activity contributed by any SHH-U in the conditioned media being negligible (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, SHH-U was only internalized by PTC when cells expressing each construct were in direct contact. Our ability to rescue the ommatidia defect of hh1 flies might also be due to more localized signaling, because HH is only thought to act over small distances in the fly eye (26Pappu K.S. Chen R. Middlebrooks B.W. Woo C. Heberlein U. Mardon G. Development. 2003; 130: 3053-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that the biological functions of HH-U proteins might be limited to those that do not require HH to act far from its site of synthesis. Although it is generally accepted that long and short range HH signaling is differentially regulated, this research has focused on how other distinct proteins direct the processed, cholesterol-modified form of HH proteins through different mechanisms (7Ma Y.

Our results broaden this discussion, because we suggest that unprocessed full-length HH proteins might be directly responsible for a subset of localized HH signaling. In this model, long and short range HH signaling would be controlled by distinct forms of HH proteins, with long range signaling regulated solely by the cholesterol-modified processed protein and short range signaling controlled, at least in part, by full-length unprocessed HH proteins. Consistent with this model, we did not observe significant accumulations of full-length HH proteins in tissues thought to depend primarily on ability of HH to signal over extended distances, such as chicken limb buds (34Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar, 35Tickle C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast we detected large amounts of full-length HH protein in Drosophila embryos, in which HH is thought to act in a more localized manner (34Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar, 36Sanson B. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results suggest that the relationship between HH processing and activity is more complex than previously thought and that in some biological contexts the full-length forms of HH family members may play a significant physiological role.

Therefore, the precise composition of each dimer is highly significant functionally, because it probably dictates the range of its possible clients. This was nicely demonstrated by the obligatory 14-3-3β/14-3-3ϵ heterodimer for aldosterone regulation of a kidney epithelial sodium channel (24Liang X. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Walker W.H.

In vitro and in cultured cells, certain mutant dimerization-impaired 14-3-3s have been shown to bind clients (25Ichimura T. Ito M. Itagaki C. Takahashi M. Horigome T. Omata S. Ohno S. Isobe T.

Similarly, a monomeric Drosophila 14-3-3ζ has been reported to interact with and inhibit the activity of the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpole (dSlo), equally well with the wild-type protein, but in a heterologous system (Zhou et al. (34Zhou Y. Reddy S. Murrey H. Fei H. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Although provocative, these results have not to date been examined in the context of an intact animal and more specifically in a tissue where 14-3-3s are found normally. Given the role of these proteins in multiple vital processes and the potential regulatory role of monomerization, it is essential to evaluate these conclusions in vivo and in a native experimental cellular environment expected to contain natural regulators of 14-3-3 homeostasis and function. We used Drosophila melanogaster to study 14-3-3 dimerization and whether monomers exist stably and function in vivo or are transient, possibly regulatory intermediate species because it offers distinct advantages for this study. It has only two well characterized genes representing the two 14-3-3 conservation groups, leonardo (leo) encoding three D14-3-3ζ (LEO) isoforms and D14-3-3ϵ, encoding the 14-3-3ϵ ortholog (30Acevedo S.F.

Secondly, null and hypomorphic mutants of both genes are available (30Acevedo S.F. Tsigkari K.K. Grammenoudi S. Skoulakis E.M.

Thus, unlike the situation in cultured cells, the effects of dimerization mutant 14-3-3s can be studied largely without potential interference from resident wild-type proteins. Third, the transgenic D14-3-3ζ proteins utilized were studied largely in the fly central nervous system (CNS) 2The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemSNXsyntaxinmAbmonoclonal antibody. system, a tissue where they are abundant in wild-type animals (32Skoulakis E.M.

Finally, with the observation described herein that these isoforms homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other, Drosophila constitutes a simple, but highly representative system to functionally dissect 14-3-3s in vivo. We show that under conditions of homeostasis, dimerization is necessary for LEO protein stability and function. central nervous system syntaxin monoclonal antibody. D. melanogaster strains were cultured in standard wheat-flour-sugar food supplemented with soy flour and CaCl2, at 21–23 °C (30Acevedo S.F. Tsigkari K.K. Grammenoudi S. Skoulakis E.M. Genetics. 2007; 177: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WW) cDNAs and ones encoding the single (WM and MW) mutations and the combined double mutant (MM) described previously (34Zhou Y. Reddy S. Murrey H. Fei H. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Yi Zhou and Irwin B. Levitan. These cDNAs were subcloned into the pUAST vector, and the resulting constructs were used to generate leoFLAG transformants followed by genetic background normalization to that of the Cantonised w1188 resident in the laboratory (35Acevedo S.F. Froudarakis E.I. Tsiorva A.A. Skoulakis E.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2007; 34: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Determination of transgene chromosomal localization and introduction in leoP1188/CyO or leoP2335/CyO mutant background was achieved with standard genetic crosses. The lethal leoP1188 and leoP2335 alleles have been described previously (32Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1996; 17: 931-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 33Philip N. Acevedo S.F. Skoulakis E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8417-8425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the leo gene resides on the second chromosome, transgenic lines bearing leoFLAG on the X or third chromosomes were used to introduce the transgenes in leoP1188/CyO or leoP2335/CyO mutant backgrounds for ease of genetic manipulations. The Elav-Gal4, Actin-Gal4, and Tub-Gal80ts have been described previously (–31Chang H.C. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas Elav-Gal4; leoP1188/CyO and Elav-Gal4; Tub-Gal80ts were generated by standard crosses. Negative controls for all experiments were heterozygotes of each Gal4 driver obtained by crossing driver homozygotes with w1188. Transgene expression under Elav-Gal4; Tub-Gal80ts was induced specifically in adult flies by incubation at 30 °C for 24 h. Temporal regulation of UAS controlled transgenes under the ubiquitously expressed temperature sensitive Gal80ts has been described before (37McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 18 °C the ubiquitously expressed under the tubulin promoter Gal80ts competes effectively with Gal4 for binding to the UAS and blocks transgene transcription. In contrast, Gal80ts becomes inactive and allows Gal4-driven transcription after incubation at temperatures of 29–31 °C, thus enabling temporal control of transgene expression. To assess the ability of leoFLAG transgenes to rescue the embryonic lethality of leoP1188or leoP2335 homozygotes, males bearing leoFLAG in leoP1188/ CyO or leoP2335/ CyO background were crossed en masse with Elav-Gal4; leoP1188/CyO females. The number of non CyO progeny denoting leoP1188, leoP2335 homozygotes or leoP1188/leoP2335 trans-heterozygotes, and the total number of progeny from such a cross were determined. If these mutant animals were fully viable, they would amount to one third of total progeny because homozygotes for the CyO chromosome die as embryos. Therefore, rescue from lethality was calculated as the percentage of the expected one third of total progeny, which was comprised by non CyO flies. For the leoFLAGMW transgene residing on the X chromosome, only females were counted. Data were averaged from at least three independent crosses. Four fly heads were homogenized in 40 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture, Sigma). Equivalence between samples in total protein was confirmed using Quant-iT (Molecular Probes). Laemmli buffer was added, samples were boiled for 5 min at 92 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis (1.5 h, 200 V) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (1 h, 100 V). Total protein equivalent to half a head/lane was loaded, unless stated otherwise, and each sample was run on duplicate gels. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-LEO pAb (32Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1996; 17: 931-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) at 1:20,000, mouse anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) at 1:600, chicken anti-D14-3-3ϵ pAb (30Acevedo S.F.

Genetics. 2007; 177: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at 1:5,000 or mouse anti-syntaxin mAb (8C3, DSHB) at 1:5,000; followed by appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugate Ab (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Bands were visualized with chemiluminesence (Pierce). The results from three independent experiments were quantified densitometrically using ImageQuant 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed statistically. 100 heads were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture). Head lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove lipids and carbohydrates and protein amounts were measured using the Quant-iT (Molecular Probes). Approximately 4 mg of protein from each sample in a final volume of 200 μl were cross-linked by incubation with 1.5 mm BS3 (Pierce), for 2 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of lysis buffer. Samples were subjected to a pull-down assay with anti-FLAG beads, as described below, and analyzed by Western blotting. 100 heads were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, including protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Lipids and carbohydrates were removed by centrifugation and equal amounts of protein from each sample subjected to a pull-down assay using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, lysates were incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG beads for 4 h, at 4 °C, with rotation. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm LiCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Pulled-down material was eluted by boiling for 10 min in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer, run on a SDS gel and blotted as described above. 20 heads were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of mRNA was reverse transcribed with random primers using ImProm-I reverse transcriptase (Promega). The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:50 and 4 μl were used per PCR reaction. Reactions were performed using the MiniOpticon System for Real Time PCR (Bio-Rad), with Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix UDG (Invitrogen). leoFLAG transcripts were amplified with leoforward (GCAGCCCACACATCCAATCAG) and FLAG reverse primers (TCATCATCATCCTTATAATCG). Act5C was also amplified to control for relative amounts of RNA between samples, using act5C forward and reverse primers (30Acevedo S.F. Tsigkari K.K. Grammenoudi S. Skoulakis E.M. Genetics. 2007; 177: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For each sample, leoFLAG and act5C were assayed in separate wells and in triplicate. Reactions were monitored with the MJ Opticon Monitor Analysis software (v3.1), and data analyzed with the relative quantification method previously described by Pfaffl (2001) (40Pfaffl M.W. Hageleit M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 275-282Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Results presented are the average of three runs from two independent reverse transcription reactions. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t-tests. For consistency, we have kept the nomenclature of mutations in 14-3-3ζ used to generate the transgenes for our study as originally described by Zhou et al. (34Zhou Y. Reddy S. Murrey H. Fei H. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), where M denotes the mutated site and W the wild-type sequence. The first mutations, Leu15-Ala-Glu to Gln15-Gln-Arg, in leoFLAGMW are located in helix A, and the Arg88-Val-Glu to Asn88-Val-Gln in leoFLAGWM mutations are located in helix D (supplemental Fig. S1). The leoFLAGMM transgene carries both mutations. Because endogenous LEO is highly enriched in the CNS, we targeted expression of transgenes to this tissue using the Elav-Gal4 driver (38Lin D.M. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 507-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and determined the levels of the resultant proteins in adult head lysates. Initially we determined the abundance of the putative monomeric transgenic proteins to address the possibility that impaired dimerization might render them unstable as we have previously reported for subunits of other multimeric complexes (41Missirlis F. Kosmidis S. Brody T. Mavrakis M. Holmberg S. Odenwald W.F. Skoulakis E.M. Rouault T.A. Genetics. 2007; 177: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged transgenic proteins were easily discernable from endogenous LEO because of their larger size (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2) and appeared highly expressed in the Drosophila CNS. In fact, one each of the two independent lines for leoFLAGWM and leoFLAGMW accumulated 2 and 2.5 times higher than the wild-type transgenic protein respectively (quantification not shown). Surprisingly however given previous reports (34Zhou Y. Reddy S. Murrey H. Fei H. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), doubly mutant transgenic protein was not detectable for the lines shown in Fig. 1 and additional independent leoFLAGMM lines (supplemental Fig. 2A). The leoFLAGMM insert in the transgene was then re-cloned from the transgenic flies, sequenced in its entirety and additional mutations, such as spurious stop codons were not uncovered. Therefore, to determine whether the doubly mutant protein is produced but is unstable, we blotted higher amounts of extracts from animals expressing the transgenes under Elav. Furthermore, to investigate whether the protein is unstable only in neurons, we expressed the same transgenes ubiquitously under the Actin-Gal4 driver. To increase the resolution of the assay, we probed for the presence of the transgenic proteins with the anti-FLAG mAb. The LEOFLAGMM protein in line MM2 is present both ubiquitously and specifically in neurons albeit at least 10-fold lower than its wild-type transgenic counterparts (Fig. 1B). Transgenic protein was not detected from the MM3 line under these conditions. Therefore, the levels of doubly mutant transgenic proteins are low irrespective of the tissue where they are found, suggesting that they may be intrinsically unstable. Although unlikely, because similar results were obtained with multiple independent lines, the marginal levels of LEOFLAGMM could be a consequence of impaired transcription because of transgene genomic location (positional) effects. To resolve this, we performed quantitative PCR with transgene-specific primers on RNA from adult brains expressing pan-neuronally leoFLAGMM and two wild-type transgenes. The results clearly demonstrate that all leoFLAGMM transgenes were expressed equally with, or higher than their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results indicate that unlike the reports from the heterologous system (34Zhou Y. Reddy S. Murrey H. Fei H. Levitan I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the combined Gln15-Gln-Arg and Asn88-Val-Gln mutations result in a dramatic post-transcriptional reduction in the steady state LEOFLAG levels in vivo. To determine whether the low levels of LEOFLAGMM reflect instability of the mutant protein rather than decreased protein synthesis, we controlled its expression both spatially and temporally using the Gal80ts system (Elav-Gal4; Gal80ts, see “Experimental Procedures”). The leoFLAGWW and leoFLAGMM transgenes were kept inactive by culturing at 18 °C throughout development. Pan-neuronal transgene transcription was induced for 24 h under the Elav-Gal4 driver by shifting adult flies to 30 °C. Further transcription was blocked by returning to the non-permissive temperature (18 °C), and the levels of transgenic proteins accumulated during the permissive 24 h were monitored over the next several days (Fig. 2). Immediately following transgene induction, the relative level of the doubly mutant LEOFLAGMM was not statistically different from that of the wild-type LEOFLAGWW control (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the doubly mutant LEOFLAGMM protein declined rapidly to nearly undetectable levels by day 4, whereas the wild-type transgenic protein was easily detectable 7 days post-induction (Fig. 2A). Quantification of multiple independent such experiments demonstrated that LEOFLAGMM was less that 50% of control 3 days post-induction and declined below detection under these conditions within 6 days (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the level of control LEOFLAGWW remained robust even beyond the seventh day that was systematically monitored, in agreement with the reported long perdurance of LEO in vivo (33Philip N. Acevedo S.F. Skoulakis E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8417-8425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed with the independent lines WW2 and MM1 (data not shown). The results, in congruence with the quantitative PCR data, demonstrate that neither transcription nor translation of the doubly mutant LEOFLAGMM are impaired. Rather, its low steady state levels reflect its instability. Therefore, as in cultured cells after transfection, the levels of the monomeric LEO protein were similar to controls immediately after conditions of elevated transcription (repression of Gal80ts), but the protein is unstable under steady state conditions. Because the mutant protein is thought unable to dimerize, these results suggest that dimerization is essential for LEO stability. Although assumed (30Acevedo S.F. Tsigkari K.K. Grammenoudi S. Skoulakis E.M. Genetics. 2007; 177: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it had not been demonstrated that Drosophila 14-3-3s homo- and heterodimerize in vivo, especially in the CNS. To establish this, we cross-linked proteins in head lysates from wild-type animals and D14-3-3ϵex4 mutant homozygotes lacking D14-3-3ϵ (30Acevedo S.F. Tsigkari K.K. Grammenoudi S. Skoulakis E.M. Genetics. 2007; 177: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The anti-LEO antibody detected both monomers and dimers in extracts from wild-type and D14-3-3ϵex4 animals (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the dimers detected with the LEO antibody in extracts from D14-3-3ϵex4 animals can only be LEO homodimers (Fig. 3A, first lane). As expected, the anti-D14-3-3ϵ antibody detected dimers only in wild-type animals, but interestingly both antibodies detected a band of very slow mobility in extracts from wild-type animals, absent from D14-3-3ϵex4 mutant lysates (arrow in Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 6). Because the latter harbor only LEO homodimers, these complexes pointed out by the arrows must represent LEO/D14-3-3ϵ heterodimers detected in vivo for the first time. Provided that Drosophila 14-3-3s homo- and heterodimerize, we tested the hypothesis that impaired dimerization is detrimental to LEOFLAGMM stability in vivo. Hence, we determined the dimerization profile of wild-type and mutant LEOFLAG proteins in the adult CNS. Proteins in the lysates were cross-linked, pulled-down with anti-FLAG beads, run on a Western blot, and probed with the anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 3B). Lo"
https://openalex.org/W2031365566,"Mutations in the coding sequence of the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene cause a neurodegenerative disease known as neuroferritinopathy or hereditary ferritinopathy, which is characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies containing the mutant FTL polypeptide and by abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain. Here, we describe the x-ray crystallographic structure and report functional studies of ferritin homopolymers formed from the mutant FTL polypeptide p.Phe167SerfsX26, which has a C terminus that is altered in amino acid sequence and length. The structure was determined and refined to 2.85 A resolution and was very similar to the wild type between residues Ile-5 and Arg-154. However, instead of the E-helices normally present in wild type ferritin, the C-terminal sequences of all 24 mutant subunits showed substantial amounts of disorder, leading to multiple C-terminal polypeptide conformations and a large disruption of the normally tiny 4-fold axis pores. Functional studies underscored the importance of the mutant C-terminal sequence in iron-induced precipitation and revealed iron mishandling by soluble mutant FTL homopolymers in that only wild type incorporated iron when in direct competition in solution with mutant ferritin. Even without competition, the amount of iron incorporation over the first few minutes differed severalfold. Our data suggest that disruption at the 4-fold pores may lead to direct iron mishandling through attenuated iron incorporation by the soluble form of mutant ferritin and that the disordered C-terminal polypeptides may play a major role in iron-induced precipitation and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies in hereditary ferritinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1993184143,"Ca(2+) channel beta subunits (Ca(v)betas) are essential for regulating the surface expression and gating of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels through their interaction with Ca(2+) channel alpha(1) subunits. In efforts to uncover new interacting partners and new functions for Ca(v)beta, we identified a new splicing isoform of Pax6, a transcription factor crucial for the development of the eye, nose, brain, and pancreas. Pax6 contains two DNA binding domains (paired domain and homeodomain), a glycine-rich linker connecting these two domains and a C-terminal proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich transactivation domain. The protein sequence and function of Pax6 are highly conserved from invertebrate to human. The newly isolated isoform, named Pax6(S), retains the paired domain, linker, and homeodomain of Pax6, but its C terminus is composed of a truncated classic proline, serine, and threonine domain and a unique S tail. Pax6(S) shows a similar level of transcriptional activity in vitro as does Pax6, but only in primates is the protein sequence highly conserved. Its spatial-temporal expression profiles are also different from those of Pax6. These divergences suggest a noncanonical role of Pax6(S) during development. The interaction between Pax6(S) and Ca(v)beta is mainly endowed by the S tail. Co-expression of Pax6(S) with a Ca(2+) channel complex containing the beta(3) subunit in Xenopus oocytes does not affect channel properties. Conversely, however, beta(3) is able to suppress the transcriptional activity of Pax6(S). Furthermore, in the presence of Pax6(S), beta(3) is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results suggest that full-length Ca(v)beta may act directly as a transcription regulator independent of its role in regulating Ca(2+) channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2116139198,"Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a key role in interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-mediated activation of Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (JAK3) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in lymphocytes. Although the mechanisms governing IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK3/STAT5 have been extensively studied, the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation in controlling these effectors remains to be elucidated. Using phosphoamino acid analysis, JAK3 and STAT5 were determined to be serine and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2 stimulation of the human natural killer-like cell line, YT. IL-2 stimulation also induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta, but not IL-2Rgamma. To investigate the regulation of serine/threonine phosphorylation in IL-2 signaling, the roles of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) were examined. Inhibition of phosphatase activity by calyculin A treatment of YT cells resulted in a significant induction of serine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT5, and serine/threonine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta. Moreover, inhibition of PP2A, but not PP1, diminished IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta, JAK3, and STAT5, and abolished STAT5 DNA binding activity. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta by a staurosporine-sensitive kinase also blocked its association with JAK3 and IL-2Rgamma in YT cells. Taken together, these data indicate that serine/threonine phosphorylation negatively regulates IL-2 signaling at multiple levels, including receptor complex formation and JAK3/STAT5 activation, and that this regulation is counteracted by PP2A. These findings also suggest that PP2A may serve as a therapeutic target for modulating JAK3/STAT5 activation in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060352676,"Cell survival and death-inducing signals are tightly associated with each other, and the decision as to whether a cell survives or dies is determined by controlling the relationship between these signals. However, the mechanism underlying the reciprocal regulation of such signals remains unclear. In this study, we reveal a functional association between PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1), a critical mediator of cell survival, and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), an apoptotic stress-activated MAPKKK. The physical association between PDK1 and ASK1 is mediated through the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1 and the C-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1 and is decreased by ASK1-activating stimuli, such as H(2)O(2), tumor necrosis factor alpha, thapsigargin, and ionomycin, as well as insulin, a PDK1 stimulator. Wild-type PDK1, but not kinase-dead PDK1, negatively regulates ASK1 activity by phosphorylating Ser(967), a binding site for 14-3-3 protein, on ASK1. PDK1 functionally suppresses ASK1-mediated AP-1 transactivation and H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a kinase-dependent manner. On the other hand, ASK1 has been shown to inhibit PDK1 functions, including PDK1-mediated regulation of apoptosis and cell growth, by phosphorylating PDK1 at Ser(394) and Ser(398), indicating that these putative phosphorylation sites are involved in the negative regulation of PDK1 activity. These results provide evidence that PDK1 and ASK1 directly interact and phosphorylate each other and act as negative regulators of their respective kinases in resting cells."

The reversal of Aβ-associated behavioral deficits in mouse models of AD following immunotherapy, therefore, offers a convenient system to interrogate distinctions among different immunotherapy modalities for efficacy against this end point.During our investigations into acute reversal of the CFC deficit in Tg2576 mice following peripheral administration of antibodies targeting different epitopes of Aβ, 3J. S. Jacobsen, et al., manuscript in preparation. we observed differences in potency, as well as overall efficacy, among three antibodies, namely 12A11, 10D5, and 12B4, targeting the same N-terminal epitope of Aβ, specifically Aβ residues 3–7. The in vivo potency of these three monoclonal antibodies does not correlate with an aggregate set of in vitro activities e.g. recognition of soluble monomeric, oligomeric, nor insoluble aggregated Aβ species, in a consistent manner. We undertook comparative structural studies of the three antibodies employing x-ray crystallography of antibody-Fab fragments in complex with Aβ1–40 as well as Aβ1–7 peptide, to gain further insight into the basis for the different in vivo properties. Our results show that all three antibodies recognize Aβ peptide in an extended conformation at the surface of the antibody. The conformation of the Aβ peptide revealed by our x-ray structures is very similar to that observed in complex with three independently derived antibodies recognizing a similar N-terminal epitope of Aβ as reported in two separate studies (26Gardberg A.S. Dice L.T. Ou S. Rich R.L. Helmbrecht E. Ko J. Wetzel R. Myszka D.G. Patterson P.H. Dealwis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The comparative studies reported here reveal significant differences in the conformation of the antibody H3 loop, and we postulate that this difference is the primary basis for their differing in vivo activities in the CFC assay. Our findings may be of clinical relevance for immunotherapeutic agents preferentially targeting soluble forms of Aβ for treatment of AD.DISCUSSIONWe investigated the structural basis underlying antigen recognition to identify distinguishing features among three antibodies (12A11, 10D5, and 12B4) with differing potencies for acute reversal of CFC deficits in Tg2576 mice. These antibodies recognize the same linear epitope of Aβ, and their in vivo potencies are not readily explained by an aggregate set of in vitro properties. The in vitro properties we interrogated include differences in affinity for immobilized Aβ1–10 (Table 1), avidity for immobilized aggregated Aβ (43Bard F. Barbour R. Cannon C. Carretto R. Fox M.

Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee C. Lee M. Motter R. Nguyen M. Reed A. Schenk D. Tang P. Vasquez N. Seubert P. Yednock T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), recognition of Aβ monomers versus chemically cross-linked multimers (Fig. 2), and binding to sAPPα (supplemental Fig. S3). To further investigate differences in antigen recognition by the three antibodies, we solved x-ray crystal structures of Fab fragments in complex with Aβ peptide.Our comparative structural analysis revealed the three antibodies under study recognize the same conformation of Aβ peptide, with strong conservation of antigen-contacting residues in the antibody CDRs, excepting H2 and H3. The basis for different potencies in the CFC assay among the three antibodies is suggested by differences in residues contacting peptide in the H2 and H3 loops, and distinct H3 loop conformations. Assuming Aβ-related behavioral deficits in Tg mouse models of AD are mediated by soluble oligomeric Aβ species, and behavioral deficits offer preclinical surrogates of cognitive decline in AD, our findings may be of clinical relevance for AD immunotherapies specifically targeting soluble Aβ. Each of these points is discussed in turn below.Our comparative structural studies employed co-crystallization of recombinant Fab fragments of 12A11, 10D5, and 12B4 with primarily Aβ1–7 peptide. The structure of 12A11 with Aβ1–40 peptide was also solved to very high resolution (Table 2). Superposition of the bound peptide reveals excellent agreement between Aβ1–7 and Aβ1–40 in the conformation of the main chain as well as orientation of the side chains (supplemental Fig. S1), demonstrating that the conformation of the peptide revealed in the structure of 12A11 with Aβ1–7 accurately reflects the conformation of the native Aβ1–40 antigen recognized by this antibody. Furthermore, antibody:antigen contacts are preserved between the crystal structure of 12A11 with Aβ1–7 and Aβ1–40. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the antigen conformation, and antibody:antigen contacts observed in the structures of 10D5:Aβ1–7 and 12B4:Aβ1–7 are reflective of the respective antibodies recognition of Aβ1–40 peptide. Our assumption is supported by the strong conservation between antigen conformation and antibody:antigen contacts reported here and the structures of PFA1 and PFA2 with Aβ1–8 peptide (26Gardberg A.S. Dice L.T. Ou S. Rich R.L. Helmbrecht E. Ko J. Wetzel R. Myszka D.G. Patterson P.H. Dealwis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Finally, the antibodies in our study have been demonstrated to recognize Aβ in plaques as well as soluble Aβ species and are efficacious in plaque reduction in passive immunotherapy studies (43Bard F.

Med. 2000; 6: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformation of the epitope observed in crystal structures reflects at-least one conformation adopted by N terminus of Aβ under physiological conditions.The structural data presented here suggest that antibodies that recognize the same elongated form of the peptide may be specific to different molecular species of Aβ. Because the heavy chain CDR3 loop is positioned in the region where a longer peptide would be located, the different interactions and Aβ conformations observed in this region may be important in binding to distinct forms of Aβ. CDR-H3 of 12A11 is three amino acids shorter than that of 12B4 and 10D5. This loop is compact and adopts an “open” position that might permit binding to a longer peptide in conformations that would be disallowed by the extended loop present in 12B4 and 10D5. Although Aβ residues C-terminal to Asp-7 are not expected to directly bind these antibodies (as demonstrated by the structure of 12A11+Aβ1–40), the CDR-H3 loop may favor or disfavor binding of antibody to certain species of Aβ peptide (different folds, oligomerization, isomerization, or racemization species), thereby acting as a “blocking” moiety. For example, 12A11 preferentially recognizes chemically cross-linked multimers of Aβ versus monomeric Aβ (Fig. 2), suggesting that 12A11 CDR-H3 loop conformation correlates with preferential binding to multimers, whereas the CDR-H3 loop found in 12B4 (Fig. 6B) correlates with equivalent binding to Aβ monomers and multimers. Likewise, chemical isomerization is enhanced in Aβ peptides purified from AD brains (47Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Roher A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kozin S.A. Mazur A.K. Blond A. Cheminant M. Ségalas-Milazzo I. Debey P. Rebuffat S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2151-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because the CDR-H3 loop is close to Aβ Asp-7, it may interact differently with the different Asp-7 isomers, giving one antibody preference over another. Overall, we postulate differences in sequence and structure of CDR-H3 contribute to the different in vivo activities observed in the CFC assay between 12A11, 10D4, and 12B4.In addition to the highly conserved conformation of Aβ peptide observed between our co-crystals and that reported by Gardberg et al. (26Gardberg A.S. Dice L.T. Ou S. Rich R.L. Helmbrecht E. Ko J. Wetzel R. Myszka D.G. Patterson P.H. Dealwis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cappai R. McKinstry W.J. Barnham K.J. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), antibody residues in the involved CDR regions show strong conservation of primary structure with equally remarkable conservation of residues contacting antigen in CDRs L1, L3, and H2 (Table 3). The greatest divergence in primary and tertiary structure is observed in CDR3 of the heavy chain (Fig. 6 and Table 3). This suggests that the H3 loop underlies the disparate in vivo activities of 12A11, 10D5, and 12B4 in the CFC assay, as discussed above. The dominance of the heavy chain variable region for conferring antibody specificity, owing to CDR3 diversity arising from V(D)J junctional hypervariability, is well recognized (51Nemazee D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 728-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The impact of the divergent H3 loops in PFA1, PFA2, and WO2 relative to 12A11 remains uncertain, because in vivo properties of these later three antibodies have not been reported. Finally, the highly conserved V-region primary structure among five independently derived mouse monoclonal antibodies (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) reveals a restricted V-region repertoire utilization elicited against human Aβ3–7 in mouse.The molecular basis underlying neural and memory loss, and consequent dementia, in AD patients remains an area of active investigation. Behavioral deficits in transgenic mouse models of AD arguably represent surrogate models for investigating the pathogenic factors responsible for memory and cognitive decline in AD patients (6Brody D.L.

The observation that behavioral and cognitive deficits in many mouse models temporally precede frank deposition and accumulation of Aβ in plaques, combined with the fact that these deficits are reversible in the presence of plaque burden in the animals (5Dodart J.C.

The major splice isoforms of APP expressed by most tissues contain a Kunitz protease inhibitor domain; secreted APP containing this domain is also known as protease nexin 2 and potently inhibits serine proteases, including trypsin and coagulation factors. The atypical human trypsin isoform mesotrypsin is resistant to inhibition by most protein protease inhibitors and cleaves some inhibitors at a substantially accelerated rate. Here, in a proteomic screen to identify potential physiological substrates of mesotrypsin, we find that APP/protease nexin 2 is selectively cleaved by mesotrypsin within the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain. In studies employing the recombinant Kunitz domain of APP (APPI), we show that mesotrypsin cleaves selectively at the Arg15-Ala16 reactive site bond, with kinetic constants approaching those of other proteases toward highly specific protein substrates. Finally, we show that cleavage of APPI compromises its inhibition of other serine proteases, including cationic trypsin and factor XIa, by 2 orders of magnitude. Because APP/protease nexin 2 and mesotrypsin are coexpressed in a number of tissues, we suggest that processing by mesotrypsin may ablate the protease inhibitory function of APP/protease nexin 2 in vivo and may also modulate other activities of APP/protease nexin 2 that involve the Kunitz domain.

Mesotrypsin is a human trypsin encoded by the PRSS3 gene found on chromosome 9p13 (1Chen J.M. Ferec C. Pancreas. 2000; 21: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Normal expression of PRSS3 is restricted to pancreas, brain, and, to a lesser extent, small intestine and colon (2Ge X. Yamamoto S. Tsutsumi S. Midorikawa Y. Ihara S. Wang S.M. Aburatani H.

Mesotrypsin exhibits substantially different specificity from other trypsins toward protein substrates. It fails to activate pancreatic zymogens and also shows reduced capacity to degrade trypsinogens (7Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Compared with other trypsins, it is significantly compromised in its ability to cleave protease-activated receptors (8Grishina Z. Ostrowska E. Halangk W. Sahin-Tóth M. Reiser G. Br. J.

Neurochem. 2006; 99: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite limited activity toward these classic trypsin substrates, mesotrypsin displays enhanced catalytic activity compared with other trypsins in the cleavage of certain specific protein substrates, most notably several canonical protease inhibitors (7Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol.

The “canonical” inhibitors of serine proteases, named for a protease-binding loop of highly characteristic backbone conformation (12Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 13Apostoluk W. Otlewski J. Proteins. 1998; 32: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), fulfill the paradoxical function of binding to a protease in a substrate-like manner yet acting as an inhibitor rather than an ordinary substrate. These inhibitors, representing at least 18 different convergently evolved protein families (14Krowarsch D. Cierpicki T. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2427-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), inhibit their cognate proteases via the “Laskowski mechanism,” in which inhibitors act as highly specific, limited proteolysis substrates for target enzymes (14Krowarsch D. Cierpicki T. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2427-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). They bind so as to position a specific peptide bond, the “reactive site,” in the active site of the enzyme, ideally oriented for enzymatic cleavage (17Radisky E.S. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10316-10321Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but due to a binding affinity many orders of magnitude stronger than that associated with ordinary substrate binding and to interactions at the protease-inhibitor interface that deter progress of the reaction and dissociation of the cleaved product peptides, enzymatic turnover proceeds extremely slowly. The human genome encodes more than 50 known or putative canonical inhibitors belonging to three families: the I1 or Kazal family, the I2 or Kunitz family, and the I17 or WAP family (MEROPS data base, available on the World Wide Web) (18Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Some of these inhibitors are very small, single domain proteins, whereas others represent functional protease inhibitor domains within larger proteins.

Alternative splicing yields three major isoforms of APP: the ubiquitously expressed isoforms APP751 and APP770 contain a 56-residue canonical inhibitor domain belonging to the Kunitz family, whereas the shorter APP695 lacks the Kunitz inhibitor domain and is primarily expressed in the nervous system (19Golde T.E.

Gusella J.F. Neve R.L. Nature. 1988; 331: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). As suggested by its name, APP is the precursor of the amyloidogenic peptides thought to play a role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer disease (22Golde T.E. Dickson D. Hutton M. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2006; 3: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In normal biology, a variety of functions for APP have been implicated. The earliest to be described was the function of the secreted ectodomain of APP (sAPP) as protease nexin 2, a serine protease inhibitor that targets coagulation factor XIa (FXIa) with high specificity (23Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9591-9594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory activity has been localized to the Kunitz domain of sAPP (25Badellino K.O. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequently, sAPP has been found to stimulate growth in both neuronal and epithelial cells, to influence neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the nervous system, and to stimulate motility in epithelial cells (26Gralle M. Ferreira S.T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; 82: 11-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Schmitz A. Tikkanen R. Kirfel G. Herzog V. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As an intact integral membrane protein, the structure of APP suggests similarity to membrane receptors (28Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), and recent data have suggested possible roles for APP as a cell surface receptor with signaling functions activated through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contacts (26Gralle M. Ferreira S.T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; 82: 11-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and through proteolysis (29Jacobsen K.T. Iverfeldt K. Cell Mol.

In the present study, we sought to identify specific substrate(s) of mesotrypsin. Hypothesizing that such substrates might possess canonical inhibitor domains, we employed an affinity-based proteomic screen designed to enrich for this class of putative mesotrypsin targets. We identify sAPP/protease nexin 2 as a protein that is highly expressed by prostate cancer cells and that is efficiently cleaved as a specific substrate by mesotrypsin. We further find that this cleavage has a large effect on the ability of sAPP/protease nexin 2 to act as an inhibitor of serine proteases, including FXIa. WPE1 NB11 and LNCaP cells were obtained from ATCC. Both are malignant, tumorigenic cell lines of human prostate epithelial origin. NB11 cells were cultured as described previously (30Webber M.M. Quader S.T. Kleinman H.K. Bello-DeOcampo D. Storto P.D. Bice G. DeMendonca-Calaca W. Williams D.E. Prostate. 2001; 47: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), in complete keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen), 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor supplement (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml gentamicin until cells reached confluence, at which time the medium was replaced with serum-free RPMI 1640. Conditioned media for affinity purification, proteolysis experiments, and Western blotting were collected from cell cultures after 4–5 days, clarified by centrifugation, and stored on ice. Prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, media were concentrated 5–7-fold using a Microcon concentrator (Millipore) with a 10,000 Mr cut-off. The recombinant, catalytically inactive R117H,S195A mutant of human cationic trypsinogen was expressed, refolded, and purified as described previously (11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified R117H, S195A trypsinogen (30 mg) was proteolytically processed by 12 μg of bovine enteropeptidase (Roche Applied Science) in 80 ml of 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2 for 5 h at 37 °C. After confirming efficient processing by SDS-PAGE, the reaction was quenched with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 25 °C. Processed R117H,S195A trypsin was purified first on a HiTrap Benzamidine FF affinity column (GE Healthcare) by elution with a linear gradient from buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl) to buffer B (20 mm HCl). Subsequently, R117H,S195A trypsin was further purified to eliminate residual contamination with enteropeptidase on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 preparation grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Following concentration by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon), purified R117H,S195A trypsin (8 mg) was adjusted to pH 6.5 with HCl and coupled to 1.2 ml of washed activated Affi-Gel-10 resin (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C; unreacted groups were subsequently blocked by incubating for several h with dilute ethanolamine. Proteins secreted by NB11 prostate epithelial cells and that possessed strong affinity to trypsin were enriched by chromatography of conditioned cell culture medium on the R117H, S195A trypsin affinity column. Medium was concentrated 8.75-fold using an Amicon stirred cell with a 10,000 Mr cut-off membrane and then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 0.2 m NaCl (Buffer A). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto the affinity column pre-equilibrated with buffer A, and then the column was eluted with a gradient to 20 mm HCl (buffer B) over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing proteins that eluted during the gradient were pooled and concentrated 20-fold using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Millipore) prior to resolution by SDS-PAGE and protein identification by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry protein identification was performed essentially as previously described (31Dächsel J.C. Taylor J.P. Mok S.S. Ross O.A. Hinkle K.M. Bailey R.M. Hines J.H. Szutu J. Madden B. Petrucelli L. Farrer M.J. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2007; 13: 382-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at the Mayo Proteomics Research Center. Briefly, the 10% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel was silver-stained using the SilverSNAP stain for mass spectrometry kit (Pierce). Subsequently, the silver-stained gel bands were excised, destained, and then reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) followed by peptide extraction with 60 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and then 60 μl of acetonitrile. Pooled extracts were concentrated and then brought up in 0.1% formic acid for protein identification by nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer coupled to an Eksigent nanoLC-two-dimensional HPLC system. The MS/MS raw data were converted to DTA files by using ThermoFinnigan's Bioworks 3.1 and correlated to theoretical fragmentation patterns of tryptic peptide sequences from the Swiss Protein Database using both SEQUEST (ThermoElectron) and Mascot (Matrix Sciences) search algorithms running on a 10-node cluster. Intact mass measurements were obtained using nanoflow liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS) at the Mayo Proteomics Research Center, again employing the ThermoFinnigan LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer coupled to the Eksigent nanoLC-two-dimensional HPLC system. The protein solutions were back-loaded onto a 250-nl OPTI-PAK trap (Optimize Technologies) custom packed with Michrom Magic C8 solid phase (Michrom Bioresources). Chromatography was performed using 0.2% formic acid in both the A solvent (98% water, 2% acetonitrile) and B solvent (80% acetonitrile, 10% isopropyl alcohol, 10% water); peaks were resolved with a 10% B to 50% B gradient over 20 min at 350 nl/min through a Michrom Magic C18 (75 μm × 150 mm) packed tip capillary column. The LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer was set to perform a Fourier transform full scan from 300 to 1800 m/z with resolution set at 60,000 (at 400 m/z). The Extract function in Excalibur was used to convert the raw mass spectra to monoisotopic masses. For protein samples that were reduced prior to nanoLC-ESI-MS, reduction involved adding 3 μl of 0.5 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to 20 μl of the protein solution and heating at 55 °C for 20 min prior to injection. N-terminal sequencing of the HPLC-purified recombinant isolated Kunitz domain of APP (APPI) and its derivatives was performed on an automated protein sequencer (ABI-Procise cLC, Applied Biosystems) at the Mayo Proteomics Research Center. SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% acrylamide) were electroblotted onto Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Membranes were blocked in 5% NFDM/TBST (nonfat dried milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. For N-terminal sAPP detection, mouse monoclonal primary antibody 22C11 (Millipore catalog number MAB348) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h at 25 °C, washed three times in TBST, and then incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with a 1:80,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed four times in TBST, developed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer protocols, and imaged on a ChemiDoc XRS molecular imager (Bio-Rad). Recombinant human cationic trypsinogen and mesotrypsinogen were expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, purified, and activated with bovine enteropeptidase as described previously (11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cationic trypsin and mesotrypsin concentrations were quantified by active-site titration using 4-nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) (32Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Recombinant APPI was expressed in Pichia pastoris as a soluble secreted protein essentially as described previously (33Navaneetham D. Jin L. Pandey P. Strickler J.E. Babine R.E. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36165-36175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression cultures grown in BMMY medium (buffered medium containing methanol and yeast nitrogen base) at 30 °C were harvested after 48 h. The supernatant was subjected to 95% ammonium sulfate precipitation at room temperature. Protein pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, using 3500 Mr cut-off dialysis tubing (ThermoScientific). Dialyzed APPI samples were chromatographed on Q-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl) and then further purified on a trypsin affinity column and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (150 mm HCl). APPI concentrations were determined by titration with bovine trypsin (Sigma) as described previously (11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mesotrypsin-cleaved APPI* was produced on a preparative scale by digestion of 250 μm APPI with 5 μm mesotrypsin at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by acidification to pH 1 and purification from unreacted APPI by repeated chromatography on a 50 × 2.0-mm Jupiter 4μ 90-Å C12 column (Phenomenex) with a gradient of 30–85% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Purified APPI* was concentrated and acetonitrile was removed by dilution with distilled H2O and ultrafiltration in an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit with a 3000 Mr cut-off. APPI* concentrations were determined from integration of HPLC peak areas and comparison with standard curves generated from known quantities of titrated APPI. Concentrations of the chromogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanalide (Z-GPR-pNA) (Sigma) were determined by an end point assay. For the study employing an octapeptide mimic of the APPI cleavage site, the peptide Gly-Pro-Ser-Arg-Ala-Met-Ile-Tyr, acetylated at the N terminus and featuring a C-terminal amide to better mimic an internal peptide sequence, was synthesized by standard solid-phase methods and HPLC-purified to 98.6% purity by EZBiolabs. The lyophilized peptide was dissolved in 10 mm NaOAc, pH 6.0, prior to use. Peptide concentration was determined in 0.1 n NaOH by absorbance at 293 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), using a calculated extinction coefficient of 2400 m−1 cm−1 according to the supplier's recommendations. Working stocks of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitors were prepared for competitive inhibition studies as described previously (11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted at 37 °C in a Varian Cary-100 spectrophotometer equipped with a multicell transporter and a circulating water bath. Assay buffer (740 μl; 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2), substrate (20 μl), and inhibitor (20 μl) were mixed and equilibrated in cuvettes prior to reaction initiation by the addition of enzyme (20 μl). Reactions were followed spectroscopically for 3–5 min, and initial rates were determined from the absorbance increase caused by the release of p-nitroaniline (ϵ410 = 8480 m−1 cm−1) (34DelMar E.G.

Briefly, reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (0.1 nm) to quartz cuvettes containing substrate Z-GPR-pNA (150 μm) and a range of APPI concentrations (10–50 nm). Reactions were run at 25 °C and were followed spectroscopically for 12 h so that reliable steady-state rates could be obtained. Conversion of substrate to product did not exceed 10% over the reaction time course. Data were analyzed as described previously (11Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol.

Equation 2 predicts that a plot of (v0 − vi)/vi versus [I0] will yield a straight line passing through the origin, with a slope of 1/Ki (1 + [S0]/Km), allowing the calculation of Ki (35Radisky E.S.

The AdnA and AdnB subunits are each composed of an N-terminal UvrD-like motor domain and a C-terminal RecB-like nuclease module. Here we conducted a biochemical characterization of the AdnAB motor, using a nuclease-inactivated heterodimer. AdnAB is a vigorous single strand DNA (ssDNA)-dependent ATPase (kcat 415 s−1), and the affinity of the motor for the ssDNA cofactor increases 140-fold as DNA length is extended from 12 to 44 nucleotides. Using a streptavidin displacement assay, we demonstrate that AdnAB is a 3′ → 5′ translocase on ssDNA. AdnAB binds stably to DSB ends. In the presence of ATP, the motor unwinds the DNA duplex without requiring an ssDNA loading strand. We integrate these findings into a model of DSB unwinding in which the “leading” AdnB and “lagging” AdnA motor domains track in tandem, 3′ to 5′, along the same DNA single strand. This contrasts with RecBCD, in which the RecB and RecD motors track in parallel along the two separated DNA single strands. The effects of 5′ and 3′ terminal obstacles on ssDNA cleavage by wild-type AdnAB suggest that the AdnA nuclease receives and processes the displaced 5′ strand, while the AdnB nuclease cleaves the displaced 3′ strand. We present evidence that the distinctive “molecular ruler” function of the ATP-dependent single strand DNase, whereby AdnAB measures the distance from the 5′-end to the sites of incision, reflects directional pumping of the ssDNA through the AdnAB motor into the AdnB nuclease. These and other findings suggest a scenario for the descent of the RecBCD- and AddAB-type DSB-processing machines from an ancestral AdnAB-like enzyme.

However, because NhaA is activated at physiological pH (pH 5.5–8.5), many questions related to the active state of NhaA have remained elusive. Our experimental results at physiological pH and computational analyses reveal that amino acid residues in transmembrane segment II contribute to the cation pathway of NhaA and its pH regulation: 1) transmembrane segment II is a highly conserved helix and the conserved amino acid residues are located on one side of the helix facing either the cytoplasmic or periplasmic funnels of NhaA structure. 2) Cys replacements of the conserved residues and measuring their antiporter activity in everted membrane vesicles showed that D65C, L67C, E78C, and E82C increased the apparent Km to Na+ and Li+ and changed the pH response of the antiporter. 3) Introduced Cys replacements, L60C, N64C, F71C, F72C, and E78C, were significantly alkylated by [14C]N-ethylmaleimide implying the presence of water-filled cavities in NhaA. 4) Several Cys replacements were modified by MTSES and/or MTSET, membrane impermeant, negatively and positively charged reagents, respectively, that could reach Cys replacements from the periplasm only via water-filled funnel(s). Remarkably, the reactivity of D65C to MTSES increased with increasing pH and chemical modification by MTSES but not by MTSET, decreased the apparent Km of the antiporter at pH 7.5 (10-fold) but not at pH 8.5, implying the importance of Asp65 negative charge for pH activation of the antiporter.

https://openalex.org/W1993371941,"The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is a key mediator in antigen-specific T cell activation. Thus, inhibitors of calcineurin, such as cyclosporin A or FK506, can block T cell activation and are used as immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft-versus-host reactions and autoimmune diseases. In this study we describe the identification of 2,6- diaryl-substituted pyrimidine derivatives as a new class of calcineurin inhibitors, obtained by screening of a substance library. By rational design of the parent compound we have attained the derivative 6-(3,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-(N,N-dimethylaminoethylthio)-2-phenyl-pyrimidine (CN585) that noncompetitively and reversibly inhibits calcineurin activity with a K(i) value of 3.8 mum. This derivative specifically inhibits calcineurin without affecting other Ser/Thr protein phosphatases or peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases. CN585 shows potent immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting NFAT nuclear translocation and transactivation, cytokine production, and T cell proliferation. Moreover, the calcineurin inhibitor exhibits no cytotoxicity in the effective concentration range. Therefore, calcineurin inhibition by CN585 may represent a novel promising strategy for immune intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2042416599,"Transcription of the yeast mitochondrial genome is carried out by an RNA polymerase (Rpo41p) that is related to single subunit bacteriophage RNA polymerases but requires an additional factor (Mtf1p) for initiation. In this work we show that Mtf1p is involved in multiple roles during initiation including discrimination of upstream base pairs in the promoter, initial melting of three to four base pairs around the site of transcript initiation, and suppression of nonspecific initiation. It, thus, appears that Mtf1p is functionally analogous to initiation factors of multisubunit RNA polymerases, such as sigma. Photocross-linking experiments reveal close proximity between Mtf1p and the promoter DNA and show that the C-terminal domain makes contacts with the template strand in the vicinity of the start site. Interestingly, Mtf1p is related to a class of RNA methyltransferases, suggesting an early evolutionary link between RNA synthesis and processing."

In this study, we identified the molecular basis for the unusual Hsp70/Hsp40 pairing using amide hydrogen exchange (HX) coupled with mass spectrometry and mutational analysis. Association of Ssz with Zuotin strongly decreased the conformational dynamics mainly in the C-terminal domain of Ssz, whereas Zuotin acquired strong conformational stabilization in its N-terminal segment. Deletion of the highly flexible N terminus of Zuotin abolished stable association with Ssz in vitro and caused a phenotype resembling the loss of Ssz function in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of Ssz, the N-terminal extension of Zuotin, and their mutual stabilization are the major structural determinants for RAC assembly. We furthermore found dynamic changes in the J-domain of Zuotin upon complex formation that might be crucial for RAC co-chaperone function.

They predispose young individuals to cardiac arrhythmia in the absence of structural abnormalities. One such mutation that changes an aspartic residue to histidine at position 307 in CASQ2 has been linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In this study we made a transgenic mouse model expressing the mutant CASQ2D307H protein in a CASQ2 null background and investigated if the disease is caused by accelerated degradation of the mutant protein. Our data suggest that the mutant protein can be expressed, is relatively stable, and targets appropriately to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, it partially normalizes the ultrastructure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which was altered in the CASQ2 null background. In addition, overexpression of the mutant protein does not cause any pathology and/or structural changes in the myocardium. We further demonstrate, using purified protein, that the mutant protein is very stable under chemical and thermal denaturation but shows abnormal Ca2+ buffering characteristics at high calcium concentrations. In addition, trypsin digestion studies reveal that the mutant protein is more susceptible to protease activity only in the presence of high Ca2+. These studies collectively suggest that the D307H mutation can compromise the dynamic behavior of CASQ2 including supramolecular rearrangement upon Ca2+ activation.

The CASQ2D307H mutation, occurring in a highly conserved region of CASQ2, was suggested to cause a recessive form of CPVT (17Eldar M. Pras E. Lahat H. Trends Cardiovasc.

This point mutation changes the negative aspartate residue (Asp) to a positive histidine (His) at position 307 in the C terminus, and interrupts a long stretch of negative charges. The quaternary structure of this mutant protein is such that the D307H mutation site protrudes into the inter-domain space of the CASQ2 monomer, and thus might interfere with CASQ2 calcium binding and polymerization (17Eldar M. Pras E. Lahat H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Lahat H. Eldar M. Levy-Nissenbaum E. Bahan T. Friedman E. Khoury A. Lorber A. Kastner D.L.

Adenoviral overexpression of CASQ2D307H in rat cardiomyocytes resulted in a net increase in protein level but significantly decreased SR Ca2+ storing capacity, Ca2+ channel-gated Ca2+ release (Ca2+ transients), and increased local Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) (15Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Terentyev D. Györke I. Terentyeva R. Volpe P. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Nori A. Williams S.C. Györke S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When paced and exposed to isoproterenol treatment, these myocytes exhibited disturbances in calcium cycling (extra-systolic spontaneous calcium transients) and delayed after depolarizations. Furthermore, Houle et al. (13Houle T.D. Ram M.L. Cala S.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 64: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that the mutant protein could be expressed and purified from COS cells, but had a reduced Ca2+ buffering capacity and interacted less well with Triadin and Junctin than the wild type (WT) protein. Light scattering experiments on the CASQ2D307H mutant protein also suggest that the mutant monomer cannot form a dimer that is properly oriented, subsequently affecting polymerization (18Kim E. Youn B. Kemper L. Campbell C. Milting H. Varsanyi M. Kang C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To understand the causal relationship between CASQ2D307H mutation and CPVT in vivo, we previously generated a mouse model that expresses this mutant protein along with wild type CASQ2 (16Dirksen W.P. Lacombe V.A. Chi M. Kalyanasundaram A. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Terentyev D. Zhou Z. Vedamoorthyrao S. Li N. Chiamvimonvat N. Carnes C.A. Franzini-Armstrong C. Györke S. Periasamy M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 2–5-Fold expression of the mutant protein did not alter SR Ca2+ load, whereas Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ spark amplitudes were decreased. We found no compensatory alterations in the expression of other SR proteins involved in Ca2+ release. The transgenic mice developed complex ventricular arrhythmias when challenged with isoproterenol and caffeine incrementally (16Dirksen W.P. Lacombe V.A. Chi M. Kalyanasundaram A. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Terentyev D. Zhou Z. Vedamoorthyrao S. Li N. Chiamvimonvat N. Carnes C.A. Franzini-Armstrong C. Györke S. Periasamy M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, this model had a limitation because the mutant was expressed along with the WT CASQ2. To overcome this limitation and to closely relate to the human condition, we developed a mouse model that expresses only CASQ2D307H in the CASQ2 null background (26Knollmann B.C. Chopra N. Hlaing T. Akin B. Yang T. Ettensohn K. Knollmann B.E. Horton K.D. Weissman N.J. Holinstat I. Zhang W. Roden D.M. Jones L.R. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pfeifer K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2510-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). First, we used this model to understand how this point mutation, D307H, affects protein expression, targeting, and localization of CASQ2 to the jSR; second, we determined whether expression of the mutant protein induced an ER stress response. In response to cellular stress such as expression of mutant proteins that may not be correctly folded, expression of chaperone proteins such as GRP94, GRP78, and/or calreticulin are up-regulated to help fold them. In addition, we investigated how the mutation affects calcium-dependent conformational and structural stability using bacterially expressed CASQ2D307H mutant protein. Our data collectively suggest that the mutation does not appear to affect protein expression and targeting to jSR but may compromise its ability to dynamically regulate calcium buffering. The mouse model for this study was generated by crossing the CASQ2D307H mouse that expresses the mutant CASQ2D307H protein in the wild type background (16Dirksen W.P. Lacombe V.A. Chi M. Kalyanasundaram A. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Terentyev D. Zhou Z. Vedamoorthyrao S. Li N. Chiamvimonvat N. Carnes C.A. Franzini-Armstrong C. Györke S. Periasamy M. Cardiovasc.

The mutant protein was expressed using the α-myosin heavy chain promoter as described previously (27Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol.

The CASQ2D307H mutant protein was transferred to the CASQ2 null background after three generations and confirmed by PCR as described before (16Dirksen W.P. Lacombe V.A. Chi M. Kalyanasundaram A.

This investigation conforms to the guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication 85-23). Expression of CASQ2 (antibody from Affinity Bioreagents), and ER chaperone proteins GRP78, GRP94 (Santa Cruz), and calreticulin (Affinity Bioreagents) were determined by standard Western blotting techniques (16Dirksen W.P.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Cell Signaling) levels were used as internal controls for protein loading and quantification. Protein bands were scanned (HP Imaging) and relative intensities quantified using Image J software. Hearts from wild type mice and mice expressing CASQ2D307H in a null background were fixed by perfusion through the left ventricle with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. All mice were between the ages of 6 and 8.6 weeks. Papillary muscles from the left ventricle were dissected, postfixed in OsO4, en block stained with uranyl acetate, and embedded in epon. Thin sections were contrasted with lead citrate and examined in a Philips 410 electron microscope. Sections of hearts from three wild type, three CASQ2D307H mice, and three CASQ2 null heart tissues fixed as part of a previous set of experiments (26Knollmann B.C. Chopra N. Hlaing T. Akin B. Yang T. Ettensohn K. Knollmann B.E. Horton K.D. Weissman N.J. Holinstat I. Zhang W. Roden D.M. Jones L.R. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pfeifer K. J. Clin.

The frequency of dyads with three appearances (“tight, intermediate, and loose”) was estimated by counting the first 10 dyads that were seen in each of 10 different grid openings in sections from each heart. Single ventricular cardiomyocytes were prepared as before (16Dirksen W.P. Lacombe V.A. Chi M. Kalyanasundaram A. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Terentyev D. Zhou Z. Vedamoorthyrao S. Li N. Chiamvimonvat N.

Cardiomyocytes from the three experimental groups were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with mouse anti-α-actinin (1:500) or rabbit anti-CASQ2 (1:200) followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:300) and Cy3TM-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:300) antibodies. The cells were viewed by excitation at 488 and 543 nm using a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM510). Whole heart homogenates from the three experimental groups were used for this assay. An ubiquitin protein enrichment kit (Calbiochem) was used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The final protein extract was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed for CASQ2 and ubiquitin using antibodies from Affinity Bioreagents and Cell Signaling, respectively. The sequence encoding the casq2 gene was cloned into pET21a between the restriction sites, NdeI and XhoI, and the D307H mutant clone was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Bacterially expressed protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen) using a C-terminal His tag by stepwise washing with 20 and 50 mm and eluted with 250 mm imidazole buffer. The purified protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 5 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was concentrated using a 3-kDa cut-off Centricon YM-3. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired using an Aviv spectropolarimeter with a temperature-controlled cell holder. Far UV CD spectra were collected with 10 μm protein in 5 mm NaH2-PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm NaCl. CD scans were recorded using a quartz cell with path length of 1 mm; response time of 2 s; scan speed of 10 nm/min; and bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Two scans were accumulated and averaged for each spectrum. For studying urea or guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) induced unfolding, the protein sample was incubated with different concentrations of urea or GdnHCl, respectively, for at least 3 h before recording CD spectra. For obtaining CD spectra in the presence of Ca2+, the indicated amounts of CaCl2 was added to the protein solution, mixed by inverting, and transferred to the cuvette after a 15-min incubation period. The protein was recovered from the cuvette after recording the spectra in the presence of Ca2+ and 2 mm EGTA was added, and CD spectra were recorded. Ca2+ chelation by EGTA was repeated by addition of 2 mm EGTA until the CD spectra overlapped with the native CD spectra. Wild type and mutant CASQ2D307H proteins were subjected to proteolysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C using TPCK-treated trypsin (New England Biolabs). The reactions were performed in the absence of CaCl2 at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min and at 1–5 mm CaCl2 for 30, 60, and 120 min (because difference in proteolytic fragments are not visible within the 5-, 10-, and 20-min digestions in the presence of CaCl2). Proteins were incubated in the reaction buffers for 20 min at 25 °C in a reaction volume of 200 μl before trypsin was added at a protease:CASQ2 ratio of 1:50 (w/w), and samples were taken at the indicated time points. The samples were quickly mixed with Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and heated at 99 °C for 2 min before being analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. 5 μg of each sample were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. All experiments were repeated 4 times. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining solution (Bio-Rad). A major goal of this study was to generate a mouse model that expresses only the CASQ2D307H mutant protein. We took advantage of our earlier model, a transgenic mouse that expressed the CASQ2D307H mutant protein ∼2-fold (along with wild type CASQ2) driven by the α-myosin heavy chain promoter. By crossing this mouse model with the CASQ2−/− mouse (26Knollmann B.C. Chopra N. Hlaing T. Akin B. Yang T. Ettensohn K. Knollmann B.E. Horton K.D. Weissman N.J. Holinstat I. Zhang W. Roden D.M. Jones L.R. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pfeifer K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2510-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) a new line that expressed only the mutant protein in a null background was developed. 2–3-Month-old male mice were used for most of the studies, unless otherwise indicated. The resulting mutant mice were compared with null and WT mice. There were no differences between the three experimental groups in survival rates (>1 year), gestation, litter sizes, and survival of litters. No incidences of sudden death were observed in the CASQ2D307H mice at any age (3–12 months) through the duration of this study. There was no significant difference between body weights or heart weight to body weight ratios at age 3 months between the 3 groups (n = 6). Histological sections from 1-year-old hearts were analyzed for gross abnormalities. No evidence of cardiac hypertrophy and/or fibrosis was found (data not shown). Next, expression of the mutant CASQ2D307H protein was investigated in total heart homogenates by Western blotting analyses using cardiac CASQ2-specific antibody (Fig. 1a). The expression level of mutant protein was 2-fold higher compared with wild type (n = 6) but there was no change in the level of calreticulin and SERCA2a protein. To determine whether the expressed calsequestrin is in the SR, we isolated SR microsomes from these hearts and performed Western blotting analyses. Our data indicate that the 2-fold increase in protein can be found in microsomes indicating that the expressed CASQ2D307H protein is targeted to the SR (Fig. 1b). The presence and location of the mutant CASQ2D307H were additionally verified in isolated cardiomyocytes by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Double immunolabeling for α-actinin, a Z-line protein, and CASQ2 showed that both WT and CASQ2D307H mutant proteins localized at the level of the Z-line at foci that were intercalated with the Z-lines of the myofibrils (Fig. 2a). The location of CASQ2-positive foci coincided with the inter-myofibrillar position of dyads, i.e. associations between jSR and T tubules (dyads), where CASQ2 is normally located. The results showed that the mutant protein was not only present but also appropriately targeted to the jSR. Electron microscopy illustrates the disposition of CASQ2 within the jSR cisternae. In cardiac myocytes from wild type mice (Fig. 2b, top row), the jSR lumen has a fairly uniform, narrow width and is occupied by a tight arrangement of small electron-dense “clumps,” presumably composed of CASQ2 associated with Triadin1 and Junctin (31Zhang L. Franzini-Armstrong C. Ramesh V. Jones L.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 233-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We call this a “tight” configuration. In CASQ2 null hearts (Fig. 2b, middle row), on the other hand, the jSR cisternae are apparently empty and have a “loose” configuration and a variable width (26Knollmann B.C. Chopra N. Hlaing T. Akin B. Yang T. Ettensohn K. Knollmann B.E. Horton K.D. Weissman N.J. Holinstat I. Zhang W. Roden D.M. Jones L.R. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pfeifer K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2510-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In contrast, most jSR cisternae in the mutant hearts expressing CASQ2D307H on a null background (Fig. 2b, bottom row) were identical to those in wild type myocytes: they have a narrow width and show a dark, tight staining pattern within the SR lumen similar to WT CASQ2. Differences in the appearance of jSR from WT, CASQ2 null, and CASQ2D307H hearts are quite obvious to the eye and this allowed us to obtain a fairly precise estimate of the relative frequency of jSR cisternae with the appearances described above. Table 1 combines counts from three wild type hearts from the current set of experiments (first row) with counts from three CASQ2 null hearts, from previous experiments (middle row), and three CASQ2D307H hearts (bottom row). In wild type hearts the great majority (93%) of jSR cisternae has a clear tight configuration; a few cisternae are intermediate and none are totally loose. In null hearts practically all jSR cisternae (93%) are loose; in CASQ2D307H rescued hearts the majority (73%) are tight and the remaining have an intermediate or loose configuration. The rescue, although excellent, is not complete, because the mean values for the tight configuration are lower in rescued than in wild type hearts.TABLE 1CASQ2D307H restores tight jSR configuration in CASQ2 null myocytesTypeTight jSRIntermediate jSRLoose jSR% of totalWT93 ± 7aValues are significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.4.10−6).7 ± 70CASQ2 null011 ± 1289 ± 12bValues are highly significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.9.10−34).CASQ2D307H73 ± 16aValues are significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.4.10−6).17 ± 1110 ± 10bValues are highly significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.9.10−34).a Values are significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.4.10−6).b Values are highly significantly different (Student’s t test, p < 0.9.10−34).

https://openalex.org/W2037377963,"Muscle contraction is tightly regulated by Ca(2+) binding to the thin filament protein troponin. The mechanism of this regulation was investigated by detailed mapping of the dynamic properties of cardiac troponin using amide hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry. Results were obtained in the presence of either saturation or non-saturation of the regulatory Ca(2+) binding site in the NH(2) domain of subunit TnC. Troponin was found to be highly dynamic, with 60% of amides exchanging H for D within seconds of exposure to D(2)O. In contrast, portions of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil exhibited high protection from exchange, despite 6 h in D(2)O. The data indicate that the most stable portion of the trimeric troponin complex is the coiled-coil. Regulatory site Ca(2+) binding altered dynamic properties (i.e. H/D exchange protection) locally, near the binding site and in the TnI switch helix that attaches to the Ca(2+)-saturated TnC NH(2) domain. More notably, Ca(2+) also altered the dynamic properties of other parts of troponin: the TnI inhibitory peptide region that binds to actin, the TnT-TnI coiled-coil, and the TnC COOH domain that contains the regulatory Ca(2+) sites in many invertebrate as opposed to vertebrate troponins. Mapping of these affected regions onto the troponin highly extended structure suggests that cardiac troponin switches between alternative sets of intramolecular interactions, similar to previous intermediate resolution x-ray data of skeletal muscle troponin."

The task faced by TatA is challenging, because it must allow the transport of large protein substrates of varying sizes while maintaining the membrane permeability barrier to ions and small molecules. There is only limited information about how this is achieved. There is suggestive evidence that TatA may polymerize in response to substrate (21Leake M.C. Greene N.P. Godun R.M. Granjon T.

Cell. 2009; 20: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the oligomeric state of TatA may dynamically alter to accommodate substrate proteins of different sizes (16Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, to fully understand how TatA complexes are able to mediate the transmembrane movement of folded proteins structural information at the molecular level of resolution is now required. In this study we have used site-directed spin labeling to probe the structure and organization of TatA subunits. Site-directed spin labeling is a powerful method to obtain structural information on proteins, such as TatA, that are not easily studied by crystallographic or solution NMR methods (25Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct.

The room temperature EPR spectra of a covalently attached spin label is sensitive to the dynamics of the label and hence its protein environment (29Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Thus a set of spin labels along a helix can provide a powerful means of deducing whether a residue is sitting at the protein surface or at a buried site. Unpaired electron spins will also interact, via dipolar coupling, with a nearby spin. The magnitude of this coupling is proportional to 1/rab3, where rab is the inter-spin distance. Measurements of inter-spin coupling can, therefore, be used to estimate the distances between the spins and hence the distances between different regions of spin-labeled proteins (32Steinhoff H.J.

In this study we have carried out EPR measurements on purified, detergent-solubilized TatA complexes containing site-directed nitroxide spin labels at consecutive positions within the transmembrane helix. The results suggest a model for the organization of the TatA complex in which a single wall of transmembrane helices interact via residues Ile12 and Val14. We also observed subunit exchange between TatA complexes. This is consistent with models for the mechanism of Tat transport that invoke dynamic TatA polymerization. Plasmid pQE80-TatA expresses E. coli TatA with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. pQE80-TatA was produced by amplifying the tatA gene from plasmid pUNITATA (35Greene N.P. Porcelli I. Buchanan G.

Plasmids expressing single cysteine TatA variants were constructed by using the same strategy as pQE80-TatA but with the appropriate mutant tatA alleles amplified from the pUNITATA-derived plasmids described by Greene et al. (35Greene N.P. Porcelli I. Buchanan G. Hicks M.G. Schermann S.M. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23937-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E. coli strain C43 (36Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) transformed with the appropriate expression plasmid was cultured aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When the cultures reached an A600 nm of 0.5, expression of the tatA allele was routinely induced with 1 mm final concentration of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the growth continued for a further 5 h before harvesting. The TatA Ile11 → Cys variant did not express well under these conditions. Instead, production of this variant was induced by 0.5 mm final concentration isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cells were cultured for a further 20 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 (at 25 °C), 200 mm NaCl (buffer A) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. Isolation of a crude membrane fraction, solubilization of the membranes with nonapolyoxyethylene dodecyl ether (C12E9, Sigma), and purification of TatA variants from the membrane extract by Ni(II) affinity chromatography were as described earlier (14Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Wallis R. van den Brink-van der Laan E. de Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 5-ml HisTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) was used in the affinity purification step. 2 mm dithiothreitol was included in the buffer at all steps up to and including the Ni(II) affinity column wash step to ensure that the cysteine residue of the TatA variants was in the reduced state. Dithiothreitol was omitted from the affinity column elution step onward to avoid interference with the labeling reaction. TatA-containing fractions from the Ni(II) affinity column were pooled and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C and then 4 h at room temperature with 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl (MTSL, Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada). A 10:1 molar excess of MTSL over TatA was employed to produce fully labeled protein, while substoichiometric MTSL:TatA ratios were used for method 1 underlabeling. The sample was then supplemented with Na2EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm and concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml using a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). The concentrated sample was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A containing 0.1% C12E9. TatA-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1% C12E9, and concentrated to ∼5 mg of protein ml−1 using a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off microcon centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The degree of labeling was determined in each case by comparing the measured protein concentration to the spin label concentration obtained by integration of the spin intensity of the EPR spectrum. The purified MTSL-labeled TatA variants were analyzed on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, using a sinapinic acid matrix. All variants showed a major peak of mass within 5 Da of that expected for TatA-MTSL. Analysis of mass peak intensities suggested >90% MTSL labeling for all “fully labeled” TatA variants in agreement with the biochemical analysis. Room temperature X-band EPR spectra were acquired using a Bruker EleXsys 500 spectrometer fitted with an ER4123D resonator with samples contained in 0.6-mm inner diameter × 0.84-mm outer diameter quartz tubes (37Carl P. The ER4123D CW-Resonator: Dedicated to Spin Labels.Bruker BioSpin Application Note. Bruker BioSpin, Coventry, UK2003Google Scholar). A Bruker EleXsys 580 system with an ER4118X-MD resonator was used in the continuous-wave mode to record X-band EPR at 170 K. For this system 3-mm inner diameter × 4-mm outer diameter quartz tubes were used. W-band EPR spectra were acquired using a Bruker, EleXsys 680 spectrometer with samples contained in 0.1-mm inner diameter × 0.5-mm outer diameter quartz tubes. Samples of TatA were prepared with nitroxide radical spin labels at each of positions 9–18. These residues encompass the center and carboxyl-terminal half of the transmembrane helix and correspond to just over 2.5 helical turns. We chose this region of TatA for analysis, because previous studies had shown that this part of TatA forms well defined interactions with other TatA protomers and because cysteine substitutions at the chosen positions do not significantly affect TatA function (35Greene N.P.

Appropriate hexahistidine-tagged single cysteine TatA variants were purified in the detergent C12E9 and then labeled with the thiol-specific spin label MTSL (38Berliner L.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 414: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. White S.H. Membrane Protein Structure: Experimental Approaches.

The purification procedure was essentially identical to the one used previously to obtain low resolution structures of TatA by electron microscopy (16Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A.

Thus the structural data from the two studies should be directly comparable. Blue native-PAGE analysis (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) of the purified spin-labeled variants revealed ladders of bands resembling those exhibited by the wild-type TatA protein (15Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and spin-labeled protein was eluted in the same fractions in gel filtration as the wild-type TatA (14Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Wallis R. van den Brink-van der Laan E. de Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To confirm that the spin labels were attached only at the engineered sites, a batch of cysteine-free parental TatA was taken through the same procedure. This resulted in an EPR spectrum devoid of any features from a nitroxide spin label (Fig. 1A). The EPR line shapes recorded at room temperature for the spin-labeled TatA variants contain contributions not only from the motions of the spin label and protein but also from any inter-spin dipolar coupling. Separation of these two effects is necessary to interpret the EPR spectra. Freezing the sample removes the contributions from label and protein motions allowing the analysis of dipolar coupling. Conversely, any contribution from dipolar coupling can be reduced by diluting spins thereby increasing inter-spin distances. In this study two different methods of sub-stoichiometric labeling were used to obtain spin dilution. In method 1 TatA was underlabeled by adding substoichiometric amounts of MTSL to the protein during the labeling reaction. In method 2 fully labeled TatA was mixed with unlabeled wild-type TatA. Identical line shape broadening was seen whichever spin dilution method was employed, and there was no significant difference between 30%, 20, and 10% dilutions. Therefore we assumed that 10% spin dilution is sufficient to remove effects due to dipolar coupling. An example is given in Fig. 1 where the room temperature EPR spectrum of 100% spin-labeled variant Ile-15 → Cys (Fig. 1B) is compared with 10% spin-labeled protein prepared by underlabeling (method 1, Fig. 1C) or prepared by mixing with wild-type protein (method 2, Fig. 1D). Line shape broadening can be characterized by a parameter R, which is the ratio of the height of the low field peak to that of the central resonance line. Both 10% labeled samples have R = 0.45 and, therefore, show identical line shape broadening. The equivalence of the two spin dilution methods is an important observation, because TatA subunits can only have the same environment after mixing that they do after underlabeling if the subunits equilibrate completely between TatA complexes. If such subunit exchange had not occurred then method 2 would be expected to yield a 9:1 mixture of completely unlabeled and 100% labeled complexes resulting in an EPR spectrum identical to that of a stoichiometrically labeled sample but with a 10-fold reduction in spin intensity. Our data show that subunit exchange was complete by the time the samples had been mixed and an EPR spectrum recorded (about 10 min). Thus the rate of helical exchange is relatively rapid. To investigate the kinetics of exchange in more detail samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at different times after mixing, and spectral broadening was measured in the low temperature EPR spectrum (data not shown). These experiments showed that subunit exchange was effectively complete at the shortest measurable mixing time (1 min). Nitroxide motional dynamics cause spectral broadening in the room temperature EPR of spin-labeled proteins. Various molecular motions contribute to probe mobility, including the flexibility of the spin-labeled side chain relative to the protein, local protein backbone fluctuations, and the overall rotary diffusion of the protein (27Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). At 9.5 GHz and room temperature the rotational diffusion of oligomeric complexes of TatA will be too slow on the EPR timescale to affect the line shape and can be ignored. By contrast, internal rotations of the spin label around the bonds in its flexible linker, and backbone motions of the protein itself, can both be sufficiently rapid (τ ∼ 1 ns) to influence spectral line shape (26Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). These motions and their anisotropy will be strongly influenced by packing interactions in the local environment and by the backbone secondary structure. Spectral line shape analysis can, therefore, show whether the spin label is at a buried or surface site and give information about the type of secondary structure in which the spin label is located. Semi-empirical measures of spin label mobility can be derived from the EPR “mobility” parameter ΔH0, measured as the peak-to-peak first derivative width of the central line, and by the spectral breadth parameter, which is represented by the second moment of the spectral breadth, 〈H2〉 (42Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 43Bordignon E. Steinhoff H.-J. Hemminga M.A. Berliner L.J. Membrane Protein Structure and Dynamics. Springer, New York2007: 129-164Google Scholar), 〈H2〉=∫(B-〈H〉)2S(B)dB∫S(B)dB(1) where B is magnetic field, S(B) is the integrated absorbance of the EPR spectrum of the spin label, and the first moment 〈H〉 = ∫B S(B)dB/∫S(B)dB. Using proteins of known structure, correlations between the inverse values of these parameters, ΔH0−1 and 〈H2〉−1, allow distinction between residues that are buried, surface-exposed, in a loop, or at contact sites between secondary structure regions (43Bordignon E. Steinhoff H.-J. Hemminga M.A. Berliner L.J. Membrane Protein Structure and Dynamics. Springer, New York2007: 129-164Google Scholar). Room temperature X-band EPR spectra were collected for the TatA variants successively spin-labeled from residue Leu-9 to Leu-18 (Fig. 2), and spin mobility parameters were calculated (Fig. 3). In each case the protein was 10% spin-labeled by dilution of 100% labeled TatA with wild-type TatA. As discussed in the previous section this removes any detectable broadening from interspin dipolar coupling and hence the EPR line shapes reflect only the motional dynamics of each spin label. Fig. 3A shows the variation of side-chain mobility, represented by ΔH0−1 values, along the transmembrane helix. Positions 12 and 14 have the most restricted mobility, whereas positions 9, 10, and 18 are significantly more mobile than the average value of 2.8 millitesla−1. This suggests two sites of significant inter-protein contact at the center of the region probed, namely residues 12 and 14. By plotting 〈H2〉−1 against ΔH0−1 for each sequence position residues can be assigned to regions of secondary structure and of inter-protein contact (Fig. 3B). This plot suggests that residues 12 and 14 are at contact interfaces, whereas residues 11, 13, and 15–17 are exposed at a helical surface.FIGURE 3Mobility of spin labels attached to the transmembrane helix of TatA.

Assignment of structural environments is based on the compilation of Bordignon and Steinhoff (43Bordignon E. Steinhoff H.-J. Hemminga M.A. Berliner L.J. Membrane Protein Structure and Dynamics. Springer, New York2007: 129-164Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In frozen solution the motions of the spin labels are quenched, and any broadening in EPR line shape is due to dipolar coupling between labels. The strength of the dipolar coupling depends on the separation between the interacting labels and thus gives information on the distance between the labeled positions. If the interacting spin separation is ∼5 Å or less the dipolar coupling may become large in comparison with the energy of the microwave photon, rendering the interacting spins EPR silent. X-band EPR spectra were collected for the ten spin-labeled TatA variants at 170 K for both 10 and 100% labeled samples. Fig. 4A shows the spectra for a representative variant. The changes in line shape on dilution are characteristic of those observed in the presence of weak magnetic dipolar interactions between nitroxide spin labels (32Steinhoff H.J. Radzwill N. Thevis W.

The broadening in the 100% labeled spectrum is similar for all label positions between 9 and 18. Thus the distance between the same positions in adjacent protomers is approximately the same for all positions analyzed. Crucially, comparison of the integrated EPR signal intensities of the fully labeled and underlabeled samples shows no loss of spin concentration with increased labeling. Thus there is no evidence for loss of signal intensity that wo"
https://openalex.org/W2021149740,"Protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) is an essential component of the intrinsic apoptotic program. Following DNA damage, such as exposure to UV radiation, PKCdelta is cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner, generating a constitutively active catalytic fragment (PKCdelta-cat), which is necessary and sufficient for keratinocyte apoptosis. We found that in addition to inducing apoptosis, expression of PKCdelta-cat caused a pronounced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest in both primary human keratinocytes and immortalized HaCaT cells. Consistent with a G(2)/M arrest, PKCdelta-cat induced phosphorylation of Cdk1 (Tyr(15)), a critical event in the G(2)/M checkpoint. Treatment with the ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine was unable to prevent PKCdelta-cat-induced G(2)/M arrest, suggesting that PKCdelta-cat is functioning downstream of ATM/ATR in the G(2)/M checkpoint. To better understand the role of PKCdelta and PKCdelta-cat in the cell cycle response to DNA damage, we exposed wild-type and PKCdelta null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to UV radiation. Wild-type MEFs underwent a pronounced G(2)/M arrest, Cdk1 phosphorylation, and induction of apoptosis following UV exposure, whereas PKCdelta null MEFs were resistant to these effects. Expression of PKCdelta-green fluorescent protein, but not caspase-resistant or kinase-inactive PKCdelta, was able to restore G(2)/M checkpoint integrity in PKCdelta null MEFs. The function of PKCdelta in the DNA damage-induced G(2)/M cell cycle checkpoint may be a critical component of its tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W2028869552,"The Escherichia coli chemoreceptors for serine (Tsr) and aspartate (Tar) and several bacterial class III adenylyl cyclases (ACs) share a common molecular architecture; that is, a membrane anchor that is linked via a cytoplasmic HAMP domain to a C-terminal signal output unit. Functionality of both proteins requires homodimerization. The chemotaxis receptors are well characterized, whereas the typical hexahelical membrane anchor (6TM) of class III ACs, suggested to operate as a channel or transporter, has no known function beyond a membrane anchor. We joined the intramolecular networks of Tsr or Tar and two bacterial ACs, Rv3645 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and CyaG from Arthrospira platensis, across their signal transmission sites, connecting the chemotaxis receptors via different HAMP domains to the catalytic AC domains. AC activity in the chimeras was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of l-serine or l-aspartate in vitro and in vivo. Single point mutations known to abolish ligand binding in Tar (R69E or T154I) or Tsr (R69E or T156K) abrogated AC regulation. Co-expression of mutant pairs, which functionally complement each other, restored regulation in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these studies demonstrate chemotaxis receptor-mediated regulation of chimeric bacterial ACs and connect chemical sensing and AC regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1969098920,"We found that factor H (FH) exists in porcine seminal plasma. Purified FH strongly inhibited serum alternative pathway complement activation against lipopolysaccharide. The molecular weight, pI, and heparin-binding activity of the purified protein were different from those of purified FH from porcine serum. The complement regulatory activity of seminal plasma FH was approximately 2-fold stronger than that of serum FH. Treatment of purified serum FH with sialidase and N-glycosidase F gave almost the same results as those of seminal plasma FH. The deletion of sialic acid from the carbohydrate chains of both FHs contributed to heparin-binding and complement regulatory activities. Results of reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry showed that seminal plasma FH is mainly secreted from epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle in male genital tracts. FH was also detected in the outer acrosomal region of ejaculated sperm by immunofluorescence staining, and found that the purified FH from the sperm membrane has the same complement regulatory activity as that of seminal plasma FH. The ejaculated sperm possessing FH in the outer acrosomal region considerably evaded complement attack. We also found that there is strong complement activity in fluids from female genital tract ducts. These findings indicate that FH bound to the outer acrosomal region and soluble FH play important roles in protecting sperm against complement attack in male and female genital tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2160720744,"The Synechocystis Slr0642 protein and its plastidial Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ortholog At2g32040 belong to the folate-biopterin transporter (FBT) family within the major facilitator superfamily. Both proteins transport folates when expressed in Escherichia coli. Because the structural requirements for transport activity are not known for any FBT protein, we applied mutational analysis to identify residues that are critical to transport and interpreted the results using a comparative structural model based on E. coli lactose permease. Folate transport was assessed via the growth of an E. coli pabA abgT strain, which cannot synthesize or take up folates or p-aminobenzoylglutamate. In total, 47 residues were replaced with Cys or Ala. Mutations at 22 positions abolished folate uptake without affecting Slr0642 expression in membranes, whereas other mutations had no effect. Residues important for function mostly line the predicted central cavity and are concentrated in the core alpha-helices H1, H4, H7, and H10. The essential residue locations are consistent with a folate-binding site lying roughly equidistant from both faces of the transporter. Arabidopsis has eight FBT proteins besides At2g32040, often lacking conserved critical residues. When six of these proteins were expressed in E. coli or in Leishmania folate or pterin transporter mutants, none showed evidence of folate or pterin transport activity, and only At2g32040 was isolated by functional screening of Arabidopsis cDNA libraries in E. coli. Such negative data could reflect roles in transport of other substrates. These studies provide the first insights into the native structure and catalytic mechanism of FBT family carriers."

We previously reported that the angiogenic growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) coaxes monocytes to assume the phenotype of functional endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study we show that PTN expression is colocalized with capillaries of human atherosclerotic plaques. Among the various reagents that are critical to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, interferon (IFN)-γ- was found to markedly induce PTN mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in macrophages. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Janus kinase inhibitors, WHI-P154 and ATA, efficiently blocked STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Notably, the level of phosphorylated STAT1 was found to correlate directly with the PTN mRNA levels. In addition, STAT1/ STAT3/p44/42 signaling molecules were found to be phosphorylated by IFN-γ in macrophages, and they were translocated into the nucleus. Further, PTN promoter analysis showed that a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) located at –2086 to –2078 bp is essential for IFN-γ-regulated promoter activity. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that both STAT1 and STAT3 bind to the GAS at the chromatin level in the IFN-γ stimulated cells. Finally, to test whether the combined effect of STAT1/STAT3/p44/42 signaling is required for the expression of PTN in macrophages, gene knockdowns of these transcription factors were performed using siRNA. Cells lacking STAT1, but not STAT3 or p42, have markedly reduced PTN mRNA levels. These data suggest that PTN expression in the human plaques may be in part regulated by IFN-γ and that PTN is involved in the adaptive immunity.—Li, F., Tian, F., Wang, L., Williamson, I.

Pleiotrophin (PTN) is expressed in vascularized human atherosclerotic plaques: IFN-γ/ JAK/STAT1 signaling is critical for the expression of PTN in macrophages FASEBJ. 24, 810–822 (2010). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2118268643,"Although the role of the classic retinoic acid (RA)-induced genomic pathway in cancer cell differentiation is well recognized, the underlying mechanisms remain to be dissected. Retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) is a transcription factor activated by RA, and its serine 77 (RARaS77) is the main residue phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) complex. We report here that in both human myeloid leukemia and mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma stem cells, either RA-suppressed CAK phosphorylation of RARa or mutation of RARaS77 to alanine (RARaS77A) coordinates CAK-dependent G1 arrest with cancer cell differentiation by transactivating RA-target genes. Both hypophosphorylated RARa and RARaS77A reduce binding to retinoic acid-responsive elements (RARE) in the promoters of RA-target genes while stimulating gene transcription. The enhanced transactivation and reduced RARa-chromatin interaction are accompanied by RARa dissociation from the transcriptional repressor N-CoR and are association with the coactivator NCoA-3. Such effects of decreased CAK phosphorylation of RARaS77 on mediating RA-dependent transcriptional control of cancer cell differentiation are examined correspondingly in both RA-resistant myeloid leukemia and embryonic teratocarcinoma stem RARa-/- cells. These studies demonstrate, for the first time, that RA couples G1 arrest to transcriptional control of cancer cell differentiation by suppressing CAK phosphorylation of RARa to release transcriptional repression.—Wang, A, Alimova, I. N., Luo, P. Jong, A, Triche, T. J., Wu, L. Loss of CAK phosphorylation of RARa mediates transcriptional control of retinoid-induced cancer cell differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1989952312,"Interleukin (IL)-31 is a recently described cytokine, preferentially produced by T helper 2 lymphocytes and associated with skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. IL-31 is a member of the four α-helix bundle cytokine family and is related to the IL-6 subgroup. Its heterodimeric membrane receptor is composed of the gp130-like receptor (GPL) subunit associated to the oncostatin M receptor subunit. We identified critical amino acids implicated in the ligand receptor interaction by computational analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis. Six IL-31 residues selected for their putative involvement in cytokine receptor contact sites were alanine-substituted, and the corresponding proteins were expressed in mammalian and bacterial systems. Biochemical, membrane binding, cell signaling, and cell proliferation analyses showed that mutation E44A, E106A, or H110A abolished IL-31 binding to GPL and the subsequent signaling events. A second ligand receptor-binding site involved Lys134, with alanine substitution leading to a protein that still binds GPL, but is unable to recruit the second receptor subunit and the subsequent signaling pathways. The results indicate that IL-31 recognizes its receptor complex through two different binding sites, and we propose a three-dimensional model for IL-31.

https://openalex.org/W2000688771,"The aim of the study was to identify as potential therapeutic targets specific molecular alterations in tumor cells recognized by the immune system. To identify such targets, we analyzed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptidomes of human melanoma cells by 2-dimensional nano-HPLC/mass spectrometry and tested the immunological significance of the peptides by ex vivo ELISpot assays with lymphocytes from melanoma patients. The peptide SQNPRFYHK was identified as derived from the regulator of the nuclear corepressor complex (NCoR) G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS-2) and to be differentially unmethyl-ated, monomethylated or asymmetrically dimethylated at the arginine. The methylation state was specifically recognized by the immune system in that only the monomethylated variant induced T-cell responses and significantly stronger responses in patients than in healthy controls. The methylations were confirmed with synthetic analogues and in vitro radiolabeling assays with recombinant GPS-2 and synthetic peptides. The immunity of the 3 variants of GPS-2 was tested in T-cell assays with T lymphocytes of melanoma patients compared with healthy donors. The results show for the first time that GPS-2 is differentially methylated at a site that lacks known methylation motifs and that the methylation state is detected by the immune system.—Jarmalavicius, S., Trefzer, U., Walden, P.
