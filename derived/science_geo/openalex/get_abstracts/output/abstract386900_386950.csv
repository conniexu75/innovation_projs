https://openalex.org/W2105842551,"To identify new susceptibility loci for psoriasis, we undertook a genome-wide association study of 594,224 SNPs in 2,622 individuals with psoriasis and 5,667 controls. We identified associations at eight previously unreported genomic loci. Seven loci harbored genes with recognized immune functions (IL28RA, REL, IFIH1, ERAP1, TRAF3IP2, NFKBIA and TYK2). These associations were replicated in 9,079 European samples (six loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ and two loci with a combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁷). We also report compelling evidence for an interaction between the HLA-C and ERAP1 loci (combined P = 6.95 × 10⁻⁶). ERAP1 plays an important role in MHC class I peptide processing. ERAP1 variants only influenced psoriasis susceptibility in individuals carrying the HLA-C risk allele. Our findings implicate pathways that integrate epidermal barrier dysfunction with innate and adaptive immune dysregulation in psoriasis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2157076525,"Many mutations confer one or more toxic function(s) on copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) that impair motor neuron viability and cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Using a conformation-specific antibody that detects misfolded SOD1 (C4F6), we found that oxidized wild-type SOD1 and mutant SOD1 share a conformational epitope that is not present in normal wild-type SOD1. In a subset of human sporadic ALS (SALS) cases, motor neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord were markedly C4F6 immunoreactive, indicating that an aberrant wild-type SOD1 species was present. Recombinant, oxidized wild-type SOD1 and wild-type SOD1 immunopurified from SALS tissues inhibited kinesin-based fast axonal transport in a manner similar to that of FALS-linked mutant SOD1. Our findings suggest that wild-type SOD1 can be pathogenic in SALS and identify an SOD1-dependent pathogenic mechanism common to FALS and SALS."

https://openalex.org/W2039684583,"Small RNAs of the piRNA (Piwi-associated RNA) class have various functions in the germline — repressing transposable elements, maintaining germline stem cells and promoting genome stability. Rouget et al. have now uncovered a function for piRNAs outside the germline, in the fruit fly embryo. Specifically, piRNAs that are complementary to a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of an mRNA for the embryonic posterior morphogen Nanos facilitate adenylation of the mRNA and its subsequent decay. Without piRNAs, Nanos accumulates and developmental defects result. Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs) are small RNAs with several functions in the germline, such as repressing transposable elements and helping to maintain germline stem cells. Now, a function for piRNAs has been discovered outside the germline, in the fruitfly embryo. Specifically, piRNAs are required for the decay of the messenger RNA encoding the posterior morphogen Nanos. When piRNA-induced regulation is impaired, this mRNA is stabilized and developmental defects ensue. Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs), a specific class of 24- to 30-nucleotide-long RNAs produced by the Piwi-type of Argonaute proteins, have a specific germline function in repressing transposable elements. This repression is thought to involve heterochromatin formation and transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing1,2,3,4,5,6. The piRNA pathway has other essential functions in germline stem cell maintenance7 and in maintaining germline DNA integrity8,9,10. Here we uncover an unexpected function of the piRNA pathway in the decay of maternal messenger RNAs and in translational repression in the early embryo. A subset of maternal mRNAs is degraded in the embryo at the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In Drosophila, maternal mRNA degradation depends on the RNA-binding protein Smaug and the deadenylase CCR411,12,13, as well as the zygotic expression of a microRNA cluster14. Using mRNA encoding the embryonic posterior morphogen Nanos (Nos) as a paradigm to study maternal mRNA decay, we found that CCR4-mediated deadenylation of nos depends on components of the piRNA pathway including piRNAs complementary to a specific region in the nos 3′ untranslated region. Reduced deadenylation when piRNA-induced regulation is impaired correlates with nos mRNA stabilization and translational derepression in the embryo, resulting in head development defects. Aubergine, one of the Argonaute proteins in the piRNA pathway, is present in a complex with Smaug, CCR4, nos mRNA and piRNAs that target the nos 3′ untranslated region, in the bulk of the embryo. We propose that piRNAs and their associated proteins act together with Smaug to recruit the CCR4 deadenylation complex to specific mRNAs, thus promoting their decay. Because the piRNAs involved in this regulation are produced from transposable elements, this identifies a direct developmental function for transposable elements in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2060035717,"The lifetime prevalence (∼16%) and the economic burden ($100 billion annually) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) make it one of the most common and debilitating neurobiological illnesses. To date, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of MDD have not been identified. Here we use whole-genome expression profiling of postmortem tissue and show significantly increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1, encoded by DUSP1, but hereafter called MKP-1) in the hippocampal subfields of subjects with MDD compared to matched controls. MKP-1, also known as dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1), is a member of a family of proteins that dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues and thereby serves as a key negative regulator of the MAPK cascade, a major signaling pathway involved in neuronal plasticity, function and survival. We tested the role of altered MKP-1 expression in rat and mouse models of depression and found that increased hippocampal MKP-1 expression, as a result of stress or viral-mediated gene transfer, causes depressive behaviors. Conversely, chronic antidepressant treatment normalizes stress-induced MKP-1 expression and behavior, and mice lacking MKP-1 are resilient to stress. These postmortem and preclinical studies identify MKP-1 as a key factor in MDD pathophysiology and as a new target for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2033342396,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease that is distinct from other chronic arthritides and which is frequently accompanied by psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) and seronegativity for rheumatoid factor. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 609 German individuals with PsA (cases) and 990 controls with replication in 6 European cohorts including a total of 5,488 individuals. We replicated PsA associations at HLA-C and IL12B and identified a new association at TRAF3IP2 (rs13190932, P = 8.56 × 10⁻¹⁷). TRAF3IP2 was also associated with PsV in a German cohort including 2,040 individuals (rs13190932, P = 1.95 × 10⁻³). Sequencing of the exons of TRAF3IP2 identified a coding variant (p.Asp10Asn, rs33980500) as the most significantly associated SNP (P = 1.13 × 10⁻²⁰, odds ratio = 1.95). Functional assays showed reduced binding of this TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6, suggesting altered modulation of immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a new and shared pathway for PsA and PsV."
https://openalex.org/W2020906240,"Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and chronic inflammation, the most common form of which is psoriasis vulgaris (PsV). We present a genome-wide association analysis of 2,339,118 SNPs in 472 PsV cases and 1,146 controls from Germany, with follow-up of the 147 most significant SNPs in 2,746 PsV cases and 4,140 controls from three independent replication panels. We identified an association at TRAF3IP2 on 6q21 and genotyped two SNPs at this locus in two additional replication panels (the combined discovery and replication panels consisted of 6,487 cases and 8,037 controls; combined P = 2.36 × 10⁻¹⁰ for rs13210247 and combined P = 1.24 × 10⁻¹⁶ for rs33980500). About 15% of psoriasis cases develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA). A stratified analysis of our datasets including only PsA cases (1,922 cases compared to 8,037 controls, P = 4.57 × 10⁻¹² for rs33980500) suggested that TRAF3IP2 represents a shared susceptibility for PsV and PsA. TRAF3IP2 encodes a protein involved in IL-17 signaling and which interacts with members of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family."
https://openalex.org/W2038309633,"We carried out a meta-analysis of two recent psoriasis genome-wide association studies with a combined discovery sample of 1,831 affected individuals (cases) and 2,546 controls. One hundred and two loci selected based on P value rankings were followed up in a three-stage replication study including 4,064 cases and 4,685 controls from Michigan, Toronto, Newfoundland and Germany. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified three new susceptibility loci, including one at NOS2 (rs4795067, combined P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹), one at FBXL19 (rs10782001, combined P = 9 × 10⁻¹⁰) and one near PSMA6-NFKBIA (rs12586317, combined P = 2 × 10⁻⁸).

We identified six new susceptibility loci associated with psoriasis in the Chinese study containing the candidate genes ERAP1, PTTG1, CSMD1, GJB2, SERPINB8 and ZNF816A (combined P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and replicated one locus, 5q33.1 (TNIP1-ANXA6), previously reported (combined P = 3.8 × 10⁻²¹) in the European studies. Two of these loci showed evidence for association in the German study at ZNF816A and GJB2 with P = 3.6 × 10⁻³ and P = 7.9 × 10⁻³, respectively. ERAP1 and ZNF816A were associated with type 1 (early onset) psoriasis in the Chinese Han population (test for heterogeneity P = 6.5 × 10⁻³ and P = 1.5 × 10⁻³, respectively). Comparisons with the results of previous GWAS of psoriasis highlight the heterogeneity of disease susceptibility between the Chinese and European populations. Our study identifies new genetic susceptibility factors and suggests new biological pathways in psoriasis."

https://openalex.org/W2025327530,"Adipose tissue-derived adipokines play important roles in controlling systemic insulin sensitivity and energy balance. Our recent efforts to identify novel metabolic mediators produced by adipose tissue have led to the discovery of a highly conserved family of secreted proteins, designated as C1q/TNF-related proteins 1–10 (CTRP1 to -10). However, physiological functions regulated by CTRPs are largely unknown. Here we provide the first <i>in vivo</i> functional characterization of CTRP3. We show that circulating levels of CTRP3 are inversely correlated with leptin levels; CTRP3 increases with fasting, decreases in diet-induced obese mice with high leptin levels, and increases in leptin-deficient <i>ob/ob</i> mice. A modest 3-fold elevation of plasma CTRP3 levels by recombinant protein administration is sufficient to lower glucose levels in normal and insulin-resistant <i>ob/ob</i> mice, without altering insulin or adiponectin levels. The glucose-lowering effect in mice is linked to activation of the Akt signaling pathway in liver and a marked suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Consistent with its effects in mice, CTRP3 acts directly and independently of insulin to regulate gluconeogenesis in cultured hepatocytes. In humans, alternative splicing generates two circulating CTRP3 isoforms differing in size and glycosylation pattern. The two human proteins form hetero-oligomers, an association that does not require interdisulfide bond formation and appears to protect the longer isoform from proteolytic cleavage. Recombinant human CTRP3 also reduces glucose output in hepatocytes by suppressing gluconeogenic enzyme expression. This study provides the first functional evidence linking CTRP3 to hepatic glucose metabolism and establishes CTRP3 as a novel adipokine."
https://openalex.org/W2093597508,"Sensory inputs frequently converge on the brain in a spatially organized manner, often with overlapping inputs to multiple target neurons. Whether the responses of target neurons with common inputs become decorrelated depends on the contribution of local circuit interactions. We addressed this issue in the olfactory system using newly generated transgenic mice that express channelrhodopsin-2 in all of the olfactory sensory neurons. By selectively stimulating individual glomeruli with light, we identified mitral/tufted cells that receive common input (sister cells). Sister cells had highly correlated responses to odors, as measured by average spike rates, but their spike timing in relation to respiration was differentially altered. In contrast, non-sister cells correlated poorly on both of these measures. We suggest that sister mitral/tufted cells carry two different channels of information: average activity representing shared glomerular input and phase-specific information that refines odor representations and is substantially independent for sister cells."

https://openalex.org/W2123179543,"Background In 2010 Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), again devastated honey bee colonies in the USA, indicating that the problem is neither diminishing nor has it been resolved. Many CCD investigations, using sensitive genome-based methods, have found small RNA bee viruses and the microsporidia, Nosema apis and N. ceranae in healthy and collapsing colonies alike with no single pathogen firmly linked to honey bee losses. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Mass spectrometry-based proteomics (MSP) to identify and quantify thousands of proteins from healthy and collapsing bee colonies. MSP revealed two unreported RNA viruses in North American honey bees, Varroa destructor-1 virus and Kakugo virus, and identified an invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV) (Iridoviridae) associated with CCD colonies. Prevalence of IIV significantly discriminated among strong, failing, and collapsed colonies. In addition, bees in failing colonies contained not only IIV, but also Nosema. Co-occurrence of these microbes consistently marked CCD in (1) bees from commercial apiaries sampled across the U.S. in 2006–2007, (2) bees sequentially sampled as the disorder progressed in an observation hive colony in 2008, and (3) bees from a recurrence of CCD in Florida in 2009. The pathogen pairing was not observed in samples from colonies with no history of CCD, namely bees from Australia and a large, non-migratory beekeeping business in Montana. Laboratory cage trials with a strain of IIV type 6 and Nosema ceranae confirmed that co-infection with these two pathogens was more lethal to bees than either pathogen alone. Conclusions/Significance These findings implicate co-infection by IIV and Nosema with honey bee colony decline, giving credence to older research pointing to IIV, interacting with Nosema and mites, as probable cause of bee losses in the USA, Europe, and Asia. We next need to characterize the IIV and Nosema that we detected and develop management practices to reduce honey bee losses."
https://openalex.org/W2112292482,"Sclerostin is expressed by osteocytes and has catabolic effects on bone. It has been shown to antagonize bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and/or Wnt activity, although at present the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Consistent with previous findings, Sclerostin opposed direct Wnt3a-induced but not direct BMP7-induced responses when both ligand and antagonist were provided exogenously to cells. However, we found that when both proteins are expressed in the same cell, sclerostin can antagonize BMP signaling directly by inhibiting BMP7 secretion. Sclerostin interacts with both the BMP7 mature domain and pro-domain, leading to intracellular retention and proteasomal degradation of BMP7. Analysis of sclerostin knock-out mice revealed an inhibitory action of sclerostin on Wnt signaling in both osteoblasts and osteocytes in cortical and cancellous bones. BMP7 signaling was predominantly inhibited by sclerostin in osteocytes of the calcaneus and the cortical bone of the tibia. Our results suggest that sclerostin exerts its potent bone catabolic effects by antagonizing Wnt signaling in a paracrine and autocrine manner and antagonizing BMP signaling selectively in the osteocytes that synthesize simultaneously both sclerostin and BMP7 proteins.

Canonical Wnt signaling has been described to play a crucial role in several bone mass disorders. Wnt proteins transduce their signals via seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors of the frizzled family and lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5/6 (LRP5/6), thereby controlling the stability of cytoplasmic β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin forms a complex with APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), axin, GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), and CK1 (casein kinase I). This complex facilitates phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. In the presence of Wnt ligands, this complex dissociates, and β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus, where it forms complexes with TCF/Lef1 transcription factors and initiates transcription of target genes (16.Nusse R.

To gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms by which sclerostin antagonizes bone formation, we investigated the inhibitory effects of sclerostin on Wnt and BMP signaling. In addition to its negative effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we unexpectedly observed that sclerostin inhibits bone formation by mitigating the secretion of BMP7 in osteocytes. Our results reconcile previously published contradictory observations on direct inhibitory effects or lack thereof of sclerostin on responses elicited by different BMP family members. SAOS-2 human osteosarcoma cells, HEK293 and HEK293T cells, and C2C12 cells stably transfected with the BRE-luciferase (BRE-luc) reporter (30.Zilberberg L. ten Dijke P. Sakai L.Y. Rifkin D.B.

Oschkinat H. Mueller T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 380: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For BIAcore measurements, rec.BMP7 was obtained from Wyeth, LRP6 was purchased from R&D Systems, the extracellular domain of IL-4R was obtained from Walter Sebald (Biocenter, University Wuerzburg), and the control Fab fragment AbD09095 was obtained from AbD (Morphosys Inc.). MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Macherery-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of human SOST, BMP7, and GAPDH were analyzed using the following primers: SOST, 5′-GAGCAGCCATCACAAACTCA-3′ and 5′-CAAGTCCCACGTGGAAGAAT-3′; BMP7, 5′-CCACCTGTAATCCCAGCACT-3′ and 5′-GACAAAGACCAGAGGGTCCA-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC-3′ and 5′-ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT-3′. All conditions were measured in duplicate, and Taqman PCRs were performed using the StepOne Plus™ real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Gene transcription levels were determined with the comparative ΔΔCt method using GAPDH as a reference, and the non-stimulated condition was set to 1. Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent, with 0.1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase, together with the indicated expression plasmids or empty control plasmid (pcDNA3.1), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were allowed to recover for 18 h, followed by serum starvation and stimulation with the indicated ligands for 18 h. Afterward, conditioned medium (CM) was collected, and cells were washed with PBS and lysed. C2C12-BRE-luc cells were stimulated with CM for 18 h and lysed. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions using β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate, and representative experiments are shown. Cells were transfected with respective expression constructs or empty control plasmid (pcDNA3.1) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The following day, the cells were stimulated with the indicated ligands for 18 h and lysed. For Western blot, ubiquitination, and co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were allowed to grow to 70% confluence, and serum concentration was reduced to 0.5% overnight. For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml). Cell lysates (400 μg of total protein) or CM (50 ml) were incubated with 1 μg/μl anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibody for 1.5 h at 4 °C. 0.5 μg/μl protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for an additional 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were extensively washed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and eluted protein complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (38.Scharpfenecker M. van Dinther M. Liu Z. van Bezooijen R.L. Zhao Q. Pukac L. Löwik C.W. ten Dijke P. J. Cell. Sci. 2007; 120: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). C-terminal Smad phosphorylation was detected using an antibody specifically recognizing phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (P-Smad1), which has been described previously (39.Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engström U. Heldin C.H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The linker phosphorylation of Smads through GSK3β or MAPK signaling was investigated through the use of P-SmadGSK3 and P-SmadMAPK antibodies obtained from the DeRobertis laboratory (35.Fuentealba L.C. Eivers E. Ikeda A. Hurtado C. Kuroda H. Pera E.M. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 2007; 131: 980-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). BMP7 expression was investigated with a BMP7 antibody kindly provided by Hicham Alaoui (Stryker Biotech, Hopkinton, MA). SOST-N-FLAG expression and LRP5-N-Myc expression were detected using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. Pro-BMP7-HA and pro-TGF-β-HA were detected via an anti-HA (12CA5) antibody (Roche Applied Science). Ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (40.Schimmel J. Larsen K.M. Matic I. van Hagen M. Cox J. Mann M. Andersen J.S. Vertegaal A.C. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2107-2122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Myc-His-ubiquitin was detected through a clone HIS-1 antibody (Sigma). Equal loading was confirmed using an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) or anti-Smad1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Western blotting was performed using secondary goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 and goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (LI-COR) using the Odyssey Scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions. KS483 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and grown until confluent. Cells were stimulated with the indicated ligands in 0.2% FBS-containing α-MEM. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured kinetically after another 4 days of culture. Measurements were corrected for protein content using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunofluorescence staining, KS483 cells were grown on coverslips overnight and stimulated the next day for 3 h with the indicated ligands. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, quenched with 20 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Afterward, cells were incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min, followed by incubation with anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) suitably diluted in blocking solution for 1 h. After washing, labeled secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 and goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were used for detection. Nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specimens were visualized with an Olympus IX51 microscope at ×100 magnification using the cellF Soft Imaging System (Olympus). A knock-out allele of Sost was generated via KOMP (line VG10069). The entire protein-coding sequence of Sost was replaced with LacZ and a floxed Neo cassette, in a manner such that the initiating ATG of Sost became the initiating methionine of LacZ. All of the details regarding the generation of this allele can be found at the Velocigene Web site. SostLacZ/+ mice were generated using clone VG10069A-G10 (supplemental Fig. S1). This allele has been tested, and it phenocopies other published knock-out lines of Sost (supplemental Fig. S2). Dissected bone tissues from 4-month-old female sclerostin KO mice or wild type mice were fixed overnight in 10% paraformaldehyde, pH 6.8, at 4 °C; decalcified using 10% EDTA, pH 7.4; and processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning. Before blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 40% methanol, 1% H2O2 in PBS, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated using xylene and a descending alcohol series. Antigen retrieval using Proteinase K (2.5 μl in 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10 min at 37 °C was followed by three washes with 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% Tween 20 (TNT). Thereafter, slides were incubated with 5% species-specific serum (Dako) in 0.5% Boehringer blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in TNT for 60 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the following antibodies diluted in 0.5% Boehringer milk powder/TNT were applied overnight at 4 °C: rabbit anti-BMP7 antibody (1:100) (Stryker), mouse anti-β-catenin antibody (1:100) (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-PS1 antibody directed against C-terminal phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (1:50) (39.Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engström U. Heldin C.H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and goat anti-sclerostin antibody (1:400) (R&D Systems). A species-specific biotinylated anti-IgG antibody (1:300 diluted in 0.5% Boehringer milk powder/TNT) followed for 45 min at 37 °C. Incubation with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:200 in 0.5% Boehringer milk powder/TNT) for 30 min at 37 °C preceded and followed an amplification step using biotinylated tyramine. Stainings were carried out using amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (Sigma) and Mayer's hematoxylin (Merck) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A water-based mounting solution was applied, and stainings were visualized with an Olympus IX51 microscope using the cellF Soft Imaging System (Olympus). To discriminate cartilage from bone, Alcian blue staining was performed. Histology sections were incubated in 1% Alcian blue 8GX (pH 2.5) in 3% acetic acid (Merck) for 15 min before rinsing the slides with distilled water. Counterstaining with toluylene red (Merck) was performed for 1 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect apoptosis, a Dead End Colorimetric TUNEL system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total positive osteocytes in the indicated areas were counted manually, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated. LRP6, BMP7, IL-4R, and AbD09095 proteins were biotinylated using NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according the manufacturer's recommendation. To minimize inactivation due to multiple biotinylation, the molar stoichiometry of protein to NHS-LC-Biotin was kept at 1:1. The surface of a BIAcore CM5 biosensor was first activated via NHS/EDC, and streptavidin was subsequently coupled to the activated surface to a final density of ∼3000 resonance units. Biotinylated proteins were then immobilized to a surface density of 200 (BMP7) to 550 resonance units (LRP6). Due to the high positive charge of sclerostin, we used IL-4R, which is highly negatively charged, and the anti-sclerostin Fab antibody AbD09095 to establish experimental conditions that show no nonspecific binding of sclerostin (used as analyte) to the biosensor surface. Different running buffer conditions with varying salt concentrations were tested, showing that upon the addition of 300 mm NaCl no interaction with the charge-complementary IL-4R is observed, and at the same time, binding to the anti-sclerostin antibody AbD09095 is unaltered. Interaction of sclerostin and variants with BMP7 and LRP6 was then measured by perfusing the biosensor using six different concentrations for each analyte. All experiments were performed using HBS300 buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) as running buffer. The association phase was monitored by injecting the analyte for 300 s at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The dissociation phase was initiated by perfusing only HBS300 buffer and monitored for 200 s. The biosensor surface was regenerated by perfusing a short (60-s) pulse of buffer containing 6 m urea, 1 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m acetic acid. Sensorgrams were evaluated using the software BIAevaluation version 2.4. Due to the fast association and dissociation kinetics, binding coefficients were deduced from the dose dependence of equilibrium binding. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. For statistical comparison of two samples, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between means. All relevant comparisons were considered to be significantly different (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Experiments were performed at least three times, and representative results are shown. Previously, we reported that sclerostin antagonizes BMP-stimulated bone formation, not by direct inhibitory effects on exogenous BMPs but by targeting the Wnt pathway. Sclerostin was found to share many characteristics with the Wnt antagonist dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in antagonizing BMP-stimulated osteoblast differentiation and direct Wnt-induced responses (32.van Bezooijen R.L. Svensson J.P. Eefting D. Visser A. van der Horst G. Karperien M. Quax P.H. Vrieling H. Papapoulos S.E. ten Dijke P. Löwik C.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Results from others had indicated that sclerostin (and its close homolog Sostdc1) may target BMP signaling directly by sequestering BMPs and thereby preventing receptor binding (9.Avsian-Kretchmer O.

Some of these experiments were performed not by stimulating cells with exogenous ligands but instead by transfecting expression plasmids or by mRNA injections (32.van Bezooijen R.L. Svensson J.P.

https://openalex.org/W1995374106,"The current model for base excision repair (BER) involves two general sub-pathways termed single-nucleotide BER and long patch BER that are distinguished by their repair patch sizes and the enzymes/co-factors involved. Both sub-pathways involve a series of sequential steps from initiation to completion of repair. The BER sub-pathways are designed to sequester the various intermediates, passing them along from one step to the next without allowing these toxic molecules to trigger cell cycle arrest, necrotic cell death, or apoptosis. Although a variety of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions are known for the BER intermediates and enzymes/co-factors, the molecular mechanisms accounting for step-to-step coordination are not well understood. In the present study we designed an in vitro assay to explore the question of whether there is a channeling or “hand-off” of the repair intermediates during BER in vitro. The results show that when BER enzymes are pre-bound to the initial single-nucleotide BER intermediate, the DNA is channeled from apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 to DNA polymerase β and then to DNA ligase. In the long patch BER subpathway, where the 5′-end of the incised strand is blocked, the intermediate after DNA polymerase β gap filling is not channeled to the subsequent enzyme, flap endonuclease 1. Instead, flap endonuclease 1 must recognize and bind to the intermediate in competition with other molecules.

Mammalian genomic DNA is constantly exposed to a variety of physical and chemical agents, including ultraviolet light and ionization radiation, alkylating molecules, and endogenous reactive oxygen species that accumulate in cells due to environmental stress and natural metabolic processes (1Lindahl T.

From biochemical and structural studies, a common theme emerged that the individual steps in BER are sequentially ordered. For example, it is only after damaged base removal that the AP site-containing DNA strand is recognized by APE1. DNA polymerase β then processes the gapped intermediate, generating the substrate for DNA ligase. Thus, to prevent exposure of the intermediates to harmful nuclease activities, recombination events, or cell death signaling, it appears that the BER enzymes must coordinate with one another to efficiently receive the DNA substrates and pass the resulting DNA products along to the next enzyme in the sequence, just as a baton is passed from one individual to the next in a relay (30Mol C.D.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that DNA can be channeled from one step to the next during BER. Steps in a reconstituted SN BER system were examined including APE1 strand incision, DNA synthesis, and dRP removal mediated by pol β, and ligation was mediated either by DNA ligase I or XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex. This was accomplished by preloading the enzymes onto BER substrates and then conducting the repair incubation in the presence of a trap such that any free enzyme or enzymes released from the DNA substrates during repair could no longer participate in the reactions. In the LP BER sub-pathway, we examined channeling of the DNA substrate from the DNA synthesis step to the FEN1 cleavage step. Our results show that the BER intermediates of the SN BER sub-pathway could be channeled from APE1 to pol β and to DNA ligase. In contrast, in the LP BER sub-pathway, the DNA product after gap filling by pol β was not channeled to FEN1. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligodeoxynucleotides were from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR) and The Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX).

The protein concentrations of enzyme samples specified below were measured by routine protein assays; the active fraction in each case corresponded to ∼50%. Preparation of the 3′- or 5′-end-labeled dRP lyase substrate was as described previously (26Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For the APE1 incision activity, the 32P-labeled duplex DNA was pretreated with UDG to generate an AP site. For the preparation of the 5′-end-labeled substrate, dephosphorylated 15-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTG CAG CTG ATG CGC-3′) was phosphorylated with Optikinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A 34-mer (5′-GTA CCC GGG GAT CCG TAC GGC GCA TCA GCT GCA G-3′) template was then annealed with 32P-labeled 15-mer upstream and 19-mer (5′-pUGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′) downstream oligonucleotides by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min and allowing the solution to slowly cool to 25 °C. In some cases the 19-mer oligonucleotide was also 3′-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP before annealing. The 32P-labeled duplex DNA (labeled either at the 5′-end, 3′-end, or both ends) was treated with UDG to generate the 5′-dRP-containing single-nucleotide gapped substrate. In some experiments a 35-mer duplex DNA was used with uracil opposite guanine at position 15 in one strand and with the 3′-end blocked with cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine). In those experiments DNA was pretreated with UDG and APE1 to generate a single-nucleotide-gapped substrate with 3′-OH and 5′-dRP flap at the gap margins, and [α-32P]dCTP was used as radiolabel. To measure the incision activity of APE1 in the presence of a DNA trap, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 nm UDG-pretreated 32P-labeled or 40 μm unlabeled DNA trap (a synthetic AP site-containing oligonucleotide DNA with tetrahydrofuran (THF), mimicking the AP site) and 30 nm APE1 was assembled on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 40 μm DNA trap, 5 mm MgCl2, or 10 nm UDG-pretreated 5′-end 32P-labeled DNA substrate, 5 mm MgCl2 and transferring the reaction mixture to 30 °C. In some experiments when both incision and gap-filling DNA synthesis reactions were performed simultaneously, the reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of 40 μm DNA trap, 25 μm dCTP, and 5 mm MgCl2 or 10 nm UDG-pretreated 5′-end 32P-labeled DNA substrate, 25 μm dCTP, and 5 mm MgCl2. In Fig. 5, APE1 and pol β concentrations were 30 and 40 nm, respectively. Samples were withdrawn at 10 s and mixed with gel-loading dye solution. The mixtures were then heated at 75 °C for 2 min, and DNA products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. Imaging and data analysis were performed with phosphorimaging and ImageQuant™ software. To measure the dRP lyase activity of pol β in the presence of a DNA trap, a reaction mixture containing 60 nm pol β, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 nm 3′-end 32P-labeled DNA substrate or 10 μm unlabeled DNA trap was assembled on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 10 μm DNA trap or 20 nm 3′-end 32P-labeled DNA substrate and transferring the reaction mixture to 30 °C. Samples were withdrawn at 10 and 20 s, and the reaction products were stabilized by the addition of freshly prepared 20 mm NaBH4. Reaction mixtures then were put on ice and incubated 20 min. After this incubation an equal volume of gel-loading dye solution was added, and the mixtures were heated at 75 °C for 2 min. Reaction products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. Imaging and data analysis were performed with phosphorimaging and ImageQuant™ software. To measure the gap-filling DNA synthesis activity of pol β in the presence of a DNA trap, reaction mixtures containing the same components as described for the dRP lyase assay were assembled with some exceptions; the substrate was 5′-end-labeled, instead of 3′-end-labeled, and 2 μm dCTP and 5 mm MgCl2 were added to initiate the reaction along with the DNA trap. After incubation, an equal volume of gel-loading dye was added, and the reaction mixtures were heated at 75 °C for 2 min. Reaction products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. Imaging and data analysis were performed with phosphorimaging and ImageQuant™ software. To perform combined gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation reactions in the presence of a DNA trap, a reaction mixture containing 60 nm pol β, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 nm UDG/APE1-pretreated gapped DNA, or 10 μm unlabeled DNA trap was assembled on ice. The reaction was initiated by transferring the reaction mixture to 30 °C and adding a mixture of 10 μm unlabeled DNA trap or 20 nm UDG/APE1-pretreated gapped DNA substrate, 2.6 μm [α-32P]dCTP, and 5 mm MgCl2. Samples were withdrawn at 10 s, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of gel-loading dye solution. After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed as above. However, in those cases when gap-filling, dRP lyase, and ligation steps were performed in combination, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NAD, and 200 nm DNA ligase I. To examine gap-filling DNA synthesis, FEN1 cleavage, and ligation reactions in the presence of a DNA trap, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 nm APE1-pretreated THF-containing DNA or 10 μm unlabeled DNA trap, and 60 nm pol β and/or 25 nm FEN1 was assembled on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 10 μm unlabeled DNA trap or 20 nm APE1-pretreated THF-containing DNA substrate, 2.6 μm [α-32P]dCTP, 20 μm each dATP, dGTP, and TTP, and 5 mm MgCl2. When all three steps (gap-filling DNA synthesis, FEN1 cleavage, and ligation) were conducted in combination or in the same sample, a reaction mixture containing 60 nm pol β, 25 nm FEN1, and 200 nm DNA ligase I was incubated with DNA substrate or the trap as above. All incubations were at 30 °C. Samples were withdrawn at 10 s, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of gel-loading dye solution. After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed as above. However, when gap-filling, FEN1 cleavage, and ligation steps were performed in combination, the reaction mixtures were also supplemented with 4 mm ATP and 200 nm DNA ligase I. Single-nucleotide gap filling reactions utilized the same UDG-processed nicked substrate that was prepared for dRP lyase assay reaction mixtures. In these present reactions, however, the primer strand was 5′-end 32P-labeled. Single turnover assays (E > S) were performed to measure insertion of dCTP (i.e. templating dG in the gap) using a KinTek Model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow system (Austin, TX). Unless noted otherwise, all concentrations refer to the final reaction concentrations after mixing. The final concentrations were 100 nm DNA, 500 nm pol β, 100 μm dCTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. After various time periods at 15 °C, reactions were quenched with 0.25 m EDTA. Quenched reactions were mixed with formamide dye, heated (5 min at 95 °C), and separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Substrate and product bands were quantified after exposure to a phosphor screen using ImageQuant™ software. Time courses were fitted to a rising exponential, yielding the rate of single nucleotide insertion. The first-order rate constant is equivalent to the insertion rate (kpol). Steady-state dRP lyase reactions used the 3′-end 32P-labeled gapped DNA with a 5′-dRP group in the gap. The preparation of this substrate is described above. Reactions were initiated with pol β (50, 100, or 150 nm) and 500 nm labeled DNA substrate in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. After various time periods at 15 °C, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and quenched with an equal volume of freshly prepared 0.4 m NaBH4. Quenched reactions were mixed with formamide dye, heated, and resolved on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Bands were visualized by exposure to a phosphorimaging screen and analyzed using ImageQuant™ software. Single turnover dRP lyase reactions utilized the 3′-end 32P-labeled gapped DNA with a 5′-dRP group in the gap. The preparation of this substrate is described above. Time courses were performed using the chemical quench-flow system. In these assays, pol β and pretreated 3′-end 32P-labeled DNA were rapidly mixed for various times at 15 °C, and the reactions quenched by collection into tubes containing freshly prepared 0.4 m NaBH4. The final concentrations were 500 nm pol β, 100 nm DNA substrate, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Quench flow parameters were input manually to obtain the desired time points when quenching occurred in the collection tubes, thereby correcting for the time that each reaction mixture spent in the exit loop. This was necessary due to the volatile nature of the high concentration of NaBH4. The DNA substrate and product were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of linear polyacrylamide carrier (10–15 μg) and re-suspended in formamide gel loading buffer. After brief heating (5 min at 95 °C), the DNA was resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and quantified using ImageQuant™ software. Time courses were fitted to a rising exponential with a base-line term. Biochemical and structural studies of BER enzymes suggested that BER intermediates could be passed sequentially from one enzyme to the next in a coordinated fashion, in contrast to a model where all substrates and products are in equilibrium with free enzymes. To examine the hypothesis that the product of one step can be channeled as substrate to the next enzyme in the SN BER pathway, we studied AP site incision, gap filling, removal of the 5′-dRP group, and ligation. These steps are mediated by APE1, pol β, and DNA ligase I, respectively, and were studied here either individually or in combination after preloading the enzyme(s) onto DNA and initiating the reactions in the presence of a trap. The design for these “single turnover” repair experiments is summarized in Scheme 1. Either an individual BER enzyme or a mixture of enzymes was first preincubated with the respective substrate DNA, and then the enzyme-substrate complex was mixed with a DNA trap plus an initiator for the reaction(s). After a brief incubation, products were recovered by gel electrophoresis and quantified. Scheme 1 illustrates the different types of incubations used; type 1 involved individual BER enzymes and steps as shown, and types 2 and 3 involved mixtures of BER enzymes and more than one reaction product. In the preincubations, the substrate DNA concentrations were in the range of the dissociation constants for the respective enzymes (10–20 nm). The reaction products observed in the presence of trap resulted from turnover of enzyme that was bound during the preincubation. The incubations were for 10 s, the shortest period we could manage using manual methods but much longer than the catalytic rate constants for each enzyme. In LP BER, the DNA synthesis reaction may occur as a series of single-nucleotide gap filling steps in conjunction with FEN1 5′-tailoring (38Liu Y. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Prasad R. Hou E.W. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3665-3674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also examined whether FEN1 can preload onto its substrate, conduct flap removal, and then pass the product to next step, gap-filling DNA synthesis. To study the APE1-mediated BER step, the reaction mixtures were assembled and incubated as shown in Scheme 1. The 32P-labeled DNA containing a lone uracil residue at position 15 was pretreated with UDG to generate an AP site-containing substrate. A 34-bp unlabeled DNA containing a synthetic AP site (THF) was used to trap any unbound APE1 in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was assembled on ice and initiated by transferring the reaction mixture to 30 °C and adding a mixture of MgCl2 and ∼4000-fold excess DNA trap. In another set of control reaction mixtures, APE1 was preincubated with trap first, and the reaction was initiated as above. The results showed that APE1 prebound to the DNA substrate was able to incise the AP site (Fig. 1a); unbound APE1 in solution was quenched by the trap, as no increase in product formation was observed with a 20-s incubation (not shown). In contrast, when APE1 was first preincubated with DNA trap and then the reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of DNA substrate and MgCl2, very little product was observed. This indicated that the trap was able to capture almost all of APE1 in the reaction mixture before it could bind and incise DNA substrate (Fig. 1b). Under these conditions 22% of the substrate was converted to product. To study these two pol β-mediated BER steps, reaction mixtures were assembled and incubated for 10 and 20 s. To examine DNA synthesis, a 34-mer nicked DNA was first prepared by annealing 5′-end-labeled 15- and 19-mer oligonucleotides to a complementary 34-mer DNA strand. The 19-mer oligonucleotide contained a 5′-phosphorylated uracil nucleotide. This duplex DNA was pretreated with UDG, resulting in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA with 3′-OH and 5′-dRP groups at the gap margins, mimicking the APE1-incised BER intermediate. A 21-bp unlabeled gapped DNA was used to trap any unbound pol β in the reaction mixture. To examine use of this BER intermediate by pol β in the DNA synthesis step, the reaction mixture was assembled on ice, and the reaction was initiated by transferring the tubes to 30 °C and adding a mixture of dCTP, MgCl2, and a ∼500-fold excess of trap. In another set of reaction mixtures, pol β was preincubated with the trap first, and the reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of DNA substrate, dCTP, and MgCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and samples were withdrawn for products analysis. The results showed that pol β pre-bound to the DNA substrate was able to incorporate one nucleotide (Fig. 2a, lane 2), i.e. incorporation of dCMP into DNA; unbound pol β in solution was trapped completely as no further increase in dCMP incorporation was observed with a 20-s incubation (Fig. 2a, lane 3). In contrast, when pol β was first preincubated with the trap and then the reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of DNA substrate, dCTP, and MgCl2, no incorporation of dCMP was observed. This indicated that the enzyme was productively bound during the preincubation and that the trap was able to capture all of the pol β in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2a, lanes 4 and 5). Under these conditions 25% of the"
https://openalex.org/W2169217573,"For many years, mRNA abundance has been used as the surrogate measure of gene expression in biological systems. However, recent genome-scale analyses in both bacteria and eukaryotes have revealed that mRNA levels correlate with steady-state protein abundance for only 50-70% of genes, indicating that translation and post-translation processes also play important roles in determining gene expression. What is not yet clear is whether dynamic processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, or response to environmental changes change the relationship between mRNA and protein abundance. Here, we describe a systems approach to interrogate promastigote-to-amastigote differentiation in the obligatory intracellular parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani. Our results indicate that regulation of mRNA levels plays a major role early in the differentiation process, while translation and post-translational regulation are more important in the latter part. In addition, it appears that the differentiation signal causes a transient global increase in the rate of protein synthesis, which is subsequently down-regulated by phosphorylation of α-subunit of translation initiation factor 2. Thus, Leishmania dynamically changes the relationship between mRNA and protein abundance as it adapts to new environmental circumstances. It is likely that similar mechanisms play a more important role than previously recognized in regulation of gene expression in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2085967485,"Although generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidases (Nox) is thought to be important for signal transduction in nonphagocytic cells, little is known of the role ROS plays in chondrogenesis. We therefore examined the possible contribution of ROS generation to chondrogenesis using both ATDC5 cells and primary chondrocytes derived from mouse embryos. The intracellular level of ROS was increased during the differentiation process, which was then blocked by treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. Expression of Nox1 and Nox2 was increased upon differentiation of ATDC5 cells and primary mouse chondrocytes, whereas that of Nox4, which was relatively high initially, was decreased gradually during chondrogenesis. In developing limb, Nox1 and Nox2 were highly expressed in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, Nox4 was highly expressed in proliferating chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Depletion of Nox2 or Nox4 expression by RNA interference blocked both ROS generation and differentiation of ATDC5 cells, whereas depletion of Nox1 had no such effect. We also found that ATDC5 cells depleted of Nox2 or Nox4 underwent apoptosis. Further, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation along with subsequent activation of ERK was observed in the cells. Finally, depletion of Nox2 or Nox4 inhibited the accumulation of proteoglycan in primary chondrocytes. Taken together, our data suggest that ROS generated by Nox2 or Nox4 are essential for survival and differentiation in the early stage of chondrogenesis."

Here we show that, within the niche of the striatum, the expression of a single transcription factor, Fezf2, is sufficient to generate corticofugal neurons from progenitors fated to become medium spiny neurons. This demonstrates that a specific population of cortical projection neurons can be directed to differentiate outside of the cortex by cell-autonomous signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1988274531,"Deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is closely associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the actions of β- and γ-secretases. In addition to Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma, deposition of Aβ in cerebral vessel walls, termed cerebral amyloid angiopathy, is observed in more than 80% of AD individuals. The mechanism for how Aβ accumulates in blood vessels remains largely unknown. In the present study, we show that brain endothelial cells expressed APP770, a differently spliced APP mRNA isoform from neuronal APP695, and produced Aβ40 and Aβ42. Furthermore, we found that the endothelial APP770 had sialylated core 1 type O-glycans. Interestingly, Ο-glycosylated APP770 was preferentially processed by both α- and β-cleavage and secreted into the media, suggesting that O-glycosylation and APP processing involved related pathways. By immunostaining human brain sections with an anti-APP770 antibody, we found that APP770 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Because we were able to detect O-glycosylated sAPP770β in human cerebrospinal fluid, this unique soluble APP770β has the potential to serve as a marker for cortical dementias such as AD and vascular dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2093081741,"The plant hormone ethylene plays important roles in growth and development. Ethylene is perceived by a family of membrane-bound receptors that actively repress ethylene responses. When the receptors bind ethylene, their signaling is shut off, activating responses. REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY (RTE1) encodes a novel membrane protein conserved in plants and metazoans. Genetic analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that RTE1 promotes the signaling state of the ethylene receptor ETR1 through the ETR1 N-terminal domain. RTE1 and ETR1 have been shown to co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis. Here, we demonstrate a physical association of RTE1 and ETR1 using in vivo and in vitro methods. Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was revealed in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in a tobacco cell transient assay and in stably transformed Arabidopsis. The association was also observed using a truncated version of ETR1 comprising the N terminus (amino acids 1-349). Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from Arabidopsis. The interaction occurs with high affinity (K(d), 117 nM) based on tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy using purified recombinant RTE1 and a tryptophan-less version of purified recombinant ETR1. An amino acid substitution (C161Y) in RTE1 that is known to confer an ETR1 loss-of-function phenotype correspondingly gives a nearly 12-fold increase in the dissociation constant (K(d), 1.38 μM). These findings indicate that a high affinity association of RTE1 and ETR1 is important in the regulation of ETR1."

Using laser scanning photostimulation in acute slices, the authors find that local connections along the tonotopic axis differ from those along the orthogonal, isofrequency axis. The primary auditory cortex (A1) is organized tonotopically, with neurons sensitive to high and low frequencies arranged in a rostro-caudal gradient. We used laser scanning photostimulation in acute slices to study the organization of local excitatory connections onto layers 2 and 3 (L2/3) of the mouse A1. Consistent with the organization of other cortical regions, synaptic inputs along the isofrequency axis (orthogonal to the tonotopic axis) arose predominantly within a column. By contrast, we found that local connections along the tonotopic axis differed from those along the isofrequency axis: some input pathways to L3 (but not L2) arose predominantly out-of-column. In vivo cell-attached recordings revealed differences between the sound-responsiveness of neurons in L2 and L3. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that auditory cortical microcircuitry is specialized to the one-dimensional representation of frequency in the auditory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2034780566,"Electrostatic forces are one of the primary determinants of molecular interactions. They help guide the folding of proteins, increase the binding of one protein to another and facilitate protein-DNA and protein-ligand binding. A popular method for computing the electrostatic properties of biological systems is to numerically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, and there are several easy-to-use software packages available that solve the PB equation for soluble proteins. Here we present a freely available program, called APBSmem, for carrying out these calculations in the presence of a membrane. The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) is used as a back-end for solving the PB equation, and a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) coordinates a set of routines that introduce the influence of the membrane, determine its placement relative to the protein, and set the membrane potential. The software Jmol is embedded in the GUI to visualize the protein inserted in the membrane before the calculation and the electrostatic potential after completing the computation. We expect that the ease with which the GUI allows one to carry out these calculations will make this software a useful resource for experimenters and computational researchers alike. Three examples of membrane protein electrostatic calculations are carried out to illustrate how to use APBSmem and to highlight the different quantities of interest that can be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2070301168,"Most genome-wide association (GWA) studies have focused on populations of European ancestry with limited assessment of the influence of the sequence variants on populations of other ethnicities. To determine whether markers that we have recently shown to associate with Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in Europeans also associate with BMD in East-Asians we analysed 50 markers from 23 genomic loci in samples from Korea (n = 1,397) and two Chinese Hong Kong sample sets (n = 3,869 and n = 785). Through this effort we identified fourteen loci that associated with BMD in East-Asian samples using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05; 1p36 (ZBTB40, P = 4.3×10(-9)), 1p31 (GPR177, P = 0.00012), 3p22 (CTNNB1, P = 0.00013), 4q22 (MEPE, P = 0.0026), 5q14 (MEF2C, P = 1.3×10(-5)), 6q25 (ESR1, P = 0.0011), 7p14 (STARD3NL, P = 0.00025), 7q21 (FLJ42280, P = 0.00017), 8q24 (TNFRSF11B, P = 3.4×10(-5)), 11p15 (SOX6, P = 0.00033), 11q13 (LRP5, P = 0.0033), 13q14 (TNFSF11, P = 7.5×10(-5)), 16q24 (FOXL1, P = 0.0010) and 17q21 (SOST, P = 0.015). Our study marks an early effort towards the challenge of cataloguing bone density variants shared by many ethnicities by testing BMD variants that have been established in Europeans, in East-Asians."
https://openalex.org/W2063028752,"Background Maraviroc treatment for HIV-1 infected patients results in larger CD4+ T cell rises than are attributable to its antiviral activity alone. We investigated whether this is due to modulation of T cell activation and inflammation. Methods and Findings Thirty maraviroc-treated patients from the Maraviroc versus Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy (MERIT) study were randomly selected from among those who had CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV on screening and achieved undetectable HIV RNA (<50 copies/mL) by Week 48. Efavirenz-treated controls were matched for baseline characteristics to the maraviroc-treated patients selected for this substudy. Changes in immune activation and inflammation markers were examined for associations with CD4+ T cell changes. Maraviroc treatment tended to result in more rapid decreases in CD38 expression on CD4+ T cells and in plasma D-dimer concentrations than did treatment with efavirenz. The proportion of patients with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein >2 µg/mL increased from 45% to 66% in the efavirenz arm, but remained constant in the maraviroc arm (P = 0.033). Decreases in CD38 expression on CD8+ T cells were correlated with CD4+ T cell rises for maraviroc treatment (r = −0.4, P = 0.048), but not for treatment with efavirenz. Conclusions Maraviroc-treated patients had earlier, modest decreases in certain markers of immune activation and inflammation, although in this small study, many of the differences were not statistically significant. Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein remained constant in the maraviroc arm and increased in the efavirenz arm. Decreases in immune activation correlated with increased CD4+ T cell gains.

https://openalex.org/W2028595956,"Background The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus is required for autoprocessing of the polyprotein, and is a potential target for treating coronaviral infection. Methodology/Principal Findings To obtain a thorough understanding of substrate specificity of the protease, a substrate library of 198 variants was created by performing saturation mutagenesis on the autocleavage sequence at P5 to P3' positions. The substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. P5 and P3 positions prefer residues with high β-sheet propensity; P4 prefers small hydrophobic residues; P2 prefers hydrophobic residues without β-branch. Gln is the best residue at P1 position, but observable cleavage can be detected with His and Met substitutions. P1' position prefers small residues, while P2' and P3' positions have no strong preference on residue substitutions. Noteworthy, solvent exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3' positions favour positively charged residues over negatively charged one, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a role in catalysis. A super-active substrate, which combined the preferred residues at P5 to P1 positions, was found to have 2.8 fold higher activity than the wild-type sequence. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrated a strong structure-activity relationship between the 3CLpro and its substrate. The substrate specificity profiled in this study may provide insights into a rational design of peptidomimetic inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2053935595,"DNA gyrase is an essential bacterial enzyme required for the maintenance of chromosomal DNA topology. This enzyme is the target of several protein toxins encoded in toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci as well as of man-made antibiotics such as quinolones. The genome of Vibrio cholerae, the cause of cholera, contains three putative TA loci that exhibit modest similarity to the RK2 plasmid-borne parDE TA locus, which is thought to target gyrase although its mechanism of action is uncharacterized. Here we investigated the V. cholerae parDE2 locus. We found that this locus encodes a functional proteic TA pair that is active in Escherichia coli as well as V. cholerae. ParD2 co-purified with ParE2 and interacted with it directly. Unlike many other antitoxins, ParD2 could prevent but not reverse ParE2 toxicity. ParE2, like the unrelated F-encoded toxin CcdB and quinolones, targeted the GyrA subunit and stalled the DNA-gyrase cleavage complex. However, in contrast to other gyrase poisons, ParE2 toxicity required ATP, and it interfered with gyrase-dependent DNA supercoiling but not DNA relaxation. ParE2 did not bind GyrA fragments bound by CcdB and quinolones, and a set of strains resistant to a variety of known gyrase inhibitors all exhibited sensitivity to ParE2. Together, our findings suggest that ParE2 and presumably its many plasmid- and chromosome-encoded homologues inhibit gyrase in a different manner than previously described agents.

TA loci were originally identified in low copy plasmids (1Jensen R.B. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Ogura T. Hiraga S. Cell. 1983; 32: 351-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), where they ensure plasmid maintenance by killing plasmid-free daughter cells in a process known as post-segregational killing (3Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Plasmid-borne TA loci promote plasmid maintenance because antitoxins are more labile than their cognate toxins in the intracellular environment. Plasmid-free cells, which can no longer synthesize either toxin or antitoxin, are therefore subject to the growth inhibitory/killing effect of the relatively long-lived toxin. Although TA loci were initially discovered in plasmids, in the current “post-genomic era,” it has become clear that these loci are also present in the chromosomes of nearly all species of bacteria, often in multiple copies (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Some bacteria harbor very large numbers of TA loci in their chromosome (5Ramage H.R. Connolly L.E. Cox J.S. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000767Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), typically in association with mobile genetic elements. For example, in Vibrio cholerae, 13 TA loci are found associated with attC recombination sequences,which apparently enabled their capture by the integrase of the chromosome 2 superintegron (6Szekeres S. Dauti M. Wilde C. Mazel D. Rowe-Magnus D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1588-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Even though the biochemical activities of several chromosome-encoded toxins have been deciphered, the physiologic significance of these ubiquitous loci remains the subject of controversy (7Engelberg-Kulka H. Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Tsilibaris V. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Van Melderen L. J.

CcdB and ParE are representative of two families of unrelated toxins that block DNA replication by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme that is also the target of quinolone antibacterial agents (10Maxwell A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). ParE, a toxin encoded on plasmid RK2 (11Roberts R.C. Ström A.R. Helinski D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Easter C.L. Sobecky P.A. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6472-6479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jiang Y. Pogliano J. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and CcdB, a toxin encoded on the F plasmid, have unrelated amino acid sequences, but they both poison DNA gyrase. CcdB and ParE are encoded adjacent to proteic antitoxins, known as CcdA and ParD, respectively. Proteins similar to CcdB and ParE are encoded within plasmid and chromosomal sequences (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Chromosomal CcdB homologues have been shown to target gyrase (14De Jonge N. Buts L. Vangelooven J. Mine N. Van Melderen L. Wyns L. Loris R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but studies demonstrating that chromosomal ParE homologues poison this essential enzyme have not been reported. Like other type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase modifies DNA topology by introducing a double-stranded break in DNA through which a second DNA duplex is passed (15Schoeffler A.J. Berger J.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This process can result in relaxation of positive or negative supercoils, both of which are energetically favored. Gyrase can also introduce negative supercoils; this process requires ATP. Both transcription and DNA replication generate positively supercoiled DNA, and gyrase is required to relieve the topological stresses associated with these essential processes. Maintenance of correct levels of chromosomal superhelicity is also critical for initiation of DNA replication and for the formation of open complexes for initiation of transcription (16Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Gyrase is a tetramer composed of two GyrA and two GyrB subunits, and both subunits contain distinct functional domains. The N-terminal domain of GyrA catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of DNA, and its C-terminal domain binds and wraps DNA around the enzyme. Without the GyrA C-terminal domain (GyrA-CTD), also called the “DNA wrapping domain” or GyrA33 (17Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), gyrase is unable to negatively supercoil DNA; however, it still retains low levels of relaxation activity (18Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of GyrB binds and hydrolyzes ATP, whereas its C-terminal domain interacts with GyrA and DNA (16Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 19Nöllmann M. Crisona N.J. Arimondo P.B. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of relatively few gyrase inhibitors has been determined. CcdB has been found to bind the dimerization domain of GyrA, thereby preventing strand passage as well as closure of the enzyme. In the presence of CcdB, the covalently linked DNA gyrase reaction intermediates are stabilized, which generates a “road block” for cellular polymerases in vivo and detectable DNA fragmentation in vitro (20Couturier M. Bahassi el-M. Van Melderen L. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Quinolone antibiotics, such as nalidixic acid, also stabilize DNA gyrase intermediates, although they and CcdB target distinct sites within GyrA (16Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). ParE from plasmid RK2 is also thought to poison gyrase by stabilizing gyrase-DNA complexes, but the interactions between ParE and gyrase subunits and the mechanism by which ParE inhibits gyrase have not been explored. An Escherichia coli strain harboring a CcdB-resistant GyrA was not resistant to RK2-encoded ParE, raising the possibility that ParE inhibits gyrase in a different manner than CcdB (11Roberts R.C. Ström A.R. Helinski D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Putative ParDE homologues are encoded in the genomes of a wide variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 21Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but studies of the target and mechanisms of these chromosome-borne TA systems have not been conducted. Here, we investigated the activities encoded by the parDE2 locus found in the V. cholerae superintegron. In this Gram-negative rod, the cause of cholera, the 13 putative TA loci include 3 loci with modest similarity to parDE of RK2. The predicted ParE2 amino acid sequence exhibits 29% sequence identity with RK2-ParE, whereas the predicted ParD2 sequence is only 12% identical to RK2 ParD. We found that the V. cholerae parDE2 genes encode a functional TA pair. Overexpression of ParE2 inhibited the growth of both V. cholerae and E. coli. ParD2 could prevent but not reverse ParE2 toxicity and, thus, may function in a different fashion than many other antitoxins. ParD2 co-purified along with ParE2, suggesting that ParD2-mediated neutralization of ParE2 toxicity results from the in vivo formation of a ParE2-ParD2 protein complex. Gyrase also co-purified with ParE2; in vitro studies revealed that distinct sites within GyrA are bound by ParE2 and CcdB. Unlike quinolones and CcdB, ParE2 requires ATP to stabilize gyrase-DNA cleavage complexes. In aggregate, our findings suggest that ParE2 inhibits gyrase in a different manner from other gyrase toxins. The plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All the gyrase mutant strains were generously provided by Coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C.

The reverse transcription reaction was performed with JPP78 (TCATCGAATGTTTTCACTAT) and then PCR-amplified with the Abridged Anchor Primer (Invitrogen) and JPP80 (TGAAGCTATCAAGGTCATAATCAGCGTCA). V. cholerae and E. coli strains were grown in LB with appropriate antibiotics and 0.2% glucose to an A600 of ∼0.3–0.5, spun down, washed twice with LB and then resuspended in LB with antibiotics and either 0.2% glucose or 0.02% arabinose and grown at 37 °C. At successive time points, aliquots were removed and plated onto selective plates containing 0.2% glucose to enumerate colony-forming units (CFU). E. coli gyrA and gyrB and V. cholerae parD2 and parE2 were each introduced into a modified pET28b (+) expression vector (Novagen) to yield recombinant proteins that contain a His6 tag on their respective N termini. This modified pET28b vector encodes a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (22Thoden J.B. Sellick C.A. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36905-36911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of these constructs were confirmed. Proteins were expressed and purified according to a standard protocol (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 1-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing one of the expression vectors was grown at 37 °C in LB supplemented with kanamycin to an A600 of ∼0.6, then protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 25 °C. Then the cells were lysed in a French pressure cell, and the His-tagged proteins were purified using His-Trap nickel columns (Amersham Biosciences) on an FPLC. The column was equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl. 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). After washing with buffer W (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), His6-tagged proteins were eluted from the column with a 20-ml linear imidazole gradient (20–500 mm imidazole). Fractions containing pure protein (purity >90% estimated by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in protein storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 50% glycerol). Size-exclusion chromatography was subsequently performed for further purification of His-GyrA and His-GyrB. When purifying His-tagged versions of either GyrB or GyrA, we noticed that endogenous GyrA or GyrB, respectively, always co-purified along with the epitope-tagged subunit. This was routinely monitored with dot blots performed with anti-GyrA and anti-GyrB antibodies. These blots revealed that more GyrA co-purified with His-GyrB than GyrB with His-GyrA (data not shown). Native ParE2 was generated by removing the N-terminal His6 tag from purified His6-ParE2 using AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Vibrio fischeri CcdB and E. coli GyrA14, GyrA59 were produced as described by Dao-Thi et al. (23Dao-Thi M.H. Van Melderen L. De Genst E. Buts L. Ranquin A. Wyns L. Loris R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Log-phase cultures of JY302 or JY307 were grown in 0.02% arabinose and 50 μm IPTG for 2 h to induce both His-ParE2 and ParD2-myc expression. His6ParE2 was affinity-purified using an Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with binding buffer 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole for 2 h at 4 °C. Wash buffer was 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and elution buffer was 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. All fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Blots were probed with anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-His antibody (Genetex) or anti-GyrA antibody (Inspiralis) or anti-GyrB antibody (Inspiralis). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore® 2000 system (GE Healthcare). The interactions between V. cholerae ParE2 or V. fischeri CcdB and various gyrase fragments were analyzed on both CM5 and Ni-NTA chips. E. coli His-GyrA, His-GyrA14, and His-GyrB were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) via amine coupling. For immobilization, the system was initially primed with Hepes-buffered saline with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The carboxylated dextran matrix was activated by a 7-min injection of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. A protein solution in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, was then injected until the desired amount of protein was immobilized. The surface immobilization was then blocked by a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride. Hen-egg lysozyme was coupled in a similar fashion in the remaining flow cell for reference subtraction. After having been coupled to the CM5 chip, His-GyrB was washed with regenerating buffer (50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaOH) before analysis. This protocol greatly reduced the amount of the co-purifying untagged GyrA subunit (data not shown). Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in running buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20) that was filtered and de-gassed before usage. The flow was set at 30 μl/min, and data were collected at 1 Hz. All analytes were dialyzed into the running buffer before analysis. Association was observed for 120 s, and dissociation was observed for 240 s. Regeneration was performed with 10 μl of regeneration buffer. The binding data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare), and the figures were generated with pro Fit 6.1.11 (Quantum Soft). For the kinetic analysis on the ParE2-GyrA59 interaction (Fig. 5G), E. coli GyrA59 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip in a similar manner. About 1200 relative units of GyrA59 was immobilized in flow cell 2 of the chip and washed with regeneration buffer (100 mm NaOH). The surface in flow cell 1 was used as a reference and treated only with N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine. Sensorgrams of different V. cholerae ParE2 concentrations (3.9 nm, 7.8 nm, 15.6 nm, 31.25 nm, 62.6 nm, 125 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm, 2 μm) plus a 0 concentration (injection of running buffer) were collected in duplicate. The flow was set at 5 μl/min, and data were collected at 2 Hz. This low flow rate was chosen based on the small quantity of ParE2 available; purifying large quantities of the protein was not feasible given its toxicity. Mass transport phenomena are likely at play under these conditions, and thus, the reported values for kon, koff, and KD should be regarded as apparent. All analytes were dialyzed into the running buffer before analysis. Association was observed for 500 s and dissociation was observed for 300 s. Regeneration was performed with 10 μl of regeneration buffer. The sensorgrams were fitted to a heterogeneous ligand model according to the equations below after subtraction of the reference and zero concentration data, which provided the kinetic parameters for the ParE2-GyrA59 interaction. Ligand 1:d[AB1]dt=kon1[A][B1]-koff1[AB1](Eq. 1) Ligand 2:d[AB2]dt=kon2[A][B2]-koff2[AB2](Eq. 2) In this model A denotes the analyte, and B denotes the ligand. E. coli GyrA, GyrA14, GyrA59, and GyrBA were immobilized on a BIAcore® Ni-NTA sensor chip (GE Healthcare) via their N-terminal hexahistidine tags as described (24Nieba L. Nieba-Axmann S.E. Persson A. Hämäläinen M. Edebratt F. Hansson A. Lidholm J. Magnusson K. Karlsson A.F. Plückthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed as described above with a different running buffer (35 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20). To ensure that the chip was free of any ligand, 20 μl of regeneration buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 350 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) was passed over the flow cells at 5 μl/min. This was followed by a 20-μl injection of the activation buffer (500 μm NiSO4, 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20) in flow cell 2 at 10 μl/min. The ligands His-GyrA14, His-GyrA59, His-GyrBA, and His-GyrA were, respectively, immobilized to the chip by injecting 10, 10, 10, and 50 μl of a 7 μg/ml solution at 20 μl/min followed by a dissociation time of 100 s. The analytes were injected at a volume of 30 μl at 20 μl/min followed by a dissociation time of at least 400 s. Regeneration was subsequently performed by injecting 40 μl of regeneration buffer at 10 μl/min. For the interaction between V. cholerae ParD2 and ParE2, N-terminal His-tagged ParD2 was non-covalently coupled to a Ni-NTA chip by injecting 10 μl of a 7 μg/ml solution at 20 μl/min followed by a dissociation time of 100 s. The rest was performed as described for the ParE2-gyrase interaction on the Ni-NTA chip. DNA gyrase supercoiling, relaxation, and cleavage assays were performed essentially as described (25Smith A.B. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Substrates for these assays were 3.5 nm relaxed pBR322, 1.02 nm supercoiled pCB182, or 4.82 pm V. cholerae chromosomal DNA. For supercoiling and cleavage assays, the reaction buffer was 35 mm Tris-HCl, 24 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1.8 mm spermidine, 1 mm ATP, 6.5% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. For holoenzyme relaxation assays, ATP and spermidine were omitted from the assay buffer, and for A592B2 relaxation assays, ATP was included. 1 unit of DNA gyrase (30 nm) (New England Biolabs) or 100 nm A592B2, 1.88 μm ParE2, 2.25 μm ParD2, and 0.5 mm nalidixic acid (Sigma) were used as indicated. Both supercoiling and cleavage reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, whereas relaxation reactions were performed at 30 °C for 3.5 h. The reactions were stopped with 50 μg/ml proteinase K and 1% SDS. The DNA was precipitated with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) (Invitrogen) before it was loaded on to 1% agarose gels and electrophoresed in the absence of ethidium bromide. The predicted V. cholerae ParE2 amino acid sequence exhibits 29% sequence identity with RK2-ParE. In contrast, the predicted ParD2 sequence is only 12% identical to RK2 ParD. However, two different annotations of the V. cholerae parD2 locus have been reported. In the original annotation of the genome of V. cholerae El Tor strain N16961, the parD2 locus (vca0360) was predicted to encode a protein of 153 amino acids (26Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Read T.D. Tettelin H. Richardson D. Ermolaeva M.D. Vamathevan J. Bass S. Qin H. Dragoi I. Sellers P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Fleishmann R.D. Nierman W.C. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Colwell R.R. Mekalanos J.J. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). In a bioinformatics study re-annotating microbial genomes, Bocs et al. (27Bocs S. Danchin A. Médigue C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) predicted that parD2 is actually a shorter ORF, vca0360.1, embedded within vca0360 (Fig. 1A). We used 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends to experimentally investigate the parD2 transcription start site. This analysis revealed that the start of parD2 transcription initiated 182 nucleotides 3′ of the annotated vca0360 translational start site, 11 bp 5′ of the translation start site predicted by Bocs et al. (27Bocs S. Danchin A. Médigue C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Additional analyses suggest that there is a recognizable and functional promoter upstream of this transcription start site (data not shown). The predicted VCA0360.1 ORF yields a protein of 80 amino acids that exhibits up to 67% sequence similarity to other chromosome-encoded ParDs and 24% identity to the RK2 plasmid-encoded ParD (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the predicted VCA0360 amino acid sequence exhibited less similarity to other ParD2 proteins. Together, these observations strongly suggest that vca0360.1 encodes V. cholerae ParD2, and we used this parD2 annotation for the studies described below. We constructed plasmid-borne inducible versions of parE2 and parD2 to test if these V. cholerae genes encode a functional toxin/antitoxin pair. Expression of parE2 from pBAD-E2 is induced by arabinose, whereas expression of parD2 from pGZ-D2 is constitutive and driven by its endogenous promoter. The parE2 expression construct was introduced along with either pGZ-D2 or a vector control into wild type El Tor V. cholerae strain N16961 and E. coli BW27784. Induction of parE2 expression in the absence of the parD2 expression construct was highly toxic in both strains. After parE2 induction, the number of CFU in cultures was reduced by ∼3–5 orders of magnitude relative to the number in cultures in which parE2 expression was repressed with glucose (Fig. 2, A and B, red diamonds versus black squares). The rapidity and magnitude of the reduction in CFU after induction of parE2 expression were even more dramatic in E. coli BW27784 than in V. cholerae, perhaps because this E. coli strain has a constitutive arabinose transporter and does not exhibit inducer exclusion (28Khlebnikov A. Datsenko K.A. Skaug T. Wanner B.L. Keasling J.D. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and ParD2 in the wild type V. cholerae strain may partially neutralize the effect of ParE2. Notably, no toxicity after parE2 induction was observed in any strain containing pGZ-D2. Collectively, these data suggest that parE2 encodes a toxin whose target is conserved between V. cholerae and E. coli and whose activity can be neutralized by ParD2. We also tested whether ParD2 could reverse ParE2 toxicity in vivo. For these experiments we used E. coli BL21 containing pBAD-E2 and pET-parD2 (JY307), which enabled inducible expression of both proteins. The strain was initially cultured in glucose to repress parE2 expression. As described above, induction of parE2 expression in the absence of parD2 induction reduced the plating efficiency of this strain by several orders of magnitude, whereas induction of parE2 expression when parD2 was produced simultaneously did not impair plating efficiency (Fig. 2C). Induction of parD2 expression 30 min after induction of parE2 also did not reduce the numb"
https://openalex.org/W2071074483,"As bending free-kicks becomes the norm in modern day soccer, implications for goalkeepers have largely been ignored. Although it has been reported that poor sensitivity to visual acceleration makes it harder for expert goalkeepers to perceptually judge where the curved free-kicks will cross the goal line, it is unknown how this affects the goalkeeper's actual movements.Here, an in-depth analysis of goalkeepers' hand movements in immersive, interactive virtual reality shows that they do not fully account for spin-induced lateral ball acceleration. Hand movements were found to be biased in the direction of initial ball heading, and for curved free-kicks this resulted in biases in a direction opposite to those necessary to save the free-kick. These movement errors result in less time to cover a now greater distance to stop the ball entering the goal. These and other details of the interceptive behaviour are explained using a simple mathematical model which shows how the goalkeeper controls his movements online with respect to the ball's current heading direction. Furthermore our results and model suggest how visual landmarks, such as the goalposts in this instance, may constrain the extent of the movement biases.While it has previously been shown that humans can internalize the effects of gravitational acceleration, these results show that it is much more difficult for goalkeepers to account for spin-induced visual acceleration, which varies from situation to situation. The limited sensitivity of the human visual system for detecting acceleration, suggests that curved free-kicks are an important goal-scoring opportunity in the game of soccer."
https://openalex.org/W2075428343,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells and are, therefore, promising anti-cancer drugs. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is activated in histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-treated tumor cells, and its growth-inhibitory function contributes to the anti-tumorigenic effect of HDAC inhibitors. We show here that induction of p21 by trichostatin A involves MAP kinase signaling. Activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by growth factors or stress signals results in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation at the p21 promoter and is crucial for acetylation of the neighboring lysine 14 and recruitment of activated RNA polymerase II in response to trichostatin A treatment. In non-induced cells, the protein phosphatase PP2A is associated with the p21 gene and counteracts its activation. Induction of p21 is linked to simultaneous acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3. The dual modification mark H3S10phK14ac at the activated p21 promoter is recognized by the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3ζ, which protects the phosphoacetylation mark from being processed by PP2A. Taken together we have revealed a cross-talk of reversible phosphorylation and acetylation signals that controls the activation of p21 by HDAC inhibitors and identify the phosphatase PP2A as chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068627201,"Background Conflict detection and subsequent behavioral adjustment are critical to daily life, and how this process is controlled has been increasingly of interest. A medial cortical region which includes the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been theorized to act as a conflict detector that can direct prefrontal activity for behavioral adjustments. This conflict monitoring hypothesis was supported by many imaging studies of the Stroop task, with a focus on non-error processes. Here we sought to examine whether this circuit could be generalized to the stop signal task (SST), another behavioral paradigm widely used to study cognitive control. In particular, with a procedure to elicit errors in the SST, we examined whether error and non-error control were mediated by the same pathways. Methodology/Principal Findings In functional magnetic resonance imaging of 60 healthy adults, we demonstrated that the medial cortical activity during stop success (SS) as compared to go success (G) trials is correlated with increased prefrontal activity in post-stop SS as compared to post-go SS trials, though this correlation was not specific to the medial cortical region. Furthermore, thalamic and insular rather than medial cortical activation during stop error (SE) as compared to G trials correlated with increased prefrontal activity in post-stop SS as compared to post-go SS trials. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these new findings challenge a specific role of the ACC and support distinct pathways for error and non-error conflict processing in cognitive control."

The zinc fingers of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein, NCp7, are prime targets for antiretroviral therapeutics. Here we show that S-acyl-2-mercaptobenzamide thioester (SAMT) chemotypes inhibit HIV by modifying the NCp7 region of Gag in infected cells, thereby blocking Gag processing and reducing infectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2128263872,"There can be little doubt that genetics has transformed our understanding of mechanisms mediating brain disorders. The last two decades have brought tremendous progress in terms of accurate molecular diagnoses and knowledge of the genes and pathways that are involved in a large number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Likewise, new methods and analytical approaches, including genome array studies and ""next-generation"" sequencing technologies, are bringing us deeper insights into the subtle complexities of the genetic architecture that determines our risks for these disorders. As we now seek to translate these discoveries back to clinical applications, a major challenge for the field will be in bridging the gap between genes and biology. In this Overview of Neuron's special review issue on neurogenetics, we reflect on progress made over the last two decades and highlight the challenges as well as the exciting opportunities for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2094337775,"Prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) catalyze the hydroxylation of collagens and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α subunits. We studied the zebrafish homologue of the recently characterized human transmembrane P4H (P4H-TM) that can hydroxylate HIF-α, but not collagens, in vitro and influence HIF-α levels in cellulo. The zebrafish P4H-TM mRNA had its highest expression in the eye and brain and lower levels in other tissues, including the kidney. Morpholino knockdown of P4H-TM in embryos resulted in a reduction in the size of the eye and head and morphological alterations in the head from 2 days postfertilization onward. In addition, pericardial edema, regarded as a sign of kidney dysfunction, developed from 3 days postfertilization onward. The phenotype was dependent on the P4H-TM catalytic activity because similar results were obtained with morpholinos targeting either translation initiation or catalytic residues of the enzyme. Structural and functional analyses of the morphant pronephric kidneys revealed fragmented glomerular basement membranes (BMs), disorganized podocyte foot processes, and severely compromised pronephric kidney function leading to proteinuria. The opacity of the eye lens was increased due to the presence of extra nuclei and deposits, and the structure of the lens capsule BM was altered. Our data suggest that P4H-TM catalytic activity is required for the proper development of the glomerular and lens capsule BMs. Many HIF target genes were induced in the P4H-TM-deficient morphants, but the observed phenotype is not likely to be mediated at least solely via the HIF pathway, and thus P4H-TM probably has additional, as yet unknown, substrates.

P4Hs belong to the group of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (1.Myllyharju J. Ann.

At least two distinct groups of P4Hs exist: the collagen P4Hs (C-P4Hs) that reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (1.Myllyharju J. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3.Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic and nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) P4Hs (for reviews, see Refs. 4.Fraisl P.

The human C-P4Hs are α2β2 tetramers in which the α subunits are responsible for the P4H activity, whereas the β subunits are identical to protein-disulfide isomerase (1.Myllyharju J. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Three C-P4H isoenzymes differing in their α subunits exist in humans and catalyze the synthesis of 4-Hyp in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences of collagens, the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and in some other proteins with collagen-like motifs. The role of 4-Hyp in collagens is to promote their structural stability because, in the absence of 4-Hyp, the collagen polypeptides are not folded into the correct triple-helical conformation at human body temperature. Surprisingly, C-P4H isoenzyme I was also recently found to hydroxylate a proline in an -X-Pro-Gly- sequence in Ago2 (Argonaute 2), a cytosolic protein essential for RNA-induced silencing complexes (7.Qi H.H.

Inhibition of the prolyl 4-hydroxylation of Ago2 was found to alter its stability and, therefore, effective RNA interference (7.Qi H.H. Ongusaha P.P. Myllyharju J. Cheng D. Pakkanen O. Shi Y.

The 4-Hyp in HIF-α acts to enable the binding of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL), leading to subsequent polyubiqitinylation and rapid proteasomal degradation of HIF-α in normoxia. In hypoxia, the prolyl 4-hydroxylation is inhibited, and HIF-α is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with HIF-β and initiates the transcription of numerous genes involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis. There are reports that link the activity of HIF-P4Hs to the regulation of the stability of some other targets in addition to HIF-α, such as HIF-P4H-3, which regulates the stability of the transcription factor ATF-4 (11.Köditz J.

Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), who suggested that the polypeptide is oriented with its catalytic site facing cytosol and showed that its overexpression suppressed cellular HIF-1α and -2α reporter transactivation activity and reduced the HIF-2α protein level. We exploited here the morpholino knockdown technology to study the in vivo role of P4H-TM in zebrafish and found that P4H-TM deficiency led to basement membrane (BM) defects in several tissues and compromised pronephric kidney function. The deficiency induced many HIF target genes, but it seems highly unlikely that the phenotypic defects are mediated at least solely by the HIF pathway, and thus P4H-TM probably has additional, as yet unidentified, substrates.DISCUSSIONOur data indicate that the expression pattern of the zebrafish homologue of vertebrate P4H-TM resembles that of the human enzyme (16.Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18.Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The expression level was the highest in the eye and brain, whereas lower levels were observed in several other tissues, including skeletal muscle, the kidney, and the heart. Morpholino knockdown technology allowed us to investigate the in vivo role of P4H-TM during zebrafish development. Surprisingly, the most obvious phenotypic alteration observed with all three independent morpholinos targeting different sites in the P4H-TM mRNA was pericardial edema, which became visible at 3 dpf and more severe at 4 dpf. This phenotype was independent of p53 but dependent on the catalytic activity of P4H-TM. A similar phenotype has been reported by others for zebrafish morphants lacking the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor CAR, which was found to be required for renal epithelial differentiation in the zebrafish pronephric kidney (37.Raschperger E. Neve E.P. Wernerson A. Hultenby K. Pettersson R.F. Majumdar A. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At this stage of development (3–4 dpf), pericardial edema most likely results from dysfunction of the pronephric kidney because the primary function of the fish pronephros is osmoregulation (27.Drummond I.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the morphology and function of the pronephros in more detail. Severe alterations in the structure of the glomerulus were observed in the TM1 morphants at 3 dpf even at the light microscopic level, whereas TEM revealed changes in the ultrastructure of the glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells and fragmentation of the GBM, suggesting that the filtration function might consequently be altered. Surprisingly, we could not detect any uptake of either low or high molecular weight fluorescent dextrans into the pronephric tubular endosomes in the P4H-TM-deficient larvae, whereas in the controls, the low molecular weight fluorescent dextran passed through the glomerular filter and was taken up in the tubuli, and the high molecular weight dextran stayed in the circulation as expected. Importantly, however, we were able to show that the apparent lack of the signs of proteinuria in the serial sections analyzed by confocal microscopy was due to the fact that the 500-kDa FITC-dextran was not reabsorbed in the tubules but was secreted into the fish water by the P4H-TM morphants. Although no gross abnormalities were seen in the structure of the P4H-TM deficient tubuli at the light microscopic level, reduced endogenous alkaline phosphatase staining suggested that their function was compromised to some extent. Lack of P4H-TM was thus shown to lead to a severe leakage of high molecular weight dextran into the filtrate in P4H-TM-deficient 3-dpf larvae, suggesting that P4H-TM is critical to the normal development and function of the pronephric zebrafish kidney because its knockdown during development leads to kidney failure and proteinuria.Leakage of high molecular weight proteins (i.e. proteinuria) is typical for many human nephropathies and also a common complication of diabetes (38.Cooper M.E. Mundel P. Boner G. Semin. Nephrol. 2002; 22: 393-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Proteinuria can result from a failure of the formation of the slit diaphragm, an adherens junction formed between podocyte foot processes (39.Patrakka J. Tryggvason K. Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2009; 8: 463-468Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but TEM analysis revealed the presence of normal slit diaphragms in the glomeruli of the larvae lacking P4H-TM. Structural integration of glomerular podocytes and blood vessels is required for the normal development of the pronephric zebrafish kidney (27.Drummond I.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Podocytes are believed to organize vessel growth by expressing Vegf and thereby attracting and assembling the glomerular tuft (35.Majumdar A. Drummond I.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but vascular shear force has also been suggested to be required for proper glomerular capillary tuft formation (40.Serluca F.C. Drummond I.A. Fishman M.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 492-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Also, degradation and remodeling of the GBM have been reported to be a key step in capillary tuft formation (40.Serluca F.C. Drummond I.A. Fishman M.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 492-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The structural alterations observed in the pronephric kidney of the morphants lacking P4H-TM may therefore be a result of several dysregulated functions (i.e. failure of GBM remodeling, evidenced by fragmented GBMs, altered Vegf-a expression detected by Q-PCR and compromised blood flow caused by alterations in the endothelial cells seen in TEM). In terms of gene expression, we observed significant alterations in the levels of two ECM components in the TM1 morphants relative to the controls. Expression of the mRNA for lox was reduced, whereas that of the α(1) chain of type XVIII collagen was increased, both of which may have contributed to the alteration in GBM remodeling. Human lysyl oxidase, which was earlier thought to cross-link mainly elastin and fibrillar collagens, has been reported to be a critical mediator of bone marrow cell recruitment by cross-linking type IV collagen of the BMs of premetastatic sites (41.Erler J.T. Bennewith K.L. Cox T.R. Lang G. Bird D. Koong A. Le Q.T. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of lox may therefore have contributed to the altered BM structures in P4H-TM-deficient larvae. The expression pattern of zebrafish lox overlaps with that of P4H-TM being expressed in the central nervous system and eyes at 3 dpf, and its morpholino knockdown phenocopies some aspects of the P4H-TM-deficient larvae by showing reduced size of the head and eyes and pericardial edema (42.Reynaud C. Baas D. Gleyzal C. Le Guellec D. Sommer P. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, these larvae have defects in the organization of their notochord BM, muscle development, and neurogenesis (42.Reynaud C. Baas D. Gleyzal C. Le Guellec D. Sommer P. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Collagen XVIII-deficient mice have been reported to have alterations in their kidney BMs and kidney filtering capacity (43.Utriainen A. Sormunen R. Kettunen M. Carvalhaes L.S. Sajanti E. Eklund L. Kauppinen R. Kitten G.T. Pihlajaniemi T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and collagen XVIII is required for preservation of the integrity of ECM and capillaries in the kidney (44.Hamano Y. Okude T. Shirai R. Sato I. Kimura R. Ogawa M. Ueda Y. Yokosuka O. Kalluri R. Ueda S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is not clear at this point whether the increased expression of type XVIII collagen mRNA in P4H-TM deficient larvae contributes directly to the kidney phenotype or whether it is a feedback effect to compensate for the altered kidney structure and function.In addition to the kidney, the eye contains highly specialized BMs (i.e. the lens capsule, inner limiting membrane, and Bruch's membrane). Abnormalities were also observed in the BM structure of the lens capsule in the P4H-TM-deficient morphants. The lens phenotype began to become visible at 2 dpf, whereas at 4 dpf, when the lens should have been completely enucleated, we observed numerous nuclei accompanied by degeneration particles and deposits in the lenses of the P4H-TM-deficient embryos. Because gene knockdown by antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides is transient, we were unable to follow the development of the eyes any longer in order to learn whether the P4H-TM deficiency merely led to a delay in development. It is possible, however, that the morphologically altered lens capsule BM may have contributed to the severely compromised epithelial cell differentiation. Interestingly, mice overexpressing endostatin, a proteolytic fragment of type XVIII collagen, under the K14 keratin promoter resulted in lens opacity and cataract and ultrastructural alterations in the skin BMs (45.Elamaa H. Sormunen R. Rehn M. Soininen R. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 221-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that altered type XVIII collagen expression may have contributed to the lens phenotype in P4H-TM-deficient larvae. Also, others have reported that laminin γ1-deficient zebrafish larvae have little or no lens capsule BM at 3 dpf, but the process of lens enucleation is normal (46.Lee J. Gross J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2483-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Although no data are currently available on the in vivo role of any of the human C-P4H or HIF-P4H homologues in zebrafish, two zebrafish lines carrying germ line mutations in the vhl homologue have been found in a Hubrecht target-selected ENU-mutagenized zebrafish library (33.van Rooijen E. Voest E.E. Logister I. Korving J. Schwerte T. Schulte-Merker S. Giles R.H. van Eeden F.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 6449-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The vhl mutant embryos display a hypoxic response and recapitulate key aspects of Chuvash polycythemia, which is caused by a deficiency in the binding of hydroxylated HIF-α to pVHL and its subsequent targeting for proteasomal degradation (33.van Rooijen E. Voest E.E. Logister I. Korving J. Schwerte T. Schulte-Merker S. Giles R.H. van Eeden F.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 6449-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Knockdown of P4H-TM did not result in any signs of polycythemia observed in the vhl mutants, and vice versa, no alterations in kidney or lens morphology were reported in the vhl mutants (33.van Rooijen E. Voest E.E. Logister I. Korving J. Schwerte T. Schulte-Merker S. Giles R.H. van Eeden F.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 6449-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the P4H-TM-deficient morphants, like the vhl mutants, showed up-regulation of several HIF-regulated genes, although direct comparison of changes in gene expression is not possible because the vhl mutants were studied at 7 dpf, whereas the P4H-TM morphants were analyzed at 3 dpf. Zebrafish embryos injected with the pan-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine mimicked the phenotype of the vhl mutants but also displayed additional alterations not seen in these. For example, strong Vegf-a mRNA expression was seen in the proximal renal tubule of the dimethyloxalylglycine-treated embryos but not in the vhl mutants, suggesting that a protein other than HIF-α regulated by 2-oxoglutarate may be responsible for controlling vegf-a expression there (33.van Rooijen E. Voest E.E. Logister I. Korving J. Schwerte T. Schulte-Merker S. Giles R.H. van Eeden F.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 6449-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Careful expression studies focused on zebrafish HIF-1α and -2α during development show that both forms are expressed in all tissues during early development (47.Rojas D.A. Perez-Munizaga D.A. Centanin L. Antonelli M. Wappner P. Allende M.L. Reyes A.E. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and their dysregulation may therefore have contributed to the phenotype observed in the P4H-TM-deficient morphants. It seems highly unlikely, however, that the phenotypic abnormalities found here could be mediated at least solely by changes in the HIF pathway, and thus P4H-TM probably has additional, as yet unknown, substrate(s), the reduced hydroxylation of which results in the observed phenotype.

P4Hs belong to the group of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (1.Myllyharju J. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2.Ozer A. Bruick R.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At least two distinct groups of P4Hs exist: the collagen P4Hs (C-P4Hs) that reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (1.Myllyharju J. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3.Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic and nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) P4Hs (for reviews, see Refs. 4.Fraisl P. Aragonés J. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol.

The human C-P4Hs are α2β2 tetramers in which the α subunits are responsible for the P4H activity, whereas the β subunits are identical to protein-disulfide isomerase (1.Myllyharju J. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Three C-P4H isoenzymes differing in their α subunits exist in humans and catalyze the synthesis of 4-Hyp in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences of collagens, the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and in some other proteins with collagen-like motifs. The role of 4-Hyp in collagens is to promote their structural stability because, in the absence of 4-Hyp, the collagen polypeptides are not folded into the correct triple-helical conformation at human body temperature. Surprisingly, C-P4H isoenzyme I was also recently found to hydroxylate a proline in an -X-Pro-Gly- sequence in Ago2 (Argonaute 2), a cytosolic protein essential for RNA-induced silencing complexes (7.Qi H.H. Ongusaha P.P. Myllyharju J. Cheng D. Pakkanen O. Shi Y. Lee S.W. Peng J. Shi Y. Nature. 2008; 455: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the prolyl 4-hydroxylation of Ago2 was found to alter its stability and, therefore, effective RNA interference (7.Qi H.H. Ongusaha P.P. Myllyharju J. Cheng D. Pakkanen O. Shi Y. Lee S.W. Peng J. Shi Y. Nature. 2008; 455: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The three human HIF-P4Hs (HIF-P4Hs 1–3, also known as PHDs 1–3, and EglN2, -1, and -3, respectively) hydroxylate one or two prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of the HIF-α subunits in a -Leu-X-X-Leu-Ala-Pro- sequence (8.Bruick R.K.

The 4-Hyp in HIF-α acts to enable the binding of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL), leading to subsequent polyubiqitinylation and rapid proteasomal degradation of HIF-α in normoxia. In hypoxia, the prolyl 4-hydroxylation is inhibited, and HIF-α is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with HIF-β and initiates the transcription of numerous genes involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis. There are reports that link the activity of HIF-P4Hs to the regulation of the stability of some other targets in addition to HIF-α, such as HIF-P4H-3, which regulates the stability of the transcription factor ATF-4 (11.Köditz J. Nesper J. Wottawa M. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Franke C. Myllyharju J. Wenger R.H. Katschinski D.M.

Indirect evidence has also been reported for hydroxylation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and IκB kinase-β by HIF-P4Hs (14.Cummins E.P. Berra E. Comerford K.M. Ginouves A. Fitzgerald K.T.

Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Its sequence resembles more closely those of the C-P4H α subunits than the HIF-P4Hs, but it lacks the peptide-substrate-binding domain of the C-P4Hs (17.Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant P4H-TM hydroxylated the two prolines in the HIF-1α ODDD in vitro, whereas it did not hydroxylate any prolines in recombinant full-length type I collagen polypeptides (16.Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Overexpression of P4H-TM in cultured neuroblastoma cells reduced HIF-1α ODDD reporter levels, whereas its knockdown increased the HIF-1α protein level, in the same way as observed with the HIF-P4Hs (16.Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). P4H-TM also hydroxylated to a low extent a HIF-1α ODDD in which the two prolines targeted by the HIF-P4Hs were mutated, suggesting that, at least in vitro, it can hydroxylate some additional prolines besides those recognized by the HIF-P4Hs (16.Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). P4H-TM is a vertebrate enzyme because the lowest organism in which its homologue is found is the zebrafish (16.Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I.

We exploited here the morpholino knockdown technology to study the in vivo role of P4H-TM in zebrafish and found that P4H-TM deficiency led to basement membrane (BM) defects in several tissues and compromised pronephric kidney function. The deficiency induced many HIF target genes, but it seems highly unlikely that the phenotypic defects are mediated at least solely by the HIF pathway, and thus P4H-TM probably has additional, as yet unidentified, substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2058194207,"Promoter recognition by RNA polymerase is a key point in gene expression and a target of regulation. Bacterial RNA polymerase binds promoters in the form of the holoenzyme, with the σ specificity subunit being primarily responsible for promoter recognition. Free σ, however, does not recognize promoter DNA, and it has been proposed that the intrinsic DNA binding ability is masked in free σ but becomes unmasked in the holoenzyme. Here, we use a newly developed fluorescent assay to quantitatively study the interactions of free σ70 from Escherichia coli, the β′-σ complex, and the σ70 RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme with non-template strand of the open promoter complex transcription bubble in the context of model non-template oligonucleotides and fork junction templates. We show that σ70, free or in the context of the holoenzyme, recognizes the −10 promoter element with the same efficiency and specificity. The result implies that there is no need to invoke a conformational change in σ for recognition of the −10 element in the single-stranded form. In the holoenzyme, weak but specific interactions of σ are increased by contacts with DNA downstream of the −10 element. We further show that region 1 of σ70 is required for stronger interaction with non-template oligonucleotides in the holoenzyme but not in free σ. Finally, we show that binding of the β′ RNAP subunit is sufficient to allow specific recognition of the TG motif of the extended −10 promoter element by σ70.

The RNAP core enzyme (α2ββ′ω) is catalytically competent but does not recognize promoters. Available biochemical, structural, and genetic data clearly show that, within the holoenzyme, σ is responsible for the recognition of promoter consensus elements located, at most promoters, ∼10 and ∼35 bp upstream of the transcription start site (located at +1) (1Burgess R.R.

However, the −10 promoter element on its own is not sufficient for promoter complex formation.

RNA polymerase oligonucleotide tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide photoinduced electron transfer. The −10 promoter element is recognized by σ region 2. Although original recognition must proceed in the form of double-stranded DNA, in transcription-competent open complex, the −10 element is present in single-stranded form as part of the transcription bubble, which on most promoters extends from −12 to approximately +3. Although open complex formation by RNAPs from mesophilic organisms such as Escherichia coli takes place under conditions at which the double-stranded form of DNA is resistant to denaturation by about 1 kcal/mol bp, many open complexes are very stable (6deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of high energetic cost of transcription bubble formation, the RNAP-promoter interactions responsible for this process must be very strong. An important source of energy driving the strand separation process and controlling the open complex stability is the interaction of RNAP with the non-template strand of the transcription bubble (6deHaseth P.L.

In the open complex, σ region 2 makes specific contacts with the non-template strand of the −10 promoter element (consensus sequence TATAAT for E. coli σ70 as well as for housekeeping σ factors of many other bacteria). Adenine at position −11 of the non-template strand is of special importance for nucleation of promoter melting (9Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Outside of the −10 element, a non-template segment of the transcription bubble corresponding to positions −6 to −3 interacts with σ region 1.2 (10Haugen S.P. Berkmen M.B. Ross W. Gaal T. Ward C.

Further downstream, a non-template segment of the transcription bubble surrounding the transcription start point (positions −2 to +2) interacts with β (11Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39669-39674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that inclusion of the non-template segment corresponding to positions −6 to +1 stimulates the binding of fork junction probes, which consist of double-stranded upstream promoter DNA with single-stranded sequences downstream of positions −11 or −12. It is unknown, however, whether such increased binding is sufficient to mediate formation of the transcription bubble. Specific interaction of oligonucleotides mimicking the non-template strand of the transcription bubble in the open promoter complex (i.e. containing the −10 promoter element and downstream DNA up to position +1) with σ is readily detected using biochemical methods such as protein-DNA cross-linking or native gel electrophoresis in the context of the holoenzyme (8Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, isolated β′ or a β′ fragment containing the primary σ-binding site is sufficient to allow relatively strong interaction between σ (or σ fragment containing region 2) with such oligonucleotides (13Kulbachinskiy A.

These results were interpreted as suggesting that, upon formation of the holoenzyme, the intrinsic −10 element binding capacity of σ is either unmasked (by removing an inhibitory interaction that is present in free σ and that prevents promoter recognition) or increased (by introducing a conformational change and/or readjusting the DNA binding domain of σ). Indeed, it is now well established that σ does undergo large scale conformational changes upon holoenzyme formation that affect the relative positions of its DNA binding domains (15Callaci S.

In this study, we use a new fluorometric assay to monitor site-specific interactions of promoter DNA and its fragments with holo-RNAP, free σ70, and with the β′-σ70 complex. Using this new method, we dissect the energetics of RNAP interaction with the non-template segment of the transcription bubble in the context of oligonucleotide and fork junction model promoter fragments. The results indicate that RNAP binding to the −10 element and to the downstream −6/−3 fragment is highly energetically favorable and can provide a major part of energy required for local promoter melting, whereas interaction with the −2/+2 segment is relatively weak. We show further that formation of the holoenzyme increases the apparent affinity of oligonucleotides mimicking the non-template strand of the transcription bubble by ∼300-fold. In contrast, formation of the holoenzyme has only a modest effect on the interaction of σ with shorter non-template oligonucleotides corresponding to the −10 promoter element alone.

Trypsin digestion reactions contained 2 nm (211Cys-TMR) σ70 or (211Cys-TMR, W433A,W434A) σ70 and about 0.1 trypsin activity unit per ml in transcription buffer. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 25 °C. Promoter DNA fragments were formed by mixing equimolar amounts of synthetic complementary strands in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, heating for 2 min at 95 °C, and slowly cooling down to 25 °C. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Quanta-Master QM4 spectrofluorometer (PTI) in transcription buffer (TB: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 0.02% Tween 20 at 25 °C. Final assay mixtures (800 μl) contained 1 nm labeled σ70 or RNAP holoenzyme and DNA probes at various concentrations. The (β′-σ70) complex assay mixtures contained 1 nm (211Cys-TMR) σ70 and 30 nm β′. The 30 nm β′ concentration saturated the fluorescence signal increase in the experiments. Some control experiments were performed using 3 nm labeled free σ70 or RNAP holoenzyme. We did not observe a difference between the Kd values measured at either 1 or 3 nm of a beacon concentration. The TMR fluorescence intensities were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and an emission wavelength of 578 nm. Kinetic measurements were performed as in Ref. 23Feklistov A. Mekler V.

To obtain equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd), the experimental dependence of the fluorescent signal amplitude (F) on DNA probe concentration (C) was fit to Equation 1,(1−X)(C−[RNAP]X)=KdX(Eq. 1) where X = (F − Fo)/(Fmax − Fo); Fo is the initial value of the amplitude, and Fmax is the limiting value of the amplitude at C = ∞. Oligo probes bearing mutations at −7 and −11 positions produced very low fluorescent signal. Dissociation constants of these probes were obtained from competition binding experiments using the consensus single-stranded probe as a reference. The experiments were carried out at a fixed concentration of a substituted probe and various concentrations of consensus probe. The data were fit to Equation 2,(1−X)(C−[RNAP]X)=KdX(1+C0/Kd,0)(Eq. 2) where Kd,0 and C0 are dissociation constant and concentration of the substituted probe, respectively. Equation 2 is valid at C0 ≫ [RNAP], a condition that was fulfilled in our experiments. Another equilibrium competition binding assay was used to measure affinity of tight RNAP-fork junction complexes (Kd value lower than 0.1 nm). A double-stranded (−58/−14) probe (shown in Fig. 4) producing negligible signal upon binding to (211Cys-TMR) σ70 holo-RNAP was used as a competitor. The ratio of equilibrium binding constants for the fork junction probes and the (−58/−14) probe was calculated as described previously (24Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The concentrations of fork junctions and (−58/−14) were between 2 and 10 nm. The approach to equilibrium binding was revealed by order of addition experiments as in Ref. 25Nickels B.E. Garrity S.J. Mekler V. Minakhin L. Severinov K. Ebright R.H. Hochschild A. Proc. Natl.

Equilibrium binding of (−26/+2)(−26/−12), (−38/−3)(−38/−12)−35mut, and (−38/−7)(−38/−13) probes was reached after incubation at room temperature for 2, 7, and 20 h, respectively. Typical kinetics of reaching equilibrium degree of saturation of RNAP with the (−38/−3)(−38/−12)−35mut and (−58/−14) probes is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Tryptophan and tyrosine side chains quench fluorescence of adjacent organic fluorophores (dyes) due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the first excited singlet state of the dye and the ground state of Trp or Tyr (26Doose S. Neuweiler H. Sauer M. Chemphyschem. 2005; 6: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Efficient PET usually occurs at length scales below 1 nm. We sought to develop a simple PET-based, one-label quantitative assay to monitor the interaction of bacterial RNAP with promoter DNA. We reasoned that the interaction of the E. coli RNAP σ70 subunit region 2 with the −10 promoter element might lend itself to such an assay because it is known that this interaction involves multiple aromatic amino acids of σ70 region 2.3 that change their environment upon interaction with DNA (27Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2009; 385: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The exact nature of this change is, however, unknown. Schematic representation of the assay is shown in Fig. 1A. The assay is based on measuring emission from a fluorescent label attached to E. coli σ70 in the vicinity of a cluster of Trp and Tyr residues from conserved region 2.3 (Trp-433, Trp-434, Tyr-425, and Tyr-430). The base-line fluorescence of labeled free σ70 or RNAP holoenzyme that contains it is expected to be low due to quenching by the nearby tryptophan and tyrosine residues. Upon DNA binding and establishment of specific interactions with nucleotides from the non-template strand of the −10 promoter element, the contacts between the fluorescent label and residues from the aromatic cluster of σ region 2.3 can become disrupted, which should result in decreased quenching and the enhancement of the fluorescent signal. The assay reports only on protein-DNA interactions confined to small parts of RNAP and DNA adjacent to σ70 region 2.3 aromatic residues, i.e. on specific interactions important for promoter complex formation. The assay thus should be “blind” to interactions that occur elsewhere in the RNAP molecule. By analogy with previously described molecular and peptide beacons assays (30Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar, 31Oh K.J. Cash K.J. Hugenberg V. Plaxco K.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2007; 18: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we name the new assay a protein (RNAP) beacon assay. Several previously described functional single cysteine mutants of E. coli σ70 that allow site-specific introduction of fluorescent labels were prepared. The mutants were chosen based on spatial proximity of modified residues to σ70 region 2.3 in available structures containing σ subunits from E. coli and Thermus spp. (3Campbell E.A. Muzzin O.

Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A structural model of (211Cys-TMR) σ70, σ70 labeled at position 211 with fluorescent label, 5-TMR, is shown in Fig. 1B as an example. RNAP holoenzymes reconstituted from mutant σ labeled with 5-TMR, BODIPY FL, or ATTO-520 (the efficiency of labeling was at least 70%) were functional (at least 80% of the wild-type RNAP activity in abortive initiation assay on the T5N25 promoter). Reconstituted fluorescently labeled RNAP holoenzymes were combined with a double-stranded DNA fragment containing the T5N25 promoter (shown in Fig. 2A), and changes in fluorescence were monitored. Upon addition of promoter DNA to RNAP holoenzymes containing mutant σ with 5-TMR attached to residue 192 or 5-TMR, BODIPY FL, or ATTO-520 attached to residue 211, the fluorescent signal increased ∼5-fold and saturated in a few minutes. A typical trace, obtained with RNAP holoenzyme containing (211Cys-TMR) σ70 and a DNA fragment containing the T5N25 promoter, is shown in Fig. 2B. Similar increases were observed when DNA fragments containing the T7 A1 or lacUV5 promoters were used. Although the interaction between RNAP holoenzyme beacons and promoter-containing DNA fragments was readily detected at 0.5 nm promoter concentration, no signal increase was observed upon mixing free (211Cys-TMR) σ70 with 500 nm promoter fragments, indicating, in agreement with previous data, that free σ70 is unable to specifically interact with promoters (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 2Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Several control experiments were performed to prove that the interaction detected in the protein beacon assay is specific. In one experiment, the interaction of a 35-nt-long double-stranded “upstream” promoter fragment containing the UP element and the −35 element but truncated at position −23 and therefore lacking the −10 promoter element (Fig. 2A) with RNAP was studied. Because RNAP elements that can sequence-specifically interact with this fragment are remote from σ region 2.3, the expectation was that RNAP binding to this promoter fragment should not lead to an increase in the fluorescence signal intensity. Indeed, we found that the addition of 100 nm of upstream fragment to RNAP-(211Cys-TMR) σ70 resulted in a fluorescence intensity increase that was 10 times lower than that generated by 2 nm of T5N25 promoter DNA (data not shown). The residual weak fluorescence intensity increase may be caused by nonspecific binding of upstream probe to σ70 region 2.3. The rate of signal increase caused by the addition of T5N25 promoter DNA to RNAP-(211Cys-TMR) σ70 was considerably slowed down by the presence of 100 nm of the upstream fragment (Fig. 2B), indicating that this fragment bound RNAP and competed for the binding with T5N25 DNA. Specific interaction of oligonucleotide whose sequence corresponded to positions −18 to +1 of the λ phage pR′ promoter non-template strand with the σ70 holoenzyme was previously reported by Marr and Roberts (8Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), who used biochemical methods (a gel retardation assay) to show that the interaction is characterized by a Kd of 3 nm and that a substitution of a T at position −12 at the upstream end of the −10 consensus element by a C decreased the interaction 5-fold. We determined dissociation constants for oligonucleotides identical to those used by Marr and Roberts (8Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with RNAP beacons based on (211Cys-TMR) σ70, (211Cys-BODIPY FL) σ70, and (192Cys-TMR) σ70 (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). Although dissociation constants for “wild-type” oligo C (Kd(C)) and mutant oligo M Kd(M) varied within a factor of 5 (from 6.2 to 28.8 nm for oligo C) for different beacons, individual Kd(M)/Kd(C) ratios were close to 4 for every beacon tested (supplemental Table S1). The ratios of Kd values are in good agreement with the Marr and Roberts data (8Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The differences in apparent binding constant values observed with individual beacons and in gel retardation assay could be at least partially due to the fact that some part of free energy of oligonucleotide binding must be used to disrupt the van der Waals interaction of the fluorophore with the quencher. If so, then dissociation constants calculated using the beacon assay are expected to be somewhat higher than the actual values for unmodified RNAP, as is indeed observed. An oligo that contained nucleotides most rarely found at each position of the −10 hexamer (oligo A of Marr and Roberts (8Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) did not generate any signal (supplemental Fig. S1). The Kd value for oligo A was determined from a competition binding experiment with oligo C as a reference and found to be 15-fold lower than Kd for oligo C. Precise quantification of partial contributions of region 2.3 aromatic residues to fluorescence quenching is complicated by their involvement in the −10 element binding (27Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol.

We found that (211Cys-TMR) σ70 holoenzyme carrying a double substitution of Trp-433 and Trp-444 to Ala exhibited less than 10% increased fluorescence in the presence of 200 nm promoter DNA (data not shown). The absence of increased fluorescence was not caused by the inability of the holoenzyme carrying fluorescently labeled W433A,W434A σ70 to bind to promoter DNA, as evidenced by gel retardation analysis (data not shown), and is in agreement with the fact that a σ70 RNAP mutant bearing four amino acid substitutions W433A, W434A, F427A, and Y430A forms complexes that resemble those formed by wild-type RNAP (33Sun L. Dove S.L. Panaghie G. deHaseth P.L. Hochschild A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of (211Cys-TMR) σ70 enhanced the TMR fluorescence intensity 3.8-fold (data not shown), which can be explained by breaking of TMR contacts with the aromatic residue quenchers. In contrast, similar digestion of (211Cys-TMR, W433A,W434A) σ70 resulted in only 8% signal increase. These results indicate that Trp-433 and Trp-434 indeed play an important role in the 211Cys-TMR fluorescence quenching. If increased fluorescence observed in the presence of promoter DNA were due to formation of promoter complexes, then a decrease in fluorescence intensity should be observed upon RNAP escape from promoter into elongation. To test this prediction, nucleotide triphosphates and unlabeled σ70 (10-fold excess as compared with the labeled σ70 protein) were added to preincubated reactions containing fluorescent RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA (Fig. 2C). Unlabeled σ70 was added to prevent recapturing of dissociated fluorescently labeled σ by the core, which could have led to reformation of promoter complexes with fluorescently labeled holoenzyme. As can be seen, fluorescence decreased upon the addition of nucleotide triphosphates and unlabeled σ by 2.5-fold. This effect was not observed in the presence of 1 μm Rifampicin, a drug that prevents RNAP escape from promoter. We interpret this result as suggesting that a decrease in fluorescence in the absence of rifampicin is due to RNAP leaving the promoter, which leads to disruption of σ contacts with DNA. Based on the data presented above, we conclude that our PET-based protein beacon assay is behaving as expected from design and that RNAP holoenzymes containing fluorescently"
https://openalex.org/W2017546741,"In this paper we investigate the definition and formation of financial networks. Specifically, we study the influence of the time scale on their construction.For our analysis we use correlation-based networks obtained from the daily closing prices of stock market data. More precisely, we use the stocks that currently comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and estimate financial networks where nodes correspond to stocks and edges correspond to none vanishing correlation coefficients. That means only if a correlation coefficient is statistically significant different from zero, we include an edge in the network. This construction procedure results in unweighted, undirected networks. By separating the time series of stock prices in non-overlapping intervals, we obtain one network per interval. The length of these intervals corresponds to the time scale of the data, whose influence on the construction of the networks will be studied in this paper.Numerical analysis of four different measures in dependence on the time scale for the construction of networks allows us to gain insights about the intrinsic time scale of the stock market with respect to a meaningful graph-theoretical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2039250316,"Sexual reproduction in higher plants relies upon the polarised growth of pollen tubes. The growth-site at the pollen tube tip responds to signalling processes to successfully steer the tube to an ovule. Essential features of pollen tube growth are polarisation of ion fluxes, intracellular ion gradients, and oscillating dynamics. However, little is known about how these features are generated and how they are causally related. We propose that ion dynamics in biological systems should be studied in an integrative and self-regulatory way. Here we have developed a two-compartment model by integrating major ion transporters at both the tip and shank of pollen tubes. We demonstrate that the physiological features of polarised growth in the pollen tube can be explained by the localised distribution of transporters at the tip and shank. Model analysis reveals that the tip and shank compartments integrate into a self-regulatory dynamic system, however the oscillatory dynamics at the tip do not play an important role in maintaining ion gradients. Furthermore, an electric current travelling along the pollen tube contributes to the regulation of ion dynamics. Two candidate mechanisms for growth-induced oscillations are proposed: the transition of tip membrane into shank membrane, and growth-induced changes in kinetic parameters of ion transporters. The methodology and principles developed here are applicable to the study of ion dynamics and their interactions with other functional modules in any plant cellular system."
https://openalex.org/W2122467523,"The multi-functional histone variant Htz1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae H2A.Z) is acetylated on up to four N-terminal lysines at positions 3, 8, 10, and 14. It has thus been posited that specific acetylated forms of the histone could regulate distinct roles. Antibodies against Htz1-K8Ac, -K10Ac, and -K14Ac show that all three modifications are added by Esa1 acetyltransferase and removed by Hda1 deacetylase. Completely unacetylatable htz1 alleles exhibit widespread interactions in genome scale genetic screening. However, singly mutated (e.g. htz1-K8R) or singly acetylable (e.g. the triple mutant htz1-K3R/K10R/K14R) alleles show no significant defects in these analyses. This suggests that the N-terminal acetylations on Htz1 are internally redundant. Further supporting this proposal, each acetylation decays with similar kinetics when Htz1 transcription is repressed, and proteomic screening did not find a single condition in which one Htz1Ac was differentially regulated. However, whereas the individual acetylations on Htz1 may be redundant, they are not dispensable. Completely unacetylatable htz1 alleles display genetic interactions and phenotypes in common with and distinct from htz1Δ. In addition, each Htz1 N-terminal lysine is deacetylated by Hda1 in response to benomyl and reacetylated when this agent is removed. Such active regulation suggests that acetylation plays a significant role in Htz1 function.

Chromatin is the highly ordered assembly that packages eukaryotic DNA and regulates nuclear processes such as replication, repair, and transcription. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle: ∼146 bp of DNA wrapped around a core histone octamer composed of a (H3-H4)2 tetramer and two (H2A-H2B) dimers (1Luger K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The major histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are each encoded by multi-copy genes, highly expressed during the S phase, and deposited in chromatin during DNA replication. Histone variants are nonallelic isoforms that are usually (although not exclusively (2Dryhurst D. Ishibashi T. Rose K.L. Eirín-López J.M. McDonald D. Silva-Moreno B. Veldhoen N. Helbing C.C. Hendzel M.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Ausió J. BMC Biol. 2009; 7: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) encoded by single copy genes. In many cases variants can substitute for the major histones in specific nucleosomes through the action of dedicated deposition machineries (3Henikoff S. Furuyama T. Ahmad K. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 320-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Both major and variant histones are subject to extensive post-translational modification by the addition of small chemical moieties, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitylation (4Latham J.A. Dent S.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These groups are thought to regulate access to the DNA in the modified nucleosome by various means, including directly modulating the charge on the nucleosome surface or generating sites for the recruitment of regulatory proteins (5Taverna S.D.

Biol. 2007; 14: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Histone H2A has one of the largest variant families and includes H2A.Z, a protein that is highly conserved across eukaryotes but differs considerably from the major H2A in each species (7Mehta M. Kim H.S. Keogh M.C. J. Biol. 2010; 9: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). H2A.Z has been ascribed a large number of roles (8Raisner R.M. Madhani H.D. Curr. Opin. Gen Dev. 2006; 16: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Zlatanova J. Thakar A.

Veenstra T.D. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2009; 461: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and stabilizing the association of condensin with mitotic chromosomes (11Kim H.S. Vanoosthuyse V. Fillingham J. Roguev A. Watt S. Kislinger T. Treyer A. Carpenter L.R. Bennett C.S. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Hardwick K.G. Krogan N.J. Bähler J. Keogh M.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We still have a poor understanding of precisely how the variant mediates any specific function, although differential enrichment at specific locations and distinct post-translational modifications are likely to contribute. In all species examined, their respective H2A.Zs are subject to multiple N-terminal tail acetylations (12Thambirajah A.A. Li A. Ishibashi T. Ausió J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Ishibashi T. Dryhurst D. Rose K.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5007-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This modification is integral to fission yeast H2A.Z function, with completely unacetylatable alleles phenocopying complete deletion of the histone in genome scale transcriptome and genetic analyses (11Kim H.S. Vanoosthuyse V. Fillingham J. Roguev A. Watt S. Kislinger T. Treyer A. Carpenter L.R. Bennett C.S. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Hardwick K.G. Krogan N.J. Bähler J. Keogh M.C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, many of these ascribed functions were derived from completely unacetylatable alleles, so the importance of any individual acetylation is unclear. Finally, it is also unknown whether the effects of any of these modifications are direct (e.g. steric hindrance or charge modulation) or indirect (e.g. via the recruitment of regulatory proteins). S. cerevisiae SWR complex whole cell extract thiabendazole correlation coefficient synthetic sick/lethal. In this work we examine the regulation and function of four individual acetylations on the Sc H2A.Z (gene name HTZ1) N terminus: K3Ac, K8Ac, K10Ac, and K14Ac. We have raised antibodies to the latter three acetyl forms and show that each is chromatin-associated and primarily regulated by the NuA4 acetyltransferase and Hda1 deacetylase complexes. We have identified a range of novel Htz1Ac regulators, all of which have equivalent effects on K8Ac, K10Ac, and K14Ac. This suggests that each acetylation is redundant, a proposal supported by epistasis mapping analyses of a comprehensive panel of unacetylatable htz1 alleles. However, N-terminal acetylation is important for Htz1 function, and completely unacetylatable htz1 alleles show a large number of genetic interactions in common with and distinct from htz1Δ. Furthermore, each Htz1Ac is actively regulated in response to benomyl, a microtubule destabilizing agent. Thus our results indicate that N-terminal acetylation is important for the Htz1 function, but the cell does not distinguish between individual acetylated lysines on this histone. The antibodies and strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified anti-Sc Htz1-K8Ac, -K10Ac, and -K14Ac were from Millipore, with αK14Ac described previously (16Keogh M.C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For each new target (αK3Ac, αK8Ac, and αK10Ac) five rabbits (prescreened for minimal reactivity to Sc proteins) were immunized (peptides as in Fig. 1A coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin), and test bleeds/boosts were performed monthly. Initial screening of each bleed was by immunoblotting against whole cell extracts (WCEs) from WT and htz1Δ cells. Attempts to raise αK3Ac failed at this stage because all rabbits failed to raise a detectable immune response (not shown). Higher titer sera (usable at >1/200 dilution) from each rabbit were then tested for specificity against WCEs from unacetylatable htz1 point mutant cells (e.g. htz1-K8R; see Fig. 1B). Specificity was further characterized by Luminex bead assay against a comprehensive peptide panel, including the relative immunogen, its acetylated form, and all other acetyl peptides from the immunization series (supplemental Fig. S1). These analyses confirmed the absence of cross-reaction with an inappropriate Htz1Ac species. To derive preparations for this study, positive bleeds from optimal responders were pooled, affinity-purified on the immunizing acetyl peptide, and subtracted with the relevant unmodified peptide. Sc cell fractionations were as described (16Keogh M.C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The total, cytoplasmic, nuclear, and chromatin fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Various unacetylatable point mutants at HTZ1 (4KR, K3R, K3Ac*, etc.) were created by a modified Delitto Perfetto approach (17Storici F. Resnick M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in a “magic marker” strain compatible with the synthetic genetic array protocol (18Tong A. Boone C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar) (KFY1069; see supplemental Table S2). In brief, HTZ1 was first replaced by a [KanR/URA3] cassette. The htz1 ORF was then PCR-amplified from Sc genomic DNA (with the desired mutation inserted by megapriming (19Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), and the product was transformed into exponentially growing cells. Colonies that replaced [KanR/URA3] with htz1 by homologous recombination were identified on 5-fluoroorotic acid (which counterselects URA3) and confirmed by sequencing. To construct htz1-NΔ, the loxP-KanMX-loxP cassette from pOM10 (20Gauss R. Trautwein M. Sommer T. Spang A. Yeast. 2005; 22: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used to replace the N terminus of htz1 (residues 3–14, including all four acetylatable lysines; see Fig. 1A) in situ. Cre-induced recombination resulted in cassette removal with retention of the 24-residue loxP element. In the final step a Nourseothricin resistance cassette (NAT) was incorporated immediately downstream of each htz1 to facilitate locus selection during synthetic genetic array (21Tong A.H. Boone C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). An HTZ1::NAT locus-tracking strain was also created as a WT control. Growth curves were monitored with a Bioscreen C (Oy Growth Curves). Seed cultures were grown to mid-log in nonselective medium and diluted to A600 ≤ 0.1 in medium with the appropriate agents, e.g. synthetic complete ± 6-azauracil (6AU) or mycophenolic acid (MPA), YPD ± benomyl, TBZ, or camptothecin. All of the analyses were performed in triplicate, and A600 curves (30 °C, constant agitation, 15-min time points) were monitored for >48 h. Translational shut-off: Cycloheximide (final concentration, 35 μg/ml (22Fillingham J. Recht J. Silva A.C. Suter B. Emili A. Stagljar I. Krogan N.J. Allis C.D. Keogh M.C. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4342-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) was added to exponentially growing cultures (A600 = ∼0.5), and 5-ml aliquots were taken at the indicated intervals for WCE isolation (TCA method; see below). Target abundance was estimated by immunoblotting at each time point (see Fig. 3A). To create GAL1p.HTZ1.HA3, the GAL1 promoter was integrated by homologous recombination to replace the endogenous promoter upstream of HTZ1.HA3. Immunoblotting (αHA) confirmed that comparable Htz1.HA3 levels are derived from each promoter in YPGR (2% galactose, 1% raffinose) medium (not shown). An exponentially growing GAL1p.HTZ1.HA3 culture (A600 = ∼0.5 in YPGR) was collected by centrifugation, washed in double distilled H2O, and resuspended in YPD (containing 2% glucose to repress transcription from GAL1p). Aliquots were taken at the indicated intervals for WCE isolation. Target abundance was estimated by immunoblotting at each time point (see Fig. 3, B and C). Genetic interactions were determined by the partially automated synthetic genetic array method (21Tong A.H. Boone C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). htz1 alleles in the magic marker background (supplemental Table S2) were mated in quadruplicate to either a mutant library of 1,286 factors involved in chromatin metabolism (23Collins S.R.

All of the libraries were arrayed at 1536 colony density/12.5 × 8.5-cm plate and replica plated with a Singer RoToR. The growth of all double-mutant haploid daughters was compared with the respective single-mutant parents to identify and quantify positive or negative genetic interactions (26Collins S.R.

Nature. 2007; 446: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), the genetic profile of each htz1 allele was compared within a set of 2,255 profiles to calculate pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients. WCEs were isolated by the TCA method, which efficiently extracts chromatin and preserves labile modifications (28Keogh M.C. Kim J.A. Downey M. Fillingham J. Chowdhury D. Harrison J.C. Onishi M. Datta N. Galicia S. Emili A. Lieberman J. Shen X. Buratowski S. Haber J.E. Durocher D. Greenblatt J.F. Krogan N.J. Nature. 2006; 439: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼10-ml cultures were grown to mid-log (A600 = ∼1.0), and cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 20% TCA. All further steps were performed on ice with prechilled solutions. Cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of 20% TCA and subjected to glass bead lysis. The suspension minus the glass beads was collected, 1 ml of 5% TCA was added, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The pellets were washed with 750 μl of 100% ethanol, and the proteins were solubilized in 50 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, 0.2% bromphenol blue). After 5 min at 95 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed further by immunoblotting. Sc H2A.Z (Htz1) has four acetylatable lysines on its N terminus at positions 3, 8, 10, and 14 (Fig. 1A) (14Babiarz J.E. Halley J.E. Rine J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Keogh M.C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K.

Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Antibodies to each modification would greatly aid in their analysis. We have previously described anti-Htz1-K14Ac (αK14Ac) in detail (16Keogh M.C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and have now raised αK8Ac and αK10Ac (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Attempts to raise αK3Ac were unsuccessful (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each reagent (αK8Ac, αK10Ac, and αK14Ac) shows strong specificity for its respective target in immunoblotting, losing recognition if the appropriate lysine is mutated to arginine (e.g. K10R; Fig. 1B). These antibodies also indicate that individual Htz1 N-terminal acetylations show no interdependence (e.g. K10Ac is not impacted by K3R, K8R, or K14R) or compensation (e.g. K10Ac levels do not increase relative to WT if K10 is the sole acetylatable residue on the Htz1 N terminus) (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). The abundance of Htz1 K8Ac, K10Ac, and K14Ac are strongly reduced on deletion of SWR1, the eponymous ATPase subunit of the SWR complex (SWR-C; Fig. 1C). Because Swr1 is required for the insertion of Htz1 into nucleosomes (30Krogan N.J. Keogh M.C. Datta N. Sawa C. Ryan O.W. Ding H. Haw R.A. Pootoolal J. Tong A. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Wu X. Emili A.

Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), this indicates that all three lysines are acetylated after chromatin assembly. Cell fractionation confirmed that each Htz1Ac is chromatin-associated (Fig. 1C) and further that its acetylation status does not regulate entry to this cellular compartment (supplemental Fig. S3). The Esa1 and Gcn5 acetyltransferases or Hda1 deacetylase are each reported to regulate the acetylation of Htz1 (15Millar C.B. Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Keogh M.C. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In direct analyses K8Ac, K10Ac, and K14Ac are abolished in cells containing mutants of NuA4, including a temperature-sensitive allele of Esa1 (esa1-L254P) or deletion of various complex subunits (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast gcn5Δ has no effect on K8Ac, K10Ac, or K14Ac levels (Fig. 1D), although we note that Gcn5 could still target Htz1-K3Ac; this could not be determined without an antibody to the latter modification. Regarding the deacetylation of Htz1, Hda1 has been shown to target Htz1-K14Ac (32Lin Y.Y. Qi Y. Lu J.Y. Pan X. Yuan D.S. Zhao Y. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this and determined that Hda1 also deacetylates K8Ac and K10Ac (Fig. 1F). Thus three distinct Htz1Ac species are chromatin-associated and metabolized by the same enzymes in rapidly growing cells. To determine whether each Htz1 acetylation could have a specific role, we tested the genetic interactions of a comprehensive range of unacetylatable alleles. A number of synthetic genetic array compatible strains were created, including complete deletion (htz1Δ), N-terminal deletion (NΔ), all four lysines mutated to arginine (4KR) or glutamine (4KQ), each individual lysine mutated to arginine (e.g. K3R) or glutamine (e.g. K3Q), or a single remaining acetylatable residue (e.g. K8R/K10R/K14R = K3Ac*). A locus-marked HTZ1::NAT strain was also created as a WT control. In immunoblotting each mutant was expressed at similar levels to WT with the exception of htz1-NΔ, which is weakly hypomorphic (not shown). Notably this hypomorphism is also seen with a comparable allele of Schizosaccharomyces pombe H2A.Z (pht1-NΔ) (11Kim H.S. Vanoosthuyse V. Fillingham J. Roguev A. Watt S. Kislinger T. Treyer A.

Thus deletions of individual members of the SWR-C are highly correlated with htz1Δ and NΔ (Fig. 2A, green nodes). This is expected because SWR-C is required for the insertion of Htz1 into chromatin (Fig. 1C) (30Krogan N.J. Keogh M.C. Datta N. Sawa C. Ryan O.W. Ding H. Haw R.A. Pootoolal J. Tong A. Canadien V.

The profiles for htz1Δ, NΔ, 4KR, and 4KQ are also highly correlated (Fig. 2A), suggesting that significant functionality of Htz1 resides in its N terminus and furthermore that the primary role of this region is to harbor the acetylations. Indeed the 4KR and 4KQ profiles were most similar to NΔ within those 2,255 profiles collated to date (Fig. 2B) (23Collins S.R. Miller K.M. Maas N.L. Roguev A. Fillingham J. Chu C.S. Schuldiner M.

Furthermore the 4KR and 4KQ profiles were themselves very highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) 0.876; Fig. 2C), suggesting that the charge on these residues does not regulate their function (see “Discussion”). In contrast to the widespread genetic interactions of completely unacetylatable htz1 alleles, single point (e.g. K3R) or singly acetylatable (e.g. K3Ac*) mutants gave few consistent interactions and clustered near the wild-type control (Fig. 2A, white node). Thus the loss of any single Htz1 acetylation does not confer a genotype strong enough to distinguish the allele, suggesting no significant loss-of-function in any case. Because the retention of any single acetylatable lysine has a similar effect, this suggests that the individual Htz1 acetylations are redundant. Closer inspection of the individual genetic interactions for htz1Δ, NΔ, 4KR, and 4KQ revealed many that are common between these four mutants. This includes SS/SL interactions with components of the PAF complex (RTF1 and CDC73), the replication checkpoint complex (CSM3 and MRC1), and the chromatin regulators BRE1, SET2, and SET3 (Fig. 2D). However, and as expected given their imperfect CCs, htz1Δ also shows many interactions distinct from the completely unacetylatable alleles. This may be related to the loss of the Htz1 core domain or C terminus in the complete deletion (see “Discussion”). For example, we observed SS/SL interactions between htz1Δ and components of the Isw1, Ino80, and Elongator complexes, as well as factors involved in kinetochore (MCM16, MCM21, and MCM22) and spindle (MAD2, MAD3, and RAD61) function. Finally, we also observed SS/SL interactions common to htz1Δ and NΔ but not shared by 4KR or 4KQ, such as with components of the Rpd3L deacetylase complex (Fig. 2D). These last may be related to the hypomorphic nature of the NΔ allele or indicate that the tail contains functional residues other than the acetylatable lysines. To more comprehensively investigate the various pathways in which Htz1Ac may play a role, we further mated the NΔ or 4KR strains against two libraries that together cover >95% of the entire Sc genome: ∼4800 nonessential deletions (24Winzeler E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2058317852,"5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) is formed by a side reaction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Unlike other folates, it is not a one-carbon donor but a potent inhibitor of folate enzymes and must therefore be metabolized. Only 5-CHO-THF cycloligase (5-FCL) is generally considered to do this. However, comparative genomic analysis indicated (i) that certain prokaryotes lack 5-FCL, implying that they have an alternative 5-CHO-THF-metabolizing enzyme, and (ii) that the histidine breakdown enzyme glutamate formiminotransferase (FT) might moonlight in this role. A functional complementation assay for 5-CHO-THF metabolism was developed in Escherichia coli, based on deleting the gene encoding 5-FCL (ygfA). The deletion mutant accumulated 5-CHO-THF and, with glycine as sole nitrogen source, showed a growth defect; both phenotypes were complemented by bacterial or archaeal genes encoding FT. Furthermore, utilization of supplied 5-CHO-THF by Streptococcus pyogenes was shown to require expression of the native FT. Recombinant bacterial and archaeal FTs catalyzed formyl transfer from 5-CHO-THF to glutamate, with k(cat) values of 0.1-1.2 min(-1) and K(m) values for 5-CHO-THF and glutamate of 0.4-5 μM and 0.03-1 mM, respectively. Although the formyltransferase activities of these proteins were far lower than their formiminotransferase activities, the K(m) values for both substrates relative to their intracellular levels in prokaryotes are consistent with significant in vivo flux through the formyltransferase reaction. Collectively, these data indicate that FTs functionally replace 5-FCL in certain prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1992185330,"Abnormal adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium has been linked to the pathophysiology of several diseases associated with vascular disorders. Various biochemical changes, including phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer membrane of red blood cells as well as plasma protein levels, have been identified as being likely to play a key role, but the detailed interplay between plasma factors and cellular factors remains unknown. It has been proposed that the adhesion-promoting effect of plasma proteins originates from ligand interaction, but evidence substantiating this assumption is often missing. In this work, we identified an alternative pathway by demonstrating that nonadsorbing macromolecules can also have a marked impact on the adhesion efficiency of red blood cells with enhanced phosphatidylserine exposure to endothelial cells. It is concluded that this adhesion-promoting effect originates from macromolecular depletion interaction and thereby presents an alternative mechanism by which plasma proteins could regulate cell-cell interactions. These findings should thus be of potential value for a detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases associated with vascular complications and might be applicable to a wide range of cell-cell interactions in plasma or plasma-like media."
https://openalex.org/W2072709793,"Voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels are used in eukaryotic organisms for the purpose of electrochemical signaling. There are prokaryotic homologues to major eukaryotic channels of these sorts, including voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, Ach-receptor and glutamate-receptor channels. The prokaryotic homologues have been less well characterized functionally than their eukaryotic counterparts. In this study we identify likely prokaryotic functional counterparts of eukaryotic glutamate receptor channels by comprehensive analysis of the prokaryotic sequences in the context of known functional domains present in the eukaryotic members of this family. In particular, we searched the nonredundant protein database for all proteins containing the following motif: the two sections of the extracellular glutamate binding domain flanking two transmembrane helices. We discovered 100 prokaryotic sequences containing this motif, with a wide variety of functional annotations. Two groups within this family have the same topology as eukaryotic glutamate receptor channels. Group 1 has a potassium-like selectivity filter. Group 2 is most closely related to eukaryotic glutamate receptor channels. We present analysis of the functional domain architecture for the group of 100, a putative phylogenetic tree, comparison of the protein phylogeny with the corresponding species phylogeny, consideration of the distribution of these proteins among classes of prokaryotes, and orthologous relationships between prokaryotic and human glutamate receptor channels. We introduce a construct called the Evolutionary Domain Network, which represents a putative pathway of domain rearrangements underlying the domain composition of present channels. We believe that scientists interested in ion channels in general, and ligand-gated ion channels in particular, will be interested in this work. The work should also be of interest to bioinformatics researchers who are interested in the use of functional domain-based analysis in evolutionary and functional discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2005980128,"Overexpression of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 leads to inclusion formation in response to proteasome impairment. These inclusions contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and α-synuclein confirming that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in protein aggregation. The processes involved are very complex and so we have chosen to take a systems biology approach to examine the system whereby we combine mathematical modelling with experiments in an iterative process. The experiments show that cells are very heterogeneous with respect to inclusion formation and so we use stochastic simulation. The model shows that the variability is partly due to stochastic effects but also depends on protein expression levels of UCH-L1 within cells. The model also indicates that the aggregation process can start even before any proteasome inhibition is present, but that proteasome inhibition greatly accelerates aggregation progression. This leads to less efficient protein degradation and hence more aggregation suggesting that there is a vicious cycle. However, proteasome inhibition may not necessarily be the initiating event. Our combined modelling and experimental approach show that stochastic effects play an important role in the aggregation process and could explain the variability in the age of disease onset. Furthermore, our model provides a valuable tool, as it can be easily modified and extended to incorporate new experimental data, test hypotheses and make testable predictions."

Expressions of P63, ABCG2 and K14/K5 have all been linked to mammalian corneal epithelial stem cells. Here we report on the limitations of K14/K5 as a limbal stem cell marker.K14/K5 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and Real time PCR and compared between bovine epithelial cells in the limbus and central cornea. A functional study was also included to investigate changes in K5/14 expression within cultured limbal epithelial cells undergoing forced differentiation. K14 expression (or its partner K5) was detected in quiescent epithelial cells from both the limbal area and central cornea. K14 was localized predominantly to basal epithelial cells in the limbus and suprabasal epithelial cells in the central cornea. Western blotting revealed K14 expression in both limbus and central cornea (higher levels in the limbus). Similarly, quantitative real time PCR found K5, partner to K14, to be expressed in both the central cornea and limbus. Following forced differentiation in culture the limbal epithelial cells revealed an increase in K5/14 gene/protein expression levels in concert with a predictable rise in a known differentiation marker.K14 and its partner K5 are limited not only to the limbus but also to the central bovine cornea epithelial cells suggesting K14/K5 is not limbal specific in situ. Furthermore K14/K5 expression levels were not lowered (in fact they increased) within a limbal epithelial cell culture undergoing forced differentiation suggesting K14/K5 is an unreliable maker for undifferentiated cells ex vivo."

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, an intracellular high affinity (2.3 × 10−19 m) Fe3+ bridge is reported as a novel approach to regulating channel gating. It inhibited CFTR activity by primarily reducing an open probability and an opening rate, and inhibition was reversed by EDTA and phenanthroline. His-950, His-954, Cys-832, His-775, and Asp-836 were found essential for inhibition and phosphorylated Ser-768 may enhance Fe3+ binding. More importantly, inhibition by Fe3+ was state-dependent. Sensitivity to Fe3+ was reduced when the channel was locked in an open state by AMP-PNP. Similarly, a K978C mutation from cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3), which promotes ATP-independent channel opening, greatly weakened inhibition by Fe3+ no matter whether NBD2 was present or not. Therefore, although ATP binding-induced dimerization of NBD1-NBD2 is required for channel gating, regulation of CFTR activity by Fe3+ may involve an interaction between the R domain and CL3. These findings may support proximity of the R domain to the cytoplasmic loops.

https://openalex.org/W2024118596,"Background We have developed multiple stable cell lines containing subgenomic HCV RNA that are resistant to treatment with interferon alpha (IFN-α. Characterization of these IFN-α resistant replicon cells showed defects in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins due to a defective Jak-STAT pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have developed an alternative strategy to overcome interferon resistance in a cell culture model by improving intracellular STAT1 signaling. An engineered STAT1-CC molecule with double cysteine substitutions in the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains of STAT1 (at Ala-656 and Asn-658) efficiently phosphorylates and translocates to the nucleus of IFN-resistant cells in an IFN-γ dependent manner. Transfection of a plasmid clone containing STAT1-CC significantly activated the GAS promoter compared to wild type STAT1 and STAT3. The activity of the engineered STAT1-CC is dependent upon the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 701, since the construct with a substituted phenylalanine residue at position 701 (STAT1-CC-Y701F) failed to activate GAS promoter in the replicon cells. Intracellular expression of STAT1-CC protein showed phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in the resistant cell line after IFN-γ treatment. Transient transfection of STAT1-CC plasmid clone into an interferon resistant cell line resulted in inhibition of viral replication and viral clearance in an IFN-γ dependent manner. Furthermore, the resistant replicon cells transfected with STAT1-CC constructs significantly up regulated surface HLA-1 expression when compared to the wild type and Y to F mutant controls. Conclusions These results suggest that modification of the SH2 domain of the STAT1 molecule allows for improved IFN-γ signaling through increased STAT1 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, HLA-1 surface expression, and prolonged interferon antiviral gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2041111848,"Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include the tick-transmitted causative agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. They possess unusual genomes composed mainly of linear replicons terminated by closed DNA hairpins. Hairpin telomeres are formed from inverted repeat replicated telomere junctions (rTels) by the telomere resolvase ResT. ResT uses a reaction mechanism similar to that of the type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. ResT can catalyze three distinct reactions: telomere resolution, telomere fusion, and Holliday junction (HJ) formation. HJ formation is known to occur only in the context of a synapsed pair of rTels. To test whether telomere resolution was synapsis-dependent, we performed experiments with rTel substrates immobilized on streptavidin-coated beads. We report that telomere resolution by ResT is synapsis-independent, indicating that alternative complexes are formed for telomere resolution and HJ formation. We also present evidence that dual hairpin telomere formation precedes product release. This mechanism of telomere resolution prevents the appearance of broken telomeres. We compare and contrast this mechanism with that proposed for TelK, the telomere resolvase of ϕKO2."

In this paper we consider how non-Western philosophies bring complexity to ideas of individual and community consent and confidentiality in the context of neurogenetics. Neurogenetics promises rich insights into how the mind works. Researchers investigating the range of topics from normal brain functioning to pathological states are increasingly looking to genetics for clues on human variability and disease etiology. Is it fair to assume this interest in neurogenetics is universal? How should researchers and clinicians approach ideas of consent to research or prediction of disease when a subject or patient understands the mind with concepts or language incompatible with neurogenetics? In this paper we consider how non-Western philosophies bring complexity to ideas of individual and community consent and confidentiality in the context of neurogenetics. Neurogenetics seeks to elucidate risk factors for neurological conditions based on the genes of individuals and the environment they live in. Neurogenetics falls under the umbrella of “personalized medicine,” and presents an opportunity to create individualized treatments for neurological conditions. Philosophically, neurogenetics is based on a positivistic and individualistic worldview. That is, the risk of disease for an individual can be measured and predicted through an objective scientific method (positivism) and that individual has an explicit right to make use of, and personally benefit from, his or her genetic material (individualism). The pursuit of neurogenetics is consistent with ideas of neuroessentialism: the brain is considered the “self-defining essence of a person” (Racine et al., 2010Racine E. Bell E. Illes J. Can we read minds?.in: Giordano J. Gordijn B. Scientific and Philosophical Perspectives in Neuroethics. Cambridge University Press, New York2010Google Scholar). Neurogenetics is constructed, ultimately, as the key for the blueprint (genetics) to understanding the self. Positivism and individualism are not universal values. In this article we explore ethical issues when conducting neurogenetic research with people from cultures that value communalism over individualism and that hold holistic, rather than reductionist, views on health and wellness. We will demonstrate the potential harms of leaving the foundational philosophical assumptions underlying neurogenetic science unchecked. In particular, we will consider indigenous concepts that render notions of “individual ownership” of genes problematic. There are implications for consent (individual and communal), confidentiality (individual and communal), benefit and relevance of research knowledge, and dissemination of research findings about indigenous communities. Although we focus on indigenous philosophy, the concerns we raise can be generalized to any group (e.g., religious, refugee, immigrant) that does not implicitly subscribe to Western scientific values. There is a growing literature on indigenous worldviews in the context of research (e.g., Wilson, 2008Wilson S. Research is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods. Fernwood Publishing, Black Point, Nova Scotia2008Google Scholar, Gillett and McKergow, 2007Gillett G. McKergow F. Soc. Sci. Med. 2007; 65: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Arbour and Cook, 2006Arbour L. Cook D. Community Genet. 2006; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although there is no “Pan-Indigenous” theory that covers all indigenous philosophy, there are commonalities for indigenous groups around the world. For example, in his book Research is Ceremony, Wilson, 2008Wilson S. Research is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods. Fernwood Publishing, Black Point, Nova Scotia2008Google Scholar explores the relational aspect of knowledge and knowledge generation common to both Canadian and Australian indigenous peoples. In Western ontology, knowledge is thought to reside with the individual and research seeks to extract knowledge from groups of individuals and physical phenomena in order to construct objective truth. In contrast, indigenous knowledge is relational, woven together from teachings received through all of one's relationships, including relationships with other people, with animals, with the Ancestors and with the land. The ethical framework of indigenous research is relational accountability that preserves and honors the relationships that give rise to the knowledge. Artifacts including bodily tissue and genetic material are not thought of as property: an indigenous person engages in stewardship rather than ownership of materials (Gillett and McKergow, 2007Gillett G. McKergow F. Soc. Sci. Med. 2007; 65: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Gillett discusses how “for some groups the removal and dissection of aspects of their being may require stringent protocols and respect for tradition” to ensure that the health of the people is not compromised, either individually or collectively. There are two high-profile examples of the consequences of researchers not attending to the protocols of the people they are studying. In 2006, Arbour and Cook, 2006Arbour L. Cook D. Community Genet. 2006; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar described the fight for the repatriation of genetic materials to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nation and the concept that DNA should be considered “on loan” from indigenous peoples, rather than the property of the researcher who collected it. Members of Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nation had offered their genetic materials for research for the purpose of understanding the high rates of arthritis affecting their community. In 2010, the Havasupai Native American tribe settled their 6 year lawsuit against scientists at Arizona State University (ASU) for unauthorized use of blood samples taken initially to search for genetic risk factors for diabetes (Santos, 2008Santos L. Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action. 2008; 2: 321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the leaders of these Nations and individual research subjects consented to the use of their tissue for investigating a single disease, only to discover that their tissues were being used to investigate a wide range of unauthorized questions, including genetic factors in schizophrenia and genetic ancestry. In addition to abrogating academic responsibility for informed consent about secondary uses for data, both research teams fundamentally disregarded the sacredness of the biological samples entrusted to them. Frank Dukepoo, a geneticist of Hopi and Laguna origin, explained that, “To us, any part of ourselves is sacred. Scientists say it's just DNA. For an Indian, it is not just DNA, it's part of a person; it is sacred, with deep religious significance. It is part of the essence of a person.” (Petit, 1998Petit, C. (1998). Trying to Study Tribes While Respecting Their Cultures: Hopi Indian geneticist can see both sides. San Francisco Chronicle. February 19, 1998. Archive at http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/02/19/MN61803.DTLGoogle Scholar.) The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserted in Article 31.1 that “Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources…” [United Nations (2007): www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/declaration.html] (italics added). Neurogenetics research with an indigenous group, therefore, must follow the group's protocols and traditions. Implicit in neurogenetics is a biomedical model of health that focuses primarily on biological processes. This model is not necessarily consistent with concepts of health used by religious groups (e.g., who supplement medical care with prayer) and other cultural groups who have developed other explanatory models for health and illness. Indigenous Canadians (First Nation, Inuit, Métis) define health broadly to incorporate the mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social aspects of health [NAHO (2007): http://www.naho.ca/english/publications/vaccho.pdf]. The health and well-being of communities and individuals are seen as interdependent. The determinants of health extend beyond genetic endowment and encompass history and politics through the enduring consequences of colonization. This has implications for the relevance and dissemination of neurogenetics research. It is useful to distinguish between community-driven research and research driven primarily by the curiosity of the researcher. The Nuu-Chal-Nulth and Havasupai Nations sought genetic information on clinical issues faced by their peoples. Their later objections were to the exploratory research to which they had not consented. Within a stewardship model, indigenous people are individually and collectively responsible for their heritage, and this responsibility includes all aspects of culture as well as genetics. Engaging in genetics research is not taken lightly because it holds the potential for disrupting culture. Just as indigenous concepts of health and wellness extend beyond the biomedical model, so do explanations of disease and illness. To reduce the understanding of illness to a genetic explanation may be a disservice to a community. Explanatory models of illness create order and meaning (Kleinman, 1978Kleinman A. Soc. Sci. Med. 1978; 12: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar), and influence the care that is given. By introducing genetic explanations about disorders—that offer, for the most part, only probabilities for developing an illness—there is a risk of destabilizing approaches to care within a community. Santos, 2008Santos L. Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and Action. 2008; 2: 321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar writes, “If academic research undermines the cultural fabric and beliefs of a group, it is tantamount to stripping them of traditions and practices that have also served as protective factors for generations.” Without first collaborating with a community to determine the relevance of the research question, the soundness of the methods, and the potential implications of the results, researchers could do harm merely by conducting the study (Caldwell et al., 2005Caldwell J.Y. Davis J.D. Du Bois B. Echo-Hawk H. Erickson J.S. Goins R.T. Hill C. Hillabrant W. Johnson S.R. Johnson S.R. et al.Am. Indian Alsk. Native Ment. Health Res. 2005; 12: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To explore issues of consent and confidentiality more deeply, we highlight research we are conducting in collaboration with a Canadian First Nation for whom there is a high incidence of dementia due to a genetic mutation that leads to early onset familial Alzheimer's Disease (EOFAD). Members of our research team identified the novel mutation in the Presenilin 1 (PS1) gene: the first reported genetic mutation leading to EOFAD in an Aboriginal population (Butler et al., 2010Butler R. Beattie B.L. Thong U.P. Dwosh E. Guimond C. Feldman H.H. Hsiung G.Y. Rogaeva E. St George-Hyslop P. Sadovnick A.D. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 2010; 37: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This genetic mutation is autosomal dominant with 100% penetrance. Age of onset in this extended pedigree is 47 to 59 years of age. The research team engaged the community in outreach activities to explain the genetic mutation, and continues to offer clinical services for genetic counseling and predictive and diagnostic genetic testing. To maintain community confidentiality publications of this mutation have not revealed the name of the First Nation. The neurogenetics research was followed by a neuroethics question: what is the meaning of EOFAD for this community? Using a community-based participatory approach, we brought together a research team that included Elders, band counselors, health professionals from the Nation, academics, and clinicians to identify research questions that were relevant to the Nation. The team learned that community members seek to achieve an understanding of EOFAD that integrates both medical and traditional approaches, and require access to research findings so that they are better equipped to make decisions around EOFAD prediction, diagnosis, and care. In the context of these goals, the team addressed the question of community confidentiality. On the one hand, there is potential harm for individuals and the community if the name of the community is revealed. For example, Norton and Manson, 1996Norton I.M. Manson S.M. J. Consult. Clin. Psychol. 1996; 64: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar described the dramatic consequences of an article in the New York Times in 1980 announcing that “Alcohol Plagues Eskimos.” Overnight the Standard and Poor bond rating of the local community dropped, and the community was unable to finance planned municipal projects. They became reluctant to engage in research activities, foregoing possible benefits from such participation. In the case of our research, we must explicitly attend to the potential harm to the community from discrimination, recognizing that public knowledge of the genetic mutation puts the Nation at risk for external and internal stigma and other adverse outcomes such as difficulties in securing extended health insurance whether or not one carries the mutation. On the other hand, as one team member who experienced life-long discrimination for being a First Nation person expressed, “I am not worried at all about the stigma because stereotyping has always been part of the First Nations… This one gene should not put a whole Nation at risk as being any different than any other ethnic group.” [GD.] GD added further concern about confidentiality, saying, “We won't be acknowledged for the work we will be contributing.” Mohat and Thomas, 2006Mohat, G.V., and Thomas, L.R. (2006). Ethical Dilemmas in Doing Participatory Research. In Handbook of Ethical Research with Ethnocultural Populations and Communities. J.E. Trimble and C.B. Fisher, eds.Google Scholar wrote: “In many Native cultures, not identifying yourself, your family, your homeland, and so forth is not acceptable.” Indeed, in keeping the name of participants and their community confidential, we as researchers could undermine the higher ethical principal of relational accountability. Moreover, in maintaining confidentiality, the Nation will be less able to act on the findings through public advocacy for future services, including a much-desired long-term care facility. There are also academic consequences to not naming the community. As researchers we are currently unable to refer to existing academic literature or community reports about this Nation in our publications and oral presentations and through digital media such as our website. We cannot use the Nation's language to describe their experiences and, as GD suggested, the philosophical premise of participatory research is compromised when participants are not acknowledged for their work. Closely aligned with the challenge of balancing community confidentiality is the challenge of consent: who can consent to reveal the name of a community? The requirement for community consent to identify a community in the dissemination of results appears in 10 out of 16 international guidelines for conducting research with indigenous communities (Weijer et al., 1999Weijer C. Goldsand G. Emanuel E.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, in many instances it is difficult to determine who has authority to speak on behalf of the community. Is it the traditional band council? Elected government? Both? How should individual research participants play a role in determining whether a community is identified, and what about people who have chosen not to participate but will be inevitably affected by public dissemination of the results? One legal scholar argues that, “The existence of a mutation in a family should be regarded as familial information, not capable of veto by one family member who does not want to share the information with other family members. Only the person's own status with regard to the mutation—positive or negative—should be within the person's control” (Skene, 2002Skene L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 48-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Similarly, Port et al., 2008Port R.V. Arnold J. Kerr D. Glavish N. Gravish N. Winship I. Clin. Genet. 2008; 73: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar suggest that in a hierarchical tribal context, the rights of the individual may be relinquished in favor of the rights of the tribe. Increasingly, Canadian researchers working with indigenous peoples are following the principles of OCAP that promote the collective Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession of data by the community [First Nations Centre (2007): www.naho.ca/firstnations/english/documents/FNC-OCAP_001.pdf]. It is not clear how to reconcile a community's right to self-determination for neurogenetics research as enacted through OCAP with established academic and clinical structures that have been created to protect individual confidentiality and enable researchers to have full access to data. To date, members of the First Nation with whom we are working have generally not sought predictive genetic testing. Low rates of uptake for predictive testing have been observed in other adult-onset neurological diseases, such as Huntington's. This may be explained by the potential social, economic, and ethical consequences that accompany predictive testing, including stigma and reduction of quality of life (Illes et al., 2007Illes J. Rosen A. Greicius M. Racine E. Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1097: 278-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we are seeking to learn how members of this Nation understand EOFAD within both traditional and medical frameworks. It is possible that disease prediction through neurogenetics represents a type of hubris. Perhaps in the absence of a cure or treatment for EOFAD, traditional understandings take precedence, and medical and scientific explanations are less relevant. More broadly, it is not clear who can speak on behalf of groups that are less well defined than this First Nation, or how to measure potential harms and risks to its members. Our paper seeks to encourage researchers to consider the sociocultural implications of their work beyond the science itself. The power of neurogenetics to explore and explain neurological variance and disease exists within the context of Western ideas of consent, ownership, confidentiality, and benefit. In research with indigenous peoples or other groups with non-Western cultural practices or moral philosophies, combining neurogenetic research with community-based participatory approaches can serve to maximize benefit while minimizing potential harm to individuals and to communities. In conducting research that demonstrates respect for the diversity of people and cultures through asking community-driven questions and using culturally appropriate methods, neurogenetics can address critical clinical concerns and has the potential to provide compelling options for prediction, diagnosis, and care of neurological diseases.
