https://openalex.org/W1983228128,"In humans, germline mutations of the WT-1 tumor suppressor gene are associated with both Wilms' tumors and urogenital malformations. To develop a model system for the molecular analysis of urogenital development, we introduced a mutation into the murine WT-1 tumor suppressor gene by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. The mutation resulted in embryonic lethality in homozygotes, and examination of mutant embryos revealed a failure of kidney and gonad development. Specifically, at day 11 of gestation, the cells of the metanephric blastema underwent apoptosis, the ureteric bud failed to grow out from the Wolffian duct, and the inductive events that lead to formation of the metanephric kidney did not occur. In addition, the mutation caused abnormal development of the mesothelium, heart, and lungs. Our results establish a crucial role for WT-1 in early urogenital development."

https://openalex.org/W1972384396,"The effectiveness of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a mechanism for information storage would be severely limited if processes that decrease synaptic strength did not also exist. In area CA1 of the rat hippocampus, prolonged periods of low-frequency afferent stimulation elicit a long-term depression (LTD) that is specific to the stimulated input. The induction of LTD was blocked by the extracellular application of okadaic acid or calyculin A, two inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. The loading of CA1 cells with microcystin LR, a membrane-impermeable protein phosphatase inhibitor, or calmodulin antagonists also blocked or attenuated LTD. The application of calyculin A after the induction of LTD reversed the synaptic depression, suggesting that phosphatase activity is required for the maintenance of LTD. These findings indicate that the synaptic activation of protein phosphatases plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2066030442,"Submaximal stimulation with agonists generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) evokes cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in many different cell types. In general, each Ca2+ rise is initiated from a specific region near the plasma membrane and then spreads as a wave throughout the cell. We now demonstrate that low (physiological) agonist concentrations evoke local cytosolic Ca2+ spikes in the secretory pole of single mouse pancreatic acinar cells that are particularly sensitive to blockade by the IP3 receptor antagonist heparin. These spikes can occur alone or repetitively or can precede longer lasting Ca2+ signals that spread throughout the cell. Intracellular IP3 application mimics these agonist actions. The short-lasting local Ca2+ spikes provide an economical signaling mechanism and are of physiological significance since they activate Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- and cation currents important for control of fluid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1565257873,"We have utilized the polymerase chain reaction technique to selectively amplify a G protein-coupled receptor cDNA from rat kidney proximal convoluted tubule mRNA, which exhibits high homology with previously cloned serotonin receptors. Sequencing of a full-length clone isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1,212 base pairs encoding a 404-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions predicted to represent transmembrane-spanning domains. Within the transmembrane regions, this receptor was found to be 44-50% identical with various members of the 5-HT1, 5-HT5, and 5-HT6 subfamilies with lower (37-40%) homology to the 5-HT2-like receptors. Northern blots revealed a approximately 3.6-kilobase transcript localized in various brain regions with the following rank order of abundance: hypothalamus > hippocampus = mesencephalon > cerebral cortex = olfactory bulb > olfactory tubercle. Expression of this clone in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of high affinity, saturable binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide ([3H]LSD; KD = 5 nM) and [3H]serotonin ([3H]5-HT; KD = 1 nM). Among endogenous biogenic amines, only 5-HT completely inhibited radioligand binding. The inhibition of radioligand binding by other serotonergic agents revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with any previously described serotonin receptor subtype. In addition, this receptor exhibits high affinity for a number of tricyclic antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs including clozapine, loxapine, and amitriptyline. In HEK-293 cells stably transfected with this receptor, serotonin elicits a potent stimulation of adenylylcyclase activity. The distinct structural and pharmacological properties of this receptor suggests that it represents a completely novel serotonin receptor subtype, which we propose to designate 5-HT7. Based on its pharmacology and its localization to limbic and cortical regions of the brain, it is likely that this receptor may play a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders that involve serotonergic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1965772541,"Transcripts for the class A Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunit (also known as BI) are present at high levels in many parts of the mammalian CNS and are widely assumed to encode the P-type Ca2+ channel. To characterize the biophysical and pharmacological properties of alpha 1A channels, macroscopic and single-channel recordings were made in Xenopus oocytes injected with alpha 1A cRNA. alpha 1-specific properties were identified by making systematic comparisons with the more familiar class C alpha 1 subunit under the condition of a standard ancillary subunit (alpha 2/delta + beta) makeup. alpha 1A currents activate and inactivate more rapidly and display steeper voltage dependence of gating than alpha 1C currents. Unlike alpha 1C, alpha 1A channels are largely insensitive to dihydropyridines and FPL 64176, but respond to the cone snail peptide omega-CTx-MVIIC(SNX-230), a potent and fairly selective inhibitor. In comparison with P-type Ca2+ channels in rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, alpha 1A channels in oocytes are approximately 10(2)-fold less sensitive to omega-Aga-IVA and approximately 10-fold more sensitive to omega-CTx-MVIIC. alpha 1A channels are not inhibited by Bay K 8644 and inactivate much more rapidly than P-type Ca2+ channels. Thus, alpha 1A is capable of generating a Ca2+ channel phenotype quite different from P-type current."

https://openalex.org/W2033250952,"Agonists trigger Ca2+ waves and oscillations in exocrine gland cells. Our confocal Ca2+ imaging revealed three distinct phases during the Ca2+ waves in the rat pancreatic acinar cell. Rises in Ca2+ concentration were initiated at a small trigger zone, or T zone, in the granular area; then, Ca2+ waves rapidly spread within the area and, at high agonist concentrations, propagated slowly toward the basal pole. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or Ca2+ from patch pipettes demonstrated the presence of high sensitivity IP3 receptors at the T zone, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release channels in the granular area, and low sensitivity IP3 receptors in the basal area. The IP3 receptors at the T zone appeared to generate autonomous Ca2+ spikes and to initiate patterned Ca2+ oscillations. Thus, heterogeneous cytosolic localization of Ca2+ release channels plays a key role in Ca2+ waves and oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2066780429,"Retinoic acid (RA) induces the neuronal differentiation of many human neuroblastoma cell lines. In this study, we show that RA treatment of neuroblastoma cells induces the expression of TrkB, the receptor for the neurotrophins BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5. BDNF addition to RA-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB and neuronal differentiation. RA treatment of KCNR neuroblastoma cells, which constitutively express BDNF mRNA, resulted in the expression of TrkB and differentiation in the absence of added BDNF. Finally, in 15N neuroblastoma cells, which express BDNF mRNA but do not differentiate in response to RA, RA induced only a truncated form of TrkB. 15N cells transfected with full-length TrkB differentiated in the absence of RA. These results indicate that RA induces the neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by modulating the expression of neurotrophin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2028351692,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PA-CAP) is a polypeptide hormone related to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Rat PACAP receptor cDNA was isolated from a brain cDNA library by cross-hybridization with rat VIP receptor cDNA. The recombinant PACAP receptor expressed in COS cells bound PACAP with about 1000 times higher affinity than VIP, and PACAP stimulated adenylate cyclase through the cloned PACAP receptor. The rat PACAP receptor consists of 495 amino acids, contains seven transmembrane segments, and has a significant similarity with other Gs-coupled receptors, such as VIP, glucagon, and secretin receptors. PACAP receptor mRNA was abundantly expressed in the brain, but not in the peripheral tissues except for the adrenal gland. In situ hybridization revealed a high level of expression of PACAP receptor mRNA in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellar cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1495025565,"The nuclear signaling pathways for retinoids and vitamin D differ in the specificity of the respective receptors for response elements. Two pathways for the action of both retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and vitamin D receptors (VDRs) have been identified, one being retinoid X receptor (RXR)-dependent and the other being RXR-independent. Moreover, RXRs were found to function as homodimers. In several steps we converted the retinoid specific response element of the human retinoic acid receptor beta promoter into the vitamin D/retinoic acid response element of the human osteocalcin promoter. We found that VDR homodimers only bind to the motif RGGTGA. The extended osteocalcin element also contains an imperfect direct repeat based on the motif RGGTGA spaced by three nucleotides, which is bound by RXR homodimers and activated by 9-cis-retinoic acid. The responsiveness of the osteocalcin element to all-trans-retinoic acid is mediated neither by RAR homodimers nor by RAR-RXR heterodimers. However, a VDR-RAR heterodimer binds to the osteocalcin response element and mediates activation by all-trans-retinoic acid. This heterodimer also binds to pure retinoid response elements, but it does not mediate activation by vitamin D alone. In combination with all-trans-retinoic acid, however, vitamin D enhances VDR-RAR heterodimer-mediated gene expression. This finding suggests a direct interaction between nuclear signaling by retinoic acid and vitamin D increasing the combinatorial possibilities for gene regulation by the nuclear receptors involved."

https://openalex.org/W2062438612,"The Escherichia coli Ada protein repairs methylphosphotriesters in DNA by direct, irreversible methyl transfer to one of its own cysteines. Upon methyl transfer, Ada acquires the ability to bind specific DNA sequences and thereby to induce genes that confer resistance to methylating agents. The amino-terminal domain of Ada, which comprises the methylphosphotriester repair and sequence-specific DNA binding elements, contains a tightly bound zinc ion. Analysis of the zinc binding site by cadmium-113 nuclear magnetic resonance and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that zinc participates in the autocatalytic activation of the active site cysteine and may also function as a conformational switch."
https://openalex.org/W1487396242,"Membrane-bound isozymes of steroid 5 alpha-reductase, designated 1 and 2, synthesize the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone. Isozyme 1 has an alkaline pH optimum (7.0-8.5), whereas isozyme 2 has an acidic pH optimum (5.0). To gain insight into this enigmatic difference, Chinese hamster ovarian cell lines expressing the human 5 alpha-reductase isozymes were established. The half-lives of both proteins are > 30 h and are not altered by the 4-azasteroid inhibitors finasteride and 17 beta-(N,N,-diethyl)carbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one. Nanomolar concentrations of finasteride block immunoprecipitation of isozyme 2 by antipeptide antibodies, which suggests that drug binding alters protein conformation. In contrast, finasteride (50 microM) has no effect on immunoprecipitation of isozyme 1. Both isozymes are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by immunocytochemistry and have their carboxyl termini exposed to the cytoplasm. In cell lysates, isozyme 2 exhibits a Vmax at pH 5.0 but has a higher substrate affinity at neutral pH. In intact and permeabilized cells, isozyme 2 has an apparent substrate Km similar to that determined in cell lysates at neutral pH. The results suggest that isozyme 2 is more efficient at neutral pH and that the acidic pH optimum determined in lysates is a consequence of cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1996224026,"The bendless (ben) mutation of Drosophila alters synaptic connectivity between a subset of CNS neurons. Here, we show that ben also causes morphological abnormalities within the visual system, suggesting that ben functions in a number of different developmental processes. We show that the ben gene encodes a protein which is closely related to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and that a missense mutation in the highly conserved active site region is associated with the ben mutation. High levels of ben expression are restricted to the nervous system during development. These results suggest a role for ubiquitin-mediated protein modification in nervous system development, including, but not exclusive to, the regulation of synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1566442216,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli in many different cell types. The kinases that activate MAPK, the MAPK/ERK Kinases (MEKs), are also activated by phosphorylation. We have studied the influence of specific oncogenes on the regulation of MEK activity in NIH3T3 and Rat1a fibroblasts. We show that a similar MEK activity phosphorylates and activates MAPK in both growth factor-stimulated (epidermal growth factor and thrombin) and oncogene (gip2, v-src, and v-raf)-transfected cells. Gip2 and v-Src activated MEK-1 in transfected Rat 1a cells, whereas v-Raf activated MEK-1 in transfected NIH3T3 cells. These cell-selective differences in MEK activation parallel constitutive MAPK activation in these cell lines. Stable expression of the v-ras oncogene resulted in little constitutive MEK activation in either cell line, even though both were highly transformed. The growth factor and oncoprotein regulated MEK activity co-fractionated by Mono S chromatography with the 45-kDa MEK-1 protein. We further demonstrate in NIH3T3 and Rat 1a cells that Raf-1 is activated, as measured by its ability to phosphorylate MEK-1, in response to epidermal growth factor but not thrombin. Thus, the regulatory network of protein kinases that activate MAPK converges at MEK but diverges with the kinases that phosphorylate and activate MEK."
https://openalex.org/W2088907559,"Three-dimensional structures of a native simian and reassortant rotavirus have been determined by electron cryomicroscopy and computer image processing. The structural features of the native virus confirm that the hemagglutinin spike is a dimer of VP4, substantiated by in vivo radiolabeling studies. Exchange of native VP4 with a bovine strain equivalent results in a poorly infectious reassortant. No VP4 spikes are detected in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the reassortant. The difference map between the two structures reveals a novel large globular domain of VP4 buried within the virion that interacts extensively with the intermediate shell protein, VP6. Our results suggest that assembly of VP4 precedes that of VP7, the major outer shell protein, and that VP4 may play an important role in the receptor recognition and budding process through the rough endoplasmic reticulum during virus maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1608720736,"The receptor for human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) is synthesized as a 313-residue-long polypeptide containing 28 cysteine residues, the pattern of which defines three homologous repeats within the protein. These entities are believed to represent a novel protein domain structure, of which the NH2-terminal domain of uPAR can be covalently cross-linked to the epidermal growth factor-like module of urokinase after receptor-ligand interaction. The NH2-terminal domain of a recombinant, soluble uPAR derivative, labeled with [35S]cysteine, was isolated after limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin. The four disulfide bonds present within this domain were assigned by a combination of plasma desorption mass spectrometry, amino acid composition, and sequence analyses of peptides generated by trypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, and thermolysin. The following disulfide bond structure was determined: Cys3-Cys24, Cys6-Cys12, Cys17-Cys45, and Cys71-Cys76. Similar cysteine pairing is likely to be found within other members of this protein superfamily, i.e. the membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis, Ly-6, and the remaining two domains of uPAR. However, an additional pair of cysteines present within these domains probably forms a fifth disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1552217451,"Inclusion body formation during recombinant protein expression in bacteria is of both fundamental interest and practical importance. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of this process, we are examining the in vitro folding and stability properties of a series of human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) sequence variants which exhibit widely differing tendencies to form inclusion bodies. Of 67 variants surveyed, nine, including wild type, were purified and their in vitro stability properties determined. One of these, a high inclusion body mutant, exhibited very low solubility in native buffer after purification and was not pursued further. For the other eight sequence variants, no strong correlations were observed between extent of inclusion body formation and either thermodynamic or thermal stability. In particular, a Lys97–>Val mutation produces substantially more IL-1 beta in inclusion bodies than the wild type (61 versus 8%) despite generating a protein more thermodynamically stable than wild type. Furthermore, the Lys97–>Val mutant forms substantial levels of inclusion bodies at 32 degrees C but requires incubation at temperatures greater than 48 degrees C for thermally induced aggregation in vitro. This and other data suggest that the tendency of at least some IL-1 beta variants to form inclusion bodies is most likely related to the stability or solubility of folding intermediates rather than native states. Implications of the structural locations of these mutations are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606548047,"Glucocorticoids evoke cytolysis in clonal human leukemic CEM-C7 cells. Suppression of c-myc mRNA by dexamethasone closely correlates with cell lysis only in CEM clones with both glucocorticoid receptor and intact lysis functions. We tested the theory that c-myc repression is essential for glucocorticoid-induced lymphocytolysis by preventing down-regulation of c-myc gene in the presence of dexamethasone and by reducing c-myc mRNA levels with antisense oligonucleotides. We find that sustained expression of c-myc provides resistance to dexamethasone-induced lysis, and antisense c-myc oligomers induce cell lysis. The lethal effects of dexamethasone in these leukemic cells appear to involve reduction of c-myc below the levels required to maintain cellular growth and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1981266474,"A single tetramer of Mu transposase (MuA) pairs the recombination sites, cleaves the donor DNA, and joins these ends to a target DNA by strand transfer. Analysis of C-terminal deletion derivatives of MuA reveals that a 30 amino acid region between residues 575 and 605 is critical for these three steps. Although inactive on its own, a deletion protein lacking this region assembles with the wild-type protein. These mixed tetramers carry out donor cleavage but do not promote strand transfer, even when the donor cleavage stage is bypassed. These data suggest that the active center of the transposase is composed of the C-terminus of four MuA monomers; one dimer carries out donor cleavage while all four monomers contribute to strand transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1589458965,"Sulfhydryl reagents such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) have been shown to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in rat hepatocytes in a way that resembles responses to Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormones (Saikada, I., Thomas, A. P., and Farber, J. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 717-722; Rooney, T. A., Renard, D. C., Sass, E. J., and Thomas, A. P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12272-12282) and to increase the amount of Ca2+ released by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)IP3) from permeable rat liver cells (Rooney et al., 1991, op. cit.; Missiaen, L., Taylor, C. W., and Berridge, M. J. (1991) Nature 352, 241-244; Renard, D. C., Seitz, M. B., and Thomas, A. P. (1992) Biochem. J. 284, 507-512). The effects of sulfhydryl reagents were studied in fura-2-injected rat and guinea pig hepatocytes and compared with the actions of cAMP (Burgess, G. M., Bird, G. St. J., Obie, J. F., and Putney, J. W., Jr. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4772-4781). In rat liver cells, the increases in [Ca2+]i induced by TBHP and thimerosal were prevented by microinjection of the cells with the (1,4,5)IP3 receptor antagonist heparin. In guinea pig hepatocytes, TBHP was not able to increase [Ca2+]i unless the cells were pretreated with angiotensin II to raise endogenous levels of (1,4,5)IP3 or were first injected with a sub-threshold concentration of inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2,4,5)IP3). The responses to TBHP in (2,4,5)IP3-injected guinea pig cells were also blocked by heparin. In many respects, the actions of TBHP appeared to be similar to those of cAMP, which has previously been shown to increase sensitivity to (1,4,5)IP3 in intact guinea pig hepatocytes (Burgess et al., 1991, op. cit.). TBHP also mimicked the effect of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) in permeabilized guinea pig hepatocytes by increasing the amount of Ca2+ released by (1,4,5)IP3. The responses to TBHP and cAMP in (2,4,5)IP3-injected guinea pig hepatocytes differed, however, in that the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by elevating intracellular cAMP was greatly reduced by Wiptide, an inhibitor of PKA, while Wiptide had no effect on the Ca2+ transients induced by TBHP. This provides evidence that the sensitizing effect of TBHP is not mediated by PKA and is more likely to be a direct effect on the inositol trisphosphate receptor. It is possible, however, that the sulfhydryl reagents and PKA act on a common regulatory site on the receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1985491605,"The bilateral efferent supply to the inner ear receptor fields is located in the hindbrain. In ovo injections of Dil into the common facial/vestibulo-acoustic nerve root at 3 days of chick development (stage 16) followed by analysis at 7 days has revealed the origin of the contralateral efferent neurons of the inner ear and their relation to the transient hindbrain rhombomeres. These neurons have a rhombomere 4-specific origin and form their commissure not by axonal outgrowth but, unusually, by transmedian cell migration into the contralateral rhombomere 4 and rhombomere 5. Neurons first project their axons from the ipsilateral basal plate through the VII/VIIIth nerve exit point and then migrate in the opposite direction, crossing the floor plate at stage 19-21. This rhombomere-specific cell behavior provides evidence at the cellular level that segmentation is intimately involved in establishing the pattern of this region of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1591951517,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) 12-hydroxydehydrogenase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of the porcine kidney. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that this enzyme is a novel protein with a molecular weight of 35,000. Although the enzyme is ubiquitously distributed in various tissues and leukocytes of porcine, the kidney and liver had the highest enzyme activities. In the presence of NADP+ as a cofactor, the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of LTB4 to 12-oxo-LTB4, the structure identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 12-Oxo-LTB4 was further converted by other enzymes to 10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-12-oxo-LTB4, which was determined by proton NMR and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 12-Oxo-LTB4 was 100-fold less potent than LTB4 in increasing intracellular calcium concentrations of human leukocytes. 6-trans-LTB4 and LTB4 proved to be the best substrates of the enzyme, whereas various types of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandins, cortisol, or pregnenolone could not serve as a substrate. These results suggest that the enzyme acts specifically on the 12(R)-hydroxy group of leukotriene B4 and is involved in the metabolic inactivation of LTB4 in the porcine kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2126943028,"Glial growth factors (GGFs) were purified from bovine pituitaries using an in vitro rat Schwann cell mitogenesis assay. In addition to an approximately 34-kDa species termed GGF-I, similar in molecular mass to a previously identified molecule (Lemke, G. E., and Brockes, J. P. (1984) J. Neuroscience 4, 75-83), two species named GGF-II and GGF-III were characterized with apparent molecular masses of approximately 59 and approximately 45 kDa, respectively. Highly purified preparations of all species share a similar dose-dependent stimulation of Schwann cell DNA synthesis at nanomolar concentrations. Forskolin synergizes with all three GGFs, shifting their dose dependence 3-8-fold into the sub-nanomolar range. The GGFs, which contain N-linked carbohydrate groups not essential for their in vitro mitogenic effects, are three distinct members of a novel family of glial cell mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W1480773806,"cGMP is the second messenger for visual excitation in vertebrate rod photoreceptors. However, no direct correlation has been observed between the measured total cGMP concentration in the rod outer segment and the electrical response of these cells to photic stimulation. To address this discrepancy, we have quantitated the number and affinities of cGMP binding sites in the rod outer segment to determine the cytoplasmic free cGMP concentration that is involved in visual transduction. We identified two distinct classes of cGMP binding sites in amphibian rod outer segments: 1) high affinity binding sites with a KD1 = 60 nM and a site density of 30 microM, and 2) moderate affinity binding sites with a KD2 = 6.6 microM and a site density of 78 microM. These two classes of binding sites are calculated to bind 94% of the total cellular cGMP, thereby lowering the cytoplasmic cGMP concentration to 3.5 microM in dark-adapted rod outer segments. This value is consistent with predictions of the cytoplasmic cGMP concentration based on activation of the cGMP-gated ion channel of rod photoreceptors. The kinetics of cGMP dissociation from high affinity binding sites indicate that this class of sites would dissociate its bound cGMP too slowly to participate in visual excitation and recovery to flash illumination. This binding of cGMP to intracellular binding sites provides a non-enzymatic mechanism by which photoreceptor cells regulate the concentration and restrict the diffusion of this second messenger during visual transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1538824877,"We studied the mechanisms that govern the expression of interstitial collagenase and 92-kDa gelatinase in U937 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line, exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of metalloproteinase expression. U937 cells were differentiated by phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) and, 24 h later, were exposed to LPS for an additional 24 h. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Northern hybridization showed that PMA mediated an induction of collagenase and markedly stimulated the low basal levels of 92-kDa gelatinase. Subsequent exposure to LPS substantially increased the production of both enzymes. Nuclear runoff assay demonstrated that PMA regulated collagenase and 92-kDa gelatinase transcription. LPS also stimulated collagenase transcription but did not affect transcription of 92-kDa gelatinase. Consistent with the runoff data, the decay rate of collagenase mRNA did not differ between experimental treatments, but the half-life of gelatinase mRNA increased with exposure to LPS. Furthermore, in situ hybridization showed that 92-kDa gelatinase was expressed by all cells whereas collagenase was produced by a subpopulation of cells in both PMA- and PMA/LPS-exposed cultures, and similar findings were seen with LPS-activated human alveolar macrophages. These data indicate that divergent mechanisms control metalloproteinase expression in phagocytic cells and that enzyme production differs among macrophage subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2059944964,"Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), the trypanosomatid mitochondrial DNA, is a network containing several thousand interlocked minicircles. During kDNA synthesis, minicircles dissociate from the network, and after replication their progeny reattach to the network periphery. Using electron microscopy autoradiography, we found that newly synthesized 3H-labeled minicircles, after short labeling periods, are concentrated in two peripheral zones on opposite sides of the network. These must be minicircle attachment sites, adjacent to the two diametrically opposed complexes of replication proteins observed previously. From the pattern of radiolabeling during longer pulses, we reached the unexpected conclusion that minicircle attachment around the entire network periphery may be due to a relative movement of the kinetoplast and the two complexes. The kinetoplast probably rotates between two fixed complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1651066421,"Glucagon and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) stimulate Na+/taurocholate (TC) cotransport and increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of hepatocytes. Whether the effect of cAMP is mediated via increases in [Ca2+]i, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and/or protein kinase C (PKC) was investigated in this study. TC uptake and [Ca2+]i were determined in isolated rat hepatocytes using [14C]TC and the fluorescent dye quin-2, respectively. Bt2cAMP, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated Na(+)-dependent, but not Na(+)-independent TC uptake. Bt2cAMP increased the maximal rate of Na+/TC cotransport without affecting the apparent Km. Increases in TC uptake and [Ca2+]i by Bt2cAMP were inhibited in hepatocytes preloaded with bis-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (MAPTA) or preincubated with 8-diethylaminooctyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB8). Calmodulin antagonists inhibited Bt2cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake, but not [Ca2+]i. Other Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents (thapsigargin, vasopressin, phenylephrine, and ionomycin) increased [Ca2+]i but failed to stimulate TC uptake, indicating that an increase in [Ca2+]i alone is not a sufficient stimulus for TC uptake. However, increases in TC uptake by 1 and 10 microM Bt2cAMP were further increased by thapsigargin, indicating a permissive role for Ca2+/calmodulin. Bt2cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake and [Ca2+]i were inhibited by known inhibitors of PKA and by an activator of PKC, but they remained unaffected by a specific inhibitor of PKC. Unlike thapsigargin, vasopressin inhibited Bt2cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake. Taken together these results indicate that stimulation of hepatic Na+/TC cotransport by cAMP 1) is mediated via PKA; 2) is potentiated, but not mediated, by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes; and 3) may be down-regulated by PKC."

Bacteriol. 173, 2716-2719) shows markedly reduced activity of thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK; EC 2.7.6.2). We have isolated a DNA fragment carrying the THI80 gene from a yeast genomic library by its ability to complement constitutive synthesis of the thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase, encoded by the PHO3 gene, of thi80 mutant cells. On the other hand, the thi80 locus was found to be located 3.3 centimorgans proximal to the smp3 locus on the right arm of chromosome XV by genetic mapping analysis, and one more fragment bearing the THI80 gene trailing SMP3 gene was obtained by the plasmid eviction method. The nucleotide sequence of the overlapped region between the two isolated DNAs contained an open reading frame of 957 base pairs, encoding a 319-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 36,616. When the intact THI80 open reading frame was expressed as a fusion protein carrying three vector-encoded amino acids at its N terminus in Escherichia coli lacking TPK, marked TPK activity was detected in the procaryotic cells, proving that the THI80 gene of S. cerevisiae encodes a structural gene of TPK. A gene disruption experiment demonstrated that the THI80 gene was essential for growth, and therefore, revealed that TPK is the only enzyme capable of synthesizing thiamin pyrophosphate in yeast. Studies of Northern blot analysis and the enzyme assay demonstrated that the THI80 gene expression is regulated mainly at the mRNA level by the intracellular thiamin pyrophosphate and requires the positive regulatory factors encoded by THI2 and THI3 genes. However, unlike thiamin-repressible acid phosphatase and the enzymes involved in thiamin synthesis of S. cerevisiae, TPK was found to be expressed constitutively at a low level and incompletely repressed by exogenous thiamin."
https://openalex.org/W1554136003,"The human bradykinin B2 receptor belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. To characterize the receptor protein, we have solubilized the membranes of cultured human foreskin fibroblasts bearing the B2 receptor. Affinity cross-linking of the solubilized receptor with the labeled agonist, 125I-Tyr0-bradykinin, or the labeled antagonist, 125I-(4-hydroxy-phenyl-propionyl)-HOE140, revealed major bands of apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and of 59 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A 1000-fold molar excess of each of the unlabeled ligands quenched the specific labeling suggesting that the agonist and the antagonist compete for overlapping binding site(s). Covalent coupling of the receptor to bradykinin or HOE140, followed by Western blotting and immunoprinting with specific anti-ligand antibodies confirmed that the major ligand-binding form of the receptor is of 69 kDa. Anti-idiotypic antibodies which bear the internal image of bradykinin (Haasemann, M., Buschko, J., Faussner, A., Roscher, A.A., Hoebeke, J., Burch, R.M., and Muller-Esterl, W. (1991) J. Immunol. 147, 3882-3892) immunoprecipitated the 125I-labeled receptor as a major band of 68 kDa and a minor band of 47 kDa indicative of partial proteolysis. Chemical deglycosylation of the 125I-labeled receptor shifted the apparent molecular mass from 69 to 44 kDa demonstrating that the receptor is heavily glycosylated. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the affinity-purified receptor revealed overlapping spots of 69 kDa and of pI 6.8-7.1 pointing to a microheterogeneity of the carbohydrate moiety. Elucidation of the key structural features of the B2 receptor protein will aid in understanding the structure-function relationships governing this prototypic peptide receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1589670515,"RNA polymerase II initiation factor delta was previously purified from rat liver and found to possess a closely associated DNA-dependent ATPase activity and a protein kinase activity capable of phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Serizawa, H., Conaway, R.C., and Conaway, J.W. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 7476-7480). In addition, delta's human homolog, BTF2(TFIIH), was recently shown to have an associated DNA helicase activity (Schaeffer, L., Roy, R., Humbert, S., Moncollin, V., Vermeulen, W., Hoeijmakers, J.H.J., Chambon, P., and Egly, J.-M. (1993) Science 259, 58-63). Here we demonstrate that initiation factor delta also possesses DNA helicase activity. In addition, we compare the properties of delta's associated CTD kinase, ATPase, and DNA helicase activities. Whereas the enzymatic properties of ATPase and DNA helicase are similar and consistent with the possibility that they could function in ATP-dependent activation of the preinitiation complex, ATPase and CTD kinase exhibit significant differences in their nucleotide specificities, responses to DNA effectors, and sensitivities to inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1524069661,"Thioredoxin, by virtue of the proximal active-site sulfhydryls (Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys), catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange with specific target enzymes. Considerable data (chemical modification, spectroscopic, and crystallographic) have implicated the cysteinyl residue nearest the N terminus of thioredoxin as the primary nucleophile; however, direct proof has been lacking. Proof is now provided by characterization of site-directed mutants of thioredoxin f with respect to activation of chloroplastic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). The C49S mutant retains the capacity to activate FBPase, whereas the C46S mutant is totally lacking in this regard. Based on kinetics of FBPase activation, wild-type and C49S thioredoxins exhibit half-saturation values of 0.9 and 4 microM, respectively. Lack of activation by C46S is not because of failure to interact with FBPase, for it exhibits a Ki of 5 microM in competition with wild-type thioredoxin. Therefore, in the normal thioredoxin-catalyzed reduction pathway, Cys-46 is the nucleophile required to attack the disulfide of the substrate and Cys-49 serves to cleave the mixed disulfide intermediate, thus allowing for the release of oxidized thioredoxin and the reduced target enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1597020672,"Using recombination intermediates made by RecA protein, we have shown that the Escherichia coli RuvB protein can mediate the branch migration of Holliday junctions in vitro. The reaction is dependent on the presence of > or = 10 mM Mg2+ and stoichiometric amounts of RuvB. The presence of E. coli RuvA protein reduces the requirement for Mg2+ and also the stoichiometric requirement for RuvB (Muller, B., Tsaneva, I. R., and West, S. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17179-17184). To determine the roles of the two proteins during branch migration, we have investigated the interaction of RuvB with DNA in the absence or presence of RuvA, by (i) gel retardation of protein-DNA complexes, (ii) stimulation of the RuvB ATPase, and (iii) protection of DNA from DNase I. The interaction of RuvB with duplex DNA was Mg(2+)-dependent and correlated with the Mg2+ requirement of the RuvB-mediated branch migration reaction. RuvB also interacted with ssDNA, but the affinity was significantly lower than for duplex DNA. In contrast to RuvB, the interaction of RuvA with duplex DNA occurred in the absence of Mg2+ and was inhibited by Mg2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. At 5 mM Mg2+, RuvA protein facilitated the interaction of RuvB with DNA, leading to the formation of a complex containing RuvA, RuvB, and duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1518335191,"Previous chemical modification studies have suggested that Cys-369, Cys-658, Lys-482, Asp-712, and Asp-716 are essential for Na,K-ATPase function. To determine if the side chains of these amino acid residues are required for enzyme activity, rat alpha 1 cDNAs containing the mutations Cys-369-->Ser, Cys-658-->Ala, Lys-482-->Ala, Asp-712-->Asn, and Asp-716-->Asn were prepared and stably expressed in HeLa cells, which normally cannot survive in medium containing microM concentrations of ouabain. Expression of rat alpha 1 wild-type and the mutants Cys-369-->Ser, Cys-658-->Ala, and Lys-482-->Ala causes the appearance of HeLa cells that survive in medium containing 0.5 microM ouabain. Membranes isolated from the rat alpha 1 mutant clones exhibit Na,K-ATPase activities, ratios of Na,K-ATPase:phosphoenzyme, and apparent affinities for ouabain and ATP which are comparable to those of the rat alpha 1 wild-type enzyme. HeLa cells expressing mRNA and protein for Asp-712-->Asn and Asp-716-->Asn rat alpha 1 mutants cannot survive in 0.1 microM ouabain, and membranes isolated from these clones exhibit very little or no ouabain-insensitive rat alpha 1 Na,K-ATPase activity. The Asp-712-->Asn, but not Asp-716-->Asn, mutant rat alpha 1 can be phosphorylated by ATP. We conclude that Cys-369, Cys-658, and Lys-482 are not essential for Na,K-ATPase function but that the Asp residues at 712 and 716 are both essential."
https://openalex.org/W1567032213,"The structure of the cAMP-CRP-CytR repression complex and the cAMP CRP-RNA polymerase initiation complex at the deoP2 promoter of E. coli have been probed by DNase I and uranyl footprinting. In the CRP2-CytR complex all protein DNA-phosphate contacts at CRP-1 and CRP-2 are retained, and in addition two new minor groove contacts, ascribed to phosphate-CytR interactions, are observed at -60 between the CRP sites. The contacts are compatible with a model in which the promoter DNA is wrapped around a complex of two CRPs and one CytR. In the RNA polymerase-CRP complex, the CRP-1 phosphate contacts are almost identical to those seen in the repression complex and strong RNA polymerase contacts are seen in the -10 and in the +10 regions. Most noteworthy are minor groove contacts in the -60 region ascribed to RNA polymerase contacts upstream from the CRP. Furthermore, binding of CRP to the CRP-2 target does not seem to interfere with RNA polymerase binding. Thus, a model is suggested in which the DNA is wrapped around a complex of RNA polymerase and one CRP. Finally, the results show that CytR and RNA polymerase are rivals that compete for binding with CRP at deoP2 and that CytR functions as an antiactivator."
https://openalex.org/W1545152130,"pOMD29 is a mitochondrial precursor protein that contains the NH2-terminal signal anchor sequence of Mas70p fused to dihydrofolate reductase. The signal anchor mediates insertion of pOMD29 into the outer mitochondrial membrane in the Nin-Ccyto orientation. Following import in vitro, pOMD29 was chemically cross-linked, via a unique cysteine residue adjacent to the signal anchor (residue 34), to form a product that was approximately twice the size of pOMD29. The cross-linked product was a dimer of pOMD29, as judged by the following. 1) It exhibited the same charge:mass ratio as pOMD29. 2) Formation of radioactive cross-linked product containing 35S-labeled pOMD29 was stimulated by co-import with unlabeled pOMD29. 3) Co-import of pOMD29 with a modified pOMD29 that contains two copies of dihydrofolate reductase resulted in formation of the predicted homo- and heterodimers. Cross-linking of pOMD29 was unaffected by concentrations of methotrexate that lock the dihydrofolate reductase moiety into its native monomeric conformation, indicating that oligomerization was mediated by the signal anchor rather than by the cytosolic domain of pOMD29. The predicted transmembrane core of the signal anchor sequence contains structural motifs similar to those found in a variety of signal-transducing cell surface receptors that dimerize through their transmembrane segments."
https://openalex.org/W1570090615,"We examined the effects of increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels on the expression of human PAF receptor (hPAF-R). Peripheral blood monocytes constitutively expressed hPAF-R mRNA transcripts. A transiently elevated intracellular concentration of AMP induced with prostaglandin E2, cholera toxin, or forskolin was a sufficient signal to inhibit PAF-R expression. To determine the mechanisms of this inhibition, human monocytes were treated with dibutyryl cAMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analogue. cAMP reduced the expression of hPAF-R in a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. The effect was seen as early as 1 h and was essentially total by 4 h. Stability of hPAF-R mRNA was not markedly decreased by cAMP, as assessed by measuring the half-lives of the transcripts. Moreover, the nuclear transcription rate of the hPAF-R gene was reduced as early as 30 min after stimulation with cAMP. The inhibition of hPAF-R mRNA accumulation was associated with diminished responsiveness to PAF, as assayed by intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, decreased number of binding sites, and decreased hPAF-R protein expression on the cell surface, as assessed by flow cytometry using a polyclonal anti-hPAF-R antibody. These data indicate that PAF-R expression can be regulated at the transcriptional and possibly post-transcriptional levels by elevation of intracellular cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1572478549,"This study examines the transcriptional regulation of the bovine CYP11A (P450scc) gene by activators of protein kinase A and protein kinase C in bovine ovarian luteal cells. Cells were transfected with reporter gene constructs containing deletion mutations of the 5'-flanking region of the bovine CYP11A gene linked to the minimal beta-globin gene. A construct containing -118/-101 base pairs of CYP11A sequence retains the same degree of stimulation by forskolin and inhibition by co-treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as larger constructs. This sequence contains two putative binding sites for nuclear proteins, an AP1-like sequence and an overlapping GA box element. Gel shift analysis using nuclear extracts of bovine ovarian luteal cells demonstrated that both the wild-type -118/-101-base pair sequence and a consensus GC box bound Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins. Mutation of the GA box element completely suppressed stimulation by forskolin. Absence of binding using the same mutated sequence correlated with the reporter gene transcription results. Mutation of the AP1-like site had little effect on forskolin induction of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibition. These results indicate that both stimulation by forskolin and inhibition by phorbol esters are mediated by the same GA box element, which binds Sp1 or an Sp1-like protein."
https://openalex.org/W1563493452,"In isolated adipocytes, epidermal growth factor (EGF) did not affect basal (nonstimulated) lipolysis, but interfered with the lipolytic action of isoproterenol (ISO) or glucagon. Similarly, EGF did not affect basal levels of cyclic AMP but interfered with the signal generated by ISO. However, EGF did not affect lipolysis stimulated by forskolin or cyclic AMP analogues. These results suggest that EGF interfered with the signal transduction between lipolytic hormone receptors and adenylate cyclase. To determine whether EGF was activating a Gi protein, adenosine deaminase (ADA) was added to degrade endogenously released adenosine. While the nonmetabolizable adenosine analogue N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine (PIA) inhibited ADA-stimulated lipolysis, EGF affected neither ADA-stimulated lipolysis nor the dose-response curve for PIA. However, EGF did not affect ISO-stimulated lipolysis in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Similarly, in the presence of ADA, the effects of ISO on lipolysis and on cyclic AMP levels were not affected by EGF. The addition of PIA restored the effect of EGF on both lipolysis and cyclic AMP. Since EGF decreased the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of PIA on (ISO+ADA)-stimulated lipolysis, we suggest that EGF modulates the interaction between GS and Gi in the control of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2162843874,"The E. coli primosome assembles at an origin on a single-stranded DNA, like that of phi X174, to promote replication of that template. Upon conversion to the duplex form, the primosome can generate a rolling circle product from this template. Rolling circle synthesis implies the transfer of the DnaB helicase from its initial loading site on the viral strand to a displaced complementary strand. Isolated primosomes promote only unit-length synthesis; supplementation with PriC, DnaC, and DnaT is necessary to reconstitute rolling circle synthesis. Rolling circle replication is sensitive to salts, whereas primosome assembly and unit-length synthesis are not. Thus, the primosome promotes two distinct reactions: assembly for first-round synthesis and strand switching for rolling circle synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1615540078,"We have measured 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) mass during Dictyostelium development. DG levels are initially high in vegetative cells, decrease upon starvation, increase during aggregation, and rise dramatically during culmination, concomitant with SpiA (a spore cell-specific gene) expression. These results are consistent with DG being involved in culmination-stage morphological changes and cell-type differentiation. Mutant analysis shows that the rise in DG during aggregation requires cAMP signaling pathways but is not directly regulated through these processes but via developmental programs induced through cAMP. DG accumulation during aggregation is approximately 8-fold higher than would be expected from inositol lipid hydrolysis (1), suggesting that DG is produced from sources in addition to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Our data suggest that during aggregation, although some DG is formed through phospholipase D activity, other pathways (e.g. de novo synthesis) may be more important regulators of DG accumulation. During culmination, DG accumulation correlated with the formation of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol suggesting the activation of phospholipase D. During this time, the [3H]palmitate labeling of a number of phospholipids decreased rapidly, suggesting a rapid metabolism of phospholipids at this time. Exposure of slugs developed in the dark to light, which initiates culmination, causes rapid DG accumulation, suggesting the activation of phospholipid hydrolysis. The temporal pattern and level of DG accumulation is altered in G alpha 1 null and overexpressing strains, suggesting that G alpha 1 is upstream from DG formation during culmination. These results demonstrate that specific pathways of DG formation are under developmental control and suggest a possible link between light, the activation of DG production, and induction of culmination."
https://openalex.org/W1574471631,"Cis unsaturated but not saturated fatty acids (FA) have been shown to specifically inhibit certain early responses in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) including the rise in intracellular calcium, degranulation, and lethal hit delivery. They do not, however, affect other early events such as the turnover of phosphatidylinositol, T-cell receptor recognition, and CTL-cognate target cell conjugation. Antigen stimulation of CTL results in an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of more than 10 substrates. We now find that cis unsaturated but not saturated FA specifically inhibit antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of only a single substrate, a 100-kDa protein (pp100). The characteristics of cis FA inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 are virtually identical to the cis FA inhibition of the CTL functional responses. Inhibition occurs within seconds of cis FA addition, can be reversed by extracting the unesterified FA with albumin, can be initiated after stimulation, and has the same dose and FA molecular species dependence as the inhibition of the CTL responses. In addition, low concentrations of phenylarsine oxide specifically inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 and the CTL responses, but have no effect on other tyrosine phosphorylation events. These striking correlations suggest that pp100 may be central to specific early signaling events including lethal hit delivery and its tyrosine phosphorylation may be regulated by a plasma membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1494944511,"We previously reported that transfection of antisense OBCAM (opioid-binding cell adhesion molecule) cDNA into NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells, which contain delta-opioid receptors, results in greatly reduced opioid binding (Ann, D. K., Hasegawa, J., Ko, J. L., Chen, S. T., Lee, N. M., and Loh, H. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7921-7926. Here we report that these cells show altered coupling between opioid receptors and G-proteins. G-proteins were identified using cholera toxin (CTX)-induced ADP-ribosylation and antisera selective for Gi2 and Go alpha subunits. In the presence of delta-opioid agonists, CTX induced the incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose into a 39-41-kDa protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as Gi2 and Go alpha subunits. This band, which was also a pertussis toxin (PTX) substrate, exhibited decreased CTX-induced ADP-ribosylation in membranes of cells treated chronically with D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE). In cells transfected with antisense cDNA for OBCAM, labeling of this band was also decreased, compared with either sense-transfected or untransfected cells. DADLE inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and DADLE stimulation of GTPase were also greatly impaired in antisense cells, as well as GTP and GppNHp inhibition of basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. These results provide further evidence for a role of OBCAM in opioid receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1605390983,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment of PC12 cells led to the rapid phosphorylation of a calmodulin-binding protein of 100 kDa (CaM-BP100) identified on blot overlays with 125I-labeled CaM. The effect was detected as a retardation in the mobility of the protein by an apparent 10 kDa on SDS gels. The mobility shift was complete within 5 min and was maintained for 24 h in the continued presence of NGF. The protein was present in both the soluble and crude particulate fractions, and the gel mobility shift occurred in both fractions. Epidermal growth factor elicited a similar response, but the mobility shift was reversed within 12 h. The gel retardation was due to phosphorylation of CaM-BP100, as it could be reversed if cytoplasmic extracts were held under dephosphorylating conditions at 37 degrees C for 10 min prior to electrophoresis; dephosphorylation was inhibited by okadaic acid but not vanadate, suggesting the participation of a Ser/Thr phosphatase. Treatment with either acid or alkaline phosphatase also reversed the mobility shift. CaM-BP100 phosphorylation was stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in intact cells, but the effect of NGF did not involve a protein kinase C-dependent process, because it occurred in PC12 cells depleted of protein kinase C. The phosphorylation event appeared to be due to an NGF-stimulated protein kinase, as mixing extracts from NGF-treated cells with extracts from control cells in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ reconstituted the mobility shift in vitro. CaM-BP100 appears to be a minor cellular phosphoprotein, as 32P labeling of the protein could not be detected in crude cell extracts. These results suggest that receptor tyrosine kinases communicate with at least one component of the Ca2+/calmodulin-signaling pathway early in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1606294018,"The transcription factor LFB1 (HNF1) involved in the expression of liver-specific genes is characterized by a serine/threonine-rich activation domain whose transactivation potential differs between mammals and Xenopus. Exchanging the activation domain between the Xenopus and rat LFB1, we produced chimeric transactivators whose activities are primarily determined by the origin of the activation domain. By replacing the serine/threonine-rich activation domain of LFB1 with the acidic activation domain of VP16, we generated transcription factors that act as dominant positive interfering mutants on endogenous LFB1 in differentiated hepatoma cells. As these LFB1/VP16 chimeras show no self-squelching as observed with wild-type LFB1 and increase the activity of saturating LFB1, we postulate that acidic and serine/threonine-rich activation domains use different targets of the basal transcription machinery. Stable transfection of various LFB1 derivatives, including those containing the VP16 transactivation domain, into the dedifferentiated C2 hepatoma cell resulted in cell clones stably expressing LFB1 function. However, as in none of these clones the chromosomal albumin genes are activated, we conclude that the presence of functional LFB1 may not be sufficient to reactivate liver-specific functions lost in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells."
