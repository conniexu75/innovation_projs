https://openalex.org/W3158444444,"Transient receptor potential canonical type 5 (TRPC5) ion channels are expressed in the brain and kidney and have been identified as promising therapeutic targets whose selective inhibition can protect against diseases driven by a leaky kidney filter, such as focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. TRPC5 channels are activated not only by elevated levels of extracellular Ca2+or lanthanide ions but also by G protein (Gq/11) stimulation. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis by phospholipase C enzymes leads to PKC-mediated phosphorylation of TRPC5 channels and their subsequent desensitization. However, the roles of PIP2 in activation and maintenance of TRPC5 channel activity via its hydrolysis product diacyl glycerol (DAG), as well as the mechanism of desensitization of TRPC5 activity by DAG-stimulated PKC activity, remain unclear. Here, we designed experiments to distinguish between the processes underlying channel activation and inhibition. Employing whole-cell patch-clamp, we used an optogenetic tool to dephosphorylate PIP2 and assess channel–PIP2 interactions influenced by activators, such as DAG, or inhibitors, such as PKC phosphorylation. Using total internal reflection microscopy, we assessed channel cell surface density. We show that PIP2 controls both the PKC-mediated inhibition and the DAG- and lanthanide-mediated activation of TRPC5 currents via control of gating rather than channel cell surface density. These mechanistic insights promise to aid in the development of more selective and precise inhibitors to block TRPC5 channel activity and illuminate new opportunities for targeted therapies for a group of chronic kidney diseases for which there is currently a great unmet need."
https://openalex.org/W3158182323,"Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of intracellular deposits containing the protein alpha-synuclein (aSYN) within patients’ brains. It has been shown that aSYN can form structurally distinct fibrillar assemblies, also termed polymorphs. We previously showed that distinct aSYN polymorphs assembled in vitro, named fibrils, ribbons, and fibrils 91, differentially bind to and seed the aggregation of endogenous aSYN in neuronal cells, which suggests that distinct synucleinopathies may arise from aSYN polymorphs. In order to better understand the differential interactions of aSYN polymorphs with their partner proteins, we mapped aSYN polymorphs surfaces. We used limited proteolysis, hydrogen–deuterium exchange, and differential antibody accessibility to identify amino acids on their surfaces. We showed that the aSYN C-terminal region spanning residues 94 to 140 exhibited similarly high solvent accessibility in these three polymorphs. However, the N-terminal amino acid residues 1 to 38 of fibrils were exposed to the solvent, while only residues 1 to 18 within fibrils 91 were exposed, and no N-terminal residues within ribbons were solvent-exposed. It is likely that these differences in surface accessibility contribute to the differential binding of distinct aSYN polymorphs to partner proteins. We thus posit that the polypeptides exposed on the surface of distinct aSYN fibrillar polymorphs are comparable to fingerprints. Our findings have diagnostic and therapeutic potential, particularly in the prion-like propagation of fibrillar aSYN, as they can facilitate the design of ligands that specifically bind and distinguish between fibrillar polymorphs.

Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by the presence of aSYN-rich deposits within the central and peripheral nervous systems (1Spillantini M.G.

The amino acid residues stretch 61 to 95 is hydrophobic and prone to form amyloid fibrils. It is named the nonamyloid-β component domain (8Rodriguez J.A. Ivanova M.I. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Reyes F.

We further established a structure–function relationship by showing that the structural differences between polymorphs impact their ability to bind neuronal cells (31Shrivastava A.N. Bousset L.

Recent developments in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allow determining to an atomic resolution the structure of the rigid core of fibrillar assemblies (33Guerrero-Ferreira R. Taylor N.M. Arteni A.A. Kumari P. Mona D. Ringler P. Britschgi M. Lauer M.E. Makky A. Verasdonck J. Riek R. Melki R. Meier B.H. Böckmann A. Bousset L. et al.Two new polymorphic structures of human full-length alpha-synuclein fibrils solved by cryo-electron microscopy.Elife. 2019; 8e48907Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This method allows neither identifying all the amino acid stretches exposed to the solvent at the surfaces of fibrillar assemblies nor determining how are regions less rigid than the amyloid core organized around it within those assemblies. The polypeptide stretches exposed at the surfaces of fibrillar polymorphs define their protein and lipid interactomes. It is therefore of utmost importance to define them at the highest possible resolution to better understand what underlies their differential binding to neuronal cells, resistance to clearance, and spread (31Shrivastava A.N. Bousset L. Renner M. Redeker V. Savistchenko J. Triller A. Melki R. Differential membrane binding and seeding of distinct α-synuclein fibrillar polymorphs.Biophys.

Here we identify the amino acid stretches exposed to the solvent at the surface of aSYN fibrillar polymorphs fibrils, ribbons, and fibrils 91. We used limited proteolysis (34Fontana A.

We next strengthened our results by determining solvent accessibility at the amino acid level by performing hydrogen–deuterium exchange coupled with MS measurements (36Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Determination of amide hydrogen exchange by mass spectrometry: A new tool for protein structure elucidation.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Illes-Toth E. Rempel D.L.

Neurosci. 2018; 9: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that aSYN C-terminal amino acid stretch 94 to 140 is highly accessible to the solvent in all three fibrillar polymorphs. This contrasts with the polymorphs-dependent differential exposure of aSYN N-terminal domain. Indeed, while aSYN amino acid stretch 1 to 38 is exposed to the solvent in the polymorph fibrils, it is fully inaccessible in ribbons and accessible in part (residues 1–18) in the polymorph fibrils 91. The differences we observe reflect differences in polypeptide folding. Our findings pave the way to design ligands with diagnostic and therapeutic potential that target distinct aSYN accessible surfaces and are capable of distinguishing different aSYN strains. We used different experimental conditions to assemble human recombinant wild-type aSYN into the three distinct fibrillar polymorphs, fibrils, ribbons, and fibrils 91. The polymorph fibrils were obtained under physiological salt concentration (22Bousset L. Pieri L. Ruiz-Arlandis G. Gath J. Henning Jensen P. Habenstein B. Madiona K. Olieric V. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Melki R. Structural and functional characterization of two alpha-synuclein strains.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), ribbons were formed in a buffer with a low salinity, and fibrils 91 were generated in a buffer with a high pH, as previously described (22Bousset L.

Nanomechanical properties of distinct fibrillar polymorphs of the protein α-synuclein.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 37970Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The homogeneity and nature of the fibrillar polymorphs were first assessed by TEM (Fig. 1A). Fibrils and fibrils 91 had a cylindrical aspect with twists while ribbons appeared flat (22Bousset L. Pieri L. Ruiz-Arlandis G. Gath J. Henning Jensen P. Habenstein B. Madiona K. Olieric V. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Melki R. Structural and functional characterization of two alpha-synuclein strains.Nat.

Nanomechanical properties of distinct fibrillar polymorphs of the protein α-synuclein.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 37970Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We next subjected the three fibrillar polymorphs to limited proteolysis using proteinase K and thermolysin to assess their characteristic proteolytic profiles. Theoretically, proteinase K and thermolysin can cleave 78 and 54 peptide bonds within aSYN, respectively. These two unspecific proteases will cleave a subset of those peptide bonds under the experimental conditions we designed, within amino acid stretches exposed to the solvent at the surface of the different polymorphs. Highly reproducible, strain-specific and protease-specific proteolytic profiles, comparable to fingerprints, were obtained after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 1, B and C) under conditions where monomeric aSYN is degraded within 5 to 15 min into polypeptides with molecular weight lower than 12 kDa (Fig. S1). These results demonstrate unequivocally that structurally distinct fibrillar aSYN polymorphs expose to the solvent different polypeptide chains. All resulting proteolytic reaction products appeared fibrillar upon assessment by TEM (Fig. S2). Their bundling propensity increased. All the proteolytic polypeptides were found in the pellet when proteinase K and thermolysin-treated fibrils, ribbons, and fibrils 91 were subjected to ultracentrifugation (Fig. S2). This demonstrates that aSYN polypeptides remain bound together within the fibrillar structures under our experimental conditions until denaturation. This further indicates that our proteolytic treatment only affects fibrils surfaces, not their amyloid core. We determined the accessibility of polypeptide stretches spanning aSYN primary structure to different antibodies in aSYN monomers, fibrils, ribbons, and fibrils 91. The different species were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes that were exposed to monoclonal antibodies directed against aSYN amino acid stretch 1 to 15 (ASyM), 91 to 99 (Syn1), and 118 to 127 (10D2) (Fig. 1D). ASyM bound all species except ribbons, which indicates that its epitope is involved in ribbon amyloid core, in agreement with solid-state NMR data we previously obtained (22Bousset L. Pieri L.

The antibody 10D2 bound all fibrillar polymorphs, indicating that aSYN C-terminal end is exposed to the solvent, again in agreement with previous solid-state NMR data (22Bousset L. Pieri L.

Interestingly, 10D2 binds fibrillar aSYN polymorphs better than its monomeric form, which either reflects a low affinity for aSYN C-terminal domain or a preferential binding to a conformation aSYN C-terminal domain adopts in fibrillar polymorphs. Syn1 was found to bind best monomeric aSYN. This agrees with the partial or full involvement of aSYN amino acid stretch 91 to 99 within the amyloid core of the fibrillar polymorphs we analyzed (22Bousset L. Pieri L. Ruiz-Arlandis G. Gath J.

We next identified the polypeptides generated by limited proteolytic cleavage of aSYN fibrillar polymorphs by proteinase K and thermolysin using two approaches. We first performed western blotting after limited proteolysis using the monoclonal antibodies ASyM, 5G4, 10C3, Syn1 (38Perrin R.J. Payton J.E. Barnett D.H. Wraight C.L. Woods W.S. Ye L. George J.M.

Syn1 recognized all the bands seen after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue. This indicates that the amino acid stretch 91 to 99 is present in all proteinase K and thermolysin cleavage products (Figs. 1 and 2). The presence or absence of ASyM, 5G4, 10C3, and 10D2 epitopes within the different proteolytic polypeptides was next assessed after membranes stripping and probing with the different antibodies. The antibody ASyM bound all polypeptides derived from proteinase K treatment of the polymorph ribbons but not the polymorphs fibrils and fibrils 91 as confirmed by the merge of Syn1 and ASyM immunodetection (Fig. 2, A–C). We conclude from this observation that the amino acid stretch 1 to 15 is inaccessible to proteinase K in the polymorph ribbons while it is in the polymorphs fibrils and fibrils 91. The antibodies 5G4 and 10C3 bound all polypeptides identified by SDS-PAGE and by Syn1 after proteinase K treatment (Fig. 2, A–C). We conclude from this observation that the amino acid stretch 46 to 105 is inaccessible to proteinase K in all aSYN fibrillar polymorphs. Most proteolytic polypeptides lacked 10D2 antibody binding (Fig. 2, A–C), which indicates the amino acid stretch 118 to 127 is accessible to the protease and the polypeptides are C-terminally truncated. The binding of ASyM, 5G4, 10C3, and 10D2 to aSYN fibrillar polymorphs fibrils, fibrils 91, and ribbons thermolysin cleavage products (Fig. 2, D–F) is in full agreement with the results obtained with proteinase K. It shows that the amino acid stretch 1 to 15 is inaccessible to thermolysin in aSYN polymorph ribbons while it is in the polymorphs fibrils and fibrils 91 that the amino acid stretch 46 to 105 is inaccessible to thermolysin in all aSYN fibrillar polymorphs and that the amino acid stretch 118 to 127 is accessible to the protease in all aSYN fibrillar polymorphs. Second, we identified all aSYN fibrillar polymorphs proteinase K and thermolysin cleavage products by MS. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in the linear mode, with a sinapinic acid matrix given the apparent molecular weight of the polypeptides (>8000 Da).

Children with CP were identified from the community using the key informant method and underwent a detailed neurodevelopmental assessment. Socio-demographic, clinical and rehabilitation status were documented. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to identify potential predictors of rehabilitation service uptake.Between January 2015 and December 2019, 2852 children with CP were registered in the BCPR (mean (standard deviation, SD) age: 7 y 8 months (mo) (4 y 7 mo), 38.5% female). Of these, 50.2% had received rehabilitation services; physiotherapy was the most common type of service (90.0%). The mean (SD) age at commencement of rehabilitation services was 3 y 10 mo (3 y 1 mo). The odds of not receiving rehabilitation was significantly higher among female children (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.3 [95% CI: 1.0-1.7], children whose mothers were illiterate and primary level completed (aOR 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4-3.1] and aOR 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2.1], respectively), fathers were illiterate (aOR 1.9 [95% CI: 1.3-2.8]), had a monthly family income ~US$ 59-118 (aOR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.2-2.6]), had hearing impairment (aOR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.5-3.5]) and motor severity (i.e. Gross Motor Function Classification System level III (aOR: 0.6 [95% CI: 0.3-0.9]) and level V (aOR: 0.4 [95% CI: 0.2-0.7])).Rehabilitation status was poor among the majority of the children with CP in the BCPR cohort, limiting their opportunities for functional improvement. A community-based rehabilitation model focusing on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics should be a public health priority in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3157664707,"Young women in South Africa are highly affected by sexually transmitted infections (STI), like C. trachomatis (CT) and N. gonorrhoeae (NG). We aimed to estimate the incidence of CT and NG, and its determinants, among young women from the Western Cape, South Africa, participating in an HPV vaccine trial (the EVRI study).HIV-negative women aged 16-24 years were enrolled between October 2012 and July 2013. At enrolment and month 6 participants were screened for CT and NG (Anyplex CT/NG real-time detection method). A questionnaire on demographic and sexual history characteristics was completed at enrolment and month 7. Treatment for CT and/or NG was offered to infected participants. Incidence rates (IR) of CT and NG were estimated. Determinants of incident CT and NG infections were assessed using Poisson regression.365 women were tested for CT and/or NG at least twice. Prevalence of CT and NG at baseline was 33.7% and 10.4%, respectively. Prevalence of co-infection with CT and NG was 7.1%. During 113.3 person-years (py), 48 incident CT infections were diagnosed (IR = 42.4 per 100 py, 95% confidence interval (CI) 31.9-56.2). Twenty-nine incident NG were diagnosed during 139.3 py (IR = 20.8 per 100 py, 95%CI 14.5-29.9). Prevalent CT infection at baseline was associated with incident CT (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 5.8, 95%CI 3.0-11.23. More than three lifetime sex partners increased the risk for incident NG (3-4 partners aIRR = 7.3, 95%CI 2.1-26.0; ≥5 partners aIRR = 4.3, 95%CI 1.1-17.5).The IR of bacterial STIs among young women in the Western Cape is very high. Besides being previously infected and a higher lifetime number of sex partners, no other risk factors were found for CT and NG, suggesting that the majority of these women were at risk. This indicates the need for intensified prevention of STIs as well as screening and treatment programs to increase sexual health in this region."
https://openalex.org/W3157693924,"Coral transplantation has been used in reef restoration for several decades, but information on the type of projects, their scope, scale, and success is mostly limited to published scientific studies and technical reports. Many practitioners do not have the capacity to share their progress in peer-reviewed literature, yet likely have a wealth of information to share on how to improve the efficiency of transplantation efforts. In order to incorporate non-published data on coral transplantation projects and gain an overview of the general features of these projects, we conducted an initial systematic online survey of projects run by various practitioners. Surveyed projects ( n = 50) covered most of the tropical belt and ranged in size from a few hundred transplanted corals to &gt;5000 transplants. The most frequent source of coral fragments were corals already broken from some previous impact (“corals of opportunity”; 58% of projects), followed by fragments stored in different types of aquaculture systems (42% of projects). The use of sexual reproduction was very limited. Fast-growing, branching corals were used in 96% of projects, being by far the most common transplanted growth form. About half of the projects mentioned undertaking maintenance of the transplantation plots. The majority of projects undertook subsequent monitoring (80%), yet the available data indicates that duration of monitoring efforts was not adequate to evaluate long-term success. The findings underline that while some general principles for successful coral restoration projects are reasonably well established, others need to be mainstreamed better in order to improve the effectiveness of coral transplantation for reef restoration. This relates in particular to sustainable funding, adequate site assessment, and long-term monitoring using established protocols. Additional information is needed to better understand and address potential challenges with regards to the sourcing of transplants and use of slow-growing species. A better integration of practitioners is necessary to improve the understanding of coral transplantation effectiveness. The results underline a need to develop and use monitoring protocols that allow gauging and comparing the effectiveness of coral transplantation among various projects, as well as for accessible platform(s) to allow the exchange of experiences made in different projects. Regular surveys of restoration projects are recommended to collate and share information among practitioners. We provide a number of recommendations for items to include in future surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3159262590,"Lake sediments are natural archives that accumulate information on biological communities and their surrounding catchments. Paleolimnology has traditionally focussed on identifying fossilized organisms to reconstruct past environments. In the last decade, the application of molecular methodologies has increased in paleolimnological studies, but further research investigating factors such as sample heterogeneity and DNA degradation are required. In the present study we investigated bacterial community heterogeneity (16S rRNA metabarcoding) within depth slices (1-cm width). Sediment cores were collected from three lakes with differing sediment compositions. Samples were collected from a variety of depths which represent a period of time of approximately 1,200 years. Triplicate samples were collected from each depth slice and bacterial 16S rRNA metabarcoding was undertaken on each sample. Accumulation curves demonstrated that except for the deepest (oldest) slices, the combination of three replicate samples were insufficient to characterise the entire bacterial diversity. However, shared Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) accounted for the majority of the reads in each depth slice (max. shared proportional read abundance 96%, 86%, 65% in the three lakes). Replicates within a depth slice generally clustered together in the Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. There was high community dissimilarity in older sediment in one of the cores, which was likely due to the laminae in the sediment core not being horizontal. Given that most paleolimnology studies explore broad scale shifts in community structure rather than seeking to identify rare species, this study demonstrates that a single sample is adequate to characterise shifts in dominant bacterial ASVs."
https://openalex.org/W3158892717,"Piglets are highly vulnerable to infections, but colostrum provides them with some protection. The function of colostrum components is unknown, as is if the amount and subsets of leukocytes in colostrum differ between gilts and sows. This study serially characterized leukocyte populations in colostrum for differential leukocyte counts. Differences in humoral and cellular composition of colostrum between 40 gilts and 40 sows (parities orders 3–4) from a commercial herd were examined. Flow cytometry is a useful tool to identify and quantify leukocyte subsets in sow colostrum. Overall, there were no (p ≥ 0.05) parity differences in total macrophages, granulocytes, and T and B cells. However, the sows’ colostrum presented significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) T lymphocyte subsets than gilts, such as central memory CD4 + T cells, effector memory CD4 + T cells, and central memory CD8 + T cells. Among B-lymphocytes, percentages of SWC7 + CD5 + cells were significantly higher in sow colostrum than in that of gilts. As expected, IgG concentrations were significantly higher in sows than in gilts. Colostrum from sows had significantly greater mitogenic activity than colostrum from gilts and this fact can be associated with the potential to accelerate the maturation of a newborn’s gastrointestinal tract. Our findings suggest that parity order may be one among other factors influencing the cell population and, consequently, the immune adaptive response in piglets that induces neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses to antigens."

Oslo social support scale, adverse childhood experience tool, and socio-demographic questionnaire were used to gather data on risk factors. Linear regression analysis was used, and unstandardized beta (β) coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported to declare statistical significance.A total of 546 adolescents participated in the study, with a response rate of 97.3%. The mean (±SD) age of participants was 16.8 ± 1.3 years. The majority (81%) of the adolescents were attending day classes at public schools. The prevalence of depression was found to be 28% using the patient health questionnaire. Based on the PHQ-9 depression severity scale, 18.5% and 8.2% of the adolescent had moderate and moderate to severe depression while 1.3% had severe depression. In the final multivariate linear regression analysis, it was found that sex, rural residence, low social support, being in higher grade level, and adverse childhood experience were found to be independently associated with a higher score of depression.One in three adolescents was found to have a depressive syndrome. We recommend schools to integrate school mental health service that contains routine screening and intervention services. Moreover, efforts are needed to sensitize and educate the communities on child protection, social support, and safeguarding to effectively tackle the magnitude of adolescent depression."
https://openalex.org/W3157137004,"Teachers in developing countries are facing increasing social and political pressure to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to improve the access to and the quality of education available to young people. This is a core part of several government-led initiatives to attain the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4-quality education. While there is no shortage of ICT, the adoption for actual use in the classroom is often a hurdle for teachers, due to various concerns they harbour. This research study used the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) to assess the stages of concern of 340 Nigerian teachers about adopting and integrating ICT in the classroom. The findings indicated that teachers’ concerns were most intense in the awareness, management and information stages respectively, and lowest at the collaborative and consequence levels. Further examination of the results also shows a significant relationship between the stages of concern and teachers’ personal attributes like teaching experience, age and the class level they teach. These findings provide practical insights into how to better create effective teacher professional development interventions, to assist teachers in adopting and integrating ICT, to enhance the learning experience of young people within the classroom."
https://openalex.org/W3159787651,"Background Although the rate of stillbirth has decreased globally, it remains unacceptably high in low- and middle-income countries. Only ten countries including Ethiopia attribute more than 65% of global burden of still birth. Ethiopia has the 7 th highest still birth rate in the world. Identifying the predictors of stillbirth is critical for developing successful interventions and monitoring public health programs. Although certain studies have assessed the predictors of stillbirth, they failed in identify the proximate predictors of stillbirth. In addition, the inconsistent findings in identify the predictors of stillbirth, and the methodological limitations in previously published works are some of the gaps. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of stillbirth among mothers who gave birth in six referral hospitals in Southern, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in six referral hospitals in Southern, Ethiopia from October 2019 to June 2020. Consecutive sampling techniques and simple random techniques were used to recruit cases and controls respectively. A structured standard tool was used to identify the predictors of stillbirth. Data were entered into Epi Info 7 and exported to SPSS 23 for analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent predictors of stillbirth. The goodness of fit was tested using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit. In this study P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to declare a result as a statistically significant association. Results In this study 138 stillbirth cases and 269 controls were included. Women with multiple pregnancy [AOR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.39–6.36], having preterm birth [AOR = 2.83, 95%CI: 1.58–508], having cesarean mode of delivery [AOR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.87–5.44], having no ANC visit [AOR = 4.17, 95%CI: 2.38–7.33], and being hypertensive during pregnancy [AOR = 3.43, 95%CI: 1.93–6.06] were significantly associated with stillbirth. Conclusions The predictors of stillbirth identified are manageable and can be amenable to interventions. Therefore, strengthening maternal antenatal care utilization should be encouraged by providing appropriate information to the mothers. There is a need to identify, screen, and critically follow high-risk mothers: those who have different complications during pregnancy, and those undergoing cesarean section due to different indications."
https://openalex.org/W3157079651,"Galactagogues are foods, herbs or medications thought to support or increase breast milk supply. The use of galactagogues during lactation is becoming increasingly common despite limited evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, and no definitive recommendations for use in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to explore factors influencing women’s decisions to use galactagogues during lactation. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted in October and November 2019 (over the telephone or in person) with participants located in most Australian states and territories, including metro and regional areas. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using NVivo. Analysis revealed that following a concern about breast milk supply, the decision to use galactagogues was influenced by three core and interrelated domains: access to and quality of breastfeeding support, maternal agency and determination to provide breast milk. Women revealed many problematic experiences with health care professionals that left them feeling dismissed and confused due to provision of inconsistent and insufficient information that was sometimes at odds with their desire to provide breast milk. In this instance, some women turned to galactagogues to regain agency. A range of broader dimensions influencing decision-making also emerged. These were separated into categories that emphasise distinctions relating to breast milk supply, which included: maternal emotional wellbeing, social norms and pressures, concerns about infant development, maternal physical health and lactation history, as well as those relating specifically to galactagogue use, including: desire for a guaranteed/urgent response, risk-risk trade-off, acceptance and trust, and accessibility and cost. In understanding the complexity of decision-making concerning these substances, we identify opportunities to improve breastfeeding counselling and support. We recommend that support be individually tailored to manage conflicting information, adopt communication styles that encourage trust and processes that enable shared decision-making to enhance or restore maternal agency. There is also considerable need to address evidence gaps regarding the effectiveness and safety of commonly used galactagogues, so that women can be appropriately counselled about potential benefits and harms."
https://openalex.org/W3157272192,"To investigate the effects of short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the central and southern China areas on ischemic heart disease (IHD) and non-accidental deaths.We investigated the associations between short-term exposure to SO2 and CO in a city in south-central China and IHD and non-accidental death using a time-series design and generalized additive models with up to a 5-day lag adjusting for day of the week, temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and relative humidity. The relative risks of IHD and non-accidental death per 10-unit increase in SO2 and CO were derived from zero to five days in single-pollutant models.Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 10,507 IHD and 44,070 non-accidental deaths were identified. The largest significant relative risk for IHD death was lag 02 for both SO2 (1.080; 95% confidence interval: 1.075-1.084) and CO (5.297; 95% confidence interval: 5.177-5.418) in single-pollutants models. A significant association was shown at all lag multiple-day moving averages. Two-pollutant models identified an association between SO2 and mortality when adjusting for CO. In stratified analyses, SO2 exhibited a stronger association with death during the cold season, while CO exhibited a stronger association with mortality from IHD during the warm season. The risk of death was more robust in the elderly for both pollutants, but was greater in men for CO and in women for SO2.Overall, we found an association between short-term exposure to low-level SO2 and CO and the risk of IHD and non-accidental death."
https://openalex.org/W3158043540,"The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is an invasive species first detected in 2014. The insect feeds on plants causing severe damage in vineyards such as the occurrence of sooty mold fungus that impairs leaf photosynthesis. Currently, there is extensive research on how to track and ultimately prevent the spread of this species. It lays eggs that persist through the winter, while the adults die out, which presents a unique opportunity to enter infested or suspected infested areas to begin quarantine and management of the spread while the species is dormant. Detection dogs may be a tool that can be used to search out the spotted lanternfly egg masses during this overwintering period, however it is not known whether dogs can detect any specific odor from the spotted lanternfly eggs. Moreover, as the eggs are only available during certain times of the year, and hatch based on temperature, finding training aids for the dogs could prove difficult. In this study, we investigated whether three detection dogs could learn the odor from dead spotted lanternfly egg masses and if so, whether that would allow them to recognize live spotted lanternfly egg masses. We found that dogs could be trained to find dead spotted lanternfly egg masses, and could learn to ignore relevant controls, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity (up to 94.6% and 92.8%, respectively). Further, we found that after the training, dogs could find live spotted lanternfly egg masses without additional training and returned to previous levels of sensitivity and specificity within a few sessions. Coded videos of training and testing sessions showed that dogs spent more time at the egg masses than at controls, as expected from training. These results suggest that dead spotted lanternfly egg masses could be a useful training aid for spotted lanternfly detection dogs."

More specifically, we are adding to the literature by exploring whether there is an association between working temporarily and loneliness at work and whether loneliness at work partly explains the association between working temporarily and job satisfaction. To this end, we analyse-by means of a mediation model-a unique sample of Flemish employees in the private sector. We find that employees with a temporary contract experience more loneliness at work as opposed to employees with a permanent contract. In addition, we discover that loneliness at work mediates the association between working temporarily and job satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3139458539,"Background More than 85% of the malaria cases in Panama occur in poor, rural and indigenous regions like Darien Province. Vector diversity, infection rate and spatial distribution are important entomological parameters of malaria transmission dynamics. Their understanding is crucial for the development of effective disease control strategies. The objective of this study was to determine the composition of Anopheles species, their natural infection rate and their geographic distribution to better understand the malaria transmission dynamics in Darién, Panama. Methods Anophelines mosquitoes were captured during the rainy and dry season of 2016. We selected five communities where adult anophelines were collected using CDC light-traps, and through protective human-baited traps. Detection of natural infection and Plasmodium genotype were detected via nested PCR through the amplification of ssrRNA and the circumsporozoite protein gene (csp), respectively. Results A total of 1,063 mosquitoes were collected mosquitoes were collected for the detection of natural infection with Plasmodium spp . Nine Anophelines species were identified, with the predominant species being: An . (Nys . ) darlingi (45.0%) and An . (Nys . ) albimanus (42.6%). Natural infection in An . (Nys . ) albimanus with P . vivax was detected in one mosquito pool from the community Pueblo Tortuga (0.6%), three from Marraganti (1.7%), two from Bajo Chiquito (1.1%) and three pools from Alto Playona 3 (1.7%). For An . (Nys . ) darlingi mosquitoes, we detected seven positive pools from the community Bajo Chiquito (4.0%), two pools from Marraganti (1.1%) and two pools from Alto Playona (1.1%). The P . vivax allelic variant VK210 was detected in infected mosquitoes. Conclusion The results from this study provide new information on the transmission dynamics associated with anophelines vectors in the Darién region. This is the first report of natural P . vivax infection in An . (Nys . ) darlingi and its incrimination as a potential malaria vector in this region of Panama. Additional studies are necessary to expand our knowledge and determine crucial parameters in malaria transmission in Darién, which in turn will aid the National Malaria Program in attaining an adequate malaria control strategy towards malaria elimination."

Well-structured, high-quality simulations are useful alternatives to prepare students for clinical practice. However, nursing simulation scenarios focused on enhancing clinical judgment in managing upper gastrointestinal bleeding are limited. This study aims to develop, apply, and evaluate an effective nursing simulation scenario for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding based on Tanner's clinical judgment model using a mixed methods study design. A high-fidelity patient simulation was conducted among 80 undergraduate nursing students divided into a simulated control group (n = 39) and an experimental group (n = 41). Subsequent student performance evaluations used questionnaires and video recordings. After scenario simulations, the students showed a statistically significant increase in theoretical knowledge (p = 0.001) and clinical performance skills (p < 0.001), but there was no significant increase in self-confidence (p = 0.291). According to the video analysis, the ""noticing"" clinical judgment phase was the most frequently observed phase, while ""reflection"" was the least frequently observed phase. Additionally, ""education"" was the most frequently observed nursing domain, and ""anxiety"" was the least frequently observed domain. Although further simulation repetitions are required to reinforce students' self-confidence when caring for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the scenario was deemed effective. Moreover, emphasis should be placed on developing various scenarios to strengthen students' clinical judgment skills, especially ""reflecting"" and ""emotional care."""
https://openalex.org/W3157709705,"Adherence of bacteria to the human intestinal mucosa can facilitate their internalization and the development of pathological processes. Escherichia coli O104:H4 is considered a hybrid strain (enteroaggregative hemorrhagic E. coli [EAHEC]), sharing virulence factors found in enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), and enteroaggregative (EAEC) E. coli pathotypes. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of natural and synthetic antimicrobials (carvacrol, oregano extract, brazilin, palo de Brasil extract, and rifaximin) on the adherence of EHEC O157:H7, EAEC 042, and EAHEC O104:H4 to HEp-2 cells and to assess the expression of various genes involved in this process. Two concentrations of each antimicrobial that did not affect (p≤0.05) bacterial viability or damage the bacterial membrane integrity were used. Assays were conducted to determine whether the antimicrobials alter adhesion by affecting bacteria and/or alter adhesion by affecting the HEp-2 cells, whether the antimicrobials could detach bacteria previously adhered to HEp-2 cells, and whether the antimicrobials could modify the adherence ability exhibited by the bacteria for several cycles of adhesion assays. Giemsa stain and qPCR were used to assess the adhesion pattern and gene expression, respectively. The results showed that the antimicrobials affected the adherence abilities of the bacteria, with carvacrol, oregano extract, and rifaximin reducing up to 65% (p≤0.05) of E. coli adhered to HEp-2 cells. Carvacrol (10 mg/ml) was the most active compound against EHAEC O104:H4, even altering its aggregative adhesion pattern. There were changes in the expression of adhesion-related genes (aggR, pic, aap, aggA, and eae) in the bacteria and oxidative stress-related genes (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and GPx) in the HEp-2 cells. In general, we demonstrated that carvacrol, oregano extract, and rifaximin at sub-minimal bactericidal concentrations interfere with target sites in E. coli, reducing the adhesion efficiency."

Method Using the stratified cluster sampling method, male college students who self-reported sexual behavior were selected as survey subjects in 13 colleges and universities in 11 cities of Zhejiang Province from October to November 2018. We used a custom online questionnaire to collect information on the demographic characteristics, sexual attitudes, sexual behaviors, and HIV interventions of the respondents. The χ 2 test was performed on the composition ratios between different groups. With the occurrence of casual sexual behavior as the dependent variable, logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing casual male sexual behavior. Results A total of 2734 male college students were surveyed, aged 20.20±1.41 years, of which 595 had casual sex, accounting for 21.7%. The rate of HIV prevention awareness among the participants was 85.1%. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving a self-assessment of HIV risk conducted by the school ( Ajusted OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.14–1.84), knowing that HIV self-test kits were available at school ( Ajusted OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.56–2.62), accepting one-night stands ( Ajusted OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 2.18–3.66), accepting commercial sex ( Ajusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.53–2.48), being a man who has sex with men ( Ajusted OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.37–2.39), being a senior ( Ajusted OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30–0.71), having knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment ( Ajusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.51–0.86), and knowing that the CDC provides HIV testing services ( Ajusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41–0.77) were factors influencing male college students’ casual sexual behavior. Conclusion Male college students who have causal sexual behaviors have a high degree of openness in sexual attitudes, insufficient knowledge of AIDS prevention, and knowledge of HIV testing-related information but low testing rates. For male college students’ HIV prevention education intervention, it is necessary to emphasize the establishment of correct sexual attitudes and concepts and promote safe sexual behaviors to prevent the spread of HIV."

Ubiquitination plays an important role in controlling the abundance and thus nuclear accumulation of Nrf1 proteins, but the regulatory enzymes that act on Nrf1 are not fully defined. Here, we identified ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinating enzyme, as a novel regulator of Nrf1 activity. We found that USP7 interacts with Nrf1a and TCF11—the two long protein isoforms of Nrf1. Expression of wildtype USP7, but not its catalytically defective mutant, resulted in decreased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a, leading to their increased stability and increased transactivation of reporter gene expression by TCF11 and Nrf1a. In contrast, knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of USP7 dramatically increased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a and reduction of their steady state levels. Loss of USP7 function attenuated the induction of Nrf1 protein expression in response to treatment with arsenic and other toxic metals, and inhibition of USP7 activity significantly sensitized cells to arsenic treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that USP7 may act to modulate abundance of Nrf1 protein to induce gene expression in response to toxic metal exposure.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor-1 (Nrf1), also known as NFE2L1, is a transcription factor essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Genetic ablation of the Nrf1 gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality, and tissue-specific inactivation of Nrf1 using mice bearing the Cre/LoxP conditional nrf1 null allele indicates that Nrf1 protects against neurodegeneration and development of steatohepatitis (1Chan J.Y.

Long isoforms of Nrf1 are made up of TCF11 and Nrf1a (also been designated previously as Nrf1). TCF11 consisting of 772 amino acids is the longest protein, whereas Nrf1a, composed of 742 amino acids, is a spliceoform missing residues 242 to 271 of TCF11 (15Luna L. Skammelsrud N. Johnsen O. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Structural organization and mapping of the human TCF11 gene.Genomics. 1995; 27: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both TCF11 and Nrf1a share the same N-terminal domain that targets them to the endoplasmic reticulum where they are N-glycosylated. To gain entry into the nucleus, they must undergo retrograde translocation into the cytoplasm, where they are deglycosylated by NGLY1 (N-glycanase 1) and cleaved by DDI2 (DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2). Normally, little Nrf1a and TCF11 accumulate because of proteasome-mediated degradation. It is thought that proteasome inhibition allows them to escape ubiquitination and degradation leading to their accumulation and import into the nucleus to mediate gene expression (16Koizumi S.

Several E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified to regulate ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a. Deubiquitinating enzymes work in opposition to protein ubiquitination by catalyzing the deconjugation of ubiquitin molecules from proteins, and they are an important regulatory mechanism controlling the function and abundance of proteins in a broad range of cellular processes (27Sowa M.E.

Currently, there are more than a hundred deubiquitinating enzymes that have been identified. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as herpesvirus associated USP, belongs to the largest ubiquitin-specific protease subfamily (28Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M.

Although USP7 was originally identified through its interaction with ICP0 (infected cell polypeptide 0), a herpes viral protein, USP7 has been shown to play a key role in regulating the stability of tumor suppressor p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), as well as proteins involved in multiple cellular pathways including various aspects of the cell cycle, immune response, cell survival, development, tumorigenesis, and viral infection (31Cummins J.M.

In this study, we found USP7 to copurify with Nrf1a, one of the long isoforms, in a screen to identify Nrf1-interacting proteins. We show here that USP7 counteracts ubiquitination and promotes stabilization of Nrf1a and TCF11. USP7 enhances TCF11- and Nrf1a-mediated transcriptional activation. Expression of TCF11 and Nrf1a by toxic heavy metal exposure is blunted in USP7 knockout cells, and inhibition of USP7 function blocked Nrf1a-mediated protection against arsenic-induced cytotoxicity. This study demonstrates that USP7 is a determinant of Nrf1 expression. In an effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in regulating Nrf1 expression, we previously interrogated the Nrf1 interactome in cells by affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (37Han J.W. Valdez J.L. Ho D.V. Lee C.S. Kim H.M. Wang X. Huang L. Chan J.Y. Nuclear factor-erythroid-2 related transcription factor-1 (Nrf1) is regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2017; 110: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). USP7 was among the different proteins identified that copurified with streptavidin-tagged Nrf1a. To verify interaction with USP7, coimmunoprecipitation assays were done. We first examined whether endogenous Nrf1 proteins interact with USP7. HEK293 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of Flag-tagged USP7 expression plasmid, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-TCF11 antibody that detects both TCF11 and Nrf1a, which are the long isoforms of Nrf1. As shown in Figure 1A, Western blotting of immunoprecipitates prepared from USP7-Flag-transfected cells showed prominent bands just above and below the 130-kDa marker, which are the expected migration of the ER membrane-associated (∼120 kDa) and membrane-free (∼110 kDa) forms of TCF11 and Nrf1a (17Radhakrishnan S.K. den Besten W.

To examine whether endogenous USP7 interacts with the two different long isoforms of Nrf1, coimmunoprecipitations were performed on cells expressing V5-tagged TCF11 or V5-tagged Nrf1a. HEK293T cells were transfected with two different concentrations of TCF11-V5 or Nrf1a-V5 expression plasmid, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-USP7 antibody. As shown in Figure 1, B and C, endogenous USP7 was coimmunoprecipitated by TCF11-V5 and Nrf1a-V5 in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that USP7 interacts with both long isoforms of Nrf1. It is interesting to note that immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from cells transfected with USP7-Flag before immunoprecipitation showed increased steady-state levels of endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, input control panel). This finding suggests that USP7 upregulates Nrf1 expression. To confirm this observation, we wish to determine if lowering endogenous USP7 level by RNA interference (siRNA)-mediated depletion of USP7 would reduce TCF11/Nrf1a expression. Two different siRNAs were used to silence USP7, and as shown in Figure 2A, knockdown of USP7 diminished endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a protein levels. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 mitigated the effect of USP7 knockdown on TCF11/Nrf1a levels, suggesting that the effects of USP7 on TCF11/Nrf1a were dependent on the proteasome. As expected, MDM2, which is a known USP7 substrate, was decreased by RNAi-mediated knockdown of USP7 and this effect was also reversed by MG132. To corroborate the siRNA findings, the effects of GNE-6776, a small molecule compound known to selectively inhibit catalytic activity of USP7 (38Turnbull A.P. Ioannidis S. Krajewski W.W. Pinto-Fernandez A. Heride C. Martin A.C.L. Tonkin L.M. Townsend E.C. Buker S.M. Lancia D.R. Caravella J.A. Toms A.V. Charlton T.M. Lahdenranta J. Wilker E. et al.Molecular basis of USP7 inhibition by selective small-molecule inhibitors.Nature. 2017; 550: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was also examined. Endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a levels, and MDM2 as control, were reduced by GNE-6776 and blocked by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2B). RT-qPCR shows that Nrf1 mRNA levels were not altered by GNE-6776 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the effects of USP7 on Nrf1 expression is at the protein level. To verify independently the effects of USP7 on TCF11 and Nrf1a, HEK293 cells were transfected with USP7-Flag along with TCF11-V5 or Nrf1a-V5 and their expression analyzed by Western blotting. Steady-state levels of bands corresponding to membrane-free (lower band) V5-tagged TCF11 and Nrf1a were significantly increased by overexpression of USP7-Flag in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, D and E, left panels). As expected, transfection of USP7-Flag increased expression of endogenous MDM2. In contrast, steady-state levels of V5-tagged-TCF11 and Nrf1a, as well as endogenous MDM2, were unaffected by transfection of the catalytically inactive USP7-CS-Flag (Fig. 2, D and E, right panels). To measure the effects of USP7 on turnover of Nrf1 proteins, the stability of TCF11-V5 and Nrf1a-V5 was assessed using cycloheximide chase assay in cells cotransfected with USP7-Flag or USP7-CS-Flag. In the absence of USP7-Flag, very little TCF11-V5 remained by 120 min after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the half-life of TCF11-V5 was prolonged by USP7-Flag, but not by the catalytically inactive form of USP7, suggesting that deubiquitinating activity of USP7 is required to stabilize Nrf1a (Fig. 2F). Similar results were obtained with cycloheximide chase of Nrf1a-V5 (Fig. 2G). Based on these results, we conclude that the stability of TCF11 and Nrf1a are extended by USP7. Next, we examined the effects of USP7 on TCF11/Nrf1a ubiquitination. Endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a were immunoprecipitated from cells expressing HA-Ubiquitin and immunoblotted against HA-tag. Treatment with the USP7 inhibitor, GNE-6776, led to an increase in ubiquitination of endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a, indicating that USP7 has deubiquitination ability toward TCF11/Nrf1a (Fig. 3A). To confirm this finding, USP7 siRNA was transfected into HEK293 cells to knock down endogenous USP7 expression. Compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, the level of endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a ubiquitination was increased by knockdown of USP7 (Fig. 3B). To verify that USP7 deubiquitinates TCF11 and Nrf1a specifically, HEK293 cells were transfected with TCF11-V5 or Nrf1a-V5 and HA-tagged ubiquitin along with increasing amounts of Flag-tagged USP7, or USP7-CS, a dominant negative catalytically inactive form of USP7. V5-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-V5 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. Ubiquitinated forms of TCF11-V5 and Nrf1a-V5 were markedly reduced by overexpression of USP7 (Fig. 3, C and E). In contrast, levels of ubiquitinated TCF11-V5 and Nrf1a-V5 were not affected by expression of USP7-CS (Fig. 3, D and F). These results show that USP7 is able to stimulate deubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a in cells and support the idea that USP7 regulates the stability of Nrf1 proteins through USP7 deubiquitinase activity. Next, we sought to investigate whether USP7 plays a role in regulating Nrf1 levels in response to cellular stress. Arsenic has previously been shown to increase Nrf1 protein levels (39Zhao R. Hou Y. Xue P. Woods C.G. Fu J. Feng B. Guan D. Sun G. Chan J.Y. Waalkes M.P. Andersen M.E. Pi J. Long isoforms of NRF1 contribute to arsenic-induced antioxidant response in human keratinocytes.Environ. Health Perspect. 2011; 119: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although arsenic has been associated with induction of oxidative stress in cells, treatment with menadione, tert-butylhydroquinone or thapsigargin, which are agents known to cause oxidative or ER stress did not lead to increased Nrf1 protein levels (Fig. 4A). Given that arsenic is a toxic metal, we investigated the effects other metal compounds on TCF11 and Nrf1a levels in HEK293 cells. Consistent with previous findings, HEK293 cells treated with arsenic showed upregulation of Nrf1 protein levels (Fig. 4B). In addition, endogenous Nrf1 levels were induced after a short exposure to cadmium and mercury, as well as lead and chromium suggesting that TCF11 and Nrf1a are stabilized by heavy metals (Fig. 4B, left and right panels). To examine the effects of arsenic on TCF11/Nrf1a ubiquitination, cells expressing HA-Ub were treated with menadione or arsenic, and endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a were immunoprecipitated for immunoblotting against HA-Ub and endogenous USP7. Compared with vehicle control and menadione, ubiquitination of endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a was decreased by arsenic (Fig. 4C). However, only a modest increase in USP7-TCF11/Nrf1a was detected by coimmunoprecipitation after arsenic treatment. To rule out possible cell-specific effects, expression of endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a in response to toxic metal exposure was examined in HCT116 cells, and similar results were obtained (Fig. 4D, left panel). To determine whether USP7 plays a role in this response, the effects of toxic metal exposure on endogenous TCF11/Nrf1a expression was examined in USP7 knockout HCT116 cells. Unlike wildtype cells, induction of TCF11/Nrf1a by toxic metal exposure was blunted or not observed in USP7 knockout cells (Fig. 4D, right panel). To confirm these observations, the half-life of V5-tagged Nrf1a in response to arsenic was evaluated by cycloheximide chase assays in USP7 wildtype and knockout cells. In USP7 wildtype cells, Nrf1a-V5 was stabilized by arsenic treatment (Fig. 4E, left panel and Fig. 4F). In contrast, stabilization by arsenic was blunted in USP7 knockout cells (Fig. 4E, right panel, and Fig. 4F). Similar results were obtained for V5-tagged TCF11 (Fig. 4G). Based on these results, we conclude that USP7 promotes stabilization of Nrf1 proteins in response to toxic metals. To investigate the significance of the interaction between USP7 and Nrf1, we used a transient reporter assay to examine whether USP7 affects transcriptional activity of TCF11 and Nrf1a. HEK293 cells were transfected with Nrf1a-V5 and a Nrf1-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid along with USP7, or USP7-CS expression plasmids. Luciferase reporter expression was enhanced by coexpression of USP7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). In contrast, coexpression of the catalytically inactive USP7-CS had no effect on reporter activation by Nrf1a (Fig. 5A). Similarly, coexpression of USP7, but not USP7-CS, enhanced reporter expression by TCF11-V5 (Fig. 5B). To further confirm the role of USP7 on Nrf1-mediated transcriptional activation, we examined the expression of known Nrf1-target genes in USP7 knockout cells. Compared with wildtype cells, expression of various proteasome genes that were examined was markedly reduced in USP7 knockout cells (Fig. 5C), and transfection of Nrf1a cDNA fully or partially restored their expression in knockout cells. These results indicate that the transacting function of TCF11 and Nrf1a is enhanced through increased protein levels enabled by USP7. To further determine the functional significance of Nrf1 as a USP7 substrate, we sought to determine the influence of USP7 on Nrf1-mediated cell survival in response to toxic metal exposure. For this purpose, we measured the effects of blocking USP7 function on the viability of wildtype and Nrf1 knockout cells in response to arsenic treatment for 24 h. We used a pair of Nrf1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, one of which is reconstituted with wildtype Nrf1a cDNA. As expected, Nrf1 knockout cells were more sensitive to arsenic-induced toxicity compared with knockout cells expressing Nrf1a (Fig. 6A). Next, we investigated the effects of USP7 inhibition. Compared with Nrf1 knockout cells, knockout cells expressing Nrf1a treated with vehicle-control were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of arsenic. However, pretreatment with GNE-6776 rendered Nrf1a-expressing knockout cells sensitive to arsenic toxicity (Fig. 6A). To substantiate these findings, we also examined viability of USP7 knockout cells in response to arsenic. Cells treated with increasing concentrations of arsenic were monitored after 24 h. USP7 knockout cells were more sensitive to arsenic than wildtype cells (Fig. 6B). To establish a role for Nrf1 in arsenic sensitivity, USP7 knockout cells were transfected with Nrf1a-V5, or empty vector as experimental control. In comparison with control transfected cells, Nrf1a-transfected cells exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity to arsenic. These findings indicate that loss of"

Skin colonizing bacteria likely play an important role in the severity of this disease. Studying the canine skin microbiota using traditional microbiological methods has many limitations which can be overcome by molecular procedures. The aim of this study was to describe the bacterial microbiota of the skin and ear canals of healthy non-allergic and allergic German shepherd dogs (GSDs) without acute flare or concurrent skin infection and to compare both. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data revealed no differences of bacterial community patterns between the different body sites (axilla, front dorsal interdigital skin, groin, and ear canals) in non-allergic dogs. The microbiota at the different body sites of non-allergic GSDs showed no significant differences. Only for the samples obtained from the axilla the bacterial microbiota of allergic dogs was characterized by a lower species richness compared to that of non-allergic dogs and the bacterial community composition of the skin and ear canals of allergic dogs showed body site specific differences compared to non-allergic dogs. Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum identified from the non-allergic dogs and Proteobacteria from allergic dogs. Macrococcus spp. were more abundant on non-allergic skin while Sphingomonas spp. were more abundant on the allergic skin. Forward step redundancy analysis of metadata indicated that the household the dogs came from had the strongest impact on the composition of the skin microbiome followed by sex, host health status and body site."

The results showed that, during the past 20 years, the forest area, forest stock, and biomass carbon storage in Tibet have been steadily increasing, with an average annual increase of 1.85×10 4 hm 2 , 0.033×10 7 m 3 , and 0.22×10 7 t, respectively. Influenced by geographical conditions and the natural environment, the forest area and biomass carbon storage gradually increased from the northwest to the southeast, particularly in Linzhi and Changdu, where there are many primitive forests, which serve as important carbon sinks in Tibet. In terms of the composition of tree species, coniferous forests are dominant in Tibet, particularly those containing Abies fabri , Picea asperata , and Pinus densata , which comprise approximately 45% of the total forest area in Tibet. The ecological location of Tibet has resulted in the area being dominated by shelter forest, comprising 68.76% of the total area, 64.72% of the total forest stock, and 66.34% of the total biomass carbon reserves. The biomass carbon storage was observed to first increase and then decrease with increasing forest age, which is primarily caused by tree growth characteristics. In over-mature forests, trees’ photosynthesis decreases along with their accumulation of organic matter, and the trees can die. In addition, this study also observed that the proportion of mature and over-mature forest in Tibet is excessively large, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of forestry in the region. This problem should be addressed in future management and utilization activities."

Normally, the models that measure the intellectual capital make use of investments in intangible assets, as indicators of the generation of value by the company; or are based on a holistic measure, using another focus to validate. This research proposes a new method to measure intellectual capital, reconciling the use of financial measures for the management of intellectual capital and its antecedents in triangulated indices; it also determines relationship path coefficients, between constructs developed from a general conceptual model, based on the academic and professional literature. The proposed method combines component indicators with holistic indicators using a structural equation model, allowing differentiating the components of intellectual capital from the stock of intellectual capital. The method is applied to more than 1,600 European companies from 2004 to 2015 to assess its validity, presenting the monetary value of intellectual capital in these companies. The results allow a comparison of the situation of intellectual capital in companies in different countries and industries, opening an opportunity to disclosure intellectual capital."
https://openalex.org/W3159547183,"Wetlands are vulnerable to plant invasions and the decomposition of invasive plant litter could make impacts on the ecosystem services of wetlands including nutrient cycle and carbon sequestration. However, few studies have explored the effects of nutrient enrichment and water level change on the decomposition of invasive plant litter. In this study, we conducted a control experiment using the litterbag method to compare the decomposition rates and nutrient release in the litter of an invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides in three water levels and two nutrient enrichment treatments. This study found that the water level change and nutrient enrichment showed significant effects on the litter decomposition and nutrient dynamic of A. philoxeroides. The increase of water level significantly reduced the decomposition rate and nutrient release of litter in the nutrient control treatment, whereas no clear relationship was observed in the nutrient enrichment treatment, indicating that the effect of water level change on litter decomposition might be affected by nutrient enrichment. At the late stage of decomposition, the increase of phosphorus (P) concentration and the decrease of the ratio of carbon to P suggested that the decomposition of invasive plant litter was limited by P. Our results suggest that controlling P enrichment in water bodies is essential for the management of invasive plant and carbon sequestration of wetlands. In addition, the new index we proposed could provide a basis for quantifying the impact of invasive plant litter decomposition on carbon cycle in wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W3157350505,"Postoperative abdominal infections belong to the most common triggers of sepsis and septic shock in intensive care units worldwide. While monocytes play a central role in mediating the initial host response to infections, sepsis-induced immune dysregulation is characterized by a defective antigen presentation to T-cells via loss of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II DR (HLA-DR) surface expression. Here, we hypothesized a sepsis-induced differential occupancy of the CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), an architectural protein and superordinate regulator of transcription, inside the Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC-II) region in patients with postoperative sepsis, contributing to an altered monocytic transcriptional response during critical illness.Compared to a matched surgical control cohort, postoperative sepsis was associated with selective and enduring increase in CTCF binding within the MHC-II. In detail, increased CTCF binding was detected at four sites adjacent to classical HLA class II genes coding for proteins expressed on monocyte surface. Gene expression analysis revealed a sepsis-associated decreased transcription of (i) the classical HLA genes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 and (ii) the gene of the MHC-II master regulator, CIITA (Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator). Increased CTCF binding persisted in all sepsis patients, while transcriptional recovery CIITA was exclusively found in long-term survivors.Our experiments demonstrate differential and persisting alterations of CTCF occupancy within the MHC-II, accompanied by selective changes in the expression of spatially related HLA class II genes, indicating an important role of CTCF in modulating the transcriptional response of immunocompromised human monocytes during critical illness."
https://openalex.org/W3157416881,"Poor sanitation worldwide leads to an annual loss of approximately $222.9 billion and is the second leading cause of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY’s) lost due to diarrhoea. Yet in Kenya, the slow rate and levels at which the household’s access improved sanitation facilities remain a concern, and it is unknown if the cost of new technologies is a barrier to access. This study assessed the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for SAFI and SATO sanitation products and identified those factors that affect the willingness to pay (WTP) valuation estimates by households in three counties in Kenya. It used quantitative economic evaluation research integrated within a cross-sectional survey. Contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to determine the maximum WTP for sanitation in households. We used the logistic regression model in data analysis. A total of 211 households were interviewed in each county, giving a total sample size of 633 households. The mean WTP for SAFI latrines was $153.39 per household, while the mean WTP for SATO pans and SATO stools was $11.49 and $14.77 respectively. For SAFI latrines, households in Kakamega were willing to pay $6.6 more than average while in Siaya, the households were willing to pay $5.1 less than the average. The main determinants of households WTP for the two sanitation products included household’s proximity to the toilet (p = 0.0001), household income (β = .2245741, p = 0.004), sanitation product (β = -2968.091; p = 0.004), socioeconomic status (β = -3305.728, p = 0.004) and a household’s satisfaction level with the current toilet (β = -4570.602; p = 0.0001). Increased proximity of households to the toilet, higher incomes, and providing loan facilities or subsidy to poor households could increase the demand for these sanitation technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3158289564,"Hydrophobins are surface-active proteins produced by filamentous fungi. The amphiphilic structure of hydrophobins is very compact, containing a distinct hydrophobic patch on one side of the molecule, locked by four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Hydrophobins form dimers and multimers in solution to shield these hydrophobic patches from water exposure. Multimer formation in solution is dynamic, and hydrophobin monomers can be exchanged between multimers. Unlike class I hydrophobins, class II hydrophobins assemble into highly ordered films at the air–water interface. In order to increase our understanding of the strength and nature of the interaction between hydrophobins, we used atomic force microscopy for single molecule force spectroscopy to explore the molecular interaction forces between class II hydrophobins from Trichoderma reesei under different environmental conditions. A genetically engineered hydrophobin variant, NCys-HFBI, enabled covalent attachment of proteins to the apex of the atomic force microscopy cantilever tip and sample surfaces in controlled orientation with sufficient freedom of movement to measure molecular forces between hydrophobic patches. The measured rupture force between two assembled hydrophobins was ∼31 pN, at a loading rate of 500 pN/s. The results indicated stronger interaction between hydrophobins and hydrophobic surfaces than between two assembling hydrophobin molecules. Furthermore, this interaction was stable under different environmental conditions, which demonstrates the dominance of hydrophobicity in hydrophobin–hydrophobin interactions. This is the first time that interaction forces between hydrophobin molecules, and also between naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces, have been measured directly at a single-molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W3158824059,"The quality and safety of prescribing in general practice is important, Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can be used which present alerts to health professionals when prescribing in order to identify patients at risk of potentially hazardous prescribing. It is known that such computerised alerts may improve the safety of prescribing in hospitals but their implementation and sustainable use in general practice is less well understood. We aimed to understand the factors that influenced the successful implementation and sustained use in primary care of a CDS system.Participants were purposively recruited from Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and general practices in the North West and East Midlands regions of England and from the CDS developers. We conducted face-to-face and telephone-based semi-structured qualitative interviews with staff stakeholders. A selection of participants was interviewed longitudinally to explore the further sustainability 1-2 years after implementation of the CDS system. The analysis, informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), was thematic, iterative and conducted alongside data collection.Thirty-nine interviews were conducted either individually or in groups, with 33 stakeholders, including 11 follow-up interviews. Eight themes were interpreted in alignment with the four NPT constructs: Coherence (The purpose of the CDS: Enhancing medication safety and improving cost effectiveness; Relationship of users to the technology; Engagement and communication between different stakeholders); Cognitive Participation (Management of the profile of alerts); Collective Action (Prescribing in general practice, patient and population characteristics and engagement with patients; Knowledge);and Reflexive Monitoring (Sustaining the use of the CDS through maintenance and customisation; Learning and behaviour change. Participants saw that the CDS could have a role in enhancing medication safety and in the quality of care. Engagement through communication and support for local primary care providers and management leaders was considered important for successful implementation. Management of prescribing alert profiles for general practices was a dynamic process evolving over time. At regional management levels, work was required to adapt, and modify the system to optimise its use in practice and fulfil local priorities. Contextual factors, including patient and population characteristics, could impact upon the decision-making processes of prescribers influencing the response to alerts. The CDS could operate as a knowledge base allowing prescribers access to evidence-based information that they otherwise would not have.This qualitative evaluation utilised NPT to understand the implementation, use and sustainability of a widely deployed CDS system offering prescribing alerts in general practice. The system was understood as having a role in medication safety in providing relevant patient specific information to prescribers in a timely manner. Engagement between stakeholders was considered important for the intervention in ensuring prescribers continued to utilise its functionality. Sustained implementation might be enhanced by careful profile management of the suite of alerts in the system. Our findings suggest that the use and sustainability of the CDS was related to prescribers' perceptions of the relevance of alerts. Shared understanding of the purpose of the CDS between CCGS and general practices particularly in balancing cost saving and safety messages could be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W3159818428,"The single-epithelial cell layer of the gut mucosa serves as an essential barrier between the host and luminal microflora and plays a major role in innate immunity against invading pathogens. Nuclear factor kB (NF-κB), a central component of the cellular signaling machinery, regulates immune response and inflammation. NF-κB proteins are activated by signaling pathways downstream to microbial recognition receptors and cytokines receptors. Highly regulated NF-κB activity in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) is essential for normal gut homeostasis; dysregulated activity has been linked to a number of disease states, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn’s Disease (CD). Our aim was to visualize and quantify spatial and temporal dynamics of NF-κB activity in steady state and inflamed human gut. Lentivirus technology was used to transduce the IEC of human gut xenografts in SCID mice with a NF-κB luminescence reporter system. NF-κB signaling was visualized and quantified using low resolution, intravital imaging of the whole body and high resolution, immunofluorescence microscopic imaging of the tissues. We show that NF-κB is activated in select subset of IEC with low “leaky” NF-κB activity. These unique inflammatory epithelial cells are clustered in the gut into discrete hotspots of NF-κB activity that are visible in steady state and selectively activated by systemic LPS and human TNFα or luminal bacteria. The presence of inflammatory hotspots in the normal and inflamed gut might explain the patchy mucosal lesions characterizing CD and thus could have important implications for diagnosis and therapy."

The ability to parse conversational speech depends crucially on the ability to identify boundaries between prosodic phrases. This is done naturally by the human ear, yet has proved surprisingly difficult to achieve reliably and simply in an automatic manner. Efforts to date have focused on detecting phrase boundaries using a variety of linguistic and acoustic cues. We propose a method which does not require model training and utilizes two prosodic cues that are based on ASR output. Boundaries are identified using discontinuities in speech rate (pre-boundary lengthening and phrase-initial acceleration) and silent pauses. The resulting phrases preserve syntactic validity, exhibit pitch reset, and compare well with manual tagging of prosodic boundaries. Collectively, our findings support the notion of prosodic phrases that represent coherent patterns across textual and acoustic parameters."

The most frequent users in our sample were patients (66%), patient support networks (24%) and professional organisations (10%). Patients who were communicating their health update (31%) were the most frequently posted content and 25% of these posts described a symptom experience. Our findings demonstrate that patients and their support networks are frequenting Instagram and therefore may be able to receive and benefit from tailored intervention, however there is an identified gap in health-organisations participating in this virtual online community."

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the association of DM with short-term prognosis, length of stay, and expenditure in patients with AKI.This study was based on the 2013 nationwide survey in China. According to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and expanded criteria of AKI, 7604 patients with AKI were identified, and 1404 and 6200 patients were with and without DM, respectively. Clinical characteristics, outcomes, length of stay, and costs of these patients were compared. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of DM with mortality, failed renal recovery, length of stay, and costs.Patients with AKI and DM were older, had higher male preponderance (61.9%), presented with more comorbidities, and had higher serum creatinine levels compared with those without DM. An apparent increase in all-cause in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and costs was found in patients with DM. DM was not independently associated with failed renal recovery (adjusted OR (95%CI): 1.08 (0.94-1.25)) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR (95%): 1.16 (0.95-1.41)) in multivariate models. However, the diabetic status was positively associated with the length of stay (β = 0.06, p<0.05) and hospital expenditure (β = 0.10, p<0.01) in hospital after adjusting for possible confounders.In hospitalized AKI patients, DM (vs. no DM) is independently associated with longer length of stay and greater costs, but is not associated with an increased risk for failed renal recovery and in-hospital mortality."

During two consecutive crop seasons, we studied the acquisition of physiological quality of peanut seeds during maturation in tropical conditions. We bring new insights about the period of late maturation of seeds and the influence of the maternal environment on physiological quality. We monitored water content, dry weight, ability of germination, desiccation tolerance, vigor and longevity. In addition, we monitored temperature and precipitation throughout plant growth. We demonstrate that the physiological quality of peanut seeds is acquired during development, with a maximum between 57 and 76 days after flowering in the late stage of maturation. This final period represents about 25% of the development, considered the best time to harvest peanut seeds with the highest quality. Our findings also support the idea that the adequate proportion of rainfall and thermal sum in the maternal environment are factors that favor the acquisition of peanut seed longevity."

Clinical and CT characteristics of smear-negative pulmonary TB patients with negative Xpert MTB/RIF results were compared with positive results.Of 1,400 patients, 365 (26.1%) were diagnosed with pulmonary TB and 190 of 365 patients (52.1%) were negative for sputum acid-fast bacilli. The diagnosis of pulmonary TB was based on a positive culture, positive Xpert MTB/RIF or the clinical diagnoses of patients treated with an anti-TB medication. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF for smear-negative pulmonary TB were 41.1%, 100%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively. Finally, 172 patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB who underwent chest CT within 2 weeks of diagnosis were included to compare Xpert-positive (n = 66) and Xpert- negative (n = 106) groups. Patients with sputum Xpert-negative TB showed lower positive rates for sputum culture (33.0% vs. 81.8%, p<0.001) and bronchoalveolar lavage culture (53.3% vs. 84.6%, p = 0.042) than in Xpert-positive TB. Time to start TB medication was longer in patients with Xpert-negative TB than in Xpert-positive TB (11.3±16.4 days vs. 5.0±8.7 days, p = 0.001). On chest CT, sputum Xpert-negative TB showed significantly lower frequency of consolidation (21.7% vs. 39.4%, p = 0.012), cavitation (23.6% vs. 37.9%, p = 0.045), more frequent peripheral location (50.9% vs. 21.2 p = 0.001) with lower area of involvement (4.3±4.3 vs. 7.6±6.4, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed peripheral location (odds ratios, 2.565; 95% confidence interval: 1.157-5.687; p = 0.020) and higher total extent of the involved lobe (odds ratios, 0.928; 95% confidence interval: 0.865-0.995; p = 0.037) were significant factors associated with Xpert MTB/RIF-negative TB. Regardless of Xpert positivity, more than 80% of all cases were diagnosed of TB on chest CT by radiologists.The detection rate of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF assay was relatively low for smear negative pulmonary TB. Chest CT image interpretation may play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment of Xpert MTB/RIF-negative pulmonary TB."

Our theory estimates how many motif classes remain undiscovered. As commonly done, we describe motif classes as regular expressions specifying motif length and the allowed amino acids at each motif position. We measure motif specificity for a pair of motif classes by quantifying how many motif-discriminating positions prevent a protein subsequence from matching the two classes at once. We derive theorems for the maximal number of motif classes that can simultaneously maintain a certain number of motif-discriminating positions between all pairs of classes in the motif universe, for a given amino acid alphabet. We also calculate the fraction of all protein subsequences that would belong to a motif class if all potential motif classes came into existence. Naturally occurring pairs of motif classes present most often a single motif-discriminating position. This mild specificity maximizes the potential number of coexisting motif classes, the expansion of the motif universe due to amino acid modifications and the fraction of amino acid sequences that code for a motif instance. As a result, thousands of linear motif classes may remain undiscovered."

However, the relative roles of these regulators are not known. To dissect this system, we focused on the FRP1 and ACO1 genes, which are induced and repressed, respectively, under iron deprivation conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the trimeric HAP complex and Sef1 are recruited to both FRP1 and ACO1 promoters. While the HAP complex occupancy at the FRP1 promoter was Sef1-dependent, occupancy of Sef1 was not dependent on the HAP complex. Furthermore, iron deprivation elicited histone H3-Lys9 hyperacetylation and Pol II recruitment mediated by the trimeric HAP complex and Sef1 at the FRP1 promoter. In contrast, at the ACO1 promoter, the HAP trimeric complex and Hap43 promoted histone deacetylation and also limited Pol II recruitment under iron deprivation conditions. Mutational analysis showed that the SAGA subunits Gcn5, Spt7, and Spt20 are required for C. albicans growth in iron-deficient medium and for H3-K9 acetylation and transcription from the FRP1 promoter. Thus, the trimeric HAP complex promotes FRP1 transcription by stimulating H3K9Ac and Pol II recruitment and, along with Hap43, functions as a repressor of ACO1 by maintaining a deacetylated promoter under iron-deficient conditions.

Genome-wide analyses showed that Hap43 and Sef1 have a widespread role in transcriptional control of iron homeostasis. Microarray analysis showed that of the Hap43-regulated genes, ∼56% were repressed and ∼44% induced were under Fe-deplete conditions (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M.

Interestingly, comparison of the Sef1 and Hap43 transcriptomes showed that ∼35% are induced and ∼14% repressed commonly in a Hap43-and Sef1-dependent manner (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B.

Genome-wide ChIP-Chip and microarray analyses showed that Sef1 is recruited to the promoters of ∼20% (∼60 genes) of low iron-induced genes including several iron uptake genes (for example, FRP1 encoding ferric reductase) and to the promoters of HAP2, HAP3, and HAP43 transcriptional regulator genes (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M. An iron homeostasis regulatory circuit with reciprocal roles in Candida albicans commensalism and pathogenesis.Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10: 118-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Hap2-Hap3-Hap5 trimeric complex, however, is recruited to both FRP1 and ACO1 gene promoters, respectively, to activate or repress their transcription under Fe-deprivation conditions (14Singh R.P. Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although Hap43 controls the induction of ∼44% (224 genes) of the transcriptome, paradoxically, Hap43 is bound largely to low-iron repressed gene promoters (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M. An iron homeostasis regulatory circuit with reciprocal roles in Candida albicans commensalism and pathogenesis.Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10: 118-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). When iron is surfeit, Sfu1, a GATA-type transcriptional regulator binds to the promoters of several iron uptake genes including FRP1 and that of the SEF1 regulator to down regulate their expression (10Lan C.Y. Rodarte G. Murillo L.A. Jones T. Davis R.W. Dungan J. Newport G. Agabian N. Regulatory networks affected by iron availability in Candida albicans.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1451-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Transcriptional control is intimately linked to the chromatin state (21Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. The role of chromatin during transcription.Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Acetylation of nucleosomal histone H3 at Lys9/14 is a transcriptionally active chromatin mark catalyzed by the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex (22Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Histone acetyltransferase complexes: One size doesn't fit all.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). SAGA is a large multifunctional protein complex that functions as a coactivator of transcription and is evolutionarily conserved from budding yeast to humans (23Spedale G. Timmers H.T. Pijnappel W.W.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6047-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Several key aspects of the transcriptional regulation by the HAP genes and the SEF1 gene are poorly understood. First, it is unclear how the HAP complex and the SEF1 genes coordinate transcriptional activation of iron homeostasis gene expression. Second, the mechanism of how the HAP trimeric complex and the Hap43 mediate transcriptional repression of iron utilizing genes. In this study, we have identified the hierarchy of regulation of target genes by Sef1, HAP complex, and the Hap43 to orchestrate a combinatorial regulatory network resulting in modulation of SAGA-mediated histone acetylation and RNA polymerase (Pol) II recruitment, thereby providing tight transcriptional control of iron homeostasis. To investigate the steady-state protein levels of each of the HAP complex and Sef1 transcriptional regulators, we TAP-tagged the respective genes at their endogenous loci and carried out quantitative western blot analysis of cell extracts prepared from cells grown in two different media—either SC-LIM or the YPD media containing BPS (−Fe) or BPS plus FAS (+Fe). Quantification of the western blot data showed that although Hap2, Hap3, Hap5, and Sef1 are all expressed under both −Fe and +Fe conditions, only Hap3 and Sef1 proteins were upregulated (∼3.5-fold) in the BPS-containing YPD (Fig. 2, A and B) and SC-LIM media (Fig. S1, A and B). The elevated Sef1 and Hap3 protein levels in −Fe medium (Fig. 2, A and B) correlated well with the upregulation of the cognate mRNAs (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M.

Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although HAP2 mRNA was slightly induced (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M.

Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), our western blot data did not reveal an increase in steady-state level of the Hap2 protein in −Fe compared with +Fe conditions. To determine if HAP43 expression is controlled at the level of transcription, we constructed a HAP43-lacZ promoter fusion and analyzed expression in WT, hap43Δ, and sef1Δ mutants. The reporter fusion was activated by approximately 6-fold in WT strain in −Fe medium (Fig. S2A), and this activation was not impaired in the hap43Δ mutant indicating that HAP43 expression is not controlled by Hap43. In the sef1Δ mutant, however, the activation of HAP43-lacZ reporter was only partially reduced (approximately 2-fold) compared with the WT level (Fig. S2A). Therefore, we quantified HAP43 mRNA level in −Fe versus +Fe condition and found that the mRNA is induced ∼6-fold in WT, but the induction was lost in the sef1Δ mutant cells (Fig. S2B). Western blot analysis showed that although Hap43 protein level was also substantially reduced (Fig. S2, C and D), the Hap43 protein was still detectable in sef1Δ/Δ mutant cell extracts, indicating Sef1-independent partial expression of HAP43 in iron-starved cells. To examine the requirement of the HAP subunits for HAP complex formation, we conducted CoIP assays using epitope-tagged Hap5, Hap2, and Hap3 in WT, hap3Δ/Δ, or hap2Δ/Δ strain backgrounds. In each case, we used TAP-tagged subunits to CoIP and probe the western blots with anti-FLAG antibody to identify protein–protein interactions. The data showed that Hap5 strongly pulled down Hap3 from WT cell extracts grown in −Fe medium, but not from +Fe cell extracts (lanes 8 and 16; Fig. 2C), likely due to the diminished expression of the Hap3 protein in +Fe compared with −Fe (Fig. 2B). The Hap2 protein was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated by Hap5 from cell extracts grown in +Fe or −Fe media (lanes 8 and 16; Fig. 2D). Moreover, the Hap2-Hap5 interaction was greatly impaired by the hap3Δ mutation in −Fe but not in +Fe condition (lanes 8 and 16; Fig. 2E). The CoIP data also showed that Hap5 interacts with Hap3 in both −Fe and +Fe cell extracts that is largely unaffected by hap2Δ/Δ mutation (Fig. 2F). Together these CoIP data indicated that the induced expression of Hap3 under −Fe condition is essential for Hap5-Hap2 interaction and assembly of Hap3 to form the HAP trimeric complex under iron starved condition. In +Fe condition, however, Hap5 interacted with Hap2 despite the diminished Hap3 protein level, thus indicating Hap3-independent interaction of Hap5 and Hap2. To address how the functions of these transcriptional regulators impinge on iron-responsive promoters, we carried out ChIP assays to confirm the in vivo occupancy of each subunit of the HAP complex and the Sef1 regulators. Our previous studies showed that under iron deprivation conditions Hap5 was recruited to FRP1 promoter (−84 to −281 with respect to ATG) and ACO1 promoter (−201 to −340) bearing the CCAAT motif (14Singh R.P. Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose these promoters to analyze the occupancy of Hap5, Hap2, Hap3, Hap43, and Sef1 under iron deplete and iron-replete conditions using TAP-tagged C. albicans strains. Because HAP43 lost its activity upon epitope tagging (14Singh R.P. Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we used affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Hap43 antibody described previously (14Singh R.P. Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for the ChIP assay. Our ChIP data showed that the occupancy of each of the three components of the HAP trimeric complex, Hap5, Hap2, and Hap3 is enhanced at the FRP1 promoter (Fig. 3A) and at the ACO1 promoter (Fig. 3B) in −Fe condition compared with +Fe condition. We also extended the analyses to other low-iron-induced promoters (FTR1, SIT1) as well as to another low-iron-repressed promoter (CYC1) using the same ChIP samples. As expected, occupancy of Hap5 was elevated at all three promoters under −Fe compared with +Fe condition (Fig. 3C). While Hap43 occupancy was undetectable at the FRP1 promoter (Fig. 3A), its occupancy was substantially high at the ACO1 promoter (Fig. 3B) and the CYC1 promoter under Fe-deplete condition (Fig. 3C). The ChIP analysis also showed Sef1 occupancy at FRP1, FTR1, SIT1, and ACO1 promoters but not to the CYC1 promoter (Fig. 3C). Given that Sef1 is a transcriptional activator, it was surprising to detect Sef1 occupancy at the ACO1 promoter under −Fe condition. Indeed, previous ChIP-chip data also seemed to identify Sef1 binding to the promoters of ACO1, ISA1, HEM3, and SEF2 genes whose expression is repressed under iron-deficient condition (11Chen C. Pande K. French S.D. Tuch B.B. Noble S.M. An iron homeostasis regulatory circuit with reciprocal roles in Candida albicans commensalism and pathogenesis.Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10: 118-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), although the significance of this data was not clear. Together these ChIP data confirmed that the HAP trimeric complex is recruited to low-iron-induced iron uptake gene promoters as well as to the low-iron-repressed iron utilizing gene promoter under iron deprivation conditions. Hap43, however, showed a robust recruitment only to the low-iron-repressed promoters. Furthermore, Sef1 occupancy to low-iron-induced promoters (FRP1, FTR1, and SIT1) was elevated and, surprisingly, to the low-iron-repressed ACO1 promoter but not to the CYC1 promoter. Thus, iron deprivation elicited the induction of HAP trimeric complex occupancy at both iron uptake and iron utilizing gene promoters. Furthermore, iron deprivation also elicited the induction of Sef1 and Hap43 occupancy at the iron uptake and the iron utilizing gene promoters, respectively. Next, we asked if the HAP trimeric complex, Sef1, and Hap43 transcriptional regulators are mutually dependent for the recruitment of each regulator to promoters in vivo. We constructed Hap5-TAP expressing strains in WT or in hap2Δ/Δ, hap43Δ/Δ, or sef1Δ/Δ mutant backgrounds, and Sef1-TAP strain in the background of hap3Δ/Δ mutation, and carried out ChIP assays with either IgG-Sepharose beads or affinity purified anti-Hap43 antibody. The ChIP data revealed that the recruitment of Hap5 to both FRP1 (Fig. 4A) and ACO1 promoters (Fig. 4B) in −Fe medium was abolished in the hap2Δ/Δ mutant indicating that Hap2 is required for Hap5 promoter occupancy. Our previous study showed that Hap5 recruitment is also dependent on Hap3 (14Singh R.P. Prasad H.K. Sinha I. Agarwal N. Natarajan K. Cap2-HAP complex is a critical transcriptional regulator that has dual but contrasting roles in regulation of iron homeostasis in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25154-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), thereby showing that Hap5, Hap2, and Hap3 function together in promoter binding of the HAP trimeric complex. Next, to address the requirement of Sef1 for recruitment of the HAP complex, we conducted ChIP assays in sef1Δ/Δ strain expressing HAP5-TAP. The ChIP-qPCR results demonstrated that the Hap5 recruitment to both FRP1 and ACO1 promoters was lost in the sef1Δ/Δ mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, deletion of hap43Δ/Δ also abolished Hap5 recruitment at ACO1 and FRP1 promoters in Fe-deplete condition (Fig. 4, A and B). Together these data demonstrated that the HAP complex recruitment is highly dependent on bot"

Thus, it is necessary to examine the typical regional effects of how aerosols affect solar radiation in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding. In this study, we used global AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data and robust radiation observational evidence to investigate the impact of aerosols on total radiation, diffuse radiation, and the diffuse radiation fraction in China from 1961 to 2016. Our results showed that there were different temporal changes in the aerosol optical depth (AOD), total solar radiation, diffuse radiation and diffuse radiation fraction over the past 56 years. Specifically, the 550 nm AOD from 2005 to 2016 decreased significantly, with annual average AOD of 0.51. Meanwhile, the average total solar radiation reduced by 2.48%, while there was a slight increase in average diffuse radiation at a rate of 3.10 MJ·m -2 ·yr -1 . Moreover, the spatial heterogeneities of AOD, total radiation, diffuse radiation, and the diffuse radiation fraction in China were significant. Aerosol particle emissions in the developed eastern and southern regions of China were more severe than those in the western regions, resulting in higher total radiation and diffuse radiation in the western plateau than in the eastern plain. In addition, aerosols were found to have negative effects on total radiation and sunshine hours, and positive effects on diffuse radiation and diffuse radiation fraction. Further, the diffuse radiation fraction was negatively correlated with sunshine hours. However, there was a positive correlation between AOD and sunshine hours. These results could be used to assess the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystem productivity and carbon budgets."
https://openalex.org/W3157196511,"Within the field of bioproduction, non-model organisms offer promise as bio-platform candidates. Non-model organisms can possess natural abilities to consume complex feedstocks, produce industrially useful chemicals, and withstand extreme environments that can be ideal for product extraction. However, non-model organisms also come with unique challenges due to lack of characterization. As a consequence, developing synthetic biology tools, predicting growth behavior, and building computational models can be difficult. There have been many advancements that have improved work with non-model organisms to address broad limitations, however each organism can come with unique surprises. Here we share our work in the non-model bacterium Actinobacillus succinognes 130Z, which includes both advancements in synthetic biology toolkit development and pitfalls in unpredictable fermentation behaviors. To develop a synthetic biology “tool kit” for A . succinogenes , information gleaned from a growth study and antibiotic screening was used to characterize 22 promoters which demonstrated a 260-fold range of fluorescence protein expression. The strongest of the promoters was incorporated into an inducible system for tunable gene control in A . succinogenes using the promoter for the lac operon as a template. This system flaunted a 481-fold range of expression and no significant basal expression. These findings were accompanied by unexpected changes in fermentation products characterized by a loss of succinic acid and increase in lactic acid after approximately 10 months in the lab. During evaluation of the fermentation shifts, new tests of the synthetic biology tools in a succinic acid producing strain revealed a significant loss in their functionality. Contamination and mutation were ruled out as causes and further testing is needed to elucidate the driving factors. The significance of this work is to share a successful tool development strategy that could be employed in other non-model species, report on an unfortunate phenomenon that needs addressed for further development of A . succinogenes , and provide a cautionary tale for those undertaking non-model research. In sharing our findings, we seek to provide tools and necessary information for further development of A . succinogenes as a platform for bioproduction of succinic acid and to illustrate the importance of diligent and long-term observation when working with non-model bacteria."

Following the baseline tests, subjects performed a first set of leg extension tests after the IPC (3 X 5 min 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure) on right thigh and the SHAM (same as IPC, but 20 mmHg) on left thigh. After 48 hours, the subjects performed another set of tests with the opposite applications. Number of repetitions, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and perceptual indicators were analyzed. After IPC and SHAM intervention performed at the same time, similar results were observed for the number of repetitions, with no significant differences between conditions (baseline x IPC x SHAM) for either left (p = 0.274) or right thigh (p = 0.242). The fatigue index and volume load did not show significant effect size after IPC and SHAM maneuvers. In contrast, significant reduction on left tight MVIC was observed (p = 0.001) in SHAM and IPC compared to baseline, but not for right thigh (p = 0.106). Results from the current study may indicate that applying IPC prior to a set of leg extension does not result in ergogenic effects. The placebo effect seems to be related to this technique and its dissociation seems unlikely, therefore including a SHAM or placebo group in IPC studies is strongly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3158808014,"Introduction Limited use of medication in poultry feed led to the investigation of exogenous enzymes as antibiotic alternatives for controlling enteric disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of diet β-glucanase (BGase) and medication on β-glucan depolymerization, digestive tract characteristics, and growth performance of broilers. Materials and methods Broilers were fed hulless barley (HB) based diets with BGase (Econase GT 200P from AB Vista; 0 and 0.1%) and medication (Bacitracin and Salinomycin Na; with and without) arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial. In Experiment 1, 160 broilers were housed in cages from d 0 to 28. Each treatment was assigned to 10 cages. In Experiment 2, broilers (2376) were housed in floor pens and vaccinated for coccidiosis on d 5. Each treatment was assigned to one floor pen in each of nine rooms. Results In Experiment 1, the soluble β-glucan weighted average molecular weight (Mw) in the ileal digesta was lower with medication in the 0% BGase treatments. Peak molecular weight (Mp) and Mw were lower with BGase regardless of medication. The maximum molecular weight for the smallest 10% β-glucan (MW-10%) was lower with BGase addition. In Experiment 2, Mp was lower with medication in 0% BGase treatments. Beta-glucanase resulted in lower Mp regardless of medication, and the degree of response was lower with medication. The MW-10% was lower with BGase despite antibiotic addition. Body weight gain and feed efficiency were higher with medication regardless of BGase use through-out the trial (except d 11–22 feed efficiency). Beta-glucanase resulted in higher body weight gain after d 11 and worsened and improved feed efficiency before and after d 11, respectively, in unmedicated treatments. Conclusion BGase and medication caused the depolymerization of soluble ileal β-glucan. Beta-glucanase acted as a partial replacement for diet medication by increasing growth performance in coccidiosis vaccinated broilers."
https://openalex.org/W3159170836,"The hypersensitive prostate specific antigen (PSA) test can measure in 0.01 ng/mL units, and its efficacy for screening after radical prostatectomy (RP) has been reported. In this study, we assessed patients who underwent RP to evaluate whether the nadir value affects biochemical recurrence (BCR). From 1995 to 2014, patients classified as N0 who had negative resection margins and a nadir PSA of less than 0.2 ng/mL were evaluated. The characteristics, pathological outcomes, PSA after RP, and BCR were assessed. A total of 1483 patients were enrolled. Among them, 323 (21.78%) patients showed BCR after RP. The mean age of the BCR group was 63.86±7.31 years, and while that of the no-recurrence group was 64.06±6.82 years (P = 0.645). The mean preoperative PSA of the BCR group was 9.75±6.92 ng/mL and that of the no-recurrence group was 6.71±5.19 ng/mL (P < 0.001). The mean time to nadir (TTN) in the BCR group was 4.64±7.65 months, while that in the no-recurrence group was 7.43±12.46 months (P < 0.001). The mean PSA nadir value was 0.035±0.034 ng/mL in the BCR group and 0.014±0.009 ng/mL in the no-recurrence group (P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analyses, Gleason score, positive biopsy core percentages, minimal invasive surgery, nadir PSA value, and TTN were independently associated with BCR. The mean BCR occurred at 48.23±2.01 months after RP, and there was a significant difference in BCR occurrence according to the nadir PSA value (P < 0.001). A high PSA nadir value and short TTN may predict the risk of BCR after successful RP, aiding the identification of candidates for adjuvant or salvage therapies after RP."
https://openalex.org/W3159438145,"We present further study of a subset of carbapenems, arising from a previously reported machine learning approach, with regard to their mouse pharmacokinetic profiling and subsequent study in a mouse model of sub-acute Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Pharmacokinetic metrics for such small molecules were compared to those for meropenem and biapenem, resulting in the selection of two carbapenems to be assessed for their ability to reduce M . tuberculosis bacterial loads in the lungs of infected mice. The original syntheses of these two carbapenems were optimized to provide multigram quantities of each compound. One of the two experimental carbapenems, JSF-2204, exhibited efficacy equivalent to that of meropenem, while both were inferior to rifampin. The lessons learned in this study point toward the need to further enhance the pharmacokinetic profiles of experimental carbapenems to positively impact in vivo efficacy performance."
https://openalex.org/W3159663028,"Introduction Cognitive difficulties and neuropsychological alterations in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD) boys are not yet sufficiently explored, although this topic could have a relevant impact, finding novel biomarkers of disease both at genetics and neuroimaging point of view. The current study aims to: 1) analyze the neuropsychological profile of a group of DMD and BMD boys without cognitive impairment with an assessment of their executive functions; 2) explore the structural connectivity in DMD, BMD, and age-matched controls focusing on cortico-subcortical tracts that connect frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum via the thalamus; 3) explore possible correlations between altered structural connectivity and clinical neuropsychological measures. Materials and methods This pilot study included 15 boys (5 DMD subjects, 5 BMD subjects, and 5 age-matched typically developing, TD). They were assessed using a neuropsychological assessment protocol including cognitive and executive functioning assessment and performed a 1.5T MRI brain exam including advance Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) method for tractography. Structural connectivity measurements were extracted along three specific tracts: Cortico-Ponto-Cerebellar Tract (CPCT), Cerebellar-Thalamic Tract (CTT), and Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF). Cortical-Spinal Tract (CST) was selected for reference, as control tract. Results Regarding intellectual functioning, a major impairment in executive functions compared to the general intellectual functioning was observed both for DMD (mean score = 86.20; SD = 11.54) and for BMD children (mean score = 88; SD = 3.67). Mean FA resulted tendentially always lower in DMD compared to both BMD and TD groups for all the examined tracts. The differences in FA were statistically significant for the right CTT (DMD vs BMD, p = 0.002, and DMD vs TD, p = 0.0015) and the right CPCT (DMD vs TD, p = 0.008). Concerning DMD, significant correlations emerged between FA-R-CTT and intellectual quotients (FIQ, p = 0.044; ρs = 0.821), and executive functions (Denomination Total, p = 0.044, ρs = 0.821; Inhibition Total, p = 0.019, ρs = 0.900). BMD showed a significant correlation between FA-R-CPCT and working memory index (p = 0.007; ρs = 0.949). Discussion and conclusion In this pilot study, despite the limitation of sample size, the findings support the hypothesis of the involvement of a cerebellar-thalamo-cortical loop for the neuropsychological profile of DMD, as the CTT and the CPCT are involved in the network and the related brain structures are known to be implied in executive functions. Our results suggest that altered WM connectivity and reduced fibre organization in cerebellar tracts, probably due to the lack of dystrophin in the brain, may render less efficient some neuropsychological functions in children affected by dystrophinopathies. The wider multicentric study could help to better establish the role of cerebellar connectivity in neuropsychological profile for dystrophinopathies, identifying possible novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers."

Anthropometrics, physiological, and reaction time (mean of reaction time -MRT-, and errors made -E) parameters of 12 Female and 13 Male firefighters were compared. Effect of overload (step test with and without equipment) on the MRT and E were analyzed on 3 trials (T1 = 1-1s, T2 = 0.5-1s, T3 = 0.5–0.5s), compared with a pre-test condition (basal). T-test between males and females was applied to assess differences (p&lt;0.05) in all parameters. ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferroni on 3 conditions of step test between males and females was applied in reaction time variables. Between MRT and E, in T1, T2 and T3 trials and the 3 test conditions, ANCOVA models with interactions were used. Differences (p&lt;0.05) in anthropometric, physiological and reaction time data emerged across groups, and on the 3rd trials (T3 vs T1 and T2) in reaction time parameters of each group. ANCOVA showed differences (p&lt;0.001) in E among trials. Post hoc showed significant differences in T1vsT3 and T1vsT2. MRT x trial interaction was extremely significant (P&lt;0.001). Implementing fitness and reaction time exercise programs is important to decrease the injury risk and increase work capacity in firefighters with reference to female workers."
https://openalex.org/W3158024606,"The emergency medical service as a high-risk workplace is a danger to patient safety. A main factor for patient safety, but also at the same time a main factor for patient harm, is team communication. Team communication is multidimensional and occurs before, during, and after the patient's treatment.In an online based, anonymous and single-blinded study, medical and non-medical employees in the emergency medical services were asked about team communication, and communication errors.Seven hundred and fourteen medical and non-medical rescue workers from all over Germany took part. Among them, 72.0% had harmed at least one patient during their work. With imprecise communication, 81.7% rarely asked for clarification. Also, 66.3% saw leadership behavior as the cause of poor communication; 46.0% could not talk to their superiors about errors. Of note, 96.3% would like joint training of medical and non-medical employees in communication.Deficits in team communication occur frequently in the rescue service. There is a clear need for uniform training in team and communication skills in all professions."
https://openalex.org/W3159549432,"Binge-drinking in adolescents and young adults is a widespread problem, however, an often unreported consequence of binge-drinking behaviour is an alcohol-induced memory blackout (MBO). An MBO is a transient amnesic event resulting from rapid, excessive alcohol consumption. Here, we examine the short-term impact of an alcohol-induced MBO event (testing < 20 hours after blackout) on memory performance in people who have experienced a high volume of MBOs. In addition, we aimed to test the hypothesis that people who experience a high volume of MBOs may have poorer recall than non-blackout controls in either sober or intoxicated states. Three episodic memory paradigms consisting of free recall, serial recall, and depth of encoding tasks, were conducted by a group of alcohol drinkers who had never experienced a memory blackout, and those who reported at least 9 in the preceding 12-months. Studies were completed sober and after alcohol by all participants, and sober but after blackout by the experimental group. Accuracy of recall was assessed with linear mixed effects modelling for all experiments and conditions. Recall rate both before and after alcohol consumption was similar between groups, with poorer recall after drinking alcohol by all participants in all three studies. After blackout, MBO participants showed no significant improvement from their intoxicated state in serial recall and depth of encoding tasks, but an improvement in free recall. Further analysis of these findings revealed that 10 out of 23 participants showed significantly impaired performance after blackout during free recall, extending up to 17 participants in serial recall. In general, alcohol reduced recall rate in both blackout and control participants similarly, but recall following MBO remained poor. Our evidence suggests that alcohol-induced blackouts impair memory functioning the next day, and future research should establish the duration of deficits after an acute alcohol-induced blackout episode."
https://openalex.org/W3159505182,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the deleterious lesions that are both endogenous and exogenous in origin and are repaired by nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for maintaining genome stability remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the role of two E3 ligases, Dma1 and Dma2 (homologs of human RNF8), in the maintenance of genome stability in budding yeast. Using yeast spotting assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and plasmid and chromosomal repair assays, we establish that Dma1 and Dma2 act in a redundant and a catalysis-dependent manner in the maintenance of genome stability, as well as localize to transcribed regions of the genome and increase in abundance upon phleomycin treatment. In addition, Dma1 and Dma2 are required for the normal kinetics of histone H4 acetylation under DNA damage conditions, genetically interact with RAD9 and SAE2, and are in a complex with Rad53 and histones. Taken together, our results demonstrate the requirement of Dma1 and Dma2 in regulating DNA repair pathway choice, preferentially affecting homologous recombination over nonhomologous end joining, and open up the possibility of using these candidates in manipulating the repair pathways toward precision genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3159567641,"Previous research has shown that behavioural mimicry fosters affiliation, and can be used to infer whether people belong to the same social unit. However, we still know very little about the generalizability of these findings and the individual factors involved. The present study intends to disentangle two important variables and assess their importance for affiliation: the matching in time of the behaviours versus their matching in form. In order to address this issue, we presented participants with short videos in which two actors displayed a set of small movements (e.g. crossing their legs, folding their arms, tapping their fingers) arranged to be either contingent in time or in form. A dark filter was used to eliminate ostensive group marks, such us phenotype or clothing. Participants attributed the highest degree of affiliation to the actors when their subsequent movements matched in form, but were delayed by 4–5 seconds, and the lowest degree when the timing of their movements matched, but they differed in form. To assess the generalizability of our findings, we took our study outside the usual Western context and tested a matching sample of participants from a traditional small-scale society in Kenya. In all, our results suggest that movements are used to judge the degree of affiliation between two individuals in both large- and small-scale societies. While moving in different ways at the same time seems to increase the perceived distance between two individuals, movements which match in form seem to invoke closeness."
https://openalex.org/W3159661546,"Peripheral sensory cells and the central neuronal circuits that monitor environmental changes to drive behaviors should be adapted to match the behaviorally relevant kinetics of incoming stimuli, be it the detection of sound frequencies, the speed of moving objects or local temperature changes. Detection of odorants begins with the activation of olfactory receptor neurons in the nasal cavity following inhalation of air and airborne odorants carried therein. Thus, olfactory receptor neurons are stimulated in a rhythmic and repeated fashion that is determined by the breathing or sniffing frequency that can be controlled and altered by the animal. This raises the question of how the response kinetics of olfactory receptor neurons are matched to the imposed stimulation frequency and if, vice versa, the kinetics of olfactory receptor neuron responses determine the sniffing frequency. We addressed this question by using a mouse model that lacks the K + -dependent Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger 4 (NCKX4), which results in markedly slowed response termination of olfactory receptor neuron responses and hence changes the temporal response kinetics of these neurons. We monitored sniffing behaviors of freely moving wildtype and NCKX4 knockout mice while they performed olfactory Go/NoGo discrimination tasks. Knockout mice performed with similar or, surprisingly, better accuracy compared to wildtype mice, but chose, depending on the task, different odorant sampling durations depending on the behavioral demands of the odorant identification task. Similarly, depending on the demands of the behavioral task, knockout mice displayed a lower basal breathing frequency prior to odorant sampling, a possible mechanism to increase the dynamic range for changes in sniffing frequency during odorant sampling. Overall, changes in sniffing behavior between wildtype and NCKX4 knockout mice were subtle, suggesting that, at least for the particular odorant-driven task we used, slowed response termination of the odorant-induced receptor neuron response either has a limited detrimental effect on odorant-driven behavior or mice are able to compensate via an as yet unknown mechanism."
