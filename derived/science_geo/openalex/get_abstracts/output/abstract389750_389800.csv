This protein is the target of compounds obtained from screening for those that can alleviate cell death promoted by the mutant huntingtin, and represents a new connection between protein misfolding and cell death. A hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is accumulation of misfolded proteins within neurons, leading to cellular dysfunction and cell death. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to link protein misfolding to cellular toxicity, the connection remains enigmatic. Here, we report a cell death pathway involving protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a protein chaperone that catalyzes isomerization, reduction and oxidation of disulfides. Through a small molecule screening approach, we discovered five structurally distinct compounds that prevent apoptosis induced by mutant huntingtin protein. Using modified Huisgen cycloaddition chemistry, we then identified PDI as the molecular target of these small molecules. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin exon 1 in PC12 cells caused PDI to accumulate at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes and trigger apoptotic cell death via mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Inhibiting PDI in rat brain cells suppressed the toxicity of mutant huntingtin exon 1 and Aβ peptides processed from the amyloid precursor protein. This pro-apoptotic function of PDI represents a new mechanism linking protein misfolding and apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2064300848,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming a fast and cost-effective method to pinpoint molecular lesions in mutagenized genetic model systems, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. As mutagenized strains contain a significant mutational load, it is often still necessary to map mutations to a chromosomal interval to elucidate which of the WGS-identified sequence variants is the phenotype-causing one. We describe here our experience in setting up and testing a simple strategy that incorporates a rapid SNP-based mapping step into the WGS procedure. In this strategy, a mutant retrieved from a genetic screen is crossed with a polymorphic C. elegans strain, individual F2 progeny from this cross is selected for the mutant phenotype, the progeny of these F2 animals are pooled and then whole-genome-sequenced. The density of polymorphic SNP markers is decreased in the region of the phenotype-causing sequence variant and therefore enables its identification in the WGS data. As a proof of principle, we use this strategy to identify the molecular lesion in a mutant strain that produces an excess of dopaminergic neurons. We find that the molecular lesion resides in the Pax-6/Eyeless ortholog vab-3. The strategy described here will further reduce the time between mutant isolation and identification of the molecular lesion."

Carriership for Gaucher disease has recently been identified as major risk for parkinsonism. Presently, no method exists to visualize active GBA molecules in situ. We here report the design, synthesis and application of two fluorescent activity-based probes allowing highly specific labeling of active GBA molecules in vitro and in cultured cells and mice in vivo. Detection of in vitro labeled recombinant GBA on slab gels after electrophoresis is in the low attomolar range. Using cell or tissue lysates, we obtained exclusive labeling of GBA molecules. We present evidence from fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence microscopy and pulse-chase experiments of highly efficient labeling of GBA molecules in intact cells as well as tissues of mice. In addition, we illustrate the use of the fluorescent probes to study inhibitors and tentative chaperones in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W1979975605,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is the master switch for heat shock protein (HSP) expression in eukaryotes. A synthetic chemical library was screened to identify inhibitors of HSF1 using a luciferase reporter under the control of a heat shock element. A compound named KRIBB11 (N(2)-(1H-indazole-5-yl)-N(6)-methyl-3-nitropyridine-2,6-diamine) was identified for its activity in abolishing the heat shock-induced luciferase activity with an IC(50) of 1.2 μmol/liter. When the cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of KRIBB11, the induction of HSF1 downstream target proteins such as HSP27 and HSP70 was blocked. In addition, treatment of HCT-116 cells with KRIBB11 induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Markers of apoptosis, such as cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, were detected after KRIBB11 treatment. Biotinyl-KRIBB11 was synthesized as an affinity probe for the identification of KRIBB11 target proteins. Using affinity chromatography and competition assays, KRIBB11 was shown to associate with HSF1 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KRIBB11 inhibited HSF1-dependent recruitment of p-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) to the hsp70 promoter. Finally, intraperitoneal treatment of nude mice with KRIBB11 at 50 mg/kg resulted in a 47.4% (p < 0.05) inhibition of tumor growth without body weight loss. Immunoblotting assays showed that the expression of HSP70 was lower in KRIBB11-treated tumor tissue than in control tissues. Because HSPs are expressed at high levels in a wide range of tumors, these results strengthen the rationale for targeting HSF1 in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2029785503,"A hallmark of cells comprising the mammalian adaptive immune system is the requirement for these rare naïve T (and B) lymphocytes directed to a specific microorganism to undergo proliferative expansion upon first encounter with this antigen. In the case of naïve CD8+ T cells the ability of these rare quiescent lymphocytes to rapidly activate and expand into effector T cells in numbers sufficient to control viral and certain bacterial infections can be essential for survival. In this report we examined the activation, cell cycle time and initial proliferative response of naïve murine CD8+ T cells responding in vivo to Influenza and Vaccinia virus infection or vaccination with viral antigens. Remarkably, we observed that CD8+ T cells could divide and proliferate with an initial cell division time of as short as 2 hours. The initial cell cycle time of responding CD8+ T cells is not fixed but is controlled by the antigenic stimulus provided by the APC in vivo. Initial cell cycle time influences the rate of T cell expansion and the numbers of effector T cells subsequently accumulating at the site of infection. The T cell cycle time varies with duration of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The duration of G1 is inversely correlated with the phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in the responding T cells. The implication of these findings for the development of adaptive immune responses and the regulation of cell cycle in higher eukaryotic cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1984331976,"During cell division, interaction between kinetochores and dynamic spindle microtubules governs chromosome movements. The microtubule depolymerase mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) is a key regulator of mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying its depolymerase activity during the cell cycle remain elusive. Here, we showed that PLK1 is a novel regulator of MCAK in mammalian cells. MCAK interacts with PLK1 in vitro and in vivo. The neck and motor domain of MCAK associates with the kinase domain of PLK1. MCAK is a novel substrate of PLK1, and the phosphorylation stimulates its microtubule depolymerization activity of MCAK in vivo. Overexpression of a polo-like kinase 1 phosphomimetic mutant MCAK causes a dramatic increase in misaligned chromosomes and in multipolar spindles in mitotic cells, whereas overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable MCAK mutant results in aberrant anaphase with sister chromatid bridges, suggesting that precise regulation of the MCAK activity by PLK1 phosphorylation is critical for proper microtubule dynamics and essential for the faithful chromosome segregation. We reasoned that dynamic regulation of MCAK phosphorylation by PLK1 is required to orchestrate faithful cell division, whereas the high levels of PLK1 and MCAK activities seen in cancer cells may account for a mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2067902268,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially fatal blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against the desmosomal adhesion protein desmoglein (Dsg) 3. Whether autoantibody steric hindrance or signaling through pathways such as p38 MAPK is primary in disease pathogenesis is controversial. PV mAbs that cause endocytosis of Dsg3 but do not dissociate keratinocytes because of compensatory adhesion by Dsg1 do not activate p38. The same mAbs plus exfoliative toxin to inactivate Dsg1 but not exfoliative toxin alone activate p38, suggesting that p38 activation is secondary to loss of adhesion. Mice with epidermal p38α deficiency blister after passive transfer of PV mAbs; however, acantholytic cells retain cell surface Dsg3 compared with wild-type mice. In cultured keratinocytes, p38 knockdown prevents loss of desmosomal Dsg3 by PV mAbs, and exogenous p38 activation causes internalization of Dsg3, desmocollin 3, and desmoplakin. p38α MAPK is therefore not required for the loss of intercellular adhesion in PV, but may function downstream to augment blistering via Dsg3 endocytosis. Treatments aimed at increasing keratinocyte adhesion could be used in conjunction with immunosuppressive agents, potentially leading to safer and more effective combination therapy regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2032597068,"The six most important cost-effective policies on tobacco control can be measured by the Tobacco Control Scale (TCS). The objective of our study was to describe the correlation between the TCS and smoking prevalence, self-reported exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) and attitudes towards smoking restrictions in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU27).Ecologic study in the EU27. We used data from the TCS in 2007 and from the Eurobarometer on Tobacco Survey in 2008. We analysed the relations between the TCS and prevalence of smoking, self-reported exposure to SHS (home and work), and attitudes towards smoking bans by means of scatter plots and Spearman rank-correlation coefficients (r(sp)). Among the EU27, smoking prevalence varied from 22.6% in Slovenia to 42.1% in Greece. Austria was the country with the lowest TCS score (35) and the UK had the highest one (93). The correlation between smoking prevalence and TCS score was negative (r(sp) = -0.42, p = 0.03) and the correlation between TCS score and support to smoking bans in all workplaces was positive (r(sp) = 0.47, p = 0.01 in restaurants; r(sp) = 0.5, p = 0.008 in bars, pubs, and clubs; and r(sp) = 0.31, p = 0.12 in other indoor workplaces). The correlation between TCS score and self-reported exposure to SHS was negative, but statistically non-significant.Countries with a higher score in the TCS have higher support towards smoking bans in all workplaces (including restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs, and other indoor workplaces). TCS scores were strongly, but not statistically, associated with a lower prevalence of smokers and a lower self-reported exposure to SHS."
https://openalex.org/W2006697402,"Select proteins involved in electrical and chemical neurotransmission are re-coded at the RNA level via the deamination of particular adenosines to inosine by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). It has been hypothesized that this process, termed RNA editing, acts to “fine-tune” neurophysiological properties in animals and potentially downstream behavioral outputs. However, the extreme phenotypes resulting from deletions of adar loci have precluded investigations into the relationship between ADAR levels, target transcripts, and complex behaviors. Here, we engineer Drosophila hypomorphic for ADAR expression using homologous recombination. A substantial reduction in ADAR activity (>80%) leads to altered circadian motor patterns and abnormal male courtship, although surprisingly, general locomotor coordination is spared. The altered phenotypic landscape in our adar hypomorph is paralleled by an unexpected dichotomous response of ADAR target transcripts, i.e. certain adenosines are minimally affected by dramatic ADAR reduction, whereas editing of others is severely curtailed. Furthermore, we use a novel reporter to map RNA editing activity across the nervous system, and we demonstrate that knockdown of editing in fruitless-expressing neurons is sufficient to modify the male courtship song. Our data demonstrate that network-wide temporal and spatial regulation of ADAR activity can tune the complex system of RNA-editing sites and modulate multiple ethologically relevant behavioral modalities.

https://openalex.org/W2023654927,"Redox state is a critical determinant of cell function, and any major imbalances can cause severe damage or death.The aim of this study is to determine if AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor, is activated by oxidants generated by Berberine in endothelial cells (EC).Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were exposed to Berberine. AMPK activity and reactive oxygen species were monitored after the incubation.In BAEC, Berberine caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) at Ser79, a well characterized downstream target of AMPK. Concomitantly, Berberine increased peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant formed by simultaneous generation of superoxide and nitric oxide. Pre-incubation of BAEC with anti-oxidants markedly attenuated Berberine-enhanced phosphorylation of both AMPK and ACC. Consistently, adenoviral expression of superoxide dismutase and pretreatment of L-N(G)-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME; a non-selective NOS inhibitor) blunted Berberine-induced phosphorylation of AMPK. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted tempol (mito-tempol) pretreatment or expression of uncoupling protein attenuated AMPK activation caused by Berberine. Depletion of mitochondria abolished the effects of Berberine on AMPK in EC. Finally, Berberine significantly increased the phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser307 and gene silencing of LKB1 attenuated Berberine-enhanced AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in BAEC.Our results suggest that mitochondria-derived superoxide anions and peroxynitrite are required for Berberine-induced AMPK activation in endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1994714835,"Background This study was inspired by coalescing evidence that magnetic therapy may be a viable treatment option for certain diseases. This premise is based on the ability of moderate strength fields (i.e., 0.1 to 1 Tesla) to alter the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers and in turn modulate cellular signaling pathways. In particular, previous results from our laboratory (Wang et al., BMC Genomics, 10, 356 (2009)) established that moderate strength static magnetic field (SMF) exposure altered cellular endpoints associated with neuronal function and differentiation. Building on this background, the current paper investigated SMF by focusing on the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in the PC12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line that displays metabolic features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methodology and Principal Findings SMF reproduced several responses elicited by ZM241385, a selective A2AR antagonist, in PC12 cells including altered calcium flux, increased ATP levels, reduced cAMP levels, reduced nitric oxide production, reduced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, inhibited proliferation, and reduced iron uptake. SMF also counteracted several PD-relevant endpoints exacerbated by A2AR agonist CGS21680 in a manner similar to ZM241385; these include reduction of increased expression of A2AR, reversal of altered calcium efflux, dampening of increased adenosine production, reduction of enhanced proliferation and associated p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Conclusions and Significance When measured against multiple endpoints, SMF elicited qualitatively similar responses as ZM241385, a PD drug candidate. Provided that the in vitro results presented in this paper apply in vivo, SMF holds promise as an intriguing non-invasive approach to treat PD and potentially other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2112067162,"Background High-throughput sequencing of an organism's transcriptome, or RNA-Seq, is a valuable and versatile new strategy for capturing snapshots of gene expression. However, transcriptome sequencing creates a new class of alignment problem: mapping short reads that span exon-exon junctions back to the reference genome, especially in the case where a splice junction is previously unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we introduce HMMSplicer, an accurate and efficient algorithm for discovering canonical and non-canonical splice junctions in short read datasets. HMMSplicer identifies more splice junctions than currently available algorithms when tested on publicly available A. thaliana, P. falciparum, and H. sapiens datasets without a reduction in specificity. Conclusions/Significance HMMSplicer was found to perform especially well in compact genomes and on genes with low expression levels, alternative splice isoforms, or non-canonical splice junctions. Because HHMSplicer does not rely on pre-built gene models, the products of inexact splicing are also detected. For H. sapiens, we find 3.6% of 3′ splice sites and 1.4% of 5′ splice sites are inexact, typically differing by 3 bases in either direction. In addition, HMMSplicer provides a score for every predicted junction allowing the user to set a threshold to tune false positive rates depending on the needs of the experiment. HMMSplicer is implemented in Python. Code and documentation are freely available at http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer."
https://openalex.org/W1993108121,"This study examined echinoderm assemblages from nearshore rocky habitats for large-scale distribution patterns with specific emphasis on identifying latitudinal trends and large regional hotspots. Echinoderms were sampled from 76 globally-distributed sites within 12 ecoregions, following the standardized sampling protocol of the Census of Marine Life NaGISA project (www.nagisa.coml.org). Sample-based species richness was overall low (<1–5 species per site), with a total of 32 asteroid, 18 echinoid, 21 ophiuroid, and 15 holothuroid species. Abundance and species richness in intertidal assemblages sampled with visual methods (organisms >2 cm in 1 m2 quadrats) was highest in the Caribbean ecoregions and echinoids dominated these assemblages with an average of 5 ind m−2. In contrast, intertidal echinoderm assemblages collected from clearings of 0.0625 m2 quadrats had the highest abundance and richness in the Northeast Pacific ecoregions where asteroids and holothurians dominated with an average of 14 ind 0.0625 m−2. Distinct latitudinal trends existed for abundance and richness in intertidal assemblages with declines from peaks at high northern latitudes. No latitudinal trends were found for subtidal echinoderm assemblages with either sampling technique. Latitudinal gradients appear to be superseded by regional diversity hotspots. In these hotspots echinoderm assemblages may be driven by local and regional processes, such as overall productivity and evolutionary history. We also tested a set of 14 environmental variables (six natural and eight anthropogenic) as potential drivers of echinoderm assemblages by ecoregions. The natural variables of salinity, sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll a, and primary productivity were strongly correlated with echinoderm assemblages; the anthropogenic variables of inorganic pollution and nutrient contamination also contributed to correlations. Our results indicate that nearshore echinoderm assemblages appear to be shaped by a network of environmental and ecological processes, and by the differing responses of various echinoderm taxa, making generalizations about the patterns of nearshore rocky habitat echinoderm assemblages difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2151632051,"Complex coherent dynamics is present in a wide variety of neural systems. A typical example is the voltage transitions between up and down states observed in cortical areas in the brain. In this work, we study this phenomenon via a biologically motivated stochastic model of up and down transitions. The model is constituted by a simple bistable rate dynamics, where the synaptic current is modulated by short-term synaptic processes which introduce stochasticity and temporal correlations. A complete analysis of our model, both with mean-field approaches and numerical simulations, shows the appearance of complex transitions between high (up) and low (down) neural activity states, driven by the synaptic noise, with permanence times in the up state distributed according to a power-law. We show that the experimentally observed large fluctuation in up and down permanence times can be explained as the result of sufficiently noisy dynamical synapses with sufficiently large recovery times. Static synapses cannot account for this behavior, nor can dynamical synapses in the absence of noise."

One of the limitations to these studies was that the enzymatic reactions were carried out under conditions where replication complex assembly and initiation were likely to be rate-limiting. Detailed transient kinetic studies of nucleotide addition require stoichiometric binding of RNA primer and template at the active site of the polymerase before the addition of the next incoming nucleotide. However, the assembly of a productive elongation complex containing polymerase-primer- template has been unsuccessful for RdRps from the Flaviviridae family, which in turn prevented detailed kinetic analysis of these medically important polymerases. For example, low active site concentrations of enzyme and the inability of the native enzyme to bind a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) have limited kinetic analysis of HCV polymerase (18Carroll S.S.

These limitations have been attributed to the encircled active site of Flaviviridae polymerases, which appear to only accommodate a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) based on their crystal structures (6Yap T.L.

In this study the assembly of the elongation complex of DENV polymerase was achieved by preincubation of NS5pol from DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and a primer-template RNA (P12/T26) at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+. We found the assembly of the productive elongation complex was stringently affected by temperature, metal ions, and enzyme concentration. Using the preassembled elongation complex, the presteady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and the specificity of NS5pol were measured. The methodology developed in this study will facilitate mechanistic analysis of nucleotide addition catalyzed by DENV RdRp during elongation. Moreover, the methodology established for DENV RdRp may also apply to other Flaviviridae polymerases, thus, facilitating kinetic characterization of polymerases from this medically important virus family. All NTPs were ultrapure grade purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Heparin sodium salt (195.9 USP units/mg) was from Sigma. MgCl2, EDTA, NaCl solutions, and Tris-Cl buffers were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Unless otherwise stated (Table 1), the following RNA oligonucleotides were used in this study: 5′-GGAGAGAAAAGG-3′ (P12, primer) and 5′-ACAGUUUUUUUUGCCCUUUUCUCUCC-3′ (T26, template). The underlined base shows the template base for the next nucleotide incorporation. All RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and HPLC-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The 5′ end labeling reaction of the P12 primer was conducted with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). Radiolabeled primer was purified with G25 spin columns (GE Healthcare). The recovery of the purified RNA oligonucleotides was quantified by PAGE analysis. To make the double-stranded RNA substrate, P12/T26, the primer, and the template were mixed at a ratio of 1: 1.1, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and then cooled down slowly to room temperature. The P12/T26 has 12 stable base pairs with a Tm of 54 °C calculated by the OligoAnalyzer 3.1 web application from the website of Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

(Menlo Park, CA). NS5pol was subcloned to a modified Novagen pET11a vector (EMD, Gibbstown, NJ) containing six histidine and three alanine codons in-frame at the 5′ end of the cloning site. Recombinant NS5pol was produced in BL21 Star (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. After the optical density reached 0.8, flasks with cells were transferred to a 4 °C cold room for 3 h. NS5pol expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at room temperature (25 °C). Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min, and then the pellets were stored in a −80 °C freezer. Cell pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm imidazole) with the addition of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 200 unit/ml Novagen Benzonase nuclease HC (purity >99%, EMD, Gibbstown, NJ), and 0.05 tablet/ml protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysate was sonicated and then clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were loaded on a column and washed with the lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with the lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The elution was diluted 5-fold with the size exclusion column buffer (SEC buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and then concentrated to 1∼2 ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 filtration device with 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with the SEC buffer. The identity of NS5pol was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of intact protein and tryptic-digested products. The active site concentration of NS5pol was determined by a burst kinetic assay (supplemental Fig. 1) and was used for all the experiments in this study. The active site concentration was about 15% of the protein concentration measured by UV280 absorbance with the extinction coefficient of 170850 cm−1m−1. The 100-μl reaction containing NS5pol (0.6 μm), P12/T26 (0.5 μm), and GTP (500 μm) in the reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 23.8 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, and 2 mm MgCl2) was conducted at 37 °C. The buffer pH, NaCl, and glycerol concentrations in the reaction buffer were chosen from optimized conditions (data not shown). The same reaction buffer was used in this report unless otherwise stated. The reaction was started by the addition of NS5pol. At each time point an aliquot (5 μl) from the reaction was mixed with 15 μl of the quench solution (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) to stop the reaction in the aliquot (Fig. 2, B and C). A typical preincubation reaction (100 μl) was started by mixing P12/T26 (0.5 μm) with NS5pol (concentrations are indicated in the figure legends) in the reaction buffer at 30 or 37 °C. At each time point an aliquot (5 μl) from the preincubation reaction was immediately mixed with an equal volume of a solution containing 1 mm GTP and 0.1 mg/ml heparin in the reaction buffer to start the single nucleotide primer extension reaction. The primer extension reaction was quenched after 90 s by mixing with 30 μl of the quench solution. Heparin was added to trap free NS5pol to ensure that the 13-mer product was generated only from the enzyme-RNA elongation complex formed during preincubation. Therefore, assaying the 13-mer product allows quantification of the formation of the elongation complex. NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) in the reaction buffer with MgCl2 at various concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mm) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The primer extension reaction was started by mixing each preincubated sample with an equal volume of a solution containing 1 mm GTP and 0.1 mg/ml heparin in the reaction buffer with MgCl2 at various concentrations (4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mm). The final MgCl2 concentrations in the primer extension reactions were 2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm after mixing. The reactions were quenched after 90 s. The 13-mer product represents the elongation complex formed during 1 h of incubation. These assays were carried out at 37 °C using an RQF-3 chemical-quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). In a typical quench-flow assay, a mixture of NS5pol and P12/T26 in the reaction buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then the mixture was stored at room temperature during the experiment. The primer extension reaction was started by mixing each aliquot from the preincubated mixture with an equal volume of a solution containing GTP in the reaction buffer. Each reaction was quenched at a time interval indicated in the figures. Each RNA substrate used in this assay had a same P12 primer and a T26 template with a different template base for the next incoming nucleotide as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) in the reaction buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then an equal volume was added of a solution containing one correct nucleotide at 0.5 mm or all four nucleotides (each nucleotide is 0.5 mm) and 0.1 mg/ml heparin in the reaction buffer. The reactions were quenched after 90 s. Because the reactions were slow, these assays were carried out at 37 °C by hand mixing. NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) in the reaction buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Primer extension reactions were initiated by mixing the assembled elongation complex with an equal volume of a solution containing NTP at various concentrations and 0.1 mg/ml heparin in the reaction buffer. Heparin was added in the nucleotide solution to prevent the complication of NS5pol and P12/T26 rebinding. Aliquots from the reactions were mixed with the quench solution at various time intervals. The quenched reactions were heat-denatured for 3 min at 95 °C before electrophoresis. The samples were loaded onto a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea, and electrophoresis was performed at 80 watts. Gels were dried at 82 °C for 1 h with a Model-583 gel drier (Bio-Rad). Dry gels were exposed to storage phosphor screens and visualized by using a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the 5′ end-labeled substrates and products was quantitated by the ImageQuant software (Version 5.2, GE Healthcare). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program, GraFit5 (Erithacus Software, Surrey, UK). Each data set presented in each figure was from a representative experiment of multiple experiments with similar protocols. The data from the time courses of product formation were fit to either a single exponential equation, product = A(1 − exp(−kobst)), or a double exponential equation, product = A1(1 − exp(kobs,1t)) + A2(1 − exp(−kobs,2t)), where A, A1, and A2 are the amplitudes of product formation, and kobs, kobs,1, and kobs,2 are the observed rate constants. The nucleotide concentration dependence of the observed rates was fit to a hyperbola, kobs = kpolS/(Kd + S), where kpol is the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation, Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for ground state binding of nucleotide, and S is the concentration of nucleotide. The parameters from data-fitting were presented in the form of best-fit value ± S.E. with their respective units. The S.E. estimates were calculated by the covariance matrix during nonlinear regression using GraFit5. His-tagged recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, NS5pol (residues 272–900 of NS5), from DENV-2 NGC strain was expressed and purified as shown in Fig. 1. RNase contamination was found in the enzyme preparation when only the nickel column was used during purification, as evidenced by the degradation of the majority RNA substrates during the replication assay (data not shown). Size-exclusion chromatography, after the nickel column, showed a small peak before a major peak. RNase contamination was found only in the small peak, and the major peak was devoid of contamination detectable during a 1-h reaction (data not shown). The major peak showed one band on an SDS gel (Fig. 1, lane 6) and was used as a source of enzyme for this study. The identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. We designed a heteropolymeric primer/template RNA substrate (P12/T26) that was derived from an RNA template used in the HCV polymerase assay (Fig. 2A) (23Deval J. D'Abramo C.M. Zhao Z. McCormick S. Coutsinos D. Hess S. Kvaratskhelia M. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that NS5pol can use this P12/T26 as a substrate by incorporating the next correct nucleotide, GTP, onto the primer. The single nucleotide primer extension reaction was initiated by the addition of NS5pol (0.6 μm) to a mixture containing P12/T26 (0.5 μm) and GTP (0.5 mm) in the reaction buffer at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at various time intervals and mixed with the quench solution to stop reactions (Fig. 2, B and C). Because the assay was performed under single turnover conditions in which more NS5pol was added than P12/T26, the time course of 13-mer formation was fit to a single exponential, yielding a kobs of 0.00110 ± 0.00003 s−1 with an amplitude of 0.46 ± 0.005 μm. Although 92% of the RNA reacted to form product in this assay, the rate of one nucleotide incorporation, with a half-life of 10 min, was too slow to represent the rate of nucleotide incorporation during elongation in vivo. We hypothesized that the slow rate was due to the slow formation of the elongation complex, NS5pol-primer-template. Therefore, we studied the formation of the elongation complex by preincubation of NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) for specific time intervals before the addition of GTP. The study was performed at two different temperatures: 30 and 37 °C (Fig. 3). After preincubation for various time intervals, aliquots from the mixture were rapidly mixed with 0.5 mm GTP to initiate the single nucleotide incorporation reactions, and the reactions were quenched after 90 s. We chose a 90-s reaction time because the burst phase of 13-mer product formation during elongation was completed in this time interval (see below). Heparin was added with the GTP solution to trap free NS5pol to ensure that the 13-mer was generated only from the elongation complex formed during preincubation. Accordingly, the concentration of the 13-mer product formed will equal the concentration of the elongation complex formed during the preincubation phase. The time course of preincubation to form the elongation complex at 37 °C was fit to a single exponential, yielding a rate of 0.00110 ± 0.00003 s−1 (t½ = 10.5 min) and an amplitude of 0.270 ± 0.002 μm; at 30 °C, the rate was 0.00020 ± 0.00007 s−1 (t½ = 58 min), and the amplitude was 0.320 ± 0.003 μm. The rate of elongation complex formation by preincubation of NS5pol with P12/T26 at 37 °C was identical to the rate of nucleotide incorporation without preincubation (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting that the elongation complex assembly was rate-limiting. Also, the rate of elongation complex formation at 37 °C was about 6 times faster than at 30 °C. Preincubation studies at room temperature (23 °C) showed less than 0.05 μm elongation complexes were formed even after preincubation for 4 h (data not shown). Several earlier studies reported different roles for divalent metal ions in the polymerase function (24Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kim Y.C. Gutshall L. Silverman C. Khandekar S. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Benzaghou I. Bougie I. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49755-49761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of MgCl2 on the formation of the elongation complex (Fig. 4). In this experiment, NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) were preincubated with MgCl2 (0–6 mm) in the reaction buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Then primer extension reaction was initiated by the addition of GTP in the presence of MgCl2 and heparin. The reactions were quenched after 90 s, and the reactions were analyzed by PAGE. The gel of the results and the plot of elongation complexes formed during 1 h of preincubation versus MgCl2 concentration are shown in Fig. 4. The observed optimal concentration of MgCl2 is around 2 mm. Surprisingly, only about 10% of total RNA (0.05 μm) was assembled into active elongation complexes after preincubation of enzyme and RNA without MgCl2 (lane 1 in Fig. 4A and the first data point in Fig. 4B) compared with about 55% of the RNA (0.275 μm) assembled after preincubation with 2 mm MgCl2 (lane 4 in Fig. 4A and the fourth data point in Fig. 4B). Both samples contained 2 mm MgCl2 during the 90-s primer extension reaction. This comparison indicates that MgCl2 is necessary for efficient formation of the elongation complex during preincubation. The MgCl2-dependent elongation complex formation was also observed at 30 °C (data not shown). The rate of nucleotide incorporation from the assembled elongation complex was measured in a rapid mixing/quenching experiment. NS5pol (0.6 μm) and P12/T26 (0.5 μm) were incubated in the reaction buffer for 1 h at 37 °C and then rapidly mixed with an equal volume of GTP solution in the reaction buffer. After mixing, the final concentrations of NS5pol, P12/T26, and GTP were 0.3, 0.25, and 800 μm, respectively. The reactions were quenched at various time intervals (Fig. 5A). The time course of 13-mer formation was fit to a two-exponential equation; the fast exponential gave a rate of 13.2 ± 0.8 s−1 and an amplitude of 0.083 ± 0.002 μm. The slow exponential gave a rate of 0.22 ± 0.01 s−1 and an amplitude of 0.094 ± 0.002 μm. This result demonstrates that nucleotide addition to the primer catalyzed by NS5pol in the assembled elongation complex is much faster than the assembly of elongation complex. Single and multiple nucleotide incorporation reactions were examined to explore the kinetics of primer extension using the pre-assembled elongation complex (Fig. 5B). NS5pol and P12/T26 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the primer extension reactions were initiated by adding one or all four nucleotides with heparin. The reactions were quenched after 90 s. In this experiment, four different P12/T26 RNA substrates were used; each has the same P12 primer but used a T26 template with different template bases for the next incoming nucleotide (Table 1). A rapid burst of formation of the 13-mer product was observed for all RNA substrates when only one nucleotide was added, suggesting single nucleotide incorporation from the assembled elongation complex was fast and independent of the identity of the correct base pai"
https://openalex.org/W2045941924,"Anthrax toxin is comprised of protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). These proteins are individually nontoxic; however, when PA assembles with LF and EF, it produces lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. Assembly occurs either on cell surfaces or in plasma. In each milieu, PA assembles into a mixture of heptameric and octameric complexes that bind LF and EF. While octameric PA is the predominant form identified in plasma under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37°C), heptameric PA is more prevalent on cell surfaces. The difference between these two environments is that the anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR) binds to PA on cell surfaces. It is known that the extracellular ANTXR domain serves to stabilize toxin complexes containing the PA heptamer by preventing premature PA channel formation--a process that inactivates the toxin. The role of ANTXR in PA oligomerization and in the stabilization of toxin complexes containing octameric PA are not understood.Using a fluorescence assembly assay, we show that the extracellular ANTXR domain drives PA oligomerization. Moreover, a dimeric ANTXR construct increases the extent of and accelerates the rate of PA assembly relative to a monomeric ANTXR construct. Mass spectrometry analysis shows that heptameric and octameric PA oligomers bind a full stoichiometric complement of ANTXR domains. Electron microscopy and circular dichroism studies reveal that the two different PA oligomers are equally stabilized by ANTXR interactions.We propose that PA oligomerization is driven by dimeric ANTXR complexes on cell surfaces. Through their interaction with the ANTXR, toxin complexes containing heptameric and octameric PA oligomers are similarly stabilized. Considering both the relative instability of the PA heptamer and extracellular assembly pathway identified in plasma, we propose a means to regulate the development of toxin gradients around sites of infection during anthrax pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990066712,"Antioxidants can scavenge highly reactive radicals. As a result the antioxidants are converted into oxidation products that might cause damage to vital cellular components. To prevent this damage, the human body possesses an intricate network of antioxidants that pass over the reactivity from one antioxidant to another in a controlled way. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the semi-synthetic flavonoid 7-mono-O-(β-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside (monoHER), a potential protective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, fits into this antioxidant network. This position was compared with that of the well-known flavonoid quercetin. The present study shows that the oxidation products of both monoHER and quercetin are reactive towards thiol groups of both GSH and proteins. However, in human blood plasma, oxidized quercetin easily reacts with protein thiols, whereas oxidized monoHER does not react with plasma protein thiols. Our results indicate that this can be explained by the presence of ascorbate in plasma; ascorbate is able to reduce oxidized monoHER to the parent compound monoHER before oxidized monoHER can react with thiols. This is a major difference with oxidized quercetin that preferentially reacts with thiols rather than ascorbate. The difference in selectivity between monoHER and quercetin originates from an intrinsic difference in the chemical nature of their oxidation products, which was corroborated by molecular quantum chemical calculations. These findings point towards an essential difference between structurally closely related flavonoids in their interplay with the endogenous antioxidant network. The advantage of monoHER is that it can safely channel the reactivity of radicals into the antioxidant network where the reactivity is completely neutralized."
https://openalex.org/W2042791227,"Over-exploited fisheries are a common feature of the modern world and a range of solutions including area closures (marine reserves; MRs), effort reduction, gear changes, ecosystem-based management, incentives and co-management have been suggested as techniques to rebuild over-fished populations. Historic accounts of lobster (Jasus frontalis) on the Chilean Juan Fernández Archipelago indicate a high abundance at all depths (intertidal to approximately 165 m), but presently lobsters are found almost exclusively in deeper regions of their natural distribution. Fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) tells a story of serial depletion in lobster abundance at fishing grounds located closest to the fishing port with an associated decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) throughout recent history. We have re-constructed baselines of lobster biomass throughout human history on the archipelago using historic data, the fishery catch record and FEK to permit examination of the potential effects of MRs, effort reduction and co-management (stewardship of catch) to restore stocks. We employed a bioeconomic model using FEK, fishery catch and effort data, underwater survey information, predicted population growth and response to MR protection (no-take) to explore different management strategies and their trade-offs to restore stocks and improve catches. Our findings indicate that increased stewardship of catch coupled with 30% area closure (MR) provides the best option to reconstruct historic baselines. Based on model predictions, continued exploitation under the current management scheme is highly influenced by annual fluctuations and unsustainable. We propose a community-based co-management program to implement a MR in order to rebuild the lobster population while also providing conservation protection for marine species endemic to the Archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W2029660372,"Gain- and loss-of-function experiments have illustrated that the family of myogenic regulatory factors is necessary and sufficient for the formation of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, MyoD required cellular aggregation to induce myogenesis in P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells. To determine the mechanism by which stem cells can be directed into skeletal muscle, a time course of P19 cell differentiation was examined in the presence and absence of exogenous MyoD. By quantitative PCR, the first MyoD up-regulated transcripts were the premyogenic mesoderm factors Meox1, Pax7, Six1, and Eya2 on day 4 of differentiation. Subsequently, the myoblast markers myogenin, MEF2C, and Myf5 were up-regulated, leading to skeletal myogenesis. These results were corroborated by Western blot analysis, showing up-regulation of Pax3, Six1, and MEF2C proteins, prior to myogenin protein expression. To determine at what stage a dominant-negative MyoD/EnR mutant could inhibit myogenesis, stable cell lines were created and examined. Interestingly, the premyogenic mesoderm factors, Meox1, Pax3/7, Six1, Eya2, and Foxc1, were down-regulated, and as expected, skeletal myogenesis was abolished. Finally, to identify direct targets of MyoD in this system, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. MyoD was observed associated with regulatory regions of Meox1, Pax3/7, Six1, Eya2, and myogenin genes. Taken together, MyoD directs stem cells into the skeletal muscle lineage by binding and activating the expression of premyogenic mesoderm genes, prior to activating myoblast genes."
https://openalex.org/W1973786354,"Background Advanced age contributes to clinical manifestations of many retinopathies and represents a major risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the elderly. Rod photoreceptors are especially vulnerable to genetic defects and changes in microenvironment, and are among the first neurons to die in normal aging and in many retinal degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying rod photoreceptor vulnerability and potential biomarkers of the aging process in this highly specialized cell type are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings To discover aging-associated adaptations that may influence rod function, we have generated gene expression profiles of purified rod photoreceptors from mouse retina at young adult to early stages of aging (1.5, 5, and 12 month old mice). We identified 375 genes that showed differential expression in rods from 5 and 12 month old mouse retina compared to that of 1.5 month old retina. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments validated expression change for a majority of the 25 genes that were examined. Macroanalysis of differentially expressed genes using gene class testing and protein interaction networks revealed overrepresentation of cellular pathways that are potentially photoreceptor-specific (angiogenesis and lipid/retinoid metabolism), in addition to age-related pathways previously described in several tissue types (oxidative phosphorylation, stress and immune response). Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests a progressive shift in cellular homeostasis that may underlie aging-associated functional decline in rod photoreceptors and contribute to a more permissive state for pathological processes involved in retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2045464801,"Background Recently the reduction of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) was suggested to be associated with diffuse axonal damage in the whole CNS of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, several points are still under discussion. (1) Is high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) required to detect the partly very subtle RNFL changes seen in MS patients? (2) Can a reduction of RNFL be detected in all MS patients, even in early disease courses and in all MS subtypes? (3) Does an optic neuritis (ON) or focal lesions along the visual pathways, which are both very common in MS, limit the predication of diffuse axonal degeneration in the whole CNS? The purpose of our study was to determine the baseline characteristics of clinical definite relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS patients with high resolution OCT technique. Methodology Forty-two RRMS and 17 SPMS patients with and without history of uni- or bilateral ON, and 59 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analysed prospectively with the high resolution spectral-domain OCT device (SD-OCT) using the Spectralis 3.5mm circle scan protocol with locked reference images and eye tracking mode. Furthermore we performed tests for visual and contrast acuity and sensitivity (ETDRS, Sloan and Pelli-Robson-charts), for color vision (Lanthony D-15), the Humphrey visual field and visual evoked potential testing (VEP). Principal Findings All 4 groups (RRMS and SPMS with or without ON) showed significantly reduced RNFL globally, or at least in one of the peripapillary sectors compared to age-/sex-matched healthy controls. In patients with previous ON additional RNFL reduction was found. However, in many RRMS patients the RNFL was found within normal range. We found no correlation between RNFL reduction and disease duration (range 9–540 months). Conclusions RNFL baseline characteristics of RRMS and SPMS are heterogeneous (range from normal to markedly reduced levels)."
https://openalex.org/W2081725365,"Most extremely preterm newborns exhibit cerebral atrophy/growth disturbances and white matter signal abnormalities on MRI at term-equivalent age. MRI brain volumes could serve as biomarkers for evaluating the effects of neonatal intensive care and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes. This requires detailed, accurate, and reliable brain MRI segmentation methods. We describe our efforts to develop such methods in high risk newborns using a combination of manual and automated segmentation tools. After intensive efforts to accurately define structural boundaries, two trained raters independently performed manual segmentation of nine subcortical structures using axial T2-weighted MRI scans from 20 randomly selected extremely preterm infants. All scans were re-segmented by both raters to assess reliability. High intra-rater reliability was achieved, as assessed by repeatability and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC range: 0.97 to 0.99) for all manually segmented regions. Inter-rater reliability was slightly lower (ICC range: 0.93 to 0.99). A semi-automated segmentation approach was developed that combined the parametric strengths of the Hidden Markov Random Field Expectation Maximization algorithm with non-parametric Parzen window classifier resulting in accurate white matter, gray matter, and CSF segmentation. Final manual correction of misclassification errors improved accuracy (similarity index range: 0.87 to 0.89) and facilitated objective quantification of white matter signal abnormalities. The semi-automated and manual methods were seamlessly integrated to generate full brain segmentation within two hours. This comprehensive approach can facilitate the evaluation of large cohorts to rigorously evaluate the utility of regional brain volumes as biomarkers of neonatal care and surrogate endpoints for neurodevelopmental outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1994296030,"Proteins function by interacting with other molecules, where both native and nonnative interactions play important roles. Native interactions contribute to the stability and specificity of a complex, whereas nonnative interactions mainly perturb the binding kinetics. For intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which do not adopt rigid structures when being free in solution, the role of nonnative interactions may be more prominent in binding processes due to their high flexibilities. In this work, we investigated the effect of nonnative hydrophobic interactions on the coupled folding and binding processes of IDPs and its interplay with chain flexibility by conducting molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that the free-energy profiles became rugged, and intermediate states occurred when nonnative hydrophobic interactions were introduced. The binding rate was initially accelerated and subsequently dramatically decreased as the strength of the nonnative hydrophobic interactions increased. Both thermodynamic and kinetic analysis showed that disordered systems were more readily affected by nonnative interactions than ordered systems. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the kinetic advantage of IDPs (""fly-casting"" mechanism) was enhanced by nonnative hydrophobic interactions. The relationship between chain flexibility and protein aggregation is also discussed."

The disordered N-terminal domain of tropomodulin contains three functional sites: two tropomyosin-binding and one tropomyosin-dependent actin-capping sites. The C-terminal half of tropomodulin consists of one compact domain containing a tropomyosin-independent actin-capping site. Here we determined the structural properties of tropomodulin-1 that affect its roles in cardiomyocytes. To explore the significance of individual tropomyosin-binding sites, GFP-tropomodulin-1 with single mutations that destroy each tropomyosin-binding site was expressed in cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that both sites are necessary for the optimal localization of tropomodulin-1 at thin filament pointed ends, with site 2 acting as the major determinant. To investigate the functional properties of the tropomodulin C-terminal domain, truncated versions of GFP-tropomodulin-1 were expressed in cardiomyocytes. We discovered that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) fold and the C-terminal helix are required for its proper targeting to the pointed ends. To investigate the structural significance of the LRR fold, we generated three mutations within the C-terminal domain (V232D, F263D, and L313D). Our results show that these mutations affect both tropomyosin-independent actin-capping activity and pointed end localization, most likely by changing local conformations of either loops or side chains of the surfaces involved in the interactions of the LRR domain.

In this report we describe a phase I clinical trial testing the safety and immunogenicity of an anthrax vaccine using recombinant Escherichia coli-derived, B. anthracis protective antigen (rPA).A total of 73 healthy adults ages 18-40 were enrolled and 67 received 2 injections separated by 4 weeks of either buffered saline placebo, or rPA formulated with or without 704 µg/ml Alhydrogel® adjuvant in increasing doses (5, 25, 50, 100 µg) of rPA. Participants were followed for one year and safety and immunologic data were assessed. Tenderness and warmth were the most common post-injection site reactions. No serious adverse events related to the vaccine were observed. The most robust humoral immune responses were observed in subjects receiving 50 µg of rPA formulated with Alhydrogel® with a geometric mean concentration of anti-rPA IgG antibodies of 283 µg/ml and a toxin neutralizing geometric 50% reciprocal geometric mean titer of 1061. The highest lymphoproliferative peak cellular response (median Lymphocyte Stimulation Index of 29) was observed in the group receiving 25 µg Alhydrogel®-formulated rPA.The vaccine was safe, well tolerated and stimulated a robust humoral and cellular response after two doses.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00057525."
https://openalex.org/W1996141657,"The current view of peroxisome inheritance provides for the formation of new peroxisomes by both budding from the endoplasmic reticulum and autonomous division. Here we investigate peroxisome-cytoskeleton interactions and show by proteomics, biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses that actin, non-muscle myosin IIA (NMM IIA), RhoA, Rho kinase II (ROCKII) and Rab8 associate with peroxisomes. Our data provide evidence that (i) RhoA in its inactive state, maintained for example by C. botulinum toxin exoenzyme C3, dissociates from peroxisomes enabling microtubule-based peroxisomal movements and (ii) dominant-active RhoA targets to peroxisomes, uncouples the organelles from microtubules and favors Rho kinase recruitment to peroxisomes. We suggest that ROCKII activates NMM IIA mediating local peroxisomal constrictions. Although our understanding of peroxisome-cytoskeleton interactions is still incomplete, a picture is emerging demonstrating alternate RhoA-dependent association of peroxisomes to the microtubular and actin cytoskeleton. Whereas association of peroxisomes to microtubules clearly serves bidirectional, long-range saltatory movements, peroxisome-acto-myosin interactions may support biogenetic functions balancing peroxisome size, shape, number, and clustering."

The effect of semantic knowledge on such prewired hedonic processing over the life span has remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study measured hedonic response to odors in different age groups (children, teenagers, young adults, and seniors) and found that children and seniors, two age groups characterized by either low level of (children) or weak access to (seniors) odor semantic knowledge, processed odor hedonics more on the basis of their physicochemical properties. In contrast, in teenagers and young adults, who show better levels of semantic odor representation, the role of physicochemical properties was less marked. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate for the first time that the biological determinants that make an odor pleasant or unpleasant are more powerful at either end of the life span."

The short V3 isoform contains the G1 and G3 terminal domains of versican that may potentially interact directly or indirectly with the hyaluronan receptor CD44 and the EGFR, respectively. We have previously described that overexpression of V3 in MeWo human melanoma cells markedly reduces tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In this study we have investigated the signaling mechanism of V3 by silencing the expression of CD44 in control and V3-expressing melanoma cells. Suppression of CD44 had the same effects on cell proliferation and cell migration than those provoked by V3 expression, suggesting that V3 acts through a CD44-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, CD44-dependent hyaluronan internalization was blocked by V3 expression and CD44 silencing, leading to an accumulation of this glycosaminoglycan in the pericellular matrix and to changes in cell migration on hyaluronan. Furthermore, ERK1/2 and p38 activation after EGF treatment were decreased in V3-expressing cells suggesting that V3 may also interact with the EGFR through its G3 domain. The existence of a EGFR/ErbB2 receptor complex able to interact with CD44 was identified in MeWo melanoma cells. V3 overexpression resulted in a reduced interaction between EGFR/ErbB2 and CD44 in response to EGF treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2018360678,"Genetic susceptibility is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated multiple CD susceptibility genes in an Australian paediatric onset CD cohort. Newly diagnosed paediatric onset CD patients (n = 72) and controls (n = 98) were genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 genetic loci. Gene-gene interaction analysis, gene-disease phenotype analysis and genetic risk profiling were performed for all SNPs and all genes. Of the 34 SNPs analysed, four polymorphisms on three genes (NOD2, IL23R, and region 3p21) were significantly associated with CD status (p<0.05). All three CD specific paediatric polymorphisms on PSMG1 and TNFRSF6B showed a trend of association with p<0.1. An additive gene-gene interaction involving TLR4, PSMG1, TNFRSF6B and IRGM was identified with CD. Genes involved in microbial processing (TLR4, PSMG1, NOD2) were significantly associated either at the individual level or in gene-gene interactive roles. Colonic disease was significantly associated with disease SNP rs7517847 (IL23R) (p<0.05) and colonic and ileal/colonic disease was significantly associated with disease SNP rs125221868 (IBD5) and SLC22A4 & SLC22A4/5 variants (p<0.05). We were able to demonstrate genetic association of several genes to CD in a paediatric onset cohort. Several of the observed associations have not been reported previously in association with paediatric CD patients.

These effects were associated with an early activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and increased expression of EGR-1 and p21 genes. Also, we observed a sustained activation of the ERK pathway, a concomitant phosphorylation and activation of ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and an inactivation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser 9. Finally, treatment of glioblastoma stem cells with TDZD-8 resulted in an inhibition of proliferation and self-renewal of these cells.Our results suggest that TDZD-8 uses a novel mechanism to target glioblastoma cells, and that malignant progenitor population could be a target of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2074309433,"Electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) is a minor subfraction of modified LDL present in plasma. Among its atherogenic characteristics, low affinity to the LDL receptor and high binding to arterial proteoglycans (PGs) could be related to abnormalities in the conformation of its main protein, apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). In the current study, we have performed an immunochemical analysis using monoclonal antibody (mAb) probes to analyze the conformation of apoB-100 in LDL(-). The study, performed with 28 anti-apoB-100 mAbs, showed that major differences of apoB-100 immunoreactivity between native LDL and LDL(-) concentrate in both terminal extremes. The mAbs Bsol 10, Bsol 14 (which recognize the amino-terminal region), Bsol 2, and Bsol 7 (carboxyl-terminal region) showed increased immunoreactivity in LDL(-), suggesting that both terminal extremes are more accessible in LDL(-) than in native LDL. The analysis of in vitro-modified LDLs, including LDL lipolyzed with sphingomyelinase (SMase-LDL) or phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)-LDL) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL), suggested that increased amino-terminal immunoreactivity was related to altered conformation due to aggregation. This was confirmed when the aggregated subfractions of LDL(-) (agLDL(-)) and oxLDL (ag-oxLDL) were isolated and analyzed. Thus, Bsol 10 and Bsol 14 immunoreactivity was high in SMase-LDL, ag-oxLDL, and agLDL(-). The altered amino-terminal apoB-100 conformation was involved in the increased PG binding affinity of agLDL(-) because Bsol 10 and Bsol 14 blocked its high PG-binding. These observations suggest that an abnormal conformation of the amino-terminal region of apoB-100 is responsible for the increased PG binding affinity of agLDL(-)."
https://openalex.org/W2079177257,"Even in the presence of negative information, healthy human beings display an optimistic tendency when thinking of past success and future chances, giving a positive bias to everyday's cognition. The tendency to actively select positive thoughts suggests the existence of a mechanism to exclude negative content, raising the issue of its dependence on mechanisms like those of effortful control. Using perfusion imaging, we examined how brain activations differed according to whether participants were left to prefer positive thoughts spontaneously, or followed an explicit instruction to the same effect, finding a widespread dissociation of brain perfusion patterns. Under spontaneous processing of emotional material, recruitment of areas associated with effortful attention, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was reduced relative to instructed avoidance of negative material (F1,58 = 26.24, p = 0.047, corrected). Under spontaneous avoidance perfusion increments were observed in several areas that were deactivated by the task, including the perigenual medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, individual differences in executive capacity were not associated with positive bias. These findings suggest that spontaneous positive cognitive emotion regulation in health may result from processes that, while actively suppressing emotionally salient information, differ from those associated with effortful and directed control."
https://openalex.org/W2167874705,"The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is the nuclear receptor mediating the toxicity of dioxins--widespread and persistent pollutants whose toxic effects include tumor promotion, teratogenesis, wasting syndrome and chloracne. Elimination of Ahr in mice eliminates dioxin toxicity but also produces adverse effects, some seemingly unrelated to dioxin. Thus the relationship between the toxic and dioxin-independent functions of Ahr is not clear, which hampers understanding and treatment of dioxin toxicity. Here we develop a Drosophila model to show that dioxin actually increases the in vivo dioxin-independent activity of Ahr. This hyperactivation resembles the effects caused by an increase in the amount of its dimerisation partner Ahr nuclear translocator (Arnt) and entails an increased transcriptional potency of Ahr, in addition to the previously described effect on nuclear translocation. Thus the two apparently different functions of Ahr, dioxin-mediated and dioxin-independent, are in fact two different levels (hyperactivated and basal, respectively) of a single function."

Pretargeting is a strategy developed to improve signal to background ratio for molecular imaging and to minimize undesired side effects of pharmacological and radiotherapy. Pretargeting relies on accessibility of the target finder on the surface of the target cell. anxA5 binds PS and crystallizes in a two-dimensional network covering the PS-expressing cell surface. Two-dimensional crystallization is the driving force for anxA5 internalization by PS-expressing cells. Here, we report structure/function analysis of anxA5 internalization. Guided by structural bioinformatics including protein-protein docking, we revealed that the amino acids Arg(63), Lys(70), Lys(101), Glu(138), Asp(139), and Asn(160) engage in intermolecular salt bridges within the anxA5 trimer, which is the basic building block of the two-dimensional network. Disruption of the salt bridges by site-directed mutagenesis does not affect PS binding but inhibits trimer formation and cell entry of surface-bound anxA5. The anxA5 variants with impaired internalization are superior molecular imaging agents in pretargeting strategies as compared with wild-type anxA5."

The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between late vs. early stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) and uterine serous carcinoma (USC), as well as between disease outcomes in each of the two histological subtypes.Gene expression profiles of 20 cancer samples were analyzed (EAC = 10, USC = 10) using the human genome wide illumina bead microarrays. There was little overlap in the DEG sets between late vs. early stages in EAC and USC, and there was an insignificant overlap in DEG sets between good and poor prognosis in EAC and USC. Remarkably, there was no overlap between the stage-derived DEGs and the prognosis-derived DEGs for each of the two histological subtypes. Further functional annotation of differentially expressed genes showed that the composition of enriched function terms were different among different DEG sets. Gene expression differences for selected genes of various stages and outcomes were confirmed by qRT-PCR with a high validation rate.This data, although preliminary, suggests that there might be involvement of distinct groups of genes in tumor progression (late vs. early stage) in each of the EAC and USC. It also suggests that these genes are different from those involved in tumor outcome (good vs. poor prognosis). These involved genes, once clinically verified, may be important for predicting tumor progression and tumor outcome."

In the current study, we tested the effects of these defects on thymic selection.We used Foxn1(Δ/Δ); DO11 Tg and Foxn1(Δ/Δ); OT1 Tg mice as positive selection and Foxn1(Δ/Δ); MHCII I-E mice as negative selection models. We also used an in vivo system of antigen-specific reactivity to test the function of peripheral T cells. Our data show that the capacity for positive and negative selection of both CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes was reduced in Foxn1(Δ/Δ) mutants compared to Foxn1(+/Δ) control mice. These defects were associated with reduction of both MHC Class I and Class II expression, although the resulting peripheral T cells have a broad TCR Vβ repertoire. In this deficient thymic environment, immature CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes emigrate from the thymus into the periphery. These T cells had an incompletely activated profile under stimulation of the TCR signal in vitro, and were either hypersensitive or hyporesponsive to antigen-specific stimulation in vivo. These cell-autonomous defects were compounded by the hypocellular peripheral environment caused by low thymic output.These data show that a primary defect in the thymic microenvironment can cause both direct defects in selection which can in turn cause indirect effects on the periphery, exacerbating functional defects in T cells."

Nucleic acid arrays are a powerful tool for genome-scale SNP analysis, but detection of low-frequency SNPs in a mixed population on an array is problematic. We demonstrate a model assay for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, wherein ligase discrimination products are collected on a suspension array. In developing this system, we discovered that signal from multiple polymorphisms was obscured by two discrete hybridization artifacts. Specifically: 1) tethering of unligated probes on the template DNA elicited false signal and 2) unpredictable probe secondary structures impaired probe capture and suppressed legitimate signal from the array. Two sets of oligonucleotides were used to disrupt these structures; one to displace unligated reporter labels from the bead-bound species and another to occupy sequences which interfered with array hybridization. This artifact silencing system resulted in a mean 21-fold increased sensitivity for 29 minority variants of 17 codons in our model assay for mutations most commonly associated with HIV-1 drug resistance. Furthermore, since the artifacts we characterized are not unique to our system, their specific inhibition might improve the quality of data from solid-state microarrays as well as from the growing number of multiple analyte suspension arrays relying on sequence-specific nucleic acid target capture."

However, the role of alloparental behavior in maintaining population viability has not been previously studied. Here, we provide the first evidence for adoption in California sea lions and show that adoption potentially works to maintain a high survival rate of young and may ultimately contribute to population persistence. Alloparental behavior should have a positive effect on the population growth rate when the sum of the effects on fitness for the alloparent and beneficiary is positive."
