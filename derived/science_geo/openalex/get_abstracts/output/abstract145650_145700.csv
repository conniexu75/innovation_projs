We have previously shown that the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is necessary for endotoxin-induced cytokine gene transcription. Due to the fact that most cytokine promoter sequences have active NF-κB sites, we hypothesized that the p38 MAP kinase was necessary for NF-κB-dependent gene expression. We found that NF-κB-dependent gene expression was reduced to near control levels with either SB 203580 or a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. Inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase did not alter NF-κB activation at any level, but it significantly reduced the DNA binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box. The dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector interfered with the direct interaction of native TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected p65 fusion protein. Likewise, this dominant-negative plasmid also interfered with the direct interaction of a co-transfected TBP fusion protein with the native p65 subunit. The p38 kinase also phosphorylated TFIID (TBP) in vitro, and SB 203580 inhibited phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo. Thus, the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, in part, by modulating activation of TFIID (TBP).

NF-κB is composed of heterodimers (most commonly p50 and p65) of members of the Rel family of transcription factors. In quiescent cells the heterodimers are kept in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor protein, IκB (9Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Other factors, however, have been shown to be essential for NF-κB transcriptional activation, especially phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in one of two of its transactivation domains (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, the association of the carboxyl terminus of p65 with basal transcription factors, such as transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and TATA-binding protein (TBP), is known to be important for transcriptional regulation of NF-κB (19Kerr L.D.

We and others have shown that the p38 MAP kinase is critical for LPS-induced cytokine gene expression (23Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

A. 1995; 92: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).Some of these studies showed that LPS, interleukin 1, and osmotic stress activate p38 MAP kinases, and inhibition with SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinases, reduced cytokine release but did not affect cytokine mRNA accumulation (23Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R.

McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the p38 MAP kinase also regulated LPS-induced cytokine gene expression at the level of transcription in macrophages (25Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The p38 MAP kinase is known to regulate various transcription factors, such as ATF-2, by phosphorylation (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

One study, using tumor necrosis factor as a stimulus, found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did not alter NF-κB DNA binding (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Another study showed that overexpression of MEKK1, an upstream kinase that activates both the p38 and c-Jun (JNK) MAP kinases, increased NF-κB-driven transcription (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). MEKK1 has also been found to interact directly with both IKK-α and IKK-β (33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Using a promoter construct driven only by NF-κB, we found that LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was inhibited by SB 203580 and a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays and found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did not affect NF-κB DNA binding. To confirm these findings, we also found that IκB-β degradation was not affected by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We next evaluated if the p38 MAP kinase regulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by performing in vivo phosphorylation studies and found that SB 203580 did not regulate phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did, however, reduce the DNA binding of TFIID (TBP) to the TATA box, and the dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector altered the direct interaction of TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected His-p65 fusion protein. It also interfered with the binding of a co-transfected His-TBP fusion protein with native p65. The p38 MAP kinase was also found to phosphorylate TFIID (TBP) in vitro, and SB 203580 inhibited the phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo. These findings suggest that the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-driven gene expression, in part, by regulation of TFIID (TBP) activation.DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we found that LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was significantly reduced by SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, and by a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. These observations showed that the p38 MAP kinase was necessary for NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. To determine the level at which this regulation occurred, we first evaluated NF-κB translocation and DNA binding and found that SB 203580 had no appreciable effect. To confirm these findings in a different manner, we measured IκB-β degradation and found that it was not reduced by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We next evaluated if the p38 MAP kinase regulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by performingin vivo phosphorylation studies. We found that SB 203580 did not regulate phosphorylation of native p65. Due to the interaction of the p65 subunit with basal transcription factors, such as TFIID (TBP), we determined what role the p38 MAP kinase had in regulating its activation. The dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector altered the interaction of TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected His-p65 fusion protein. Likewise, the dominant-negative p38 kinase also regulated the interaction of native p65 with a co-transfected His-TBP fusion protein. In addition, we found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase reduced TFIID (TBP) binding to the TATA box and that the p38 kinase phosphorylated this basal transcription factor in vitro. We confirmed that these observations were physiologically relevant by showing that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase decreased the LPS-induced phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo.The regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression can occur at multiple levels after cell stimulation. Early regulation occurs in the cytoplasm with the activation of IKK and subsequent IκB phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis (9Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that MEKK1, an upstream activator of the p38 MAP kinase, regulates NF-κB translocation and, thus, NF-κB-dependent transcription (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears from these studies that MEKK1 regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription by activating IKK. In fact, MEKK1 directly interacts with both IKK-α and IKK-β and phosphorylates them (33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies reveal that the regulatory role of the p38 MAP kinase is downstream of IKK.Like other transcription factors, NF-κB activation is also controlled by phosphorylation of it subunits (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The DNA binding of the p65 subunit is augmented after undergoing phosphorylation in the nucleus (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of p65 is also dependent on phosphorylation in one or both of its COOH-terminal transactivation domains (36Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our data shows that LPS induces the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit; however, the p38 MAP kinase is not directly involved in this phosphorylation. These findings are similar to those of Beyaertet al. (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), who found that the p38 MAP kinase pathway regulated tumor necrosis factor-induced interleukin 6 synthesis (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In this study, the p38 MAP kinase also regulated NF-κB activity but not NF-κB phosphorylation. The means by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB activity was not determined in this study.The mechanism(s) by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression has not previously been shown. Subunits of NF-κB are known to interact with other transcription factors, such as ATF-2, TFIIB, and TBP (19Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M.

It is unlikely that ATF-2 is necessary in our system, because our reporter plasmid is driven by NF-κB alone. The interaction of NF-κB with the basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TBP, is a much more likely scenario. The p65 subunit interacts directly with these basal transcription factors in a manner that activates gene expression in COS7 cells (22Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TBP is an essential component of transcription initiation in class I, II, and III promoters (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and it is one of the subunits of TFIID (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One study has shown that phosphorylation of both TBP and TFIIB in the amino-terminal regions could regulate the transcription of class II promoters (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data corroborates that phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) regulates transcription of class II promoters. The novel finding, however, is that the p38 MAP kinase regulates the activation of TFIID (TBP). In fact, we found that inhibition of phosphorylation reduced its binding to the TATA box and its interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This, in turn, is a plausible mechanism for the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by the p38 MAP kinase.A phosphorylation substrate for the p38 MAP kinase must have the minimal consensus sequence Ser/Thr-Pro (45Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One study has shown that another serine/threonine kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates TBP in the amino-terminal region (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so there are several Ser/Thr-Pro motifs present in the first 160 amino acids. Although DNA-dependent protein kinase has a slightly different consensus sequence requirement, both proline-directed and minimal consensus sequences, which are necessary for MAP kinase specificity, are present in the amino-terminal region of TBP. Our data clearly shows that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates TFIID (TBP), and this phosphorylation is necessary for TBP binding to the TATA box. Therefore, the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription in part by modulating activation of basal transcription factors. Cytokine gene expression in endotoxin (LPS)1-stimulated macrophages is regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcription. A transcription factor that is necessary for the transcription of many cytokine genes is nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (1Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell.

NF-κB is composed of heterodimers (most commonly p50 and p65) of members of the Rel family of transcription factors. In quiescent cells the heterodimers are kept in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor protein, IκB (9Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Other factors, however, have been shown to be essential for NF-κB transcriptional activation, especially phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in one of two of its transactivation domains (18Naumann M.

One family of kinases that is essential for transferring signals from the cell surface to the nucleus is the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We and others have shown that the p38 MAP kinase is critical for LPS-induced cytokine gene expression (23Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

Some of these studies showed that LPS, interleukin 1, and osmotic stress activate p38 MAP kinases, and inhibition with SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinases, reduced cytokine release but did not affect cytokine mRNA accumulation (23Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R.

McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the p38 MAP kinase also regulated LPS-induced cytokine gene expression at the level of transcription in macrophages (25Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The p38 MAP kinase is known to regulate various transcription factors, such as ATF-2, by phosphorylation (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

One study, using tumor necrosis factor as a stimulus, found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did not alter NF-κB DNA binding (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Another study showed that overexpression of MEKK1, an upstream kinase that activates both the p38 and c-Jun (JNK) MAP kinases, increased NF-κB-driven transcription (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). MEKK1 has also been found to interact directly with both IKK-α and IKK-β (33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a promoter construct driven only by NF-κB, we found that LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was inhibited by SB 203580 and a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays and found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did not affect NF-κB DNA binding. To confirm these findings, we also found that IκB-β degradation was not affected by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We next evaluated if the p38 MAP kinase regulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by performing in vivo phosphorylation studies and found that SB 203580 did not regulate phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 did, however, reduce the DNA binding of TFIID (TBP) to the TATA box, and the dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector altered the direct interaction of TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected His-p65 fusion protein. It also interfered with the binding of a co-transfected His-TBP fusion protein with native p65. The p38 MAP kinase was also found to phosphorylate TFIID (TBP) in vitro, and SB 203580 inhibited the phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo. These findings suggest that the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-driven gene expression, in part, by regulation of TFIID (TBP) activation. DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we found that LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was significantly reduced by SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, and by a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. These observations showed that the p38 MAP kinase was necessary for NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. To determine the level at which this regulation occurred, we first evaluated NF-κB translocation and DNA binding and found that SB 203580 had no appreciable effect. To confirm these findings in a different manner, we measured IκB-β degradation and found that it was not reduced by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We next evaluated if the p38 MAP kinase regulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by performingin vivo phosphorylation studies. We found that SB 203580 did not regulate phosphorylation of native p65. Due to the interaction of the p65 subunit with basal transcription factors, such as TFIID (TBP), we determined what role the p38 MAP kinase had in regulating its activation. The dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector altered the interaction of TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected His-p65 fusion protein. Likewise, the dominant-negative p38 kinase also regulated the interaction of native p65 with a co-transfected His-TBP fusion protein. In addition, we found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase reduced TFIID (TBP) binding to the TATA box and that the p38 kinase phosphorylated this basal transcription factor in vitro. We confirmed that these observations were physiologically relevant by showing that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase decreased the LPS-induced phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo.The regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression can occur at multiple levels after cell stimulation. Early regulation occurs in the cytoplasm with the activation of IKK and subsequent IκB phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis (9Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

Several studies have shown that MEKK1, an upstream activator of the p38 MAP kinase, regulates NF-κB translocation and, thus, NF-κB-dependent transcription (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears from these studies that MEKK1 regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription by activating IKK. In fact, MEKK1 directly interacts with both IKK-α and IKK-β and phosphorylates them (33Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies reveal that the regulatory role of the p38 MAP kinase is downstream of IKK.Like other transcription factors, NF-κB activation is also controlled by phosphorylation of it subunits (18Naumann M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The DNA binding of the p65 subunit is augmented after undergoing phosphorylation in the nucleus (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of p65 is also dependent on phosphorylation in one or both of its COOH-terminal transactivation domains (36Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our data shows that LPS induces the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit; however, the p38 MAP kinase is not directly involved in this phosphorylation. These findings are similar to those of Beyaertet al. (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), who found that the p38 MAP kinase pathway regulated tumor necrosis factor-induced interleukin 6 synthesis (31Beyaert R.

In this study, the p38 MAP kinase also regulated NF-κB activity but not NF-κB phosphorylation. The means by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB activity was not determined in this study.The mechanism(s) by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression has not previously been shown. Subunits of NF-κB are known to interact with other transcription factors, such as ATF-2, TFIIB, and TBP (19Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M.

It is unlikely that ATF-2 is necessary in our system, because our reporter plasmid is driven by NF-κB alone. The interaction of NF-κB with the basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TBP, is a much more likely scenario. The p65 subunit interacts directly with these basal transcription factors in a manner that activates gene expression in COS7 cells (22Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TBP is an essential component of transcription initiation in class I, II, and III promoters (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and it is one of the subunits of TFIID (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One study has shown that phosphorylation of both TBP and TFIIB in the amino-terminal regions could regulate the transcription of class II promoters (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data corroborates that phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) regulates transcription of class II promoters. The novel finding, however, is that the p38 MAP kinase regulates the activation of TFIID (TBP). In fact, we found that inhibition of phosphorylation reduced its binding to the TATA box and its interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This, in turn, is a plausible mechanism for the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by the p38 MAP kinase.A phosphorylation substrate for the p38 MAP kinase must have the minimal consensus sequence Ser/Thr-Pro (45Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One study has shown that another serine/threonine kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates TBP in the amino-terminal region (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so there are several Ser/Thr-Pro motifs present in the first 160 amino acids. Although DNA-dependent protein kinase has a slightly different consensus sequence requirement, both proline-directed and minimal consensus sequences, which are necessary for MAP kinase specificity, are present in the amino-terminal region of TBP. Our data clearly shows that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates TFIID (TBP), and this phosphorylation is necessary for TBP binding to the TATA box. Therefore, the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription in part by modulating activation of basal transcription factors. In these studies, we found that LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression was significantly reduced by SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, and by a dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector. These observations showed that the p38 MAP kinase was necessary for NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. To determine the level at which this regulation occurred, we first evaluated NF-κB translocation and DNA binding and found that SB 203580 had no appreciable effect. To confirm these findings in a different manner, we measured IκB-β degradation and found that it was not reduced by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We next evaluated if the p38 MAP kinase regulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by performingin vivo phosphorylation studies. We found that SB 203580 did not regulate phosphorylation of native p65. Due to the interaction of the p65 subunit with basal transcription factors, such as TFIID (TBP), we determined what role the p38 MAP kinase had in regulating its activation. The dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase expression vector altered the interaction of TFIID (TBP) with a co-transfected His-p65 fusion protein. Likewise, the dominant-negative p38 kinase also regulated the interaction of native p65 with a co-transfected His-TBP fusion protein. In addition, we found that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase reduced TFIID (TBP) binding to the TATA box and that the p38 kinase phosphorylated this basal transcription factor in vitro. We confirmed that these observations were physiologically relevant by showing that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase decreased the LPS-induced phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) in vivo.

Several studies have shown that MEKK1, an upstream activator of the p38 MAP kinase, regulates NF-κB translocation and, thus, NF-κB-dependent transcription (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S.

The DNA binding of the p65 subunit is augmented after undergoing phosphorylation in the nucleus (18Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of p65 is also dependent on phosphorylation in one or both of its COOH-terminal transactivation domains (36Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our data shows that LPS induces the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit; however, the p38 MAP kinase is not directly involved in this phosphorylation. These findings are similar to those of Beyaertet al. (31Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), who found that the p38 MAP kinase pathway regulated tumor necrosis factor-induced interleukin 6 synthesis (31Beyaert R.

In this study, the p38 MAP kinase also regulated NF-κB activity but not NF-κB phosphorylation. The means by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB activity was not determined in this study. The mechanism(s) by which the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression has not previously been shown. Subunits of NF-κB are known to interact with other transcription factors, such as ATF-2, TFIIB, and TBP (19Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M.

It is unlikely that ATF-2 is necessary in our system, because our reporter plasmid is driven by NF-κB alone. The interaction of NF-κB with the basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TBP, is a much more likely scenario. The p65 subunit interacts directly with these basal transcription factors in a manner that activates gene expression in COS7 cells (22Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TBP is an essential component of transcription initiation in class I, II, and III promoters (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One study has shown that phosphorylation of both TBP and TFIIB in the amino-terminal regions could regulate the transcription of class II promoters (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data corroborates that phosphorylation of TFIID (TBP) regulates transcription of class II promoters. The novel finding, however, is that the p38 MAP kinase regulates the activation of TFIID (TBP). In fact, we found that inhibition of phosphorylation reduced its binding to the TATA box and its interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This, in turn, is a plausible mechanism for the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by the p38 MAP kinase. A phosphorylation substrate for the p38 MAP kinase must have the minimal consensus sequence Ser/Thr-Pro (45Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One study has shown that another serine/threonine kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates TBP in the amino-terminal region (44Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so there are several Ser/Thr-Pro motifs present in the first 160 amino acids. Although DNA-dependent protein kinase has a slightly different consensus sequence requirement, both proline-directed and minimal consensus sequences, which are necessary for MAP kinase specificity, are present in the amino-terminal region of TBP. Our data clearly shows that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates TFIID (TBP), and this phosphorylation is necessary for TBP binding to the TATA box. Therefore, the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription in part by modulating activation of basal transcription factors.

Bad phosphorylation was examined following cytokine stimulation, which revealed phosphorylation on a critical residue, serine 112, in a MEK-dependent manner. Furthermore, Bad phosphorylation also increased on several sites distinct from serine 112 but could not be detected on serine 136, previously thought to be a protein kinase B/Akt-targeted residue. Serine 112 phosphorylation was shown to be absolutely required for dissociation of Bad from Bcl-xL. These results demonstrate for the first time in mammalian cells the involvement of the Ras-MAPK pathway in the phosphorylation of Bad and the regulation of its function.

The process of apoptosis involves various discreet levels, ultimately leading to the activation of cysteine-aspartate specific proteases (caspases)1 (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). An intensely studied family of proteins involved upstream of caspase activation share homology with Bcl-2, one of the first apoptosis regulating proteins identified as an oncogene. These proteins may function as a checkpoint for life and death decisions (2Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Cytokines prevent the onset of apoptosis and caspase activation by activating both protein and lipid kinase cascades, which may converge on the Bcl-2 family. In this way, the cytoprotective actions of these signaling pathways may involve the up-regulation of death antagonists, as well as the post-translational modification of Bcl-2 family proteins, which alters their role in propagating the apoptotic signal. Cytokine receptors of the hemopoietic superfamily activate a number of well studied signaling pathways following tyrosine kinase activation, including p21ras and PI3K and their downstream targets. PI3K-generated 3′-phosphoinositides mediate activation of a family of phospholipid-dependent kinases, which includes PDK1 (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

PDK1 is an important activation loop kinase and is responsible for the phosphorylation of PKB/c-Akt, p70 S6 kinase, and protein kinase Cδ (reviewed in Ref. 7Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 93-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ras-activated Raf operates in a parallel pathway, by phosphorylating and activating downstream targets including the dual specificity kinase MAPK/Erk kinase (MEK; also termed MKK)-1 and 2 (8Crews C.M.

The ability of Ras to induce transformation is believed in part to involve sustained activation of Raf, MEK, and MAPK activity (12Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S.

MEK has a very narrow substrate specificity, restricted to the threonine and tyrosine residues of p44erk1 and p42erk2. Phosphorylation by MEK of this family of MAPKs dramatically increases their activity, resulting in phosphorylation of further downstream targets including p90rsk (15Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), as well as translocation to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors involved in immediate/early gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 16Su B.

Two recently developed inhibitors of MEK1, PD98059 (18Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) and MEK1/2, U0126 (19Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar), have been extensively characterized, and shown to be highly selective in their inhibition of the MAPK pathway. One Bcl-2 family member shown recently to be a target of cytokine-stimulated signaling is Bad (20Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Induction of Bad phosphorylation on multiple serine residues influences its subcellular distribution, from an association with Bcl-xL at the mitochondria, to a cytosolic location, associated with 14-3-3 (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). The association of Bad with Bcl-xL is mediated through dimerization of conserved BH3 domains (22Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), characteristic for other BH3 domain containing proteins. Phosphorylation of residues in proximity to the BH3 domain of Bad may alter the affinity of Bad for Bcl-xL, promoting dissociation. This may relieve Bcl-xL of some negative influence, allowing protection of cells from apoptosis. The specific residues on Bad phosphorylated in response to survival factors are serine 112 and serine 136 (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Mutation of either of these residues to alanine potentiates death following transient transfection with Bad, suggesting that both are critical in the disruption of Bad-Bcl-xL heterodimers. Dephosphorylation of Bad by specific phosphatases, such as calcineurin, reverses the cycle back to an unphosphorylated, death-promoting agonist during Ca+2-induced apoptosis (24Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Bad occurs by unknown, cytokine-stimulated pathways. Besides cytokines, many other receptors for growth and survival factors can activate pathways leading to phosphorylation of Bad, including the receptors for epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and Stem cell factor (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 25del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this respect, oncogenes involved in the signal transduction of each of these receptors may bypass the requirement for extracellular stimuli to maintain protection from apoptosis, in part by increasing Bad phosphorylation. Therefore, the detailing of specific signaling pathways involved in the regulation of Bad is critical in our understanding of oncogenesis. In our previous report, we showed that the mobility shift of Bad, indicative of phosphorylation, could be blocked by a MEK inhibitor, PD 98059 (27Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This lead us to perform a careful analysis of Bad phosphorylation following MEK inhibition. Here we show that Bad is targeted on serine 112 by a MEK-dependent pathway, whereas phosphorylation of two other residues occurs in a MEK-independent manner. Serine 112 phosphorylation was found to be required for dissociation of Bad from Bcl-xL. These results demonstrate for the first time the involvement of a Ras-controlled signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation of a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member in mammalian cells. This ultimately may lead to better therapies designed to exploit the apoptosis machinery during diseases such as cancer. Antibodies to Bad and Bcl-xL were from Transduction Laboratories (B36420 and B22630, Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-943, La Jolla, CA). Anti-phosphoSer112 Bad (9291), anti-phospho-MAPK (9106), and anti-phospho-PKB (9270) antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PD98059 was from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Recombinant murine GM-CSF and IL-3 were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Synthetic IL-4 was a gift from Dr. James Wieler (Universtiy of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). GM-CSF and IL-3 were used at 50 ng/ml, and IL-4 was used at 10 μg/ml. These concentrations of cytokines were shown previously to induce maximal increases in tyrosine phosphorylation. Synthetic phosphopeptides containing Ser112 and Ser136were a kind gift from Dr. Ian Clark-Lewis (Universtiy of British Columbia). Phosphoamino acids were purchased from Sigma. MC/9 or FD-CP1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. Cells were starved of cytokine by overnight incubation in medium in which 90% of the culture volume was replaced with RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum but without added WEHI-3 conditioned medium. Alternatively, cells were washed three times and incubated in IL-3-free medium for at least 4 h prior to use in the experiment. For determining the electrophoretic mobility shift of Bad, MC/9 or FD-CP1 cells stimulated under various conditions were lysed with ice-cold solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa3MoO4, 1 μg/ml microcystin-LR, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 1 min), and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. 2 μg of anti-Bad monoclonal antibody (B36420; Transduction Laboratories) was added, and the samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Bad immunocomplexes were captured with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with fresh solubilization buffer and resuspended in 1× reducing sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were fractionated in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel with a 118:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 3% skim milk solution for 1 h and then incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-Bad antibody (either SC-943 from Santa Cruz or B36420 from Transduction Laboratories) overnight at room temperature. Primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. These same immunoprecipitating and blotting conditions were used to detect Bad co-immunoprecipitation with Bcl-xL, with the following exceptions. In these experiments, 2 μg of anti-Bcl-xLantibody were added for 1 h at 4 °C and captured for an additional hour with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed and fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described above. MC/9 cells were starved of cytokine as described above, washed in phosphate-free medium, and then placed in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium buffered with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 1 mCi/ml 32P-labeled orthophosphate at 37 °C for 2 h. Bad was immunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized lysates as described above. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated on a 12.5% gel with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 118:1 and dried under heat and vacuum. 32P-Labeled Bad was detected by autoradiography and quantified by either excision from the gel followed by liquid scintillation counting or by using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). 32P metabolically labeled Bad from various conditions and isolated as described above was excised from the gel and digested with 10 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 50 mm(NH4)HCO3, pH 7.8, overnight at 37 °C. Gel fragments were pelleted by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and dried under vacuum. Peptides were washed with diminishing volumes of water and resuspended in 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer (1% (NH4)2CO3, pH 8.8). Electrophoresis was performed on 200-μm microcrystalline cellulose plates (Kodak) at 600 V, 7 °C for 45 min. The plates were chromatographed in the second dimension in chromatography buffer (n-butanol/pyridine/ acetic acid/water, 32.5:25:5:20). Plates were dried, and phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. In earlier experiments, two sided Kodak BioMS film with intensifying screens was used, but a sharper image was obtained using single sided Kodak BioMR film without intensifying screens. If cold synthetic phosphopeptides were also run, these were visualized with ninhydrin staining. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by scraping the visualized phosphopeptides into glass reaction vessels, and treatment with 500 μl of 6 n HCl heated to 105 °C for 60 min. The HCl was removed under vacuum, and the phosphoamino acids were washed with diminishing volumes of water. Separation was performed on cellulose plates using buffer consisting of 0.5% pyridine and 5% acetic acid at 1000 V, 10 °C for 45 min.32P-Labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. In each of the samples, a 1 μg of a mixture of phospho-l-serine, phospho-l-threonine, and phospho-l-tyrosine was also added that was visualized by ninhydrin staining. To examine the phosphorylation of Bad in detail, we first performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Bad isolated from 32P-labeled cell stimulated with phorbol esters, a general kinase activator, produced a two-dimensional map of numerous labeled phosphopeptides (Fig. 1 A). Two of the observed phosphopeptides co-migrated exactly with synthetic tryptic peptides containing phosphorylated Ser112 and Ser136 (Fig. 1 B). We next stimulated cells with GM-CSF. Compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 C), GM-CSF caused an increase in phosphorylation of two residues distinct from either Ser112 or Ser136, as well as the appearance of a third phosphopeptide corresponding to the phospho-Ser112-containing peptide (Fig. 1 D). Unlike stimulation with phorbol esters, we were unable to detect Ser136 phosphorylation following GM-CSF stimulation. Identical results were obtained when cells were stimulated with IL-3 or Stem cell factor (data not shown). The three phosphopeptides, including the one containing Ser112, were isolated and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis, which demonstrated exclusive serine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 E). Our previous studies have shown that Bad phosphorylation induced by the hemopoietic cytokines IL-3 and GM-CSF is dependent upon MEK activation (27Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This set of experiments monitored the mobility shift of Bad on SDS-PAGE, a phenomenon common to phosphorylated proteins. To further characterize the phosphorylation of Bad downstream of cytokine receptors, Bad isolated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells was examined following treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 (Fig.2 A). Treatment with this compound significantly reduced the ability of GM-CSF or IL-3 to induce Bad phosphorylation compared with unstimulated cells, but it did not completely abrogate phosphorylation. As further evidence for MEK as an upstream regulator of Bad phosphorylation, a second, unrelated inhibitor of MEK was employed. Treatment of cells with U0126 (19Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) also partially reduced the phosphorylation of Bad induced by GM-CSF (Fig.2 B). We also tested the effect of raising intracellular cAMP levels with forskolin to activate PKA, because Bad can be phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that forskolin induces a large increase in cAMP in MC/9 cells, as well as promoting CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 in a PKA-dependent manner (49Scheid M.P. Foltz I.N. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. Duronio V. Blood. 1999; 93: 217-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, forskolin increased Bad phosphorylation measured by 32P labeling only slightly compared with GM-CSF. In contrast to GM-CSF stimulation, inhibition of MEK did not inhibit the slight increase in Bad phosphorylation promoted by forskolin. MEK-dependent Bad phosphorylation was also observed in another cell line, FD-CP1 (Fig. 2 C). In these cells, both PD 98059 and U0126 effectively reduced the phosphorylation of Bad, which matched exactly the reduction in phosphorylation of p42erk2. We next asked which sites of phosphorylation were downstream of MEK. Cells were metabolically labeled with 32P and pretreated with PD98059, followed by stimulation with GM-CSF. The32P-labeled Bad was digested by trypsin and separated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. In the absence of MEK activity, the Ser112 phosphorylation was abolished, whereas the other two phosphopeptides were not affected significantly (Fig.3 A). The Ser112phosphopeptide has more than one potential phosphorylation site (two serines and a threonine), and so to demonstrate conclusively that Ser112 was undergoing MEK-dependent phosphorylation, we utilized a phospho-Ser112-specific antibody. Cells pretreated with PD 98059 or U0126 and then stimulated with cytokines revealed a complete reduction in Bad Ser112phosphorylation to unstimulated levels (Fig. 3, B andC). Also, manual Edman degradation was performed on this peptide isolated from the tryptic maps and demonstrated that the third residue (Ser112) contained a radioactive phosphate (data not shown). Together these results indicated that the principle phosphorylated site downstream of MEK was Ser112 and that MEK activation by cytokines is necessary for Ser112phosphorylation. Having established the role of MEK in Bad phosphorylation, we asked whether MEK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser112 was important for disrupting Bad-Bcl-xL heterodimerization. During apoptosis, Bad heterodimerization may play a significant role in promoting the death signal by inactivating Bcl-xL (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 23Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In our model, a significant fraction of Bad co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL from cells that had been deprived of cytokine for 8 h, demonstrating the physical interaction of these two proteins during the early stages of apoptosis (Fig.4 A). Stimulation with GM-CSF for 5, 10, or 20 min resulted in an immediate and dramatic loss of Bad-Bcl-xL association, consistent with phosphorylation-induced dissociation. To test whether Ser112 phosphorylation was essential for this dissociation, cells were stimulated with GM-CSF for 5 min while in the presence of U0126. Blocking the activation of MEK completely restored Bad-Bcl-xL association to levels equivalent to unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 A). In another experiment, similar conditions were tested as well as another hemopoietic factor, IL-4, which has been shown previously to activate PKB (27Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) but not Ras or MAPK (29Welham M.J. Duronio V. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1683-1693PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a requirement for MEK-MAPK activation, IL-4 was unable to promote dissociation between Bad and Bcl-xL (Fig.4 B). In each of these experiments, we examined the activation state of both MAPK and PKB using phospho-specific antibodies. Both GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulated PKB Ser473phosphorylation in a MEK-independent manner, consistent with our earlier findings that these cytokines activate PKB (27Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, only under conditions of MAPK activation was there a decrease in the association of Bad with Bcl-xL. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MEK- but not PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Bad is critical for the ability of cytokines to promote the dissociation of Bad-Bcl-xL dimers. This study demonstrates the phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 family member Bad by the MEK-MAPK pathway on a single residue, Ser112. This phosphorylation was found to be essential for Bad dissociation from Bcl-xL, providing an important link between growth and survival signaling pathways and protection from apoptosis. Because MEK has so far only been shown to phosphorylate and activate p44erk1 and p42erk2, it is likely that these kinases are also involved in Bad Ser112 phosphorylation. The Erks cannot phosphorylate Bad at Ser112 in vitro (data not shown), and the site surrounding Ser112 does not conform to the consensus phosphorylation site for these enzymes (30Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Downstream targets of the Erks include p90rsk (15Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and it is likely that one of these serine kinases is responsible for Bad phosphorylation on Ser112. The unique properties of MEK has allowed the development of two cell-permeable drugs that potently block the activation of the Erks, PD 98059 (2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one; Ref. 18Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) and U0126 (1, 4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1, 4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene; Ref. 19Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J.

For example, U0126 has been shown not to inhibit molecules such as protein kinase C, Raf, MEKK, Erk, JNK, MKK3, 4, and 6, and Cdk2 and 4. Except for MEK1, PD 98059 displays no inhibitory actions toward 18 known serine/threonine kinases (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical pathways activated by cytokines to protect apoptosis are not yet fully understood, recent work has illustrated the importance of PI3K-dependent activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt (28Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). PKB has also been shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 (26Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenburg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 40Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the in vitro rate of phosphorylation is much slower when compared with another PKB target, FKHR (34Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the degree of phosphorylation of Bad in vivo on serine 136 by PKB may be dependent upon the degree of expression of Bad. For example, del Pesoet al. (25del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylation of expressed Bad was entirely blocked by PI3K inhibitors, indicating that Bad was phosphorylated to the greatest degree on PKB-targeted residues. Datta (26Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenburg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar) and Blume-Jensen (40Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed in different systems that expressed Bad was only partially blocked by PI3K inhibitors or dominant negative PKB constructs, isolated to serine 136, demonstrating that other sites were targeted by PI3K-independent pathways. These later studies were consistent with the original report by Zha and co-workers (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that phosphorylation of expressed Bad induced by IL-3 occurred primarily on serine 136 and serine 112. Our recent study has suggested that PI3K-dependent PKB activation does not lead to the phosphorylation of Bad (27Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This is based on the finding that IL-4 can activate PI3K and PKB but does not promote Bad phosphorylation. Also, GM-CSF-stimulated Bad phosphorylation occurs independently of PI3K and PKB. Similar findings have recently been reported in several other cell types (41Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with our earlier report, two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis revealed that cytokine-stimulated Bad phosphorylation occurs primarily at serine 112 as well as at two additional residues. Serine 136 phosphorylation was not detected but could be observed following stimulation with phorbol esters, a nonphysiological kinase activator. Our data thus raise the question of whether serine 136 phosphorylation is physiologically important. A significant body of published work would suggest that it is. For example, expression of mutant Bad in which Ser136 has been mutated to alanine potentiates apoptosis, arguing that the inability of PKB to phosphorylate this altered residue promotes association with Bcl-xL, thus leading to cell death (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 26Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenburg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 40Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our studies here with endogenous Bad argue that Bad-Bcl-xL association is disrupted independently of Ser136 phosphorylation. Rather, dissociation is primarily dependent upon the phosphorylation state of Ser112. Loss of Ser112 phosphorylation, through inhibition of MEK, fully restores the association of Bad with Bcl-xL, even in the presence of PI3K and PKB activation. It is currently unclear whether association of Bad with 14-3-3 proteins requires Ser136 phosphorylation or whether phosphorylation at Ser112 or the other sites we have detected are sufficient. It also remains a possibility that Bad mediates anti-apoptotic signaling through its interaction with 14-3-3 molecules, via Ser136 phosphorylation, and independent of Bcl-xL interaction, but this appears not to be a dominant pathway in our model. Efforts in our laboratory are currently underway to resolve this issue. Treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors caused a slow but gradual appearance of nonviable cells (data not shown). The induction of cell death was considerably slower than following removal of a survival factor, indicating that inhibiting Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 does not promote apoptosis at the same rate as cytokine-withdrawal. However, we may not expect them to be the same, for several reasons. Bad phosphorylation by cytokines probably is not the only mechanism in place to protect cells from apoptosis. As well, phosphorylation of Bad on the other residues besides Ser112may also provide protection, although we have shown here that this is independent of association with Bcl-xL. For example, there may also be additional proteins that interact with Bad dependent upon phosphorylation at these other residues. Finally, cell death induced by MEK inhibition may be through mechanisms completely independent of Bad phosphorylation. Our current results cannot distinguish between these various possibilities. Cytokines may be able to activate survival pathways that operate independently of Bad phosphorylation. This seems likely, because IL-4 is unable to promote Ser112 phosphorylation or prevent Bad association with Bcl-xL, but it can protect cells from apoptosis by activating PI3K (42Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism may be the phosphorylation of caspase-9 by PKB in a PI3K-dependent manner (35Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvensen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with findings by Parrizas and co-workers (43Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), who showed that MEK inhibition on its own could not induce apoptosis in insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated PC12 cells but resulted in synergistic apoptosis when PI3K was also inhibited. Therefore, cell survival may be regulated by multiple signaling pathways, at the level of the mitochondria by the Ras-MAPK pathway (Bad phosphorylation), as well as downstream targets involved in the execution of apoptosis by the PI3K/PKB pathway. This possibility would also explain why under some circumstances PI3K inhibition does not always lead to cell death, and it will be critical to test whether under these conditions Bad phosphorylation by MEK plays an important role. PKA has also recently been proposed to catalyze phosphorylation of Ser112, in a cAMP-dependent manner, offering an explanation for the survival-promoting effects of cAMP in some cell types (44Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This observation is complicated by the recent finding that cAMP can activate the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Epac, independently of PKA (45de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Epac in turn can activate Rap1, a small G-protein similar to Ras located at internal membranes, which may stimulate components upstream of MAPK, including B-Raf (46York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In different cell types, forskolin can both activate and attenuate MAPK activity (47Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 48Weissinger E.M. Eissner G. Grammer C. Fackler S. Haefner B. Yoon L.S. Lu K.S. Bazarov A. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3229-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), possibly because of the level of expression and degree of cross-talk between Rap1 and other signaling molecules, including PKA, MEKK, and Raf. In our model, we have previously reported that forskolin treatment slightly attenuates p44erk1activation, potently induces CREB phosphorylation, and suppresses apoptosis induced by PI3K inhibition, ceramide treatment, or cytokine withdrawal (49Scheid M.P. Foltz I.N. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. Duronio V. Blood. 1999; 93: 217-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, forskolin could only slightly promote Bad phosphorylation, which was independent of MEK activity. In addition, we have previously been unable to detect any rise in cAMP levels following stimulation with cytokines (49Scheid M.P. Foltz I.N. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. Duronio V. Blood. 1999; 93: 217-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that PKA activation by adenylate cyclase-generated cAMP is not the principle means for Bad phosphorylation on Ser112 and suggest that Bad phosphorylation is not a major route for cAMP-promoted survival. Hinton and Welham (41Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar) have recently described the phosphorylation of Bad Ser112 in a PI3K-dependent manner. In the factor-dependent cell lines used, LY-294002 abolished Ser112 phosphorylation in response to IL-3. The requirement for PI3K upstream of MAPK is controversial, based on the apparent cell type-specific inhibition of MAPK by wortmannin, which may be through targets other than PI3K (50Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18134-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, recent studies (51Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 52Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the inhibitory actions of both wortmannin and LY294002 on MAPK at low agonist concentrations. Although the role that PI3K plays upstream of MAPK requires further investigation, in light of these findings and in context with our results here, it is likely that inhibition of Bad Ser112 phosphorylation by LY-294002 is through inhibition of the MAPK pathway and not PKB. In summary, our results have described the role of the MEK-MAPK pathway in the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. This may form one of several survival pathways activated by cytokines that together support the survival of mammalian cells. Our data suggest that additional pathways, possibly PI3K-mediated, can compensate for increased Bad association with Bcl-xL. Therapies designed to target elements of these pathways may be useful in the treatment of diseases characterized by inappropriate cell survival.

We showed recently that VEGF effect on vascular permeability was dependent on the synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by EC. Consequently, we sought to evaluate by antisense knockdown of gene expression the contribution of VEGF receptors (Flt-1 and Flk-1) on these events. VEGF (10(-11) to 10(-8) M) elicited a dose-dependent increase of bovine aortic EC proliferation, migration, and PAF synthesis by up to 2.05-, 1.31- and 35.9-fold above basal levels, respectively. A treatment with two modified antisense oligomers (1-5 x 10(-7) M) directed against Flk-1 mRNA blocked by 100, 91, and 85% the proliferation, migration, and PAF synthesis mediated by VEGF, respectively. A treatment with two antisense oligomers directed against Flt-1 mRNA failed to modulate these activities. The use of placenta growth factor (up to 10(-8) M), an Flt-1-specific agonist, induced only a slight increase (0.6-fold) of PAF synthesis. These data illustrate the crucial role of Flk-1 in EC stimulation by VEGF. The capacity to inhibit the protein synthesis of Flt-1 and Flk-1 by antisense oligonucleotides provides a new approach to block VEGF pathological effects in vivo."

Both native and recombinant 5-HT3 receptors reveal rapid and cooperative activation by agonists and desensitization to prolonged application of 5-HT (reviewed in Refs. 1Jackson M.B. Yakel J.L. Annu.

With a few exceptions, ligand-gated channels require the association of more than one kind of homologous subunit for function, and subunit composition determines the pharmacological (18Luetje C.W.

While the 5-HT3Asubunit expressed in heterologous systems functions efficiently as homomers, different voltage-dependence, desensitization, and pharmacological properties between recombinant and native 5-HT3 receptors suggest that native 5-HT3receptors may exist as heteromers (3Fletcher S.

Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) cannot completely account for the differences observed between recombinant homomers and native 5-HT3 receptors. In fact, co-expression of both splice variants in oocytes could not reproduce the responses observed in the cell line from which the splice variants were cloned (22Van Hooft J.A. Kreikamp A.P. Vijverberg H.P.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies on porcine brain have revealed the existence of at least four proteins (52–71 kDa) closely associated with the 5-HT3A subunit that may represent antigenically distinct channel subunits (33Fletcher S. Barnes N.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cloning of a 5-HT3B subunit that modified the pharmacological and single channel characteristics of the 5-HT3A subunit when co-expressed in heterologous expression systems was recently reported (34Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We extend this report and provide evidence for the co-existence of both 5-HT3B and 5-HT3A receptor subunits in native cells, a requirement for heteromeric association. We show that 5-HT3B has no effect on the function of α2β2, α3β4, α4β2, and α7 nicotinic ACh receptors. Furthermore, the characterization of the pharmacology and function of heteromeric receptors in Xenopus oocyte and mammalian expression systems reported here differs from that described (34Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and these differences have important consequences for the function of heteromers in vivo. The amino acid sequence of the 5-HT3A receptor sequence (accession no. P46098) was used as a query in a tblastn search of the publicly available human genomic sequence data base (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). From this search, a related sequence to the 5-HT3A receptor (subsequently called 5-HT3B) was found (accession no. AC002290). To obtain a full-length sequence, a human small intestine size-selected cDNA library was constructed in pSPORT as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the addition of size selection of cDNAs to >2 kilobase pairs. To screen the subsequent library, a ∼400-base pair fragment was amplified with specific PCR primers (GATCTCCCTACCTCTAAGTG; AGCACACTGGTCTTGAACAC) to exonic sequences within the genomic sequence using cDNA synthesized from poly(A) RNA extracted from human small intestine. The ∼400-base pair fragment was subsequently radiolabeled and used to screen ∼500,000 recombinants from the constructed cDNA library by standard molecular biology methods (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A single positive clone was obtained and subsequently sequenced by a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and determined to be full-length. The Sequencher program (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) was used for removal of vector sequences and general sequence analyses. The full-length 5-HT3B receptor was subsequently cloned into pGEM HE and pcDNA3.1zeo(+) (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for functional expression inXenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells, respectively. HEK293 cells stably expressing p5HT3A (accession no. D49394) in pCINeo (Promega) were screened for expression using Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in conjunction with a FLIPR™ system (Molecular Devices, FL-101, Sunnyvale, CA). The clone revealing the most robust influx of Ca2+ upon application of 5-HT was used for all subsequent studies (5-HT3A/HEK). This line was stably transfected with p5HT3B in pcDNA3.1zeo(+) (5-HT3B/5-HT3A/HEK), and individual clones were maintained under selection (neomycin (500 μg/ml), zeocin (200 μg/ml)). Transfected cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson catalog no. 354640) and grown for at least three days to confluency. Cells were rinsed with F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated in Fluo-4 (2 μm; Molecular Probes) with pluronic acid (0.04%; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature, and assayed using the FLIPR. Cells were challenged with agonists (at 3-fold concentration in 40 μl added to 80 μl at a velocity of 50 μl/s), and the fluorescence intensity was captured every second for the first 2 min following agonist addition, with additional readings every 2 s for 1 min. For antagonist experiments, agonist was added in the presence of antagonist at the indicated concentrations after a 2-min preincubation. The saline used for these experiments contained 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Xenopus laevisoocytes were prepared and injected using standard methods (37Fraser S.P. Moon C. Djamgoz M.B.A. Wallis D. Electrophysiology. IRL, Oxford1993: 65-86Google Scholar). Ovarian lobes dissected from adult female X. laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were shipped on ice overnight, defolliculated in 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type 1, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) in nominally Ca2+-free saline. Selected oocytes were maintained in ND-96 (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.0) for 2–24 h before injection. For in vitro transcription, pGEM HE (38Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) containing 5-HT3A or 5-HT3B cDNA was linearized with NheI and transcribed for 2 h at 37 °C with T7 RNA polymerase (T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE; Ambion) in the presence of the cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G. cRNA was quantified using formaldehyde gels against RNA markers (Life Technologies). Oocytes were injected using a 10μl microdispensor (catalog no. 53506-100; VWR Scientific) with 50 nl of 5-HT3A receptor cRNA with or without the 5-HT3B cRNA (0.33 and 0.0033–3.3 ng each) or 5-HT3B (3.3 ng) together with human nicotinic ACh receptor subunits (0.2 ng of α2β2, 0.25 ng of α3β4, 0.2 ng of α4β2, 0.5 ng of α7). Control oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water. Injected oocytes were maintained in 48-well cell culture clusters (Costar; Cambridge, MA) at 18 °C up to 14 days in ND96. Whole cell agonist-induced currents were measured with a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp (GeneClamp500, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Recording microelectrodes were filled with 3 mKCl and had resistances of 1 and 2 megaohms. Cells were maintained in a 600-μl volume bath and continuously perfused at 10 ml/min at room temperature. The membrane voltage was clamped at -70 mV unless otherwise indicated. Responses of 5-HT3A-injected oocytes to agonists were measured in either Ca2+-containing saline (Ca2+-SOS; equivalent to ND-96 without gentamicin) or Ba2+-containing saline (Ba2+-SOS; Ba2+ replaced Ca2+, with or without 1 mm EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca2+). While most of the oocytes injected with 5-HT3A responded to 5-HT with prolonged responses in the continued presence of agonist (see “Results”), a minority (<30%) of oocyte batches responded to 5-HT with an ultrafast decay component (data not shown). The t80 of responses to 10 μm 5-HT was ∼10-fold faster (p < 5e −5) and the time to peak of the response to 5-HT (10 μm) was 3.4-fold shorter (p < 0.05) in these oocytes compared with the oocytes described in this report. The modulation of 5-HT3Areceptors expressed in oocytes by 5-HT3B was similar with the exception of its effect on decay kinetics. The effect of 5-HT3B was to shorten the long lasting responses of the majority of oocytes and lengthen the short responses to an identical intermediate value. The decay constant τ for heteromers was significantly slower than that of homomeric responses under identical conditions (p < 5e −6). Thus, 5-HT3B had opposite effects on the decay of responses from the two populations of oocytes. For clarity, only data for the majority of oocytes are described. It is not immediately apparent why oocyte batches fell into two populations with regard to the kinetics of desensitization to 5-HT. However, if similar populations of responses are observed in mammalian cells, it may account for the less robust effects of 5-HT3B co-expression on Ca2+ influx in populations of cells compared with single oocytes. The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (39Hamill O. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) was used to record ligand-induced currents from 5-HT3A/HEK or 5-HT3B/5-HT3A/HEK cells lacking visible association with other cells maintained >2 days on 12-mm uncoated glass coverslips. During recordings, cells were visualized using a Nikon Diaphot 300 with DIC Nomarski optics and continuously perfused in a physiological saline (∼0.5 ml/min) consisting of 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm hemi-Na-HEPES (pH 7.3, 295–300 mosmas measured using a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT)). Recording electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate capillary tubing (R6; Garner Glass, Claremont, CA). The tips were coated with dental periphery wax (Miles Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and had resistances of 0.6–1 megaohms when containing intracellular saline (100 mm potassium gluconate, 25 mm KCl, 0.483 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm hemi-Na-HEPES, and 1 mmK4-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrapotassium salt (100 nm free Ca2+); pH 7.4, 290 mosm). Unless indicated, all voltages shown are corrected for a liquid junction potential of −18 mV. Series resistances were <2 megaohms and generally not compensated. Current and voltage signals were detected and filtered at 2 kHz with an Axopatch 1D patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), digitally recorded with a DigiData 1200B laboratory interface (Axon Instruments) and PC-compatible computer system, and stored on magnetic disc for off-line analysis. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with PClamp7 software. Slow changes in holding current were simultaneously detected and filtered at 2 kHz, recorded with an LPF 202A DC amplifier (Warner, Hamden, CT) and VR-10B digital data recorder (Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) onto video tape, and later analyzed at 10 Hz. Apparent reversal potentials (V rev) of ligand-induced conductance changes were determined using a voltage-ramp protocol (40Dubin A.E. Bahnson T. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage ramps were applied between −100 and +100 mV from a holding potential of −68 mV at a rate of 1 mV/ms every 1 s. The tissue distribution of 5-HT3BmRNAs was determined by semiquantitative PCR. A primer set specific to 5-HT3B (TGTGTTCAAGACCAGTGTGC; TAGCTTTGGAAGAGCAGTCG) was used to complete amplification of a portion of the 5-HT3B mRNA via PCR using cDNA templates synthesized from poly(A) RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) that was extracted from various human tissues (see legend to Fig. 7). Products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and detected using a labeled oligonucleotide (TGTTGGTCAAATTCCTCCATGATGAGCAGCGTGGTGGACA). RT-PCR ISH was performed as described previously (41Nuovo G. PCR in Situ Hybridization: Protocols and Applications. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 271-333Google Scholar) on normal human and monkey tissues using specific primer sets to 5-HT3B (5′-TGTGTTCAAGACCAGTGTGC; 3′-TAGCTTTGGAAGAGCAGTCG) and 5-HT3A(5′-CAGAGGATTTCTGCTCAGGC; 3′-CCTCGTACAGAGTTATCAGG). Negative control plasmid sequencing primer sets included 5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′, and 5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′. Briefly, with the exception of monkey amygdala, formalin-fixed tissues (Analytical Biological Services, Inc., Wilmington, DE) were paraffin-embedded, cut (5 μm) onto Plus Superfrost slides (Fisher). These and normal human checkerboard tissue slides (Dako, Carperturia, CA) were dried, dewaxed, and hydrated. Fresh frozen Macaque amygdala was sectioned at 10 μm on a cryostat, fixed, and frozen. Tissues were digested in 2 mg/ml pepsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, dehydrated, and air-dried. All tissues (with the exception of positive controls) were treated with 1 unit/μl DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight. Slides were placed in aluminum boats (41Nuovo G. PCR in Situ Hybridization: Protocols and Applications. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 271-333Google Scholar) on the heating block of a model 480 DNA Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler programmed for 30-min cDNA synthesis at 65 °C, denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, and then 20 cycles of amplification at 60 °C for 90 s and 94 °C for 1 min. Ten μl of probe mixture (containing reagents of the GeneAmp Kit (Perkin-Elmer), 1 mmdigoxygenin dUTP, 40 units of RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2% bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm primers) was added to the tissue and incubated under a fastened coverslip. The presence of reaction product was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxygenin antibody (1:200; Life Technologies) and nitro blue tetrazolium bromochloroindolyl phosphate (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red (Polyscientific, Bay Shore, NY). Sections were visualized under a BX-50 Olympus light microscope and photographed (Fig. 8) or captured electronically using a Sony 3CCD camera using Image Pro software (Fig.9; Phase 3 Imaging Systems, Glen Mills, PA).Figure 9Co-localization of 5-HT3B and 5-HT3A transcripts in neurons in the monkey amygdala was detected using RT-PCR ISH. Seven neuronal cells (arrowheads) from the lateral amygdala express both 5-HT3A (a and c) and 5-HT3B (b and d) mRNA. Not all cells were labeled by the RT-PCR ISH technique. Fast red nuclear staining is observed only in cells negative for either 5-HT3A or 5-HT3B expression. Anasterisk marks a vessel as reference in the serial sections.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using a standard Ficoll gradient from 1 unit of blood from each of five normal human donors. Monocytes (CD14+) were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive selection and magnetic bead technology, and total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Total RNA from normal human ascending and descending colon (CDP-061068; lot 8906066; CDP-061069; lot 8906067; BioChain Institute, Inc.) and 5 μg of each poly(A) RNA from normal human small intestine and spleen (6547-1; lot 7050565; 6547-1; lot 7050565;CLONTECH) were amplified without further treatment and labeled with cy3-dCTP. The labeled material was hybridized to DNA chips including 5-HT3B and 5-HT3Asequences. Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. unless indicated. Ca2+ influx peak values were determined by subtracting minimum from maximum values during the agonist exposure. EC50, IC50, and slope values for dose-response data were determined using the Hill equation (sigmoidal dose response with variable slope) using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). 5-HT, mCPBG, 1-PBG, 2-methyl-5-HT (2-Me-5-HT), quipazine dimaleate, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (mCPP), ketanserine tartrate, LY-278,584 maleate, DA, tropisetron, histamine, tryptophan, norepinephrine, octopamine, homovanillic acid, tryptophol, α-methyl serotonin, glycine, GABA, 5-hydroxyindole, γ-hydroxybutyrate, cis-4-aminocrotonic acid, agmatine, d-cycloserine,N-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-aspartyl-l-glutamic acid,S-α-histamine, N-α-methyl histamine, melatonin, N-acetyl serotonin, (±)-epibatidine-2HCl, and tropisetron (3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate HCl) were purchased from RBI.

Bacterial alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Life Technologies. Y-25130 (N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide monohydrochloride) was purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc. (Ballwin, MO). The nucleotide sequence of 5-HT3B revealed a single large open reading frame of 1326-base pair and 5′- and 3′-untranslated extensions of 141 and about 456 nucleotides. The first in-frame methionine was designated as the initiation codon for an open reading frame that predicts a 5-HT3B protein with 441 amino acids and an estimated molecular mass of about 50.3 kDa. The protein contained hydrophobic amino-terminal residues with sequences highly predictive of signal cleavage sites that would result in a mature protein initiating at amino acid 22 (SignalP). The predicted 5-HT3B protein was aligned with nucleotide and protein data bases and found to be related to known 5-HT3A receptors, revealing about 44% identical and approximately 70% highly conserved amino acids compared with the human 5-HT3A subunit. The identity of the 5-HT3B receptor with the 5-HT3A receptor at the nucleotide level was only about 60%. Hydropathy analysis of the amino acid sequence predicted the presence of four putative transmembrane domains (M1–M4) with similar spanning as that predicted for the 5-HT3A subunit (not shown). The coding sequence reported here is identical to the sequence reported by Davies et al.(34Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted 5-HT3B protein contains many of the features of the proposed ligand binding sites of ligand-gated receptors (2Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Hope A.G. North R.

https://openalex.org/W2046844598,"The G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 serves as the primary coreceptor for entry of T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus. CXCR4 undergoes tonic internalization as well as internalization in response to stimulation with phorbol esters and ligand (SDF-1α). We investigated the trafficking of this receptor, and we attempted to define the residues of CXCR4 that were critical for receptor internalization. In both COS-1 and HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing CXCR4, SDF-1α and phorbol esters (PMA) promoted rapid internalization of cell surface receptors as assessed by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence analysis. Expression of GRK2 and/or arrestins promoted modest additional CXCR4 internalization in response to both PMA and SDF. Both PMA- and SDF-mediated CXCR4 internalization was inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative mutants of dynamin-1 and arrestin-3. Arrestin was also recruited to the plasma membrane and appeared to colocalize with internalized receptors in response to SDF but not PMA. We then evaluated the ability of CXCR4 receptors containing mutations of serines and threonines, as well as a dileucine motif, within the C-terminal tail to be internalized and phosphorylated in response to either PMA or SDF-1α. This analysis showed that multiple residues within the CXCR4 C-terminal tail appear to mediate both PMA- and SDF-1α-mediated receptor internalization. The ability of coexpressed GRK2 and arrestins to promote internalization of the CXCR4 mutants revealed distinct differences between respective mutants and suggested that the integrity of the dileucine motif (Ile-328 and Leu-329) and serines 324, 325, 338, and 339 are critical for receptor internalization. The G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 serves as the primary coreceptor for entry of T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus. CXCR4 undergoes tonic internalization as well as internalization in response to stimulation with phorbol esters and ligand (SDF-1α). We investigated the trafficking of this receptor, and we attempted to define the residues of CXCR4 that were critical for receptor internalization. In both COS-1 and HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing CXCR4, SDF-1α and phorbol esters (PMA) promoted rapid internalization of cell surface receptors as assessed by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence analysis. Expression of GRK2 and/or arrestins promoted modest additional CXCR4 internalization in response to both PMA and SDF. Both PMA- and SDF-mediated CXCR4 internalization was inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative mutants of dynamin-1 and arrestin-3. Arrestin was also recruited to the plasma membrane and appeared to colocalize with internalized receptors in response to SDF but not PMA. We then evaluated the ability of CXCR4 receptors containing mutations of serines and threonines, as well as a dileucine motif, within the C-terminal tail to be internalized and phosphorylated in response to either PMA or SDF-1α. This analysis showed that multiple residues within the CXCR4 C-terminal tail appear to mediate both PMA- and SDF-1α-mediated receptor internalization. The ability of coexpressed GRK2 and arrestins to promote internalization of the CXCR4 mutants revealed distinct differences between respective mutants and suggested that the integrity of the dileucine motif (Ile-328 and Leu-329) and serines 324, 325, 338, and 339 are critical for receptor internalization.

A small molecule agonist of CCR5, aminooxypentane-RANTES, has been reported to interfere with HIV binding to the receptor and also induces receptor internalization (40Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To date, this is the only chemokine receptor agonist that appears to be able to block HIV infectivity both by disruption of HIV-coreceptor interaction and by promotion of chemokine receptor internalization. In contrast to the interaction between HIV and coreceptors that occurs at the cell surface, far less is known regarding the mechanism of CXCR4 or CCR5 trafficking and signaling. An understanding of these mechanisms is needed in order to design effective HIV therapeutics directed against virus-chemokine receptor interactions or that promote clearance of cell surface coreceptors. Importantly, it must be ensured that such therapies do not inappropriately activate signaling pathways that induce activation or replication of existing virus in latently infected cells (29Kinter A. Catanzaro A. Monaco J. Ruiz M. Justement J. Moir S. Arthos J. Oliva A. Ehler L. Mizell S. Jackson R. Ostrowski M. Hoxie J. Offord R. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11880-11885Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Internalization and desensitization of an ever-growing number of GPCRs has been shown to require phosphorylation of agonist-activated receptors by a family of proteins known as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This promotes binding of a second family of proteins called arrestins, which act as adaptors between the receptor and components of the endocytic machinery, such as AP-2 and clathrin, both major components of clathrin-coated pits (reviewed in Refs. 42Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and 43Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This process also promotes dissociation of the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins, thus terminating receptor signaling. From early endosomes, receptors may then be dephosphorylated and returned to the cell surface for another round of activation or enter a degradative pathway. The determinants for receptor phosphorylation and internalization of both CCR5 and CXCR4 appear to reside in the C-terminal tail (21Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 44Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The involvement of GRKs and arrestins in CCR5 internalization and desensitization has been reported (21Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and residues in the CCR5 C-tail that are phosphorylated in response to different CCR5 agonists have recently been identified (45Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to characterize better the mechanism of CXCR4 internalization, examine the role of GRKs and arrestins, and identify determinants in the CXCR4 C-tail that mediate receptor phosphorylation and internalization. We found that both phorbol ester and SDF-1α stimulation promoted CXCR4 internalization in a dynamin-dependent manner but that only SDF-1α-mediated internalization appeared to utilize an arrestin-dependent pathway. In contrast to the 7 serine and threonine residues in the CCR5 C-tail that may potentially be involved in receptor shut-off, CXCR4 contains 16 serine and threonine residues as well as a dileucine motif. Thus, we created a number of CXCR4 mutants to identify residues in the C-tail that mediate CXCR4 internalization and phosphorylation in response to either phorbol esters or SDF-1α stimulation. This analysis revealed that CXCR4 phosphorylation and internalization is mediated by multiple residues in the C-tail but that the dileucine motif and serines at positions 324, 325, 338, and 339 appear to be the most critical. Wild-type and mutant CXCR4 receptors were subcloned in-frame into pCDNA3 containing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the 5′ end constructed as described previously (46Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Wild-type CXCR4 was also expressed in the vector pSR1 (a gift from Robert Doms, University of Pennsylvania) with equivalent results. CXCR4 mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, using oligonucleotides up to 99 bases long. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI or EcoRI and XhoI and ligated with pCDNA3 cut with the same enzymes. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct orientation and to ensure that no undesired mutations were introduced. Constructs used to express arrestin-2, arrestin-3, GRK2, GRK2-K220R, dynamin-I-K44A, arrestin-3-(1–320), and arrestin-3-(284–409) have been previously described (47Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L.

COS-1 or HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and transfected with FuGene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Receptor internalization was measured as described previously (48Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected for 5 h and then split into 24-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The following day, cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, Alexis Corp.) or SDF-1α (Peprotech) for the times indicated. Medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Cells were washed three times with TBS and then blocked for 45 min with 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope (101R, Covance Biologicals) diluted 1:1000. Cells were washed three times, reblocked for 15 min, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma or Bio-Rad) diluted 1:1000. Cells were washed three times, and antibody binding was visualized by adding 0.25 ml of alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad). Development was stopped by removing 0.1 ml of the substrate to a 96-well microtiter plate containing 0.1 ml of 0.4 mNaOH. Plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) using Microplate Manager software. To assess redistribution of CXCR4 and arrestin in living cells, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of receptor and 0.25 μg of GFP-tagged arrestin-2. Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and mounted on an imaging chamber (Warner Instrument Corp.) equipped with an inlet port through which media and compounds could be perfused. For these studies, the medium used did not contain phenol red or antibiotics. Cell surface receptors were labeled at 4 °C by incubating cells with rhodamine-conjugated antibody directed against the HA epitope (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were examined by microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan Fluor 40 × 0.75 objective. Images were collected using QED Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop. For confocal microscopy, cells were prepared in the same manner, and images were obtained on a Bio-Rad MRC-Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal microscope (Hemmelholsteadt, UK) using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. HEK-293 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 μg of the indicated CXCR4 construct. 24 h later, cells were washed twice in serum and sodium phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in the same medium for 2 h. Cells were then labeled with 0.2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (NEN, 8500–9120 Ci/mmol) for 90 min. Cells were then stimulated with either 1 μm PMA or 100 nm SDF-1α for 10 min. The medium was removed, and cells were washed once with TBS and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Igepal CA-630, Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cells were then sonicated for 20 s using a Fisher model 550 sonic dismembrator. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was precleared by adding 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with gentle rocking for 1 h. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and receptors were immunoprecipitated by adding 4 μl of anti-HA polyclonal antibody (101C, Covance Biologicals) to the supernatant for 1–2 h. 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following day, immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Beads were resuspended in 25 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. We first determined the parameters for internalization of CXCR4 in response to both heterologous and homologous receptor stimuli. We used both COS-1 and HEK-293 cells for this analysis, since they have been shown to contain different amounts of GRKs and arrestins (50Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) which affect the extent of receptor internalization (50Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Specifically, COS-1 cells appear to contain lower amounts of endogenous GRKs and arrestins that result in inefficient receptor internalization (50Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To quantify rapidly the receptor internalization under a variety of conditions, we used an ELISA that measures the level of epitope-tagged cell surface receptors. Thus, internalization is detected as a decrease in cell surface receptor levels compared with non-agonist-treated controls. We first examined CXCR4 internalization in response to its natural agonist, SDF-1α. 100 nm SDF-1α promoted internalization of approximately 40% of cell surface CXCR4 receptors (Fig.1 A). This amount of internalization was achieved by 30 min and did not increase upon longer incubation times. SDF-1α promoted CXCR4 internalization in COS-1 cells with kinetics and magnitude nearly identical to that observed in HEK-293 cells. CXCR4 is also rapidly internalized in response to phorbol ester stimulation (52Signoret N. Oldridge J. Pelchen-Matthews A. Klasse P.J. Tran T. Brass L.F. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Holmes W.

Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, PMA stimulation of HEK-293 cells expressing CXCR4 resulted in internalization of 40–45% of surface receptors after 60 min. Internalization was first detected at 10 nm PMA and was maximal at 1 μm. Time course studies revealed that maximal receptor internalization occurred between 30 and 60 min after PMA addition, similar to the kinetics of SDF-1α-mediated internalization (data not shown). However, PMA-mediated internalization of CXCR4 was less efficient in COS-1 cells. Approximately 20–25% of cell surface CXCR4 was internalized in COS-1 cells in response to PMA (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of protein kinase C activity by treatment of cells with bisindolylmaleimide IX completely abrogated PMA-mediated internalization of CXCR4 but had no effect on SDF-1α-mediated internalization (Fig. 1 C). No effect was observed upon treatment of cells with bisindolylmaleimide V, an inactive analog of bisindolylmaleimide IX. Therefore, internalization of CXCR4 in response to PMA appears to be mediated by activation of protein kinase C, whereas protein kinase C activity is not required for CXCR4 internalization in response to SDF-1α. In contrast to CXCR4, internalization of CCR5 is not significantly promoted by phorbol ester and is relatively inefficient in response to stimulation by CCR5 ligands (21Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 53Signoret N. Rosenkilde M.M. Klasse P.J. Schwartz T.W. Malim M.H. Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare directly CXCR4 and CCR5 internalization, we examined internalization of CCR5 in response to PMA or RANTES stimulation in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, only 10–15% of surface CCR5 internalized in response to RANTES. RANTES-mediated CCR5 internalization was not promoted by coexpression of arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 and was modestly promoted by coexpression of GRK2. However, simultaneous overexpression of both arrestin-3 and GRK2 promoted CCR5 internalization in a synergistic manner. These results are similar to those obtained when CCR5 is stimulated by MIP-1β (21Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PMA stimulation of CCR5 also did not promote significant internalization and overexpression of GRK2 or arrestins did not promote internalization. However, overexpression of both GRK2 and arrestin-3 promoted a modest but significant increase in CCR5 internalization (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, our results indicate that CXCR4 and CCR5 have different requirements for internalization in the same cell type. These differences may result from different affinities of GRKs and arrestins for activated receptors. We next addressed the question of whether CXCR4 internalization was an arrestin- or dynamin-dependent process. We hypothesized that SDF-1α-mediated activation of CXCR4 would promote receptor phosphorylation by GRKs and recruitment of arrestin. However, PMA may mediate CXCR4 internalization via direct phosphorylation of CXCR4 by protein kinase C or through protein kinase C-mediated activation of GRK2 (54Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H.

We cotransfected HEK-293 cells with CXCR4 and dynamin-K44A, two different arrestin-3 dominant negative mutants and a dominant negative mutant of GRK2. Dynamin-K44A is deficient in GTP binding and functions to inhibit dynamin-mediated scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane (56Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Arrestin-3-(1–320) lacks the clathrin binding domain and thus appears to act by competing with wild-type arrestin for receptor binding. Conversely, arrestin-3-(284–4"

A class of small proteins (∼13–17 kDa), odorant-binding proteins (OBPs),1 is believed to facilitate the passage of hydrophobic odorant molecules from the environment to the surface of olfactory receptor neurons (1Kaissling K.-E.

These proteins are present in the sensillar lymph at an enormous 10–20 mm concentration (3Vogt R.G. Prestwich G.D. Blomquist G.J. Pheromone Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 385-431Google Scholar). In Lepidoptera, two classes of OBPs have been distinguished: one involved in the recognition of sex pheromones (pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs)) and another thought to participate in the recognition of general odorants (general odorant-binding proteins (GOBPs)) (4Vogt R.G. Prestwich G.D. Lerner M.R. J. Neurobiol. 1991; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Since the identification of the first such proteins in Antheraea polyphemus (5Vogt R.G. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1981; 293: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), homologous proteins have been detected and characterized in many species from several insect orders.

Sequences of lepidopteran PBPs are highly conserved, but their homology to GOBPs and OBPs from other insect orders is only moderate. The whole family, however, shows highly conserved motifs, among them the six cysteine residues thought to participate in formation of disulfide bonds (6Breer H. Krieger J. Raming K. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 735-740Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements and theoretical structure prediction have revealed that these proteins are in a large part α-helical (15Feng L. Prestwich G.D. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1997: 131-143Crossref Google Scholar). However, despite substantial efforts in the past several years, their three-dimensional structure remained elusive. Also, details of their function are still not fully understood. Although candidate pheromone receptors have just been identified in Drosophila (20Clyne P.J. Warr C.G. Freeman M.R. Lessing D. Kim J.

Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that this protein is very sensitive to pH changes. This phenomenon has been most likely responsible for the failures in structural studies of this class of proteins. We also demonstrate that the protein undergoes partial unfolding upon interaction with model membranes, analogous to the conformational change observed at low pH. RNA was isolated by a single-step acid/guanidinium/phenol/chloroform extraction (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) from 20 male antennae. PolyATtract (Promega) was used to purify mRNA, and the first cDNA strand was synthesized with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT) primer. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a MiniCycler (PTC-150, MJ Research, Inc.) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 with annealing at 50 °C. The following primers were designed based on the published sequence ofB. mori PBP (10Krieger J. von Nickisch-Rosenegk E. Mameli M. Pelosi P. Breer H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar): CGTCTCAAGAAGTCATGA (5′-primer; blunt-end ligation into the MscI site) and AGACACTCGAGATTCTCAAACTTCAGCT (3′-primer; theXhoI site is underlined). Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the MscI and XhoI sites of the pET22b expression vector (Novagen). Ligation reaction was used for transformation of Epicurian E. coli MRF′ Kan cells (Stratagene). Plasmids were isolated, and the constructs were sequenced with T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers using Dye Terminator Reaction Ready kits on an ABI PRISM Model 373A automated DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Recombinant vectors were transferred into BL21(DE3) expression hosts (Novagen). Expression was performed in LB medium with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin in 1-liter flasks (12 × 330 ml, 4-liter total culture volume) at 28 °C without induction. Cultures were grown to A 600 nm > 2; cells were harvested by centrifugation; and the periplasmic proteins were released by osmotic shock as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). The periplasmic fraction was loaded onto a 20-ml DEAE HR 16/10 column (Toyopearl 650S, TOSOH). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using the Amersham Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatographic system. Fractions containing recombinant PBP were pooled, applied to a 20-ml hydroxylapatite HR 16/10 column (Bio-Gel HT, Bio-Rad). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 5–200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. Hydroxylapatite fractions were concentrated in a Centriprep-10 and then in a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc.) and separated on a Superdex-75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl in either 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, or 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified PBP was concentrated again, desalted on a HiTrap desalting column (Sephadex G-25 SF, 2 × 5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of the recombinant protein was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 6 m guanidine HCl, taking the theoretical extinction coefficient as 19,670 m−1cm−1 (calculated with the ProtParam program on the ExPASy molecular biology server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, according to the algorithm of Gill and von Hippel (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar)). The N-terminal sequences were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard Model 241 protein sequencer with phenylthiohydantoin-derivative separation on a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100 high pressure liquid chromatographic system. The molecular weights of proteins were measured by electrospray mass spectrometry on an on-line liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer system (Hewlett-Packard). The number of disulfide bonds was determined by measuring the molecular weight of the protein after alkylation with iodoacetamide. The native protein was purified from 1160 male antennae, which were homogenized in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After initial centrifugation for 2 × 5 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was recentrifuged at 105,000 × g to separate the membranes and the soluble fraction. The soluble fraction was applied to a 1-ml DEAE column (Toyopearl 650S), which was then eluted with 25 and 500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The 500 mm NaCl eluate, after desalting, was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mmNaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing PBP were applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1 ml of Bio-Gel HT) and eluted with a stepwise gradient of 5–200 mm sodium phosphate. PBP was then concentrated in a Centricon-10, separated on a Superdex-75 16/60 column, desalted, lyophilized, and stored as the recombinant protein. The binding activity of the recombinant protein was tested with several ligands in the native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay following published procedures (25Vogt R.G. Köhne A.C. Dubnau J.T. Prestwich G.D. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3332-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wojtasek H. Hansson B.S. Leal W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bombykol (the natural pheromone of B. mori; 53 Ci/mmol) and the following pheromones from scarab beetles ((R,Z)-5-(dec-1-enyl)-oxacyclopentan-2-one (R-japonilure; 55 Ci/mmol), (S,Z)-5-(dec-1-enyl)-oxacyclopentan-2-one (S-japonilure; 55 Ci/mmol), (R,Z)-5-(oct-1-enyl)-oxacyclopentan-2-one (R-buibuilactone; 55 Ci/mmol), and 1,3-dimethyl-2,4-(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione (162 Ci/mmol)) were used. Preparation of the radiolabeled compounds has been described (26Wojtasek H. Hansson B.S. Leal W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or will be described elsewhere. 2S. Kuwahara and W. S. Leal, manuscript in preparation The recombinant protein (2 μg/assay) was incubated with 10 μCi of the tritiated ligands in polyethylene glycol 20,000-precoated glass tubes on ice for 30 min and separated on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was processed for fluorography (30 min in 7% formaldehyde and 1 h in 1 m sodium salicylate), air-dried between cellophane sheets, and exposed to x-ray film for 1–2 weeks. Chromatofocusing was performed on a MonoP HR 5/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with start buffer (25 mm piperazine HCl, pH 6.0). Elution was performed with Polybuffer 74 HCl, pH 4.2. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a MonoQ HR 10/10 or HR 5/5 column. Several sets of conditions were tested: (i) 0–300 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; (ii) the same gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5; and (iii) 0–200 mm NaCl in 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was performed on the following HiTrap columns (1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): phenyl-Sepharose HR, butyl-Sepharose 4FF, and octyl-Sepharose 4FF. Samples were applied in 1 mammonium sulfate and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and eluted with 1 to 0 m gradients of ammonium sulfate in 50 mm sodium phosphate. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 1 mg/ml for the recombinant protein and at 0.4 mg/ml for the native protein in 20 or 50 mm buffers on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C, unless otherwise stated. Near-UV spectra were taken in a 10-mm path length cell, and a 0.1-mm path length cell was used in the far-UV region. The temperature dependence experiments were performed in a buffer resembling the sensillar lymph from A. polyphemus (27Kaissling K.-E. Thorson J. Sattelle D.B. Hall L.M. Hildebrand J.G. Receptors for Neurotransmitters, Hormones and Pheromones in Insects. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1980: 261-282Google Scholar) (sensillar Ringer solution: 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 170 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2) in a thermostatted cell from 25 to 95 °C in 10 °C intervals. Spectra in the presence of the pheromone were also recorded in the sensillar Ringer solution in a 10-cm path length cell at 0.1 mg/ml protein (6.3 μm) to minimize problems associated with low ligand solubility. The pheromone was added to the protein solution from an ethanol stock solution (0.5% final ethanol concentration) at 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 molar ratios of the protein to the ligand. Samples were mixed by vortexing and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to taking the spectra. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded at 10 μg/ml for the recombinant protein or 7 μg/ml for the native protein in 20 or 50 mm buffers on a Shimazu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 235 nm, and emission was monitored from 280 to 420 nm. Spectra in the presence of bombykol were recorded after the pheromone was added from a stock solution in methanol. For ANS binding, the recombinant protein was dissolved at 100 μg/ml in appropriate buffers, and ANS was added from a 1 mg/ml stock solution to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml (25:1 molar ratio of ANS to the protein). Spectra were recorded immediately after mixing. The excitation wavelength was 380 nm, and emission was monitored from 420 to 620 nm. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) were dissolved in chloroform, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and then under vacuum for at least 1 h. The phospholipid film was dispersed in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, either with or without 170 mm KCl at 10 mg/ml. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication with a probe sonicator to near optical clarity, and the residual multilamellar vesicles and the titanium particles released from the probe were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The vesicles were mixed with the recombinant protein in the same buffer at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml protein and ∼5 mg/ml phospholipids (1:225 molar ratio of the protein to phospholipids), and the samples were incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h. Far-UV CD spectra were then taken as described above. Fluorescence spectra were recorded after 1:50 dilution in appropriate buffers (without vesicles). Insect odorant-binding proteins have been previously expressed both in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. PBP from Antheraea pernyi was expressed in the baculovirus system (16Krieger J. Raming K. Prestwich G.D. Frith D. Stabel S. Breer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but a low yield prevented the production of sufficient amounts of the protein for structural studies. Intracellular expression of the same protein inE. coli gave a higher yield, but the majority of the recombinant protein was produced in the insoluble form and required refolding for structural and functional analysis (18Prestwich G.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have selected the pET22b vector, which allows expression of the recombinant proteins fused to the peIB signal peptide, directing the proteins to the E. coli periplasm. This provides an appropriate oxidative environment for the formation of disulfide bonds. Insect PBPs are secreted proteins, and the existence of two to three disulfide bonds has been postulated (6Breer H. Krieger J. Raming K. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 735-740Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By measuring the molecular weight of the carboxymethylated protein, we determined that, inB. mori PBP, indeed all six cysteines form disulfide bridges. The molecular weight of the protein after alkylation with iodoacetamide was 15,877 ± 2, identical to the unreacted protein. This value was the same for the recombinant and native proteins and corresponded well with the molecular weight obtained from translation of the cDNA (15,884, uncorrected; or 15,878, assuming all six cysteines are in disulfide bonds), which demonstrates that B. mori PBP is not post-translationally modified. When alkylation of the protein was performed after reduction with 50 mmdithiothreitol, the molecular weight increased to 16,230 ± 3, which corresponds exactly to incorporation of six carboxamidomethyl groups. Using the periplasmic expression system, we routinely obtained 6–10 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. The highest yield was obtained without induction, when the protein was expressed slowly at low temperature (28 °C). This provided optimal conditions for protein translocation into the periplasm and its enzymatic processing. Although induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside significantly increased the amount of total recombinant protein, it reduced the amount of the soluble protein translocated into the periplasm. Periplasmic localization also circumvented the problem of degradation of recombinant proteins experienced, for example, in the case of Manduca sexta GOBP1 (15Feng L. Prestwich G.D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein purified from the periplasm appeared as a single band both in native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A) and comigrated with the protein isolated from male antennae (data not shown). It specifically bound bombykol, its natural ligand, in the native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay (Fig. 1 B). However, the far-UV CD spectra of the recombinant and native proteins were not always identical. Preliminary NMR experiments performed by Wüthrich and co-workers 3F. Damberger, R. Horst, H. Wojtasek, W. S. Leal, and K. Wüthrich, manuscript in preparation. (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland) at pH 6.2 indicated the existence of at least two conformations. Originally, we attempted to separate these forms chromatographically. We used a variety of chromatographic systems (see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein appeared homogeneous in most of them, but in the case of anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column, we sometimes observed distortions or splitting of the PBP peak (Fig. 2). These results were not highly reproducible, and different patterns were observed even for the same sample in consecutive injections or when a sample was reinjected soon after analysis. This indicated that the different forms of the protein were easily convertible into one another. We found that a number of factors affected the chromatographic homogeneity of the protein. Ammonium sulfate, for example, promoted the formation of a mixture (Fig. 2, B and C). When we isolated the protein from the high osmolarity buffer used in the osmotic shock procedure (20% sucrose), we also observed a form eluting from the DEAE column much earlier than the native protein. Originally, we considered this to be a misfolded form. Later, however, we were able to obtain this low-salt eluting form by incubation with ammonium sulfate and sucrose (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Analysis of the purified recombinant protein on the MonoQ HR 5/5 column. The protein was incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 200 mm KCl (A) or 350 mm(NH4)2SO4 (B andC) and then diluted 10 times with either 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 (A and B), or 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20% sucrose (C) just before injection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This unexpected conformational flexibility led us to a thorough spectroscopic analysis of both the recombinant and native proteins under various conditions. We analyzed the effect of temperature, salts, pH, denaturing agents, and the pheromone on the structure of the protein by near- and far-UV CD and by fluorescence spectroscopy. The most dramatic structural changes were observed under the influence of pH (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Changes in the near-UV CD and fluorescence spectra indicated a great conformational transition between pH 6.0 and 5.0. Near-UV CD spectra, reflecting mostly packing constraints of aromatic residues, demonstrated that these side chains became much more flexible at lower pH; thus, the protein underwent partial unfolding, and most of the tertiary contacts were broken. The decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence at low pH also indicated that the aromatic residues became more exposed to solvent (Fig. 5). The secondary structure (far-UV CD) was also affected, but only slightly (Fig. 4 A). The decrease in the spectrum intensity at 222 nm, corresponding to the decrease in helicity, indicated that some unwinding of helices occurred. A plot of the dependence of the intrinsic fluorescence on pH indicated that this conformational transition was mediated by protonation of residue(s) with an apparent pK a of ∼5.7 (Fig.5 B). The presence of an equimolar concentration of bombykol (0.6 μm) did not prevent this transition. However, we observed a substantial enhancement of fluorescence at neutral and basic pH values (i.e. in the closed conformation), which we interpret as an indication of ligand binding. It is consistent with increased hydrophobicity of the environment around the tryptophan residues. At low pH (5.0 and below), there was a slight quenching of the fluorescence signal. Since such quenching also occurs at neutral pH when a large excess of bombykol is added, we attribute this effect to the presence of free ligand, which would imply that at low pH it is not bound.Figure 4Far-UV CD spectra of the recombinant (A) and native (B) proteins.Spectra for recombinant PBP were taken in the same buffers as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

Spectra of the native protein were taken in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (spectrum 1); 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (spectrum 2) and 6.0 (spectrum 3); and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (spectrum 4) and 4.5 (spectrum 5). Spectra of the recombinant protein were taken in 20 mm buffers: sodium borate (pH 9.0), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), sodium phosphate (pH 7.0 to 6.0), sodium acetate (pH 5.5 to 4.0), and sodium formate (pH 3.5 and 3.0) without ligand or with bombykol (0.6 μm; 1:1 molar ratio). Each data point inB represents a mean of at least three measurements. S.E. values for most points were too small to be shown in the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested the effect of the pheromone on the protein tertiary structure by near-UV CD spectroscopy under conditions close to native (sensillar Ringer solution, pH 6.5). However, changes in the protein spectra at a pheromone concentration close to stoichiometric (0.5–2 molar ratio of the ligand to the protein) were minimal (data not shown). The limited availability of the protein from the natural source prevented us from performing a comparable analysis with the native protein. However, we have taken fluorescence spectra at selected pH points (Fig. 5 A) and far-UV CD spectra at neutral (7.0) and acidic (4.5) pH values (Fig. 4 B). The native protein showed the same changes in its spectroscopic properties (decrease in fluorescence intensity and helicity at low pH) as the recombinant material. This opening of the PBP structure was confirmed by binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid. The fluorescence intensity of this hydrophobic probe was substantially enhanced at pH 4.5 compared with pH 6.5 or denaturing conditions (Fig.6). Such enhancement of ANS fluorescence has been considered as an indication of the formation of the molten globule state (28Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we observed much stronger ANS fluorescence in the presence of PBP at pH <4.5. Therefore, it is conceivable that the conformation at pH 4.5 is not the molten globule state, but a distinct unfolding intermediate. We have considered the possibility that the pH-induced conformational transition may lead to changes in the protein quaternary structure. We have used gel filtration chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, and chemical cross-linking to test this hypothesis, but we have obtained no evidence for formation of dimers or oligomers at pH values between 4 and 8. It has been shown in a number of cases that pH-linked unfolding of proteins reflects their interaction with membranes (29van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F.

https://openalex.org/W1979785616,"STATs are activated by various cytokines and growth factors via tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to sequential dimer formation, nuclear translocation, binding to specific DNA sequences, and regulation of gene expression. Recently, serine phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727 by ERK has been identified in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Here, we report that Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3 can also be induced by JNK and activated either by stress or by its upstream kinase and that various stress treatments induce serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibitors of ERK and p38 did not inhibit UV-induced Stat3 serine phosphorylation, suggesting that neither of them is involved. We further demonstrate that JNK1, activated by its upstream kinase MKK7, negatively regulated the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Stat3 stimulated by EGF. Correspondingly, pretreatment of cells with UV reduced the EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphotyrosine-dependent activities of Stat3. The inhibitory effect was not observed for Stat1. Our results suggest that Stat3 is a target of JNK that may regulate Stat3 activity via both Ser-727 phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Seven STAT genes have been identified, which contain a conserved structure of SH2 and a DNA-binding domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Binding of cytokines to their respective receptors stimulates the Janus kinase family, which phosphorylates STAT proteins on a specific tyrosine residue (Tyr-701 in Stat1 and Tyr-705 in Stat3) at the COOH terminus. Homo- or heterodimers are formed between the phosphorylated tyrosine and its partner's SH2 domain. These dimers translocate into the nucleus and function as transcription factors by binding to their recognition sequences and regulating the target gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 1Darnell Jr., J.E.

In addition to cytokines, growth factors such as EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1 also stimulate STAT tyrosine phosphorylation presumably through their intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity (4Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.S.A. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Silvennoinen O.

Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 9Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of STATs has also been demonstrated. A Pro-X-Ser-Pro sequence that is a recognition site of ERKs has been found at the COOH terminus of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat4, suggesting that ERK is involved in the phosphorylation of these STATs (10Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). ERKs are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that are activated by growth factor stimulation and have been shown to play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (11Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 12Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G.

It has been reported that ERK2 co-immunoprecipitated with Stat1α in response to interferon-β and was involved in the regulation of interferon-β-induced gene expression (14David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been reported that ERKs phosphorylate Stat3 on Ser-727in vitro as well as in vivo in response to EGF (15Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, the existence of serine/threonine kinases other than ERKs phosphorylating STATs on serine has also been suggested. For example, Stat1 is a relatively poor substrate for ERKs (15Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition, although phosphorylation of Stat1 on Ser-727 is induced in response to interferon-γ, ERKs are not activated by interferon-γ and therefore are unlikely to be involved in such phosphorylation (16Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu Z.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, serine phosphorylation of Stat3 by IL-6 stimulation has been shown to be ERK-independent (15Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and the involvement of H-7-sensitive serine kinases has also been reported (17Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 18Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two other subtypes of mammalian MAPKs that are activated by environmental stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines have been identified. JNKs, also known as stress-activated protein kinases, are activated by IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), UV radiation, and anisomycin (20Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). JNKs bind to the amino terminus of c-Jun and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73 (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The third group of MAPKs, p38, is activated by endotoxic lipopolysaccharide or hyperosmolarity (24Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Although ERKs, JNKs, and the p38 kinase families are closely related due to their similar regulatory TXY motif for activity, they are distinguishable by unique (although sometimes overlapped) upstream activators and downstream substrates (25Dérijard B.

Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Stat3 can be phosphorylated by stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines and examined which kinases are involved in such phosphorylation. We observed that Stat3 was phosphorylated on Ser-727 by TNF-α and various stress treatments. JNK1 activated either by UV or anisomycin or by its upstream kinase MEKK1 phosphorylated Stat3 in vitro. The major phosphorylation site was identified to be Ser-727. Stat3 can also be phosphorylated by cotransfection of JNK1 with MEKK1 in vivo. We further demonstrate that activation of JNK1 either by its upstream kinases or by UV treatment resulted in negative regulation of its activity. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Stat3 fusion protein, containing an almost full-length Stat3, was constructed as described previously (9Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The point mutant GST-S1, in which Ser-727 of GST-Stat3 was replaced by Ala, was prepared using the polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit ExSiteTM (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The deletion mutant GST-C2 (containing amino acids 480–770) was generated by digesting GST-Stat3 with XmnI/XhoI, isolating the fragment, and inserting it into pGEX-KG. The expression plasmid of Stat3, pRc/CMV-Stat3 (6Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. J. E. Darnell, Jr. (Rockefeller University). Substitution of the phosphorylation site Ser-727 by Ala was performed with the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The correct construction was confirmed by sequencing. The activated MEKK1 mutant (28Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Han (Scripps Research Institute). The reporter plasmid pSIE-CAT for CAT assays was prepared by inserting three copies of the hSIE consensus sequence (TTCCCGTAA) upstream of a c-fos minimal promoter followed by the CAT gene in plasmid pFOSCATΔ56 (30Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with expression plasmids were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate)). The cell lysates were incubated with an anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science Inc.) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and divided into two portions. One portion was subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The other portion was subjected toin vitro kinase assay. Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were washed once with JNK kinase assay buffer containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.3), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The GST-Stat3 fusion proteins used as substrates were produced and partially purified as described previously (9Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Stat3 was eluted by vortexing for 15 min at room temperature in an equal volume of 20 mmreduced glutathione, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), concentrated using a Centriprep 10 (Amicon, Inc.), washed once in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), and further concentrated using an ULTRAFREE-MC filter unit (Millipore Corp.). Equal amounts of fusion proteins were used in the kinase assays. The fusion proteins were incubated with immunoprecipitated JNK1 in the kinase assay buffer in the presence of 5 or 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15–30 min. The reaction mixture was boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. The blots were also subjected to Amido Black staining to show the equal amount of GST fusion proteins used in each reaction. As for Western analysis of total cell lysates, equal amounts of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride, membrane, and blotted with the respective antibodies, including anti-phospho-Ser-727 Stat3, anti-phospho-Tyr-705 Stat3 (both from New England Biolabs Inc.), and anti-Stat3 (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. COS-1 cells were transfected and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml for 4 h before harvesting. The cells were lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Stat3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film as described previously (31Jain N. Mahendran R. Philp R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection of plasmids into COS-1 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (32Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). For CAT assays, the cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of CAT-containing reporter plasmids, 3–5 μg of expression plasmids, and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene. The cells were lysed in 0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with three freeze-thaw cycles after 45 h of transfection. The lysate was spun, and the supernatant was collected and used for β-galactosidase activity and CAT assays. The pellets were resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and extracted as crude nuclear extract for DNA mobility shift assay. The amount of cytoplasmic extract used in each CAT assay was normalized with equivalent β-galactosidase activity. Acetylated and non-acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by thin-layer chromatography, followed by autoradiography and quantification using a Bio-Rad GS700 imaging densitometer. The mobility shift DNA binding assay was performed using hSIE as a probe under conditions described previously (9Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), except in the absence of salt in the binding buffer. Stat3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-705 in response to growth factors and cytokines. In addition, serine phosphorylation of Stat3 has been observed, and the major phosphorylation site is Ser-727. We investigated whether environmental stress or inflammatory cytokines can induce phosphorylation of Stat3. COS-1 cells, which express low levels of endogenous Stat3 (10Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), were transfected with Stat3 expression plasmid and treated with TNF-α and various stresses. Phosphorylation of Stat3 was examined with antibodies specifically recognizing either Ser-727- or Tyr-705-phosphorylated Stat3 protein in Western blot analysis. Fig.1 A (upper panel) shows that Stat3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was induced by UV, anisomycin, TNF-α, and sodium arsenite and, to a weaker extent, by NaCl, okadaic acid, and lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, Tyr-705 phosphorylation of Stat3 was undetected in cells with these treatments (middle panel). EGF, as a positive control, induced both strong tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3. An equal expression of Stat3 is shown in the lower panel. We also tested the induction of serine phosphorylation of endogenous Stat3 by stress in NIH 3T3 cells. TNF-α and various stress treatments, together with a positive control (platelet-derived growth factor), stimulated the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that both endogenous and exogenous Stat3 can be phosphorylated on Ser-727 by stress treatments. Since JNK/stress-activated protein kinase is activated by stress and JNK1 is a major JNK, we next examined whether JNK1 was able to phosphorylate Stat3 in vitro. COS-1 cells were treated with UV, anisomycin, NaCl, or EGF; and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-JNK1 antibody, followed by an immune complex protein kinase assay using the GST-Stat3 fusion protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 A, UV and anisomycin induced Stat3 phosphorylation by JNK1, whereas NaCl and EGF, which mainly activate p38 kinase and ERKs, respectively, did not stimulate Stat3 phosphorylation significantly. MEKK1 phosphorylates the JNK upstream kinase SAPK/ERK kinase-1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK1 (28Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To further confirm Stat3 phosphorylation by JNKs, we transfected COS-1 cells with JNK1 in the absence or presence of constitutively activated MEKK1 and performed the immune complex kinase assay. We observed that GST-Stat3 was strongly phosphorylated by MEKK1-activated JNK1, but not by JNK1 transfected alone or by endogenous JNK1 (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). The activation of JNK1 by MEKK1 was confirmed by the strong phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79), a physiological substrate of JNK1 (second panel, lane 3). This was also verified by the strong phosphorylation of JNK1 detected with an anti-phospho-JNK1 antibody that recognizes dual-phosphorylated JNK1 in Western blot analysis (third panel, lane 3). An equal expression of exogenous JNK1 in the presence or absence of MEKK1 was shown (lower panel). These data suggest that JNK1, activated by either stress or by its upstream kinase, phosphorylates Stat3 on Ser-727 in vitro. We further tested whether Ser-727 was the only phosphorylation site of JNK1. A point mutant (GST-S1) in which Ser-727 was replaced by alanine and a deletion mutant (GST-C2) containing the COOH-terminal portion of Stat3 (amino acids 480–770) were generated, and the phosphorylation by JNK1 was tested. As shown in Fig. 2 C, MEKK1-activated JNK1 strongly phosphorylated GST-Stat3 and GST-C2, but failed to phosphorylate GST-S1. The amounts of the fusion proteins GST-Stat3 and GST-S1 used in the kinase assays were comparable (indicated byasterisks in the lower panel). These data suggest that Ser-727 is the only phosphorylation site of JNK1 in vitro. Next, we examined whether JNK1 phosphorylated Stat3 in vivo. COS-1 cells were either transfected with Stat3 expression plasmid alone or cotransfected with JNK1 and MEKK1 and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Stat3 antibody. A basal level of Stat3 phosphorylation was observed in cells transfected with Stat3 alone (Fig. 3, lane 1), which was strongly enhanced in cells cotransfected with JNK1 and MEKK1 (lane 2). As a positive control, EGF also stimulated Stat3 phosphorylation (lane 3). These data indicate that Stat3 can be phosphorylated by JNK1 in vivo. To ascertain the noninvolvement of other MAPK family members in the stress-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3, the inhibitors of MEK1 (PD98059) (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) and p38 kinase (SB203580) (34Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) were used to pretreat cells, followed by UV or EGF treatment. The Ser-727 phosphorylation was analyzed. UV-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 was not affected by either inhibitor (Fig.4, middle panel). In contrast, EGF-induced phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059, but not by SB203580 (right panel). The basal level of phosphorylation in uninduced cells was slightly decreased by both inhibitors (left panel). These results suggest that whereas ERKs phosphorylate Stat3 by EGF stimulation, ERKs and p38 are unlikely to be involved in Stat3 serine phosphorylation induced by UV. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 by growth factors and cytokines is a prerequisite for its dimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation, whereas the Ser-727 phosphorylation alone does not stimulate Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activities (6Zhong Z.

We studied the role of JNK1 in Stat3 function by testing its effect on the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Stat3 stimulated by EGF. MKK7 (JNK kinase-2) has recently been identified to be a specific upstream activator of JNK1 without affecting ERKs or p38 (29Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

The DNA binding activity was analyzed using hSIE, a high affinity binding site for Stat3, as a probe. As reported previously, EGF induced the activation of Stat3 and Stat1 to form three complexes with SIE: SIF-A (Stat3 homodimer), SIF-B (Stat1/Stat3 heterodimer), and SIF-C (Stat1 homodimer) (6Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of Stat3 was not observed in the untreated cells transfected with Stat3 (Fig.5 A, lane 3), but was induced after EGF treatment (lane 4, SIF-Aand SIF-B). SIF-A was not affected by constitutively activated MKK7, JNK1, or kinase-deficient mutant JNK1−alone (lanes 5–7), but was almost completely destroyed by cotransfection of MKK7 and JNK1 together (lane 8). The DNA binding activity was largely restored by cotransfection of either mutant MKK7 and wild-type JNK1 (lane 10) or constitutively activated MKK7 and kinase-deficient JNK1 (lane 9). It has been previously reported that the formation of SIF-C by endogenous Stat1 can be detected after EGF stimulation in COS cells (41Sasse J. Hemmann U. Schwartz C. Schniertshauer U. Heesel B. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, SIF-C was also detected upon EGF treatment (lane 4), but was unaffected by cotransfection with wild-type or mutant MKK7 and/or JNK1 (lanes 5–10). We next examined whether activated JNK1 also affected Stat3 transcriptional activity stimulated by EGF. A reporter plasmid containing three copies of hSIE followed by a CAT gene was cotransfected with Stat3 in the presence or absence of JNK1 and/or MKK7 expression plasmids, and the CAT activities were analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, CAT activity increased 10.4-fold after EGF stimulation, which slightly decreased in the presence of MKK7 (7.5-fold), but was unaffected by either wild-type or mutant JNK1 (10.3- and 11.8-fold, respectively). However, when Stat3 was cotransfected with MKK7 and JNK1 together, CAT activity was completely inhibited (1.4-fold), whereas such inhibition was not observed with cotransfection of MKK7 and mutant JNK1 or of mutant MKK7 and JNK1. These results are consistent with the DNA binding data, indicating that activated JNK1 suppresses both the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Stat3. Src has been shown to specifically stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of Stat3, but not of Stat1 (8Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar,9Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To confirm the repression of Stat3 activity by JNK1 described above, we performed similar transfection experiments in which EGF treatment was replaced by cotransfection with Src, and the DNA binding activity and transactivation of Stat3 stimulated by Src were examined. Similar repression by activated JNK1 was observed (data not shown). Western blot analysis verified the activation and expression of JNK1 and Stat3 in these transfection experiments. As shown in Fig.5 C, we observed strong JNK1 phosphorylation only in the presence of MKK7, but not in its absence or in the presence of mutant MKK7−. Notably, JNK1− was not phosphorylated by cotransfection with MKK7 (upper panel), although an equivalent expression of JNK1 and JNK1− was observed (second panel). The different apparent molecular masses of JNK1 and JNK1− were due to the different constructions, as JNK1 contains three copies of HA epitope, whereas JNK1−contains one copy of FLAG sequence (21Dérijard B.

The expression of transfected Stat3 protein was comparable in all the samples (lower panel). However, a significant decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in cells cotransfected with MKK7 and JNK1 stimulated with EGF (third panel) was observed, which correlated well with its reduced DNA binding and transcriptional activities. This further indicates that the repression of Stat3 activity by JNK1 is due to a decrease in its tyrosine phosphorylation. To confirm the"

To study the signal transduction pathways that are mediated by this receptor, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify signaling molecules that associate with the phosphorylated Tek receptor. Using this approach, we demonstrate that five molecules, Grb2, Grb7, Grb14, Shp2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase can interact with Tek in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner through their SH2 domains. Mapping of the binding sites of these molecules on Tek reveals the presence of a multisubstrate docking site in the carboxyl tail of Tek (Tyr1100). Mutation of this site abrogates binding of Grb2 and Grb7 to Tek in vivo, and this site is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 and p85 in vivo. Furthermore, stimulation of Tek-expressing cells with Angiopoietin-1 results in phosphorylation of both Tek and p85 and in activation of endothelial cell migration and survival pathways that are dependent in part on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Angiopoietin-1-induced signaling from the Tek receptor is mediated by a multifunctional docking site that is responsible for activation of both cell migration and cell survival pathways.

Signal transduction pathways mediated by RTKs are initiated upon ligand binding with subsequent receptor-mediated dimerization and autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). These phosphotyrosine residues serve as high affinity binding sites for numerous intracellular signaling molecules that contain Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding domains (2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Such specialized protein modules are found in various classes of RTK targets including the p85 subunit of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, the docking molecules Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1, and the adaptor proteins Grb2, Grb7, and Grb14. Additional modular units such as Src homology 3 and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are also found in Grb2 and the Grb7/Grb14 family, respectively. A regulated cascade of protein-protein interactions allows other signaling molecules to be recruited and assembled into an organized biochemical network that leads to the activation of important signaling pathways within the cell. Two subfamilies of RTKs have been identified whose expression is almost exclusively restricted to cells of the endothelial lineage (3Mustonen T. Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 4Claesson-Welsh L. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 1-187Google Scholar). The first subfamily contains the high affinity vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFRs) known as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1), and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). To date, there are four distinct isoforms of VEGF denoted VEGF-A through VEGF-D that bind and activate different subsets of the VEGFRs (5Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). The second subfamily consists of the TIE receptors known as Tie (Tie1) and Tek (Tie2), which are structurally dissimilar from the VEGFRs. Whereas the ligand for Tie has yet to be identified, a family of ligands known as the angiopoietins have recently been shown to bind Tek (6Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L.

Interestingly, these ligands appear to have opposing actions as Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and Angiopoietin-4 (Ang4) stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Tek, whereas Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) and Angiopoietin-3 (Ang3) can inhibit this phosphorylation. Genetic experiments have demonstrated that the signal transduction cascades that are mediated by each of these RTKs are distinct and that each pathway is critical for normal embryonic blood vessel development. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 appear to be required during the initial developmental process of blood vessel formation known as vasculogenesis (9Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar, 10Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), whereby endothelial cell precursors differentiate and assemble into a primitive vascular network (11Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). This network is subsequently remodeled through the sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing larger vessels by a process known as angiogenesis (11Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). VEGFR-3, Tie, and Tek have all been shown to be required for this later stage of blood vessel maturation (12Dumont D.J. Jussila L.-F. Seet T. Mustonen T. Alitalo K. Science. 1998; 282: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 13Dumont D.J. Gradwohl G. Fong G.H. Puri M.C. Gertsenstein M. Auerbach A.

Inactivation of Tek signaling pathways results in early embryonic lethality as a result of angiogenic defects throughout the vascular system including a reduction in blood vessel integrity, decreased vessel sprouting, and a loss of endothelial cells (7Maisonpierre P.C.

These analyses have revealed that activation of Tek by Ang1 appears to control at least two different signal transduction cascades that can effect changes in angiogenic sprout formation and survival of endothelial cells. Consistent with the role of Tek signaling pathways in vessel sprouting, a modified form of Ang1 known as Ang1* has recently been shown to initiate endothelial cell migration and sprouting in vitro (17Witzenbichler B.

Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Sessa W.C. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 213-223PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tek has been shown to signal through a novel phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing docking molecule known as Dok-R that can associate with numerous signaling molecules that are thought to be involved in cell migration (20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Collectively these results suggest that Tek signaling through Dok-R may lead to alterations in the intracellular architecture of endothelial cells, which is critical for their directed migration during sprouting angiogenesis. The identification of a unique family of Tek ligands with opposing functions implies that the signal transduction pathways downstream of Tek are tightly regulated; however, these pathways are currently not well understood. The phosphorylated Tek receptor has been shown to associate with Grb2 and Shp2 in vitro (21Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently, Korpelainen et al. (22Korpelainen E.I. Karkkainen M. Gunji Y. Vikkula M. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown that Tek can activate the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1, 3 and 5. Tek has also been shown to initiate signal transduction pathways downstream of PI 3-kinase and Dok-R (20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Kontos C.D. Stauffer T.P. Yang W.P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Here we report that Grb7, Grb14, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, as well as Grb2 and Shp2, can associate with Tek. These five molecules can interact specifically with the phosphorylated Tek receptor through their SH2 domains in yeast and in vitro. Using synthetic phosphopeptides, we have mapped the potential binding sites of these molecules on Tek and found that one tyrosine residue, Tyr1100, may serve as a multisubstrate docking site. We provide evidence to suggest that Grb2, Grb7, and p85 can associate with Tek in vivo and that these interactions are mediated through this multidocking site. We also show that Tek can use both Grb7 and p85 as substrates and that tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is abrogated when Tyr1100is mutated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p85 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following Ang1 stimulation of Tek and that a PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for Ang1-induced endothelial cell migration and cell survival. Construction of the mouse day 12.5 embryonic heart and lung cDNA library and the yeast two-hybrid screening approach have been extensively described in Ref. 20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar. GST fusion proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli using standard procedures, and the recombinant fusion proteins were purified following immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted from the beads upon treatment with free (10 mm) glutathione for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The concentrations of the proteins were estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. N-terminally biotinylated peptides were synthesized by the AMGEN peptide synthesis group (Boulder, CO), and purity was confirmed by mass spectral and amino acid composition analysis. Relative binding of purified GST-SH2 domains to biotinylated phosphopeptides was measured using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore 2000, Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Peptides were coupled to streptavidin-coated sensor surfaces (Sensor Chip SA) to a density of 400 response units as per manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were serially diluted in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) and injected at a 5 μl/min flow rate. Surface regeneration was performed by 10-μl injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH at a 20 μl/min flow rate. Relative binding was measured as an increase in arbitrary response units, and kinetic parameters were determined using the BIA evaluation 3.0 software. The cDNAs representing the cytoplasmic domain of Tek, both wild type and kinase inactive, were subcloned into pACTag2 (20Jones N. Dumont D.J.

The cDNA representing the full-length Tek receptor was cloned into the pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen), and the corresponding full-length TekA853 and TekF1100 cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Grb7 cDNA has been previously described (24Fiddes R.J. Campbell D.H. Janes P.W. Sivertsen S.P. Sasaki H. Wallasch C. Daly R.J. J. Biol.

For Ang1 stimulations on endothelial cells, cells were serum-starved for 6 h, pretreated with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 8.0, for 10 min at 37 °C, and stimulated with 5 ml of conditioned medium in the presence of sodium orthovanadate for 10 min. Alternatively, for Ang1 stimulations on HEK293Tek cells, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and were stimulated in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. GST mixes, immunoprecipitations, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 1 μg of eluted fusion protein was incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated peptide in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were recovered on streptavidin agarose beads (Pierce), eluted in sample buffer, and processed as described in Ref. 20Jones N. Dumont D.J.

Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Tek antibodies specific to the extracellular domain were a kind gift of Fu-Kuen Lin (AMGEN, Thousand Oaks, California). A peptide specific to the kinase insert region of Tek (NH2-CRKSRVLETDPAFAVANSTAST-COOH) was used to raise a polyclonal anti-Tek antiserum in rabbits, and this affinity purified antibody is referred to as anti-TekKI. Polyclonal anti-p85 antibody was generously provided by Anke Klippel. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 200 mml-glutamine (all Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mg/ml heparin (ICN Biomedicals), and 0.02 mg/ml bovine endothelial cell growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.

HEK293Tek cells were further supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 nm methotrexate (Sigma) and EA.hy926 were further supplemented with hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (Sigma). Ang1 cDNA was subcloned into either SignalpIg-plus (Novagen) or pSecTagB (Invitrogen), and HEK293T cells stably expressing Ang1-Fc or Ang1-MH were generated by selection of transfected cells with either 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), respectively, and resistant cells were pooled. Nontransfected HEK293T cells and stable transfectants were grown to confluence on 15-cm dishes, and conditioned medium was collected for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% or 10% FBS. Harvested medium was clarified by centrifugation, and secretion of Ang1-Fc or Ang1-MH into the medium was confirmed by Western analysis. Ang1-Fc was depleted from 10 ml of conditioned medium by incubation with 500 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. HUVEC, Py4-1, HEK293, and HEK293Tek cells were seeded at a density of 8.4 × 104 cells in 500 μl of DMEM + 0.1% FBS, with or without inhibitor, in the upper chamber of an 8 μm-pore modified Boyden chamber (Falcon). Conditioned medium was placed in the lower chamber, and wortmannin and LY299402 (both Sigma) were added at a final concentration of either 10, 50, or 100 nm or 10, 20, or 40 μm, respectively. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Nonmigrating cells were scraped off, and filters were fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min, stained with Harris' Hematoxylin (BDH) for 10 min, and washed twice with tap water for 3 min each. Filters were then mounted using 100% glycerol (Fisher Biotech) and counted using a light microscope (Leica) at 400× magnification. HUVEC were seeded at 1.2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes in DMEM +10% FBS. After 24 h in culture, cells were washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 1 ml of fresh DMEM + 10% FBS or Mock, Ang1-Fc, depleted or Ang1-Fc + 10 nm wortmannin conditioned medium. After 5 days of incubation, viable cells were stained with trypan blue (Life Technologies, Inc.) and counted using a hemacytometer (Bright-Line). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test for comparisons between two means. All experiments were performed in triplicate. A p value of less than 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. Results are graphically expressed as the mean ± S.E. Gels were digitally scanned and processed using Photoshop 5.0 on a Macintosh G3 computer. To identify proteins that could participate in Tek signaling pathways, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to find molecules that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of Tek in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 26Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have previously reported the identification of Dok-R as a Tek binding partner (20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested whether Tek could associate with two known binding partners, Grb2 and Shp2 (21Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar), in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner in yeast. The entire intracellular domain of the wild type Tek receptor (TekIC), the catalytically inactive Tek receptor (TekA853IC), or a mutant receptor bearing a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation in the predicted Grb2 binding site in the tail (TekF1100IC) (21Huang L. Turck C.W. Rao P. Peters K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar) was coexpressed in yeast with the SH2 domains of Grb2 and Shp2. Expression of the truncated receptors in yeast results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of both TekIC and TekF1100IC, whereas TekA853IC remains unphosphorylated (Fig.1 A). Yeast expressing both TekIC and Grb2 was able to activate the lacZreporter gene and grow on selective medium (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). In contrast, yeast expressing either TekA853ICand Grb2 or TekF1100IC and Grb2 produced very low β-galactosidase activity and sparse growth on selective medium, illustrating that this interaction was dependent upon Tek kinase activity and an intact Tyr1100 residue (Fig. 1 Band data not shown). Similar results were obtained with Shp2 (data not shown), indicating that the yeast two-hybrid system could be used to identify putative Tek binding partners. A yeast strain expressing TekIC was then used to screen for interacting proteins expressed from cDNAs obtained from a day 12.5 mouse embryonic heart and lung library as described previously (20Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Early embryonic heart and lung express high levels of Tek (27Dumont D.J. Yamaguchi T.P. Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1471-1480PubMed Google Scholar); thus it was reasoned that cDNAs derived from these tissues should be rich in Tek signaling partners. Several clones were identified that interacted with Tek in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Fig. 1 C lists the names of the signaling molecules that were either obtained in the screen or were shown to interact with TekIC or TekIC mutants in yeast. Grb2, Shp2, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase have previously been reported to serve as targets for numerous activated RTKs, while Grb7 and Grb14 are members of an emerging family of PH domain-containing adaptor molecules. Importantly, we confirmed that all of these signaling molecules are coexpressed with Tek in cultured endothelial cells (data not shown), suggesting that Grb2, Grb7, Grb14, Shp2, and p85 could indeed be true signaling partners of Tek. Sequence analysis of the partial Grb7, Grb14, and p85 cDNAs obtained in the screen demonstrated that they contained the regions coding for the SH2 domains of these proteins. To determine whether it was indeed the SH2 domains that mediated these interactions and also to test whether these interactions could occur outside of the yeast environment, we fused the SH2 domains of Grb2, Grb7, Grb14, Shp2, and p85 to GST and purified these fusion proteins from E. coli. Immobilized GST-SH2 domains were incubated with lysates prepared from HEK293T cells transiently expressing the hemagglutinin-tagged cytoplasmic domains of either wild type Tek (TekIC) or catalytically inactive Tek (TekA853IC). In a manner similar to that seen in yeast, overexpression of TekIC in mammalian cells results in its autophosphorylation, and the kinase inactive form of TekICremains unphosphorylated (Fig.2 A). The isolated SH2 domains of Grb2, Grb7, and Grb14 could all precipitate TekIC but were unable to precipitate TekA853IC (Fig. 2 B). Both Shp2 and p85 contain two SH2 domains; thus we constructed GST-SH2 fusions of each domain individually to determine which of these domains mediated the interaction with Tek. Both SH2 domains of Shp2 and p85 were able to interact with TekIC; however, the C-terminal SH2 domain of Shp2 was the least effective at precipitating TekIC (Fig. 2 B). These in vitrobinding data supported our results obtained in yeast (Fig.1 C) where the Shp2 N-terminal SH2 domain mediated stronger binding to TekIC than the C-terminal SH2 domain. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the SH2 domains of Grb2, Grb7, Grb14, and p85 and the N-terminal SH2 domain of Shp2 can all bind specifically to Tek in vitro and that these interactions are dependent on Tek tyrosine kinase activity. To this point, we have shown that the SH2 domains of these signaling molecules can interact with the receptor in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner both in yeast and in vitro, and we next wanted to determine the putative binding sites of these SH2 domains on Tek. Because the in vivoautophosphorylation sites of Tek have yet to be defined, we designed synthetic phosphopeptides representing all 19 possible tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Tek (Fig.3 A). Although it is highly unlikely that all of these tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in response to Ang1 stimulation, these phosphopeptides were used as a starting point to reveal the sites that could potentially mediate an interaction. The interactions between the various GST-SH2 domains and the 19 potential binding sites were investigated using real time biosensor (BIAcore) analysis, where the phosphopeptides were immobilized on sensor chips. GST alone did not bind strongly to any of the immobilized phosphopeptides, whereas the SH2 domains of both Grb2 and Grb7 bound most strongly to the peptide comprising phosphorylated tyrosine residue 1100 (Tyr(P)1100) and not to the unphosphorylated counterpart (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Tyr(P)1100 is within a Y1100VNT context, and this sequence fits the consensus binding site for the SH2 domains of both Grb2 and Grb7 that predicts the presence of asparagine at the +2 position following the tyrosine (28Songyang Z.

In contrast to Grb2 and Grb7, the SH2 domain of Grb14 did not bind strongly to Tyr(P)1100; rather this SH2 domain was found to bind most effectively to peptides representing Tyr(P)814 and Tyr(P)1106 (Fig. 3 B). Tyr(P)814 is found within the context Y814PVL, whereas Tyr(P)1106 is found within the context Y1106EKF, suggesting that Grb14 may bind preferentially to sites where the +3 position is occupied by a large hydrophobic residue. The binding of Shp2 to these immobilized peptides was somewhat more complex because peptides representing Tyr(P)814, Tyr(P)895, Tyr(P)897, Tyr(P)1010, Tyr(P)1022, and Tyr(P)1111 were all found to interact strongly with the Shp2 tandem SH2 domains (Fig.3 B). These residues are found within the contexts Y814PVL, Y895LYL, Y897LAI, Y1010SVY, Y1022GVL, and Y1111AGI, respectively. Interestingly, when the individual SH2 domains were tested in these binding experiments, the N-terminal SH2 domain was able to bind to nearly all of the tyrosine residues initially detected using the tandem SH2 domains, whereas the C-terminal SH2 domain bound very poorly to these residues (Fig. 3 B). This result suggested that the binding detected when using the tandem SH2 domains can be mostly attributed to the N-terminal SH2 domain. The consensus binding site for the Shp2 N-terminal SH2 domain predicts a hydrophobic valine or isoleucine at the +1 and +3 positions following the tyrosine (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M.

In contrast to Shp2, when the individual SH2 domains of p85 were tested, the C-terminal SH2 domain displayed consistently higher binding to the various phosphopeptides than the N-terminal SH2 domain (Fig.3 B). The p85 SH2 domains were found to bind to peptides representing Tyr(P)895, Tyr(P)1037, Tyr(P)1066, Tyr(P)1100, and Tyr(P)1106, and these residues are within the contexts Y895LYL, Y1037CGM, Y1066DLM, Y1100VN"

The proteolysis of one PEST-containing protein, IκBα, is prerequisite to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Two mechanisms of IκBα degradation in vivo have been described, one well characterized through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and another less characterized through calpain. In this report, a mutational analysis was done to identify any regions of IκBα that facilitate its recognition and proteolysis by calpain in vitro. These studies revealed that the PEST sequence of IκBα is critical for its calpain-dependent degradation. Furthermore, the IκBα-PEST domain binds to the calmodulin-like domain of the large subunit of μ-calpain (μCaMLD). Transfer of the IκBα-PEST domain to a protein incapable of either binding to or being degraded by μ-calpain allowed for the interaction of the chimeric protein with μCaMLD and resulted in its susceptibility to calpain proteolysis. Moreover, the μCaMLD of calpain acts as a competitive inhibitor of calpain-dependent IκBα degradation. Our data demonstrate that the IκBα-PEST sequence acts as a modular domain to promote the physical association with and subsequent degradation by μ-calpain and suggest a functional role for PEST sequences in other proteins as potential calpain-targeting units.

Modifications of proteins can include phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, proteolytic processing, and in some instances degradation of target molecules. A role for the latter has become clearer as discrete protein domains have been described that mark proteins for proteolysis, such as the KFERQ sequence (1Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), cyclin destruction boxes (2Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), and regions rich in proline (P), glutamic/aspartic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T), or PEST sequences (3Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Two cytosolic proteases, the ATP-dependent proteasome and the calcium-dependent calpain, appear to be responsible for the majority of nonlysosomal targeted proteolysis (4Mykles D.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 184: 157-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An example of inducible protein degradation is seen during the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Under nonstimulated conditions, NF-κB is partitioned to the cytoplasm through association with a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins, most notably IκBα (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). As IκBα binds to dimeric NF-κB complexes, it is able to mask the nuclear localization sequence present on NF-κB and thereby achieve cytoplasmic sequestration of the complex (7Huxford T. Huang D.-B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 8Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB, therefore, is typically preceded by the proteolytic inactivation of the IκB inhibitory protein (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). This has been shown to occur in response to many signals, which act to positively regulate an IκB kinase complex leading to site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα (9DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

This in turn targets the molecule to a ubiquitin ligase enzyme and subsequent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway (13Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F.

A recent study suggests that loss of calpain 3 activity results in an accumulation of IκBα leading to an increased sensitivity to apoptosis, which contributes to the limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A phenotype (15Baghdiguian S. Martin M. Richard I. Pons F. Astier C. Bourg N. Hay R.T. Chemaly R. Halaby G. Loiselet J. Anderson L.V.B. Munain A.L.D. Fardeau M. Mangeat P. Beckmann J.S. Lefranc G. Nat.

Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that IκBα is degraded in a calpain-dependent manner following treatment of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with the toxic particulate silica. Zhang et al. (17Zhang J. Patel J.M. Block E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L461-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that hypoxic conditions activated calpain activity in endothelial cells, resulting in a proteolysis of IκBα that was sensitive to the calpain inhibitor E-64d. Furthermore, Brasier and colleagues (18Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of HepG2 liver cells with the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α resulted in the degradation of IκBα through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as well as through a parallel pathway dependent on calpain activity. We have also recently demonstrated a novel degradation pathway of IκBα in murine B cells that is independent of proteasome activity yet dependent on intracellular calcium and is associated with the constitutive activity of NF-κB in these cells (19Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity to cysteine-protease and calpain inhibitors as well as the calcium requirement of this IκBα proteolysis implicate a possible involvement of calpain. Together, these studies suggest that the degradation of IκBα required for NF-κB signaling is not solely dependent on the 26S proteasome but can also occur through calpain under certain conditions.The calpain family of proteolytic enzymes is comprised of both ubiquitous and tissue-specific isoforms of calcium-dependent thiol proteases (20Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 21Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous μ- and m-calpains share structural similarity yet differ markedly in their requirements for calcium. In vitro, μ-calpain is active at calcium concentrations between 5 and 50 μm,whereas m-calpain is active at concentrations of 0.2–1.0 mm (22Johnson G.V.W. Guttmann R.P. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although μ-calpain requires far less calcium than m-calpain for its half-maximal activation in vitro, intracellular calcium concentrations are nevertheless orders of magnitude lower (0.1–0.4 μm). This poses an enigma surrounding the in vivo activation of calpains and has led to several proposed models of calpain regulation (22Johnson G.V.W. Guttmann R.P. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These include interaction of calpain with membrane phospholipids, an autolytic self-activation, and its regulation by endogenous “activator” protein. Although their activation in cells remains unclear, several physiologic roles for the calpains have been suggested spanning such processes as cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and long term potentiation (20Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Calpains are heterodimers consisting of a large 80-kDa subunit and a smaller 30-kDa subunit. The large subunit contains the catalytic function of the enzyme as well as a calmodulin-like domain (CaMLD),1 so named for its high sequence homology to other EF-hand containing proteins such as calmodulin (20Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Several known substrates of μ- and m-calpain have been identified and many more proposed (23Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and yet structural determinants of calpain substrates remain ill-defined. Interestingly, several calpain substrates contain either calmodulin-binding domains or PEST domains (24Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The latter have been associated with proteolysis, because proteins containing high PEST scores often undergo rapid degradation in vivo (3Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar).IκBα contains a C-terminal PEST sequence and is reported to be inducibly degraded by calpains in vivo. Therefore, to better understand the mechanism allowing IκBα to be degraded by calpain, and more specifically a possible role for the IκBα-PEST domain in calpain-dependent proteolysis, we analyzed the IκBα structural requirements for this reaction. Here, we report the fundamental role of the IκBα-PEST sequence in determining substrate susceptibility to calpain in vitro. Our data suggest a mechanism for calpain-specific proteolysis of IκBα in which first the PEST domain of IκBα binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the CaMLD of the large subunit of calpain, followed by N-terminal cleavage of IκBα and further proteolysis.DISCUSSIONActivation of the transcription factor NF-κB by a wide variety of inducing agents is preceded by the proteolytic inactivation of the inhibitory molecule IκBα. Because of its central role in NF-κB signaling, great effort has gone into delineating the events required to degrade IκBα through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In addition to proteasome-dependent IκBα proteolysis, several groups have either directly or indirectly implicated calpain as an in vivo IκBα protease (15Baghdiguian S. Martin M. Richard I. Pons F. Astier C. Bourg N. Hay R.T. Chemaly R. Halaby G. Loiselet J. Anderson L.V.B. Munain A.L.D. Fardeau M. Mangeat P. Beckmann J.S. Lefranc G. Nat.

Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of IκBα degradation by calpain is uncertain. In this report we examined the structural determinants of IκBα required for degradation by calpain in vitro and demonstrate a functional role for the C-terminal PEST domain of IκBα as a necessary and sufficient calpain-targeting module. A necessary role for the PEST sequence is inferred because deletion of this region inhibits the degradation of IκBα by calpain, and mutation of residues within this domain reduces the efficiency of calpain-dependent IκBα proteolysis as well. Furthermore, the hierarchy of sensitivity to calpain degradation among the IκBα-PEST mutants is mirrored in their relative abilities to associate with the μCaMLD of the large calpain subunit, i.e. IκBα > MutF > IκBΔC. The finding that transfer of the IκBα-PEST domain to CAT yields a chimeric molecule that only then binds to and is a substrate for calpain indicates that this sequence is sufficient for calpain-dependent proteolysis.Phosphorylation of some proteins within PEST or PEST-like sequences is necessary for their recognition by F-box or other proteins that serve to recruit the substrate to a ubiquitin-ligase complex, and degradation through the 26 proteasome ensues (44Yaglom J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although it has long been proposed that by sequestering calcium, the PEST motif could form a calcium-dependent interaction with calpain that would place the catalytic site of calpain in close proximity to the PEST-containing substrate (3Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 24Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of direct association between a PEST sequence and calpain or any other protease.We determined that the degradation of IκBα by calpain is preceded by cleavage at either one or both of two N-terminal sites (data not shown). This is consistent with findings based both on μ-calpain and m-calpain (16Chen F. Lu Y. Kuhn D.C. Maki M. Shi X. Sun S.-C. Demers L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A strong preference for these sites by calpain is evident, because the N-CAT-PEST protein displays a similar pattern to IκBα as it is proteolyzed. The results suggest that one requisite role for calcium in calpain proteolysis may be proximity,i.e. the recruitment of the protein substrate to the enzyme. Although the 66 N-terminal residues of IκBα contain strong calpain cleavage sites, these alone were not sufficient to confer calpain susceptibility to CAT. However, when CAT was brought into association with calpain in the presence of calcium by means of the IκBα-PEST sequence, proteolysis ensued. Thus our data indicate that a calcium-dependent association, not catalysis, is the rate-limiting step in this reaction. Though it was not demonstrated, a similar role for the PEST sequences of the common cytokine receptor γ chain may exist, because this protein bound to the CaMLD of the calpain small subunit and was not degraded by calpain when the PEST sequences were removed (50Noguchi M. Sarin A. Aman M.J. Nakajima H. Shores E.W. Henkart P.A. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Recently, evidence has accumulated, which suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway may be responsible for degradation of many PEST-containing proteins (51Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent reports demonstrate that the PEST domains of three different calpain substrates are dispensable for calpain proteolysis (52Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 53Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Jariel-Encontre I. Poulat F. Berta P. Piechaczyk M. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14919-14927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In one instance it was shown that rather than the PEST domains, the calmodulin-binding domain of the calcium-dependent ATPase was critical for its degradation by calpain (52Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A common theme among the vast majority of calpain substrates is that they contain either a PEST sequence, a CaM binding domain, or both. Though unlikely to apply to all calpain substrates, it is intriguing to think that in these proteins the PEST domains or CaM binding domains serve overlapping functions, i.e. by promoting the association of substrate with μCaMLD these protein motifs could act interchangeably as calpain-homing sequences.Several groups have shown that the basal turnover of IκBα becomes retarded when the casein kinase II phosphorylation sites within the PEST sequence are deleted or replaced with alanine (25Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26VanAntwerp D.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6037-6045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Aoki T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,56Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data indicate that phosphorylation of IκBα at casein kinase II sites within the PEST domain enhances both the association with and the degradation by calpain in vitro, consistent with the possibility that calpain activity, either alone or in addition to the proteasome (56Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), may be responsible for the basal degradation of IκBα under some in vivo conditions.Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal signal responsive domain of IκBα does not affect calpain-dependent proteolysis. In keeping with this, we discovered that neither the induced phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36, nor the substitution of alanine at these sites, alters the rate and pattern of IκBα degradation by calpain (data not shown). These data indicate that the S32A/S36A mutants, which have been used to identify the inducible phosphorylation-dependent NF-κB activation pathway, can be effectively degraded by calpain. Thus, the S32A/S36A IκBα protein will likely prove to be a useful reagent in distinguishing the two proteolytic mechanisms. Similarly, future investigations directed at determining the amino acid components and points of contact along the interface between IκBα-PEST and μCaMLD could be helpful to generate IκBα mutants specifically resistant to calpain-dependent proteolysis. Such studies may also help to specify the role of PEST motifs as general calpain-targeting sequences.It will also be of interest to resolve which, if any, PEST sequences derived from other proteins, such as other IκB members, are able to interact with the CaMLDs of calpain. IκBβ has a C-terminal PEST sequence similar to IκBα, and IκBε has putative PEST sequences in its amino-terminal domain. We have observed that in vitro, IκBβ is readily degraded by μ-calpain, 2S. D. Shumway and S. Miyamoto, unpublished results. suggesting potential calpain-mediated regulation of NF-κB complexes in association with IκB members other than IκBα. Additionally, it may be insightful to examine the ability of calpain substrates that lack high PEST scores to associate with the CaMLD. The findings in this report suggest that association through PEST sequences may be an indication of a protein's sensitivity to calpain proteolysis, though one can imagine CaM binding domains or other uncharacterized motifs playing a similar role. Though the contribution of IκBα-PEST to calpain-dependent IκBα proteolysis in vivohas not been investigated here, our demonstration of its calpain-targeting potential in vitro provides information on IκBα structure that can be used to examine systems where calpain is known or suspected to be activated. Underlying many of the complex cellular signaling networks are numerous posttranslational alterations of protein structure. Modifications of proteins can include phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, proteolytic processing, and in some instances degradation of target molecules. A role for the latter has become clearer as discrete protein domains have been described that mark proteins for proteolysis, such as the KFERQ sequence (1Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), cyclin destruction boxes (2Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), and regions rich in proline (P), glutamic/aspartic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T), or PEST sequences (3Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Two cytosolic proteases, the ATP-dependent proteasome and the calcium-dependent calpain, appear to be responsible for the majority of nonlysosomal targeted proteolysis (4Mykles D.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 184: 157-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An example of inducible protein degradation is seen during the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Under nonstimulated conditions, NF-κB is partitioned to the cytoplasm through association with a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins, most notably IκBα (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). As IκBα binds to dimeric NF-κB complexes, it is able to mask the nuclear localization sequence present on NF-κB and thereby achieve cytoplasmic sequestration of the complex (7Huxford T. Huang D.-B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 8Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB, therefore, is typically preceded by the proteolytic inactivation of the IκB inhibitory protein (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). This has been shown to occur in response to many signals, which act to positively regulate an IκB kinase complex leading to site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα (9DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

This in turn targets the molecule to a ubiquitin ligase enzyme and subsequent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway (13Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F.

Although IκBα degradation is attributed primarily to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, there have recently been a number of alternate proteolytic mechanisms described for IκBα, including some which specifically implicate isoforms of calpain as the direct IκBα protease (15Baghdiguian S.

Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that 40% of disease flares in a population of susceptible individuals were temporally associated with documented viral respiratory infections. Other groups have demonstrated a higher incidence of measles virus particles in the resected colon tissue of patients with Crohn's disease as compared with tissue from patients who did not have IBD (6Wakefield A.J.

Virol. 1999; 116: 796-803Google Scholar), in a prospective study of over 7000 patients, found that the combination of measles and mumps infections in the same year of childhood is significantly associated with subsequent IBD. In a separate study, the simultaneous presence of DNA from Herpesvirus 6 and Epstein-Barr virus was detected more frequently in ulcerative colitis (76%) than in Crohn's disease or control tissues (9Wakefield A.J.

(10Farmer G.W. Vincent M.M. Fuccillo D.A. Horta-Barbosa L. Ritman S. Sever J.L. Gitnick G.L. Gastroenterology. 1973; 65: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a similar association between cytomegalovirus and ulcerative colitis. Under normal circumstances, colonic mucosal tissue (lamina propria) contains a population of leukocytes, including T- and B-lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and mast cells, which are scattered in a network of collagen fibers and smooth muscle cell bundles (11Rosai J. Ackerman's Surgical Pathology. 8th Ed. 1. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1996: 729Google Scholar). These leukocytes arrive to the area via the regularly distributed capillaries in the lamina propria. They serve a surveillance function in the tissue, providing immune protection against the lumenal contents of the colon. Mucosal lymphocytes may reenter the bloodstream, presumably via the lymphatic vessels located in close proximity to the muscularis mucosae, and are free to recirculate through blood and lymphoid organs until a specific antigenic challenge recalls them to an affected area (12Salmi M. Jalkanen S. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 1998; 4: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In IBD, the mucosal immune cell population increases dramatically, and the infiltrate is predominantly mononuclear leukocytes. Further, a hyperplastic thickening of the juxtaposed muscularis mucosae also occurs (13Lee E.Y Stenson W.F DeSchryver-Kecskemeti K. Mod. Pathol. 1991; 4: 87-90PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that interactions between leukocytes and mesenchymal smooth muscle cells are important in the development of IBD. We (14Strong S.A. Pizarro T.T. Klein J.S. Cominelli F. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1244-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have recently shown that colonic mesenchymal cells proliferate in response to leukocyte-derived inflammatory cytokines. Increasingly, however, investigators are finding evidence for bidirectional interaction and communication between smooth muscle cells and immune cells within tissues, events that can play a role not only in IBD (15Roberts A.I. Nadler S.C. Ebert E.C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Fiocchi C. Collins S.M. James S.P. Mayer L. Podolsky D.K. Stenson W.F. Inflamm.

Med. 1994; 180: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the impact that virus infection can have on one of the early events in the colon's inflammatory process, namely leukocyte interaction with mucosal smooth muscle cells (M-SMCs) via leukocyte adhesion molecules. Our data indicate that virus infection dramatically increases the level of mononuclear leukocyte adhesion to M-SMCs through a distinctly different mechanism of interaction from that involved in leukocyte adhesion after treating M-SMCs with inflammatory cytokines (18de la Motte C.A. Klein J.S. Strong S.A.. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A956Google Scholar). The data indicate that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus and the viral mimic, poly(I·C), up-regulate leukocyte adhesion primarily through a novel mechanism involving hyaluronan interaction with CD44, a cell surface hyaluronan-binding protein expressed on many leukocytes. M-SMCs were isolated from human colon specimens (14Strong S.A. Pizarro T.T. Klein J.S. Cominelli F. Fiocchi C.

Briefly, the mucosal layer (lamina propria) of each colon was removed and cut into strips, washed in 50 ml of Hanks' BSS containing 0.15% dithiothreitol (w/v) for 30 min, washed three times in 100 ml of Hanks' BSS containing 1 mm EDTA for 1 h each, and Hanks' BSS alone for at least 2 h with a 100 ml/wash changed every 30 min. The tissue samples were then minced and digested overnight in 100 ml of Hanks' BSS containing collagenase and DNase (0.1 mg/ml each), penicillin (250 units/ml), streptomycin (250 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.625 μg/ml). The liberated cells were filtered from the undigested debris with a tissue screen, cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone), and by incubation at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2, humidified environment. One 75-cm2 flask, containing 15 ml of medium, was seeded with the cells obtained from an ∼125-cm2 area of original tissue. Two to 3 days after plating, the non-adherent cells were washed away, and the culture fluid replenished. When cell cultures were confluent (∼10 days), they were split at a 1:3 ratio. Cultured M-SMCs obtained by this method routinely stain positively for α-smooth muscle cell actin (antibody from Sigma/Aldrich). M-SMC cultures were used in the first through fourth passages. U937 cells, originally derived from a human histiocytic lymphoma, were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI medium containing 5% FBS and routinely subcultured at a 1:5 ratio (∼2 × 105 cells/ml) three times per week. Infectious isolates of RSV and measles virus were obtained from the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Each virus was grown in clinical indicator cell lines (HEp-2 cells for RSV and primary rhesus monkey kidney cells for measles virus), and aliquots of supernatant fluids from these cells were passed directly to the confluent cultures of M-SMCs at the concentrations specified in the figures. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. Infection of smooth muscle cells was confirmed on acetone-fixed coverslips from parallel cultures by fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Coverslips were treated with blends of monoclonal antibodies against RSV or measles virus (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at a 1:200 dilution, washed and treated with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig at 1:200, then counterstained with Evan's Blue dye (0.2%) to identify the cell layer, and observed with a fluorescence microscope. Total mononuclear cells were separated from heparinized peripheral blood (100 units heparin/ml) by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients (19Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 21 Suppl. 97: 77-83Google Scholar). The isolated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMLs) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS (25–50 × 106cells/ml) in a Teflon beaker to prevent attachment during labeling. Viability of the PBMLs was always greater than 95%, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Neutrophils in the pellet of the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient were further purified according to the method of Stossel et al. (20Stossel T.P. Pollard T.D. Mason R.J. Vaughan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using sedimentation in a dextran gradient and hypotonic lysis of residual erythrocytes. Cells isolated by this procedure were routinely greater than 95% neutrophils, as estimated by differential counting. Adhesion of U937 cells to M-SMCs was measured as described previously (21DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, M-SMCs were plated into 24-well plates in their appropriate medium (∼2.5 × 104 cells/well in 0.5 ml) 3–5 days before the assay, and grown to confluence. Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, treatment of M-SMCs with poly(I·C) (10 μg/ml), TNF-α (1 ng/ml), or live virus was done 18–24 h before assay. On the day of the assay, U937 cells or normal human monocytes (up to 70 × 106 cells/ml) were labeled for 90 min at 37 °C with 100 μCi of 51Cr as sodium chromate (NEN Life Science Products) in 1 ml of culture medium. The labeled cells were washed three times with culture medium, counted on a hemacytometer, and resuspended to 106 viable cells/0.5 ml of culture medium. Incubation medium was aspirated from M-SMCs, and 106labeled leukocytes were added per well. The binding phase of the assay was done at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the wells were washed three times with cold medium. The cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and an aliquot removed for quantitation of radiolabel. The number of U937 cells or monocytes bound per well was calculated from the initial specific activity (cpm/cell). Spontaneous release of chromium from the monocytic cells in control incubations without M-SMCs was typically less than 5%. M-SMCs and leukocytes were prepared for the adhesion assay as described above, with the additional step of treating either the M-SMCs with a blocking monoclonal anti-VCAM-1 antibody (10 μg/ml) or the leukocytes with a blocking monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody (from clone A3D8) at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The antibody-treated cells and their untreated controls were incubated at 4 °C, 1 h before continuing with the assay. The number of leukocytes bound was determined as above. M-SMCs were plated in 48-well plates and grown to confluence (3–4 days). The cells were treated as described in the figure legends, and cell surface protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 determined as described previously (22Shankar R. de la Motte C.A. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9376-9382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at the time of the assay, the incubation medium was removed and the cells rinsed with DMEM/F-12 containing 2% FBS. Intact anti-human VCAM-1 antibody (Genzyme, Boston, MA), or anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (Novacastra), or anti-human HLA-DR antibody as an isotype-matched (IgG1) control antibody were added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in wash medium (100 μl/well). The plates were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the wells three times with cold medium, biotin-conjugated, affinity-purified F(ab′)2 fragments from goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was added to each well at a dilution of 1:1000 in wash medium (100 μl/well). The plate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with cold medium, a 1:80 dilution of125I-streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) solution added to each well (100 μl/well), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the wells were washed four times with cold medium, the cells lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and an aliquot removed for radiolabel quantitation. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described previously (14Strong S.A. Pizarro T.T. Klein J.S. Cominelli F. Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1244-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) from confluent M-SMCs grown in 75-cm2 area flasks. Briefly, M-SMCs were lysed at ∼5 × 105 cells/ml with RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX); 10% (v/v) chloroform was added. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the aqueous layer recovered. RNA in the aqueous layer was precipitated in 50% isopropanol, and the precipitate pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting RNA pellets were washed several times in 75% EtOH before dissolving in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA samples (10 μg) were denatured with deionized glyoxal, size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen) by electroblotting. Membranes were air-dried, UV light-cross-linked, and hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled, full-length probe for VCAM-1 RNA (23Polte T. Newman W. Gopal T.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The blots were then stripped and rehybridized by the same procedure using a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, to determine if sample loading was equivalent. Relative levels of hyaluronan synthesis by cultures of M-SMCs were determined by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis as described in detail by Calabro et al. 2Calabro, A., Benavides, M., Tammi, M., Hascall, V. C., and Midura, R. J. (1999) Glycobiology, in press., 3Calabro, A., Hascall, V. C., and Midura, R. J. (1999) Glycobiology, in press. Briefly, confluent M-SMC cultures were incubated with minimal essential medium containing 2% FBS, with or without poly(I·C) or TNF-α as described in the figure legends, and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The culture fluid and cell layer samples were then collected individually, and treated with proteinase K (0.125 mg/ml) and incubated for 2 h, 60 °C. An additional 50-μl aliquot containing 0.125 mg of enzyme was added to each sample and the incubation continued for 2 h. Proteinase K was inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were concentrated to 300 μl in a Speed-Vac centrifuge, and the glycosaminoglycans were precipitated by adding EtOH to 75%, followed by incubation at −20 °C, overnight. Each precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 0.1 m ammonium acetate (0.1 ml) containing 0.0005% phenol red, pH 7. Hyaluronidase SD from Streptococcus dysgalctiae (final concentration 100 milliunits/ml) was added to each sample, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Chondroitinase ABC (final concentration: 100 milliunits/ml) was then added, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. EtOH was then added to 90%, followed by incubation for 2 h at −20 °C to remove any remaining insoluble material. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and evaporated to dryness. Hyaluronidase and chondroitinase digestion products were derivatized by addition of 12.5 mm 2-aminoacridone in 85% Me2SO, 15% acetic acid for 15 min at ambient temperature. An equal volume of 1.25 m sodium cyanoborohydride in ultrapure water was then added and the incubation continued for 18 h at 37 °C. Glycerol was added (final concentration 20%), and the samples stored at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Aliquots (5 μl) of each sample, along with derivatized disaccharide standards, were electrophoresed (500 V, 80 min) on MONOTM composition gels (Glyko, Novato, CA), in MONOTM gel running buffer, at 4 °C. The gels were visualized with a UV light transilluminator, imaged with a Quantix CCD camera, and the results analyzed using Gel-Pro AnalyzerTM software. All cell culture media, salt solutions, antibiotics, and the HLA-DR antibody were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. FBS was purchased from Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD. Poly(I·C) was a product of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden. Dithiothreitol and DNase were from ROche Molecular Biochemicals. TNF-α and VCAM-1 antibody were purchased from Genzyme, Boston, MA. Hyaluronidase SD, chondroitinase ABC, and purified hyaluronan fragments are products of Seikagaku America, Ijamsville, MD. GeneScreen membrane and radioisotopes were from NEN Life Science Products, except the 125I-streptavidin was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase and the CD44 blocking antibody (A3D8) were from Sigma. The VCAM-1 cDNA probe was a generous gift of Dr. Walter Newman, Leukosite, Cambridge, MA. We used RSV and measles virus (MV) as initial agents to test the hypothesis that virus infection of M-SMCs can alter their interactions with leukocytes. The established U937 cell line was used as a model for leukocyte adhesion (21DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) since this monocytic tumor cell carries the ligand for most of the recognized leukocyte adhesion molecules (26Prieto J. Eklund A. Patarroyo M. Cell Immunol. 1994; 156: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Photomicrographs (Fig.1 A) show that leukocytes bind in focal areas to M-SMCs 1 day after exposure to RSV, but did not bind to the untreated control cells. Immunofluorescent histochemistry with a specific anti-RSV antibody (Fig. 1 B) revealed that nearly all of the M-SMCs were infected. By day 2 syncytia formed, and cell damage was evident; by day 4 the entire monolayer of cells was destroyed (data not shown). MV, which infects cells more slowly, was also tested. Fig.2 A shows that leukocytes bound in focal areas to M-SMCs 1 day after infection with MV, but did not bind to untreated control cells. The number of focal areas of adhesion was infrequent, as was the number of infected M-SMCs at this time point, as determined by immunohistochemistry with a MV-specific antibody (Fig. 2 B). Each foci consisted of one or two M-SMCs with an adherent cluster of U937 cells. After 4 days of virus exposure, patches of infected M-SMCs were evident (Fig. 2 B); leukocyte adhesion to the cell monolayer increased dramatically and in correlation to the original virus dose (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, M-SMCs are susceptible to infection with RSV and MV, and virus infection alters their interaction with leukocytes. We next used an accepted viral mimic model (27Haines D.S. Strauss K.I. Gillespie D.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), poly(I·C) (synthetic double-stranded RNA), to minimize the effects of infection efficiency and cell destruction inherent in live virus experiments. Fig. 3 demonstrates that treatment of M-SMCs with poly(I·C) (optimal concentration: 10 μg/ml; optimal time: 18 h; data not shown) results in an ∼8-fold increase in adhesion of U937 cells and a ∼12-fold increase in adhesion of PBMLs compared with unstimulated controls. Conversely, adhesion of neutrophils to M-SMCs was only minimally affected by the poly(I·C) treatment, suggesting that the adhesion mechanism is specific for mononuclear leukocytes. While double-stranded RNA is widely known as an inducer of interferons for many cell types, the ability of poly(I·C) to increase adhesiveness of M-SMCs for leukocytes appears to be direct, since IFN-α (100 units/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) were unable to induce leukocyte adhesion under identical culture conditions (data not shown). Smooth muscle cells from a variety of organs are known to express VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 as a result of cytokine stimulation (17Lazaar A.L. Albelda S.M. Pilewski J.M. Brennan B. Pure E. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Li H. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone M.A. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1551-1559PubMed Google Scholar, 29Couffinhal T. Duplaa C. Labat L. Lamazier J.-M.D. Moreau C. Printseva O. Bonnet J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 407-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and poly(I·C) has also been shown to induce VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells (30Offermann M.K. Zimring J. Mellits K.H. Hagan M.K. Shaw R. Medford R.M. Mathews M.B. Goodbourn S. Jagus R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Doukas J. Cutler A.H. Mordes J.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of poly(I·C) on cell surface expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on M-SMCs. Fig. 4 shows typical radioimmune assays to assess levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and HLA-DR (control) on M-SMCs. Untreated cultures express a high level of ICAM-1, a low but measurable level of VCAM-1, and a low level of HLA-DR (Fig. 4). Stimulation with poly(I·C) does not significantly alter the constitutive levels of ICAM-1 protein, or increase HLA-DR expression, but does increase VCAM-1 surface protein ∼4-fold. Northern analyses demonstrate a time-dependent increase in VCAM-1 mRNA expression after poly(I·C) treatment of M-SMCs (Fig.5). Untreated M-SMCs express very low levels of VCAM-1 mRNA. After adding poly(I·C), the levels increase dramatically through the first 8 h and then decrease during the next 8 h interval. However, they remain above base line even after 24 h. Levels of expression of mRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were not altered by poly(I·C) treatment at any time point. Treatment of M-SMCs with TNF-α also showed up-regulation of VCAM-1 mRNA while IFN-γ and IFN-α had little or no effect. We next used a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks VCAM-1 binding to its ligand to determine if mononuclear leukocyte adhesion to poly(I·C)-treated M-SMCs is mediated by VCAM-1 (Fig.6). As a positive control, M-SMCs were treated with TNF-α (optimum concentration: 1 ng/ml; data not shown), which induces VCAM-1-mediated leukocyte adhesion (18de la Motte C.A. Klein J.S. Strong S.A.. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A956Google Scholar). Adhesion in this case was completely blocked by treatment with the VCAM-1 antibody (10 μg/ml; added 30 min before and during the leukocyte adhesion step). Conversely, the antibody did not block adhesion of U937 cells to M-SMCs treated with poly(I·C). This is a surprising result since poly(I·C) greatly increased VCAM-1 protein expression as indicated above (Fig.4). Lazaar et al. (17Lazaar A.L. Albelda S.M. Pilewski J.M. Brennan B. Pure E. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have shown that endogenously expressed hyaluronan on airway smooth muscle cells can participate in adhesion of activated leukocytes. Although the mononuclear leukocytes (PBMLs and U937 cells) used in our studies are not activated, we nevertheless investigated whether hyaluronan was involved in the poly(I·C)-induced adhesion of mononuclear leukocytes by M-SMCs. Replicate cultures of M-SMCs were untreated, treated with poly(I·C), or treated with TNF-α for 18 h. They were then treated for 10 min with medium alone or medium containing 100 units (final concentration 200 units/ml) bovine testicular hyaluronidase, an enzyme that cleaves hyaluronan, before determining adhesion of U937 cells. Hyaluronidase treatment actually increased leukocyte adhesion significantly to untreated or to TNF-α-stimulated M-SMCs (Fig.7). Conversely, hyaluronidase treatment greatly reduced (∼75% decrease) adhesion to poly(I·C)-treated cultures. In other experiments, streptococcal hyaluronidase (100 milliunits/ml), a more specific enzyme for digesting hyaluronan, was equally as effective as bovine hyaluronidase in abrogating leukocyte adhesion (bovine, ∼75% versus streptococcal, ∼71% reduction in poly(I·C)-induced adhesion). These results strongly suggest that removal of hyaluron"

It has been postulated that these glycans protect the underlying polypeptides from the proteolytic environment of the lysosome. Previous attempts to test this hypothesis have been inconclusive because they utilized approaches that prevent initial glycosylation and thereby impair protein folding. We have used endoglycosidase H to remove the Asn-linked glycans from fully folded lysosomal membrane proteins in living cells. Deglycosylation of Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 resulted in their rapid degradation, whereas Limp-2 was relatively stable in the lysosome in the absence of high mannose Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Depletion of Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 had no measurable effect on endosomal/lysosomal pH, osmotic stability, or density, and cell viability was maintained. Transport of endocytosed material to dense lysosomes was delayed in endoglycosidase H treated cells, but the rate of degradation of internalized bovine serum albumin was unchanged.These data provide direct evidence that Asn-linked oligosaccharides protect a subset of lysosomal membrane proteins from proteolytic digestion in intact cells.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence for this conclusion comes fromin vitro studies that utilize mature glycoproteins that are treated with various glycosidases to remove their carbohydrate units. By comparing glycosylated proteins with their unglycosylated counterparts, it has been shown that glycosylation increases thermal stability, solubility, dynamic stability, and resistance to protease digestion (2Stochaj U. Cramer M. Mannherz H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 3Rudd P.M. Joao H.C. Coghill E. Fiten P. Saunders M.R. Opdenakker G. Dwek R.A.

In contrast, experiments designed to analyze the importance of glycosylation in protecting endogenous proteins from proteolysis in living cells have used approaches that prevent the initial glycosylation of the nascent protein. Most of these studies have used tunicamycin, an inhibitor of UDP-GlcNAc:dolichyl-phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase, to produce unglycosylated proteinsin vivo. However, the inhibition of initial glycosylation disrupts protein folding to such an extent that it induces the “unfolded protein response,” a complex stress response characterized by the up-regulation of several chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Brewer J.W. Cleveland J.L. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Many of the misfolded proteins are rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, a decrease in the half-life of a protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin usually reflects endoplasmic reticulum-mediated proteolysis of misfolded proteins. The use of site-directed mutagenesis to remove Asn-linked glycosylation signals has provided a means for exploring the role of individual glycosylation sites on the behavior of the protein, but potential problems with proper protein folding remain. To avoid these difficulties, we sought a method for removing Asn-linked glycans from mature proteins in vivo, thereby bypassing any effects on initial protein folding. In this paper, we describe such a method based on the ability of endoglycosidase H (endo H)1 to cleave high mannose oligosaccharides from fully folded proteins. Using this method, we have examined the role of glycosylation in protecting lysosomal membrane proteins from degradation. Of all intracellular proteins, the components of the lysosome exist in the most proteolytic environment. The integral membrane proteins that are major constituents of the lysosomal membrane are extensively glycosylated and include Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 (lysosome-associatedmembrane proteins) and Limp-1 and Limp-2 (lysosomal integral membraneproteins) (for a review, see Ref. 8Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Indeed, the majority of the weight of these molecules is derived from carbohydrates (9Lewis V. Green S.A. Marsh M. Vihko P. Helenius A. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1989; 268: 360-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As such, these proteins make excellent models to test the hypothesis that core glycosylation protects against proteolysis in vivo. Using endo H to deglycosylate the various lysosomal membrane proteins in intact cells, we have determined that Asn-linked high mannose glycans protect Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 from degradation but are not essential for the prolonged survival of Limp-2.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were obtained from ATCC. The cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. The NRK cells were treated with 1 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) for at least 3 days prior to use in the experiments. The DMJ-containing medium was replaced daily. CHO 15B or DMJ-treated NRK cells were grown in six-well plates (22-mm diameter) to 70% confluency in complete medium containing 20 milliunits/ml endo H for the indicated number of hours. Cells were washed, scraped in PBS, and recovered by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with various antibodies as described in the figure legends. In some experiments, the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 μm) and leupeptin (1 μm) were added simultaneously with endo H. To examine the effect of the endo H on a soluble intracellular protein, CHO 15B cells were allowed to internalize purified human β-glucuronidase for 12 h and then chased for 2 h prior to the addition of the endoglycosidase. CHO 15B and DMJ-treated NRK cell pellets were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and 50-μg aliquots were digested with 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 milliunits of endo H in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 μm pepstatin A and 1 μm leupeptin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Following SDS-PAGE, the CHO 15B extracts were blotted for Lamp-1, and the NRK extracts were blotted for Limp-2. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE and protein transfer onto nitrocellulose were performed using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II and Trans-blot apparatuses according to the manufacturer's instructions. Buffer systems were those of Laemmli and Towbin et al., respectively (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Membranes with transferred proteins were blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with the specified antibodies, as detailed in the figure legends, for 1 h with constant shaking. All antibodies were diluted in PBST containing 3% milk. After washing the blots with PBST, the membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed in PBST. The ECL reaction was for 1 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and the chemiluminescent signals were visualized on autoradiographic film. For quantitative analysis, autoradiographs were analyzed using a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with ImageQuant software. The pH of the endosomal/lysosomal system was determined as described by Ohkuma and Poole with modifications (22Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). The method of Percoll gradient fractionation has been described previously (24Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CHO 15B cells were grown in 10-cm plates to 70% confluency and incubated in complete medium in the presence or absence of 20 milliunits/ml endo H for 18 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in complete medium containing 3 × 106 cpm of 125I-labeled β-glucuronidase for 15 min. Residual radiolabeled ligand was removed by three washes with complete medium, and the cells were chased for 30 or 60 min in complete medium. Cells were homogenized, and subcellular organelles were fractionated on 18% Percoll gradients as described (24Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nine 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient; 5% was assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity, and the remainder was counted in a γ-counter. NRK cells were grown on coverslips in complete media and treated with 20 milliunits/ml endo H for greater than 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS; fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS; permeabilized in PBS containing 5% donkey sera, 5% goat serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% saponin for 30 min; washed with PBS; and double-labeled with primary antibodies as described in the figure legends. Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Slides were examined by using a Nikon epifluorescence microscope. Cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 20 milliunits/ml endo H as described above. Acridine Orange was then added to the medium for 5 min, and the cells were immediately photographed. We have addressed the role of glycosylation of lysosomal membrane proteins at the level of the endosomal/lysosomal system by removing the Asn-linked oligosaccharides from mature proteins in living cells using a novel method based on the activity of endo H. This enzyme cleaves at the chitobiose core of Asn-linked high mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides, leaving behind a single N-acetylglucosamine (we will refer to this as deglycosylation). Because endo H is incapable of cleaving processed, complex-type oligosaccharides, we adopted two complementary strategies to prevent the formation of such structures in the cells under investigation. In the first strategy, we utilized a ricin-resistant CHO cell line (CHO 15B) deficient in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoproteinN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity (19Gottlieb C. Skinner A.M. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Gottlieb C. Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is necessary for processing Man5GlcNA2to complex-type structures, and consequently the Asn-linked oligosaccharides in the cell line remain as high mannose forms (Man5–9GlcNAc2), which are endo H substrates (26Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). The second strategy employed the Golgi α-mannosidase I inhibitor DMJ (27Bischoff J. Kornfeld R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 326-331Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NRK cells grown in the presence of 1 mmDMJ for 3 days contain glycoproteins with high mannose oligosaccharides that are cleavable by endo H. In the initial experiments, 20 milliunits/ml endo H was added to the media of CHO 15B cells or DMJ-treated NRK cells. After various times of incubation, cell lysates were prepared, and the state of the lysosomal membrane proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting. By 3 h of endo H treatment, a decrease in the molecular weight of the lysosomal glycoproteins Lamp-1, Lamp-2, and Limp-2 was observed, consistent with the removal of multiple Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides (Fig.1). Interestingly, in both CHO 15B cells (A) and DMJ-treated NRK cells (B) the decline in the molecular weight of Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 was associated with a significant loss of immunoreactivity on the immunoblots. This decline continued such that almost all of the Lamp-1 immunoreactivity was lost by 18 h, and the Lamp-2 disappeared by 6–9 h. The rate of loss of deglycosylated Lamp-2 was slowed by the addition of the lysosomal protease inhibitors pepstatin A and leupeptin to the incubation medium, consistent with the loss being due to proteolysis, most likely in the lysosome (Fig. 2). However, the protease inhibitors were least effective at protecting the lowest molecular weight (most deglycosylated) forms of Lamp-2. This observation emphasizes the susceptibility of the Lamp-2 protein core to proteolysis in the absence of a threshold level of glycosylation. Deglycosylated Lamp-1 was also partially protected in the presence of leupeptin and pepstatin A (data not shown). These findings directly demonstrate the importance of the multiple Asn-linked glycans of Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 for protecting the protein core from digestion in the proteolytic environment of the lysosome. The molecular weight of Limp-2 was also reduced after DMJ-treated NRK cells were incubated in medium containing endo H (Fig. 1 C). However, in contrast to the findings with Lamp-1 and Lamp-2, Limp-2 was relatively stable in the lysosomal environment in the absence of high mannose oligosaccharides as demonstrated by the minor reduction in Limp-2 protein observed with 48 h of endo H treatment. To confirm that all of the Asn-linked glycans of native Limp-2 are accessible to endo H, DMJ-treated NRK cells that had been incubated in the presence of endo H for 30 h were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and the proteins were denatured by boiling in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol followed by redigestion with endo H. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the redigested Limp-2 migrated at the same position on SDS-PAGE as the material originally recovered from the endo H-treated cells. This indicated that endo H releases all the high mannose units from native Limp-2. Since the endo H was added to the medium of living cells, it could encounter the various lysosomal membrane proteins when they traffic to the cell surface (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D. Cell. 1987; 49: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the endo H could be internalized by pinocytosis and act at the level of the endosomal/lysosomal vesicular compartments. To distinguish these two possibilities, we first incubated Triton X-100 lysates of CHO 15B and DMJ-treated NRK cells with various concentrations of endo H for 30 min and then determined the extent of deglycosylation of Lamp-1 and Limp-2 (Fig. 3 A). It is apparent that both proteins are significantly deglycosylated by 0.1 milliunit of endo H and fully deglycosylated by 2.5 milliunits. Thus, if the living cells took up just a few percent of the 20 milliunits/ml endo H from the medium over the 3–6-h period of the standard experiments, there would probably be sufficient intracellular endo H to deglycosylate the lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, assuming that the endo H remained active in the proteolytic environment of the endosomal/lysosomal system. To test for intracellular endoglycosidase activity, we examined the effect of endo H treatment on an intracellular pool of β-glucuronidase, a soluble lysosomal glycoprotein. CHO 15B cells were allowed to internalize β-glucuronidase for 12 h and then were incubated with 20 milliunits/ml endo H for various times. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the entire pool of internalized β-glucuronidase was deglycosylated after 6 h of endo H treatment (lane d). No endo H cleavage was detected when cells were incubated briefly (15 min) with the glycosidase and collected in its presence, thereby excluding the possibility that deglycosylation occurred during processing of the sample (lane e). Since none of the β-glucuronidase recovered in the lysates could have cycled to the cell surface (because endo H would have removed the oligosaccharide bearing the mannose 6-phosphate tag and thus prevented reinternalization), these observations indicate that at least a fraction of the endo H was internalized by the cells. After 18 h of endo H treatment, greater than 95% of total Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 was degraded. Since vacuolation of the cytoplasm was observed in treated cells (see below), we considered the possibility that prolonged exposure to the endoglycosidase resulted in irreversible cellular destruction. In an attempt to address this issue, DMJ-treated NRK cells were incubated in the presence of endo H for 24 h to deplete Lamps and then allowed to recover for 24 h following the removal of the endo H from the medium. As shown by the immunoblots in Fig. 5, the level of Lamp-1 protein went from undetectable after endo H treatment (lane c) to nearly normal levels (compare lane f withlane e) after the 24-h chase in the absence of endo H. This finding indicates that the cells are viable and that the Lamp-1 biosynthetic pathway is intact after the prolonged endo H treatment. The rate at which Lamp-1 was replenished is consistent with the documented half-life of this protein (9Lewis V. Green S.A. Marsh M. Vihko P. Helenius A. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations were made with Lamp-2 (data not shown). Since the length of endo H treatment required to deplete Lamps does not affect cell viability, we used this method to investigate possible lysosomal functions of Lamp-1 and Lamp-2. Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 have been estimated to constitute about 12% of the proteins in the lysosomal membrane (29Fukuda M. Viitala J. Matteson J. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18920-18928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This density of Lamps, in conjunction with their extensive glycosylation, has been suggested to form a carbohydrate barrier to the hydrolytic lysosomal lumen that would protect other proteins embedded in the lysosomal membrane (e.g. components of the vacuolar H+-ATPase), as well as the membrane itself (8Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 9Lewis V. Green S.A. Marsh M. Vihko P. Helenius A. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Lamps prevent degradative damage of the proton pump, we assessed the function of this macromolecular complex under conditions of Lamp depletion. The combined endosomal and lysosomal pH in living cells was measured using established methods based on the pH-dependent signals from FITC-dextran (22Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). In these experiments, CHO 15B cells were allowed to internalize FITC-dextran for 15 h and then were incubated in the absence or presence of 20 milliunits/ml endo H to deplete the Lamps. Under these conditions, the endosomal/lysosomal pH was determined to be 5.4 ± 0.2 for untreated cells and 5.3 ± 0.16 for endo H-treated cells (Fig.6). These findings indicate that the deglycosylation and subsequent depletion of Lamps have no significant effect on the endosomal/lysosomal pH. The activity of the proton pump was further tested by measuring the pH change induced by the addition of 10 mm NH4Cl and the rate and degree of acidification after washing out this weak base. After removal from the NH4Cl solution, the endosomal/lysosomal pH rebounded with identical kinetics to initial levels in both endo H-treated and untreated cells, which demonstrates the presence of an active proton pump. Therefore, we conclude that glycosylated Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 are not vital for vacuolar H+/ATPase function. To test the possibility that the Lamps play a structural role in stabilizing the lysosomal membrane or act as a barrier to protect the membrane from digestion, we assessed the ability of Lamp-depleted lysosomes to withstand hypoosmotic conditions. Control and Lamp-depleted lysosomes were equally susceptible to hypoosmotic conditions, with approximately half of the β-hexosaminidase activity being released after incubation in 125 mm sucrose (data not shown). Furthermore, in comparison with untreated cells, we observed no change in the amount of lysis induced by mechanical stress or in the enzyme activity released during the initial isolation of lysosomes from the postnuclear supernatant (data not shown). From these data, we conclude that the integrity of the lysosomal membranes is not grossly altered by Lamp depletion. Lysosomes are characterized not only by the presence of acid hydrolases but also by the organelle's high density. We considered the possibility that Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 might be required for the formation of these dense structures. To address this, we subjected cell homogenates of untreated and endo H-treated cells to subcellular fractionation on 18% Percoll gradients. Under these conditions, dense lysosomes are recovered in the bottom third of the gradient, whereas lighter organelles, including endosomes, are found in the upper third of the gradient. As shown in Fig. 7, the distribution of Limp-2 in the gradient was identical in the control and Lamp-depleted DMJ-treated NRK cells. This establishes that Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 are not necessary for the formation of dense lysosomes. However, the dense lysosome fraction of the Lamp-depleted cells had a 30–60% decrease in the proportion of total β-hexosaminidase activity recovered in the gradients (Fig. 7). A similar decrease in the percentage of β-glucuronidase activity in the dense lysosome fraction was also observed in endo H-treated cells (data not shown). In both CHO and NRK cells, treatment with endo H did not result in a decrease in the total activity of these two acid hydrolases, although the β-glucuronidase was documented to be deglycosylated (Fig. 4). The finding that the distribution of the soluble acid hydrolases differs from that of Limp-2 in the gradient is consistent with an alteration in the trafficking of the acid hydrolases, particularly in their transport to dense lysosomes. Direct evidence for this possibility was obtained by monitoring the arrival of endocytosed125I-labeled β-glucuronidase in dense lysosomes. In this experiment, control and Lamp-depleted CHO 15B cells were allowed to internalize 125I-labeled β-glucuronidase for 15 min, and following a chase period of 30 or 60 min, the cells were homogenized and subjected to subcellular fractionation on 18% Percoll gradients. The distribution of the 125I-labeled β-glucuronidase was determined, and the percentage recovered in the dense lysosome fraction was calculated (Fig. 8). It is apparent that the transport of β-glucuronidase to the dense lysosomes is slower in the endo H-treated cells, although it eventually reaches that organelle. This result is consistent with there being a partial block in the transport of material between endosomes and dense lysosomes and helps explain the observed alteration in the steady state distribution of the acid hydrolases. We next compared the ability of control and endo H-treated CHO 15B to degrade 125I-labeled phosphopentamannosylated bovine serum albumin that had been internalized via the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor. The rate of proteolysis was very similar in both cell types, demonstrating that the Lamp-depleted cells maintained the proteolytic function of the endosomal/lysosomal system (data not shown). In view of the lag in transporting β-glucuronidase to dense lysosomes in the endo H-treated cells, it would appear that at least a portion of the proteolysis is occurring in endosomal compartments proximal to the dense lysosomes. This is consistent with the conclusion of Tjelle et al. (30Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2905-2914PubMed Google Scholar) that prelysosomal compartments are major sites of protein degradation. Phase contrast microscopy of NRK cells that had been treated with endo H for 12 h revealed the presence of swollen phase-lucent vacuoles. These vacuoles took up Acridine Orange, indicating an acidic lumen (Fig.9, A and B). The vacuoles stained for Limp-2, which is present in both late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 9, C and E), but were negative for the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor, a marker of late endosomes (Fig. 9 D) (31Griffiths G.

The Ste20 family of kinases can be divided into two structurally distinct subfamilies.

Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Similar to Ste20, PAK1 has been demonstrated to be a Cdc42 and Rac1 effector molecule and specifically regulates the JNK pathway, one of the mammalian MAPK pathways (2Bagrodia S. Derijard B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is activated by a variety of stress-inducing agents, including osmotic and heat shock, UV irradiation, protein inhibitors, and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF (4Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). JNKs are activated through threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation by MAPK/ERK kinases 4 and 7 (MAPK kinase), which are in turn phosphorylated and activated by MAPK kinase kinases, including MEKK1, mixed lineage kinase 2, and mixed lineage kinase 3 (4Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). In addition to the activation of the JNK pathway, PAK1 has also been demonstrated to be a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (5Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).The second subgroup of Ste20 family of kinases is represented by the germinal center kinase (GCK), and this family is, therefore, often referred to as GCK family of protein kinases (6Kyriakis J.M.

In contrast to Ste20 and PAK1, GCK family members have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory region. Many GCK family members, including GCK, GCKR, hematopoietic protein kinase 1, GCK-like kinase, HPK/GCK-like kinase, and NCK-interacting kinase (NIK), have also been demonstrated to activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in 293 cells (7Pombo C.M.

Severin is an F-actin fragmenting and capping enzyme that regulates Dictyostelium motility. This finding raised the intriguing possibility that the GCK family kinases may also be involved in regulating cytoskeleton function in addition to their role in regulating the JNK pathway. However, there has being no evidence suggesting the involvement of mammalian GCKs in cytoskeleton regulation.Here, we report a novel mammalian GCK family kinase identified in our yeast two-hybrid screening. It interacts with both Traf2 and NCK, and was therefore designated Traf2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK). It shares highest homology to NIK. We demonstrate in this report that TNIK, like many other GCK family members, is able to specifically activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in Phoenix-A cells. In addition, overexpression of TNIK results in the disruption of F-actin structure in Phoenix-A, NIH-3T3, and Hela cells, thereby providing for the first time evidence that a mammalian GCK family kinase may regulate the cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and CytokinesAntibodies used in this report include anti-HA mAb (Babco) and pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma) and pAb (Santa Cruz), anti-Myc mAb (Babco), anti-Traf2 pAb (Santa Cruz), anti-NCK mAb (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma).

The sequences of the fragments were contained in a partial cDNA clone, KIAA0551 (GenBankTM accession number AB011123). Antisense oligos TGCGCTTATATTCCAGAAGTAGAGCT and CTGTCTCTGCTCCTCCTCTA were designed according to the 5′ end sequence of KIAA0551, and the full-length TNIK cDNA was cloned from reverse-transcribed human brain mRNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR. Northern blotting was performed on human multitissue Northern blot according to the manufacturer's recommendations (CLONTECH). A PCR product amplified from nt 1264 to 2427 of TNIK coding region was used as a probe.Plasmid ConstructionFull-length human TNIK was cloned into pCI (Promega)-derived expression vector pYCI under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter with an HA epitope tag (AYPYDVPDYA) inserted on the N terminus by PCR. A kinase mutant form of TNIK, designated as TNIK (KM) was constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligos AGCTTGCAGCCATCAGGGTTATGGATGTCAC and GTGACATCCATAACCTTGATGGCTGCAAGCT to change the highly conserved lysine 54 in the kinase domain to arginine. Full-length human Traf2 was cloned into pYCI with a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDKG) inserted on the N terminus by PCR. Full-length human NCK was similarly cloned into pYCI with a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus. Myc-JNK2 and Myc-ERK1 were constructed in the pCR3.1 vector with a Myc epitope tag (ASMEQKLISEEDLN) inserted on the N terminus of JNK2 and ERK1, respectively. All of the truncation mutants were constructed by PCR. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection of Phoenix-A Cells, and ImmunoprecipitationPhoenix-A cells (derivatives of 293 cells) (15Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Coico R. Curr. Protocols Immunol., Suppl. 1999; 31: 10.28.1-10.28.17Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of Phoenix-A cells was performed using the standard calcium phosphate method (15Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Coico R. Curr. Protocols Immunol., Suppl. 1999; 31: 10.28.1-10.28.17Google Scholar). Either 4 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate or 3 × 106 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish were seeded 16 h before transfection. 3 μg of DNA was used in the transfection for each well of a six-well plate, and 10 μg DNA was used for each 100-mm dish. Medium was changed 8 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed 24 h after transfection. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min). For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates (2 × 106 cells/lane) were rotated with 2–3 μg of desired antibodies and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1.5 h. Immune complexes were precipitated, and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer. Washed precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. Supersignal and Supersignal West Duro substrates (Pierce) were used as detection systems for the Western blotting.In Vitro Kinase AssaysFor the JNK in vitrokinase assay, Myc-JNK2 was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells with TNIK mutants, Traf2, or MEKK1 as described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm β-glycerophospate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. Myc-JNK2 was precipitated from clarified cell lysates with an anti-Myc mAb, and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). For the kinase reactions, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) c-Jun-(1–79) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μm PKI peptide (Sigma), 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (Norvex), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then loaded onto SDS-PAGE. ERK and p38 in vitro kinase assays were conducted in a similar fashion. For ERK kinase assays, an anti-Myc mAb was used to immunoprecipitate Myc-ERK1, and myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used as an exogenous substrate. For p38 kinase assays, an anti-FLAG mAb was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-p38, and GST-ATF2 (Santa Cruz) was used as an exogenous substrate. For in vitro kinase assays on TNIK, 3 μg of wild type HA-TNIK or 3 μg of kinase mutant form of HA-TNIK was expressed in Phoenix-A cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Immune complexes were subjected to kinase assays as described above in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of Gelsolin as an exogenous substrate.Fluorescence MicroscopyPhoenix-A cells seeded in six-well plates were co-transfected with GFP and TNIK constructs as described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 fluorescent microscope. For detection of apoptosis, Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) was added to transfected Phoenix-A cells (final concentration, 2 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before microscopic observation.Determination of Actin Distribution4 × 105 Phoenix-A cells per well in a six-well plate were transfected with 3 μg of control vector, HA-TNIK(WT) or HA-TNIK(KM). 24 h after transfection, culture media were carefully removed. Cells were lysed directly on the plate using 250 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants represented the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. Pellets were washed once with 500 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer and dissolved in 500 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. DNA was sheared by sonication. This represented the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions derived from the same number of cells were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted with an anti-β-actin mAb to determine the content of F- and G-actin.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of TNIKUsing a human brain cDNA library and a T/B cell library in our yeast two-hybrid pathway mapping effort, we identified a novel germinal center kinase family member that interacted with both Traf2 and NCK. A GenBankTM search revealed that this kinase is identical to a partial cDNA clone with unknown function, KIAA0551 (GenBankTM accession numberAB011123). The 5′ end sequence of KIAA0551 was cloned from cDNAs prepared from human brain mRNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR, and full-length cDNA clones of KIAA0551 were obtained by RT-PCR. We designated this protein TNIK, for Traf2 and NCKInteracting Kinase (Fig.1 A).Figure 1Cloning of TNIK . A, sequence alignment of TNIK (top sequence) to NIK (bottom sequence). Identical residues are shaded with black,and homologous residues are shaded with gray. The three alternatively spliced exons are marked by a solid line above the TNIK sequence. B, PCR of TNIK fragments from human spleen, heart, and brain cDNAs. Oligos corresponding to nt 1264–1281 and nt 2427–2410 were used as primers. C,diagram of NIK and TNIK spliced isoforms. The percentage of homology between TNIK and NIK in individual domains is indicated. The three alternatively spliced exons are hatched, and the amino acid boundaries corresponding to the three exons are indicated.D, in vitro kinase assay of TNIK. Phoenix-A cells in six-well plates were transiently transfected with 3 μg of HA-TNIK(WT) (lanes 1 and 3) or HA-TNIK(KM) (lanes 2 and 4). Expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Immune complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assay (lanes 1 and2) or immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (lanes 3 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The longest TNIK clone was encoded by a polypeptide of 1360 amino acids. It had an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain and a C-terminal germinal center kinase homology (GCKH) region. It shared about 90% amino acid identity with a previously cloned GCK family member, NIK, in both the kinase domain and the GCKH domain (12Su Y. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, TNIK was only 53% identical to NIK in the intermediate region (Fig. 1, A and C). Two shorter clones of TNIK were also obtained: one lacked nt 1338–1424 (amino acids 447–475) and nt 2383–2406 (amino acids 795–802), and the other lacked those two regions plus nt 1609–1773 (amino acids 537–591) (Fig. 1 C). These clones suggested that TNIK may have multiple spliced isoforms. Primers encompassing these three alternatively spliced regions were designed and used for PCR from spleen, heart, and brain cDNAs. The relative amounts of the different isoforms, seen as multiple bands amplified from both spleen and brain, varied among the different tissues (Fig. 1 B). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into a TA cloning vector and the inserts sequenced. All eight combinations from the alternative splicing of these three regions were identified. These eight spliced isoforms of TNIK were designated as TNIK1 to TNIK8 (Fig. 1 C). TNIK1 was used in all the experiments described in this report.To prove that the cDNA clone we obtained represented an active protein kinase, a putative kinase mutant form of TNIK, designated as TNIK(KM), was constructed with a conserved lysine (Lys-54) residue in the ATP binding pocket mutated to arginine. An HA epitope tag was inserted on the N-terminal portion of TNIK(WT) and TNIK(KM). Both proteins were transiently expressed in Phoenix-A cells, and the expressed proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation and anin vitro kinase assay. A strong phosphorylated band at 150 kDa was detected in the TNIK(WT) expressed lane, but not in the TNIK(KM) expressed lane (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody showed equal levels of expression of both TNIK(WT) and TNIK(KM) at 150 kDa (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the phosphorylated band in the in vitro kinase assay represented autophosphorylated TNIK, and the TNIK(KM) mutant was deficient in protein kinase activity.Tissue Distribution of TNIKThe expression pattern of the TNIK message was examined by human multi-tissue Northern blot. Because TNIK shared high homology with NIK, a probe corresponding to nt 1264–2427 of TNIK was used to rule out any potential cross-hybridization. This region shared only 40% amino acid identity with NIK. Three major bands of sizes 6.5, 7.5, and 9.5 kilobases were detected (Fig. 2). Alternative splicing in the coding region described above is unlikely to account for the size differences among the three messages, because the largest isoform is only 273 base pairs bigger than the smallest isoform. Alternative splicing in the untranslated region or alternative usage of poly(A) sites could be possible explanations. This phenomenon is not unique to TNIK. NIK and HPK/GCK-like kinase also have multiple message sizes. TNIK is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels of message detected in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, heart and skeletal muscle predominantly expressed the 6.5-kilobase form; placenta, kidney, and pancreas predominantly expressed the 7.5-kilobase form; brain, lung, and liver expressed all three forms at a similar level. It is currently unknown whether these messages have different functional roles.Figure 2Expression of TNIK message in human tissues. Top panel, human multi-tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a probe corresponding to nt 1264–2427 in the TNIK coding region. Bottom panel, the same blot was stripped and reblotted with an β-actin probe to control for the amount of mRNA on each lane. MW, molecular weight (in thousands).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of TNIK with Traf2 and NCKTo confirm the interaction of TNIK with Traf2, N-terminal HA-tagged TNIK was transiently expressed in Phoenix-A cells, and HA-TNIK was immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA antibody. The immune complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-Traf2 antibody. Endogenous Traf2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HA-TNIK (Fig.3 A, top panel). To map the interaction domain on TNIK that mediated its interaction with Traf2, we constructed several truncated forms of HA-tagged TNIK (Fig.3 B) and co-expressed them with FLAG-tagged Traf2. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were then blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody to detect the co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Traf2. TNIK(WT), TNIK(N2), TNIK(C1), and TNIK(M) all co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Traf2, suggesting that the intermediate domain of TNIK is sufficient for TNIK to interact with Traf2 (Fig. 3 C, top panel, lanes 1, 3, 4,and 6). However, TNIK(C2) consistently showed weak interaction with Traf2 (lane 5), suggesting that the GCKH domain was also involved in the interaction with Traf2. TNIK(N1), the TNIK mutant with only the kinase domain, failed to interact with Traf2 (lane 2). Expression levels of the transfected proteins were controlled by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3 C, middle and bottom panels). In addition, TNIK8, the shortest form of TNIK, was still able to interact with Traf2 (data not shown), suggesting that the three alternatively spliced exons were not required for TNIK to interact with Traf2.Figure 3Interaction of TNIK with Traf2 . A, co-immunoprecipitation of TNIK with endogenous Traf2. Phoenix-A cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of vector (lane 1) or HA-TNIK (lane 2). Top panel, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb and blotted with an anti-Traf2 pAb. Middle and bottom panels, 110 of cell lysates were blotted with an anti-HA mAb or an anti-Traf2 pAb to control for protein expression. B,schematic diagram of TNIK mutants. C, mapping of domains on TNIK that mediated its interaction with Traf2. FLAG-Traf2 was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells with HA-TNIK mutants. Top panel, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA pAb and blotted with an anti-FLAG mAb. Middle and bottom panels, cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG mAb or an anti-HA mAb. D, schematic diagram of Traf2 mutants. E, mapping of domains on Traf2 that mediated its interaction with TNIK. HA-TNIK was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells with FLAG-Traf2 mutants, and the cell lysates were analyzed as in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then mapped the domains on Traf2 that mediated the interaction with TNIK. FLAG-tagged Traf2 mutants (Fig. 3 D) were co-expressed with HA-TNIK, and the lysates were subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were then blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody. Traf2(WT), Traf2(87–501), and Traf2(272–501) were all able to co-immunoprecipitate with HA-TNIK, whereas Traf2(1–272) failed to interact with HA-TNIK (Fig. 3 E, top panel). Immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies showed comparable expression levels of the transfected proteins (Fig.3 E, middle and bottom panels). This result suggested that the Traf domain is required for Traf2 to interact with TNIK. However, because the interaction of full-length Traf2 with TNIK is stronger then that of either Traf2(87–501) or Traf2(272–501), the N-terminal ring finger may directly contribute to the interaction or may stabilize the configuration of the Traf2 molecule to facilitate this interaction.Interaction of TNIK with NCKThe interaction of TNIK with NCK was investigated in a similar fashion. Following transient expression of HA-TNIK in Phoenix-A cells, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and blotted with an anti-NCK antibody. Endogenous NCK specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HA-TNIK (Fig.4 A, top panel). To map the domains on TNIK required for this interaction, HA-tagged TNIK mutants were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged NCK, and the HA-TNIK mutants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. The immune complexes were then blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody. TNIK(WT), TNIK(N2), TNIK(C1), and TNIK(M) were all able to associate with NCK, suggesting that the intermediate domain is also sufficient for TNIK to bind NCK (Fig.4 B, top panel, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6). Neither the GCKH domain nor the kinase domain showed any detectable binding to NCK (lanes 2 and 5). Immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies showed equivalent levels of expression of the transfected preoteins (Fig. 4 B, middle andbottom panels).Figure 4Interaction of TNIK with NCK. A, co-immunoprecipitation of TNIK with endogenous NCK. Phoenix-A cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of vector (lane 1) or HA-TNIK (lane 2).Top panel, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA pAb and blotted with an anti-NCK mAb. Middle andbottom panels, 110 of cell lysates were blotted with an anti-NCK mAb or an anti-HA mAb. B, mapping of domains on TNIK that mediated its interaction with NCK.

Middle and bottom panels, cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG mAb or an anti-HA mAb to control for protein expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of JNK2 by TNIKWe next examined whether TNIK was able to activate the JNK pathway. 1, 2, or 3 μg of TNIK expression plasmid was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells with Myc-JNK2. 24 h after transfection, Myc-JNK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its kinase activity measured using GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate. Co-transfection of TNIK enhanced JNK2 kinase activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5 A, top panel, lanes 1 and3–5). When 3 μg of TNIK was transfected, JNK2 activity was enhanced 3–4-fold. A similar magnitude of JNK2 activation was observed when cells were treated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml of TNF (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lanes 1, 2, and 5). Also consistent with published result (16Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), Traf2 potently activated JNK2 activity (lane 6). The expression levels of Myc-JNK2 were controlled by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel).Figure 5Specific activation of the JNK pathway by TNIK . A, overexpression of TNIK activated JNK2. 1 μg of Myc-JNK2 was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells in six-well plates with 3 μg of vector (lanes 1 and 2); 1, 2, or 3 μg of TNIK plus 2, 1, or 0 μg of vector (lanes 3–5); or 1 μg of Traf2 plus 2 μg of vector (lane 6).Top panel, Myc-JNK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by an anti-Myc mAb and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as an exogenous substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2128246500,"Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) has been shown recently to be necessary for mediating activity-dependent neuronal survival. In this study, we show that calcium signals regulate MEF2 activity through a serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. In cultured primary cerebellar granule neurons, the electrophoretic mobility of MEF2A protein was sensitive to the level of extracellular potassium chloride (KCl) and depolarizing concentrations of KCl led to hypophosphorylation of the protein. The specific inhibitors of calcineurin cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 could overcome KCl-dependent MEF2A hypophosphorylation. The effects of CsA and FK506 were KCl specific as they had little effect on MEF2A phosphorylation when granule neurons were cultured in the presence of full media. Hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A led to the loss of its DNA binding activity as determined by DNA mobility shift assay. Consistent with this, CsA/FK506 also inhibited MEF2-dependent reporter gene expression. These findings demonstrate that regulation of MEF2A by calcium signals requires the action of protein phosphatase calcineurin. By maintaining MEF2A in a hypophosphorylated state, calcineurin enhances the DNA binding activity of MEF2A and therefore maximizes its transactivation capability. The identification of MEF2 as a novel target of calcineurin may provide in part a biochemical explanation for the therapeutic and toxic effects of immunosuppressants CsA and FK506.

Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). A classic and important in vitro model that mimics the in vivo events of the trophic action of neuronal activity is potassium chloride (KCl)-dependent survival of primary cerebellar granule cells (2Franklin J.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Hack N. Hidaka H. Wakefield M.J. Balazs R. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There, the elevated levels of extracellular potassium promote survival by opening L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels leading to an influx of calcium into cells. The molecular mechanisms by which calcium entry promotes neuronal survival have just begun to be defined. Several protein kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways are activated by calcium influx through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (1Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). These include the classical protein kinase C isoforms, the calcium-dependent adenylate cyclases, members of the calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase family, and the components of Ras-MAPK1 signaling pathway. However, evidence for the involvement of these protein kinases in calcium-dependent neuronal survival has been limited. Recently, calcium influx has been shown to activate the phosphtidylinositide-3′OH kinase/Akt pathway and p38 MAPK signaling pathway providing a mechanism by which calcium promotes neuronal survival (4Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol.

In addition to the activation of protein kinases, calcium signals have also been shown to increase the activity of phosphatase calcineurin (also known as PP2B) (6Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 7Halpain S. Girault J.A. Greengard P.

Calcineurin is a calcium and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase involved in many cellular processes including neuronal excitability (7Halpain S. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nature. 1990; 343: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and the prevention of neurotoxicity (8Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although many of its identified substrates to date are structural proteins, one of the best studied calcineurin targets is nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), a transcription factor that when dephosphorylated by calcineurin, translocates into the nucleus to activate gene expression (9Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 10Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies by several groups suggest that calcineurin may also regulate gene expression by acting on another important transcription regulator myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). It has been shown that putative MEF2-binding sites within promoters of Epstein-Barr virus lytic gene BZLF1, nur77 orphan steroid receptor, and some slow fiber-specific genes can confer calcium inducibility and are calcineurin sensitive (12Chin E.R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Despite its DNA binding sites having been implicated in mediating calcium/calcineurin-dependent gene transcription, MEF2 itself has not been shown to be the target of or regulated by calcineurin. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which calcineurin regulates MEF2-dependent gene transcription remain undefined. MEF2 belongs to a family of MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor) box transcription factors and plays a critical role in muscle gene expression (15Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Four members of mammalian MEF2s have been identified known as MEF2A to D. They bind to DNA as homo- and heterodimers through the consensus MEF2 binding sequence C/TTA(A/T)4TAG/A to regulate gene expression (16Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In this study, a mechanism by which calcium signals regulate the function of MEF2A in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons has been characterized. This signaling pathway involves calcineurin. Specifically, blocking intracellular calcium signals reduced MEF2-dependent reporter gene activity. Both KCl withdrawal and the inhibition of calcineurin by CsA and FK506 led to the hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A protein. The hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A inhibited its DNA binding activity. Consistent with this, both CsA and FK506 blocked calcium-dependent MEF2 reporter gene expression. These findings indicate that calcineurin, in response to calcium signals, enhances the transactivation activity of MEF2A by keeping it in a hypophosphorylated state. Cerebellar granule neurons were cultured from Long-Evans rats from postnatal day 6 (P6) on polyornithine-coated plates or glass coverslips as described (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 18Schulz J.B. Weller M. Klockgether T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4696-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in basal Eagle's medium (Sigma) with calf serum (10%, Hyclone), 25 mm KCl, and 2 mmglutamine (full media). One day after culture (1 DIV), the antimitotic cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to the media to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. In general, cells were cultured for an additional 5 days before experimentation. Cerebellar granule neurons were transfected by the calcium phosphate method on 5 or 6 (DIV) largely as described (19Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then returned to conditioned full media for 2 h. Cells were then washed three times with basal Eagle's medium without serum but with 25 mm KCl and 2 mm glutamine (KCl media) and placed in the same media or washed with and placed in media containing lower concentrations of KCl for an additional 10 h. CAT assays were performed as described (16Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). 6 DIV cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with a MEF2 CAT reporter gene construct along with a plasmid encoding β-Gal (pRSVβ-Gal). The expression of the CAT gene was regulated by 2 copies of the MEF2 DNA-binding site inserted 5′ to basal TK promoter (pTKMEF2 × 2CAT). Cells extracts were assayed for both CAT and β-Gal activities. Whole cell extracts from cultured primary cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (19Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in full media or in the presence or absence of KCl with or without calcineurin inhibitor CsA (0.1 μm) or FK06 (0.1 μm) for the times indicated. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 100 μl of buffer (for 60-mm plates) containing 20 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and anti-MEF2A polyclonal antibodies were used to determine the expression of MEF2A protein. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 5–10 μg of extract was used to incubate with specific probes (20McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C., Yu, Y.T. Andres V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were first preincubated in a buffer containing poly(dI-dC)/poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 15 min. 32P-Labeled specific probes were added and the reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for another 15 min. For specific complex disruption, 1 μl of polyclonal antibodies was included in the preincubation buffer. The in vitro phosphatase treatment was carried out as suggested by the manufacturer (Sigma). Cell lysates were diluted 10 times with alkaline phosphatase reaction buffer and mixed with 3 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase covalentely linked to agarose beads (Sigma) at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by removing the AP-agarose beads through centrifugation. To address the activation of MEF2-dependent gene expression by neuronal activity, we measured the levels of expression from a CAT reporter gene that contains two MEF2 DNA-binding sites within its 5′-regulatory region. Previous studies including our own have shown that MEF2A protein is expressed by cerebellar granule neurons in vivo and in vitro (21Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Leifer D.

Lett. 1995; 200: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).2 Our recent work has demonstrated that expression from the MEF2 reporter gene is activated in granule neurons cultured in the presence of KCl and the enhanced expression requires MEF2 DNA-binding sites.2However, it was not clear whether withdrawal of KCl could lead to the inhibition of MEF2 reporter gene expression. To test this, MEF2-driven CAT reporter gene activity was measured in the absence of KCl following transfection. Prolonged removal of trophic factor KCl results in neuronal apoptosis at a rate of about 30% of cell death within 24 h following KCl withdrawal (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). 3Z. Mao, unpublished observations. To exclude the possibility that the change of MEF2-dependent CAT activity following KCl withdrawal was due to cell death, CAT activity was measured 10 to 12 h after KCl removal, a time when most cells were still morphologically healthy and no obvious cell death could be detected.3 As expected, robust MEF2 DNA-binding site-dependent CAT activity could be detected when cells were cultured in the presence of KCl (25 mm) (Fig.1) and this activity depended on calcium influx through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels.3Removal of KCl (5 mm) resulted in a significant decrease in the level of CAT expression (Fig. 1). Dose-response analysis revealed that the degree of decline in MEF2-driven CAT activity paralleled the levels of extracellular KCl as less than optimal levels of KCl (10 mm) led to an intermediate change of CAT expression. These results suggested that calcium signals are critical for activation of MEF2-dependent gene regulation. To study the mechanisms by which the calcium signals regulate MEF2-driven reporter gene expression, we analyzed the expression of MEF2 protein in the presence and absence of KCl. Although the levels of MEF2A protein expressed by granule neurons within 6 h following KCl withdrawal did not change (data not shown), MEF2A protein prepared from KCl-deprived granule cells showed a significant alteration in its mobility when analyzed by Western blot. There were at least two major species of MEF2A protein detectable in KCl-treated granule cell extracts (Fig. 2 A). KCl withdrawal, however, resulted in the disappearance of the faster migrating species with a corresponding increase in the level of the slower migrating species of MEF2A (Fig. 2 A). The change of the ratio of the faster and slower migrating MEF2A species suggested that there is a KCl-dependent change in the post-translational modification of MEF2A. To establish that the mobility change of MEF2A resulting from KCl withdrawal was indeed due to variable degrees in phosphorylation, protein extracts from granule neurons deprived of KCl were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP). Treatment of KCl-deprived protein samples with AP reversed the mobility of MEF2A from slow to fast migration and resulted in the appearance of a MEF2A species migrating even faster than the lower MEF2A band found in KCl-treated neurons (Fig. 2 B). These findings confirmed the KCl-dependent hypo- and hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A in granule cells and suggested that calcium signals maintain MEF2A protein in a hypophosphorylated state through the activation of a protein phosphatase. To characterize the phosphatase involved in dephosphorylation of MEF2A in response to membrane depolarization in granule neurons, we studied the effects of calcineurin-specific inhibitors on MEF2A mobility by Western blot. Previous studies have identified several calcium responsive promoters and mapped the calcium-responsive and cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive elements to the putative MEF2 DNA-binding site (9Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 12Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 14Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). But it was not clear from those studies whether MEF2 was a target of this signaling pathway. To address this question, we tested the effect of blocking calcineurin on MEF2A phosphorylation. Treatment of granule neurons cultured in the presence of KCl with either CsA or FK506 led to a change of the level of MEF2A phosphorylation as indicated by the disappearance of the faster migrating band and an increase and up-shift of the slower migrating band of MEF2A (Fig.3, A and B). CsA at a concentration as low as 0.01 μm effectively reversed the effect of KCl and led to increased MEF2A phosphorylation. The effect of CsA or FK506 on MEF2A phosphorylation was relatively specific to KCl as the mobility of MEF2A prepared from granule cells cultured under full media conditions (serum + KCl) was not significantly altered by CsA or FK506 (Fig. 3 C). However, serum alone failed to maintain MEF2A in a hypophosphorylated state even in the absence of calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 3 D). The specific effects of calcineurin inhibitors were further corroborated by the failure of okadaic acid, an inhibitor to serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, to alter the migration of MEF2A (Fig. 3 E). These results suggested that calcineurin was the major phosphatase to dephosphorylate MEF2A in response to calcium signals in granule neurons and was required in mediating calcium-dependent MEF2A hypophosphorylation. KCl withdrawal has been shown to trigger granule cell death, and it has been suggested that granule neurons irreversibly commit themselves to the apoptotic pathway about 2 h following KCl withdrawal (25Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To correlate MEF2A dephosphorylation with cell death, the kinetics of MEF2A hyperphosphorylation after KCl removal or the addition of CsA were analyzed. The mobility change of MEF2A was detectable as early as 15 to 30 min following the withdrawal of KCl and reached its peak at about 2 h (Fig. 4 A). A similar but somewhat delayed pattern was seen with CsA where an alteration in MEF2A migration was first detectable at about 30 to 60 min following the addition of CsA (Fig. 4 B). In general, withdrawal of KCl was more effective in altering the pattern of MEF2A migration than CsA. The inclusion of CsA in addition to KCl withdrawal did not result in any further up-shift in MEF2A migration or shift in the kinetics to an earlier time point (Fig. 4 C). These findings suggested that the change in MEF2A phosphorylation preceded the final commitment of granule neurons to the apoptotic pathway following KCl withdrawal and therefore were consistent with the finding that MEF2 is required for calcium-promoted neuronal survival.2 To study the biochemical consequences of the change in MEF2A dephosphorylation by calcineurin, we assessed MEF2A DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Previous studies of nur77 promoter in T cell activation have shown that the DNA binding activity of MEF2 is constitutive and insensitive to calcium signals, and only the transactivation activity of MEF2 is calcium signal-dependent (14Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To our surprise, we found that MEF2A DNA binding activity in granule neurons was calcium-dependent and could be modulated by calcineurin activity. KCl withdrawal or addition of CsA/FK50 resulted in diminished DNA binding by MEF2A (Fig. 5,A and B). The decline in MEF2A DNA binding activity closely correlated with the change in its pattern of migration, as the decrease in MEF2A DNA binding activity followed a time course consistent with the occurrence and the level of hyperphosphorylated MEF2A species. However, CsA did not significantly affect the DNA binding activity of MEF2A when granule neurons were cultured in full media (Fig. 5 C), consistent with our previous finding that CsA did not result in MEF2A hyperphosphorylation in the presence of full media. These findings suggested that one direct consequence of calcineurin-dependent MEF2A hypophosphorylation in response to calcium influx into granule neurons is the enhancement of the DNA binding ability by MEF2A. The hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A resulting from a decrease in calcineurin activity leads to an inhibition of MEF2A DNA binding. These observations provide a new mechanism by which calcium signals regulate MEF2 activity. The decline of MEF2A DNA binding activity resulting from the inhibition of calcineurin suggested that calcineurin was involved in the activation of MEF2A-dependent genes. To test this, we analyzed the activity of MEF2-driven CAT reporter gene following the inhibition of calcineurin by CsA or FK506. Calcium-dependent MEF2 CAT gene expression was found to be CsA/FK506 sensitive. Both CsA and FK506 significantly reduced the expression of calcium-dependent and MEF2-mediated CAT reporter gene (Fig. 6) suggesting that the activity of calcineurin is required to promote MEF2-dependent gene expression. Calcium signals are critical in mediating many cellular responses including neuronal survival. In this report, we have defined a mechanism whereby calcium signals regulate the activity of MEF2A protein in cultured primary cerebellar granule neurons. Calcium-dependent and calmodulin-regulated calcineurin has been identified as the major phosphatase that regulates MEF2A activity in response to membrane depolarization. The mobility of MEF2A on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is both calcium and calcineurin sensitive. Blocking calcium influx by either lowering the levels of extracellular concentrations of KCl or the inhibition of calcineurin with CsA or FK506 results in the hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A. Hyperphosphorylation of MEF2A significantly reduces its ability to bind to DNA and therefore inhibits its transactivation activity. By maintaining MEF2A protein in a hypophosphorylated state, calcineurin enhances MEF2-dependent gene expression. Previous studies have mapped the calcineurin-dependent induction of the nur77 promoter to the putative MEF2 DNA-binding site (14Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which MEF2 factor mediates the calcineurin-sensitive response in T cells was not clear. Although the transactivation activity of MEF2 requires calcium signals, its DNA binding activity seems to be constitutive and insensitive to calcium signals (14Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our studies show that in cultured cerebellar granule neurons, MEF2A DNA binding activity is calcium sensitive and modulated by calcineurin. The reason for this difference is not clear. It is possible that MEF2 proteins may be regulated differently in response to calcium signals in different cell types. The balancing effect of other phosphatases or kinases may be different in those cells. Finally, different isoforms of MEF2 could be regulated differently. As the antibodies used in the nur77 promoter study do not distinguish between different MEF2 isoforms, it is possible that differential regulation of MEF2 isoforms by calcineurin might be masked. The finding that MEF2A is a downstream target of calcineurin in response to calcium influx raises the question of whether calcineurin dephosphorylates MEF2A directly or indirectly. Given that no other phosphatase cascades have been shown to be the direct substrate of calcineurin in granule neurons, the most simple explanation for this finding is that MEF2A protein is a direct substrate of calcineurin. MEF2 is a nuclear protein. Although it has been shown recently that MEF2 can translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm in myocyte in response to TGF-β (26De Angelis L. Borghi S. Melchionna R. Berghella L. Baccarani-Contri M. Parise F. Ferrari S. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12358-12363Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it does not seem to do so in response to the withdrawal of KCl.3 On the other hand, calcineurin resides primarily in the cytoplasm. Calcineurin can translocate into the nucleus together with its substrate such as NFAT but has not been shown to do so by itself (6Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 28Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). NFAT is expressed in granule cells and can be found in the nucleus of cells treated with KCl (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that calcineurin molecules transported into the cell nucleus with NFAT in response to calcium signals may dephosphorylate MEF2A directly in the nucleus. Together with our studies on p38 MAPK-dependent MEF2 activation in neurons,2 data presented here show that two complementary biochemical mechanisms, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, regulate the activity of MEF2 protein in a synchronized fashion in response to calcium signals. The findings that both p38 MAP kinase and phosphatase calcineurin activate MEF2 in the presence of calcium suggest that these enzymes function through different sites on MEF2. The p38 MAPK sites within MEF2A have been identified in the C-terminal of the protein where its transactivation domain resides (29Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 30Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The hypothesized sites for calcineurin on MEF2A proteins remain unknown. Given that calcineurin inhibitors affect MEF2A DNA binding activity, it is most likely that calcineurin sites are at the N-terminal region of the protein, which contains the highly conserved DNA binding and dimerization domains of MEF2 (30Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is known that the substrate specificity of calcineurin is not only due to a specific sequence but rather determined by both primary and higher order structure features (6Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that preliminary analysis of this region of MEF2 protein failed to identify any obvious calcineurin sites. Previous studies of MEF2 phosphorylation in COS cells have shown that the only known in vivophosphorylation site within this region of MEF2 protein is a casein kinase II site (31Molkentin J.D. Li L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17199-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the casein kinase II site is an unlikely calcineurin target as phosphorylation of this site has been shown to enhance MEF2C DNA binding. These results suggest that the pattern and regulation of MEF2 phosphorylation in granule neurons in response to calcium signaling may be very different from that in COS cells. Given that MEF2 is required for neuronal survival,2blocking calcineurin activity with CsA or FK506 might be expected to induce neuronal death. However, our preliminary studies show that CsA and FK506, either alone or in combination, fail to block the calcium-promoted survival of granule neurons consistently.3The reason for this is unclear. One possible explanation is that CsA and FK506 may not completely abolish calcineurin activity in vivo. Consistent with this, our own analysis demonstrates that in general, KCl withdrawal results in a higher degree of MEF2A upshifting and CsA or FK506, even at higher dose, is less effective than KCl withdrawal in shifting MEF2A to a hyperphosphorylated form. This is in agreement with the finding that a much higher degree of residual MEF2A DNA binding activity could be detected in CsA-treated cells (Fig. 5,A and B). Therefore, it is possible that the residual MEF2A activity could account for the lack of cell death in the presence of CsA or FK506. Or alternatively, unidentified CsA-insensitive mechanisms might contribute to cell survival. Consistent with this hypothesis, CsA and FK506 were found to be much less effective in inhibiting MEF2A DNA binding and transactivation activities in the presence of full media. The mechanisms by which full media protect MEF2A from the inhibitory effects of calcineurin inhibitors are not known. It is conceivable that instead of targeting the phosphatase calcineurin, the survival signals of full media may inhibit the function of inhibitory kinase(s) whose activities would normally become unopposed following KCl withdrawal or inhibition of calcineurin function when granule neurons are grown only in the presence of KCl. It is interesting to note that this additional survival signals could only be activated by a combination of serum and KCl because serum alone seems to be unable to prevent MEF2A from being hyperphosphorylated even in the absence of calcineurin inhibitors. The identification of calcineurin as the major MEF2A phosphatase may have broad implication not just limited to granule neurons and could provide insight into the therapeutic and toxic effects of CsA observed clinically. It is widely accepted that the immunosuppressive action of CsA is due to inhibition of NFAT, a transcription factor important for cytokine gene expression during immune response (32Hoey T. Sun Y.L.

MEF2 proteins are expressed by a variety of cell types in the immune system including macrophages, B cells, and T cells (data not shown) (29Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J.

Their target genes in these immune cells have only just begun to be identified. For example, MEF2 proteins have been suggested to regulate the expression of immunoglobulin gene light chain or J chain in B cells (36Satyaraj E. Storb U. J.

Therefore, inhibition of MEF2 may underlie part of the mechanisms by which CsA suppresses immune responses. The side effects of CsA and FK506, such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, could be partly due to the inhibition of MEF2 in those cell types where MEF2 factors have been shown to be expressed.3 We thank Dr. Michael E.

As such, RGS proteins can function as negative regulators of G protein-mediated signal transduction by speeding deactivation of the active form of Gα subunits, thereby promoting formation of inactive G protein heterotrimers (GαGDPβγ). It is now clear that some proteins that contain an RGS domain have more complex functions. For example, p115 RhoGEF, which contains an RGS domain near its amino terminus, is an effector for G protein action, catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on the monomeric G protein Rho more efficiently when stimulated by Gα13-GTP. The capacity of Gα13 to activate p115 RhoGEF is dependent on the RGS domain of p115, which also accelerates hydrolysis of GTP by Gα13 (4Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.-G. McCabe P. Polakis P.

A subfamily of RGS proteins has been identified in which each member possesses so-called DEP (disheveled, EGL-10,pleckstrin) and GGL (G protein γsubunit-like) domains in addition to an RGS domain (9Ponting C.P.

The superficial resemblance of the complex formed by Gβ5 and a GGL-containing RGS protein to a G protein βγ subunit complex suggests potential targets for modulation of G protein signaling. G protein βγ subunits regulate the activity of a diverse array of effectors (adenylyl cyclases, ion channels, and phospholipase C-β isoforms, among others), play a significant role in interactions of G proteins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases with receptors, and facilitate signal transfer from G protein-coupled receptors to mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (21Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about the signaling properties of Gβ5. Of the five known Gβ subunits, Gβ5 is the clear outlier. Although Gβs 1–4 are 80–90% identical to each other, Gβ5 is only about 50% homologous to its relatives (18Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J.

We describe herein the cloning of RGS6 and explore the biochemical properties of RGS6 and RGS7, the most closely related member of this group of RGS proteins. We demonstrate that both RGS6 and RGS7 associate strongly and specifically with Gβ5. These RGS/β5 complexes have been purified following expression directed by recombinant baculoviruses and tested for interactions with certain recombinant G protein α subunits and known effectors for G protein action. [γ-35S]GTPγS and [γ-32P]GTP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained and recombinant baculoviruses were amplified as described previously (24Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baculoviruses encoding amino-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Gβ1 and 5 have been described previously (10Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gαq, Gαz, Gα12, and p115 RhoGEF were generously provided by Dr. Tohru Kozasa (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center); PLC-β1 and PLC-β2 by Dr. Paul Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center); antisera against RGS6 (U1895) and RGS7 (U1480) by Dr. Andrejs Krumins (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center); antiserum against Gβ5 (SGS-1) by Dr. William Simonds (National Institutes of Health); an antiserum that reacts with Gβ1–4 subunits (B600) by Dr. Susanne Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center); and a recombinant baculovirus encoding RGS7 by Dr. Sheu-Fen Lee (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from commercial sources or prepared by the Pharmacology Core Facility of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. A partial rat RGS6 cDNA sequence (GenBank: RNU32436), identified by homology to the C. elegans EGL-10 protein, was used with the BLAST algorithm to identify a human clone (GenBank: HUMORFE) containing sequences homologous to the consensus RGS domain found in all members of the RGS protein family. Further BLAST alignments with a human expressed sequence tag data base identified g874443 as identical to HUMORFE except with 11 additional nucleotides and an EcoRI site at its 5′ end. This incomplete RGS6 cDNA clone was obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory collection of expressed sequence tags through Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), and sequences derived from its 5′ region were used to prepare oligonucleotide primers for 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cloning of the missing DNA sequences. Marathon-Ready™ (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) cDNA from human brain was used for 5′-RACE. Oligonucleotide primer B413 (5′-CCACATCCTGTAGGGGTTGTTTC-3′) derived from RGS6 sequence downstream of the EcoRI site at nucleotide position 1117 (Fig. 1) was used with oligonucleotide primer AP1 (supplied byCLONTECH) to produce double-stranded cDNA according to a polymerase chain reaction protocol provided by the supplier. Following removal of oligonucleotide primers by gel filtration, the enriched cDNA was used to prepare a specific 1153-base pair human RGS6 5′-RACE product using primers B413 and B415 (5′-TCTAGACTGCAGGATGGCTCAAGGATCCGGGGATC-3′). The latter primer was derived from a human RGS6 cDNA sequence obtained from GenBank with the accession number AF073920. The human RGS6 5′-RACE cDNA was joined to the g874443 partial RGS6 cDNA at their commonEcoRI restriction site at nucleotide position 1117 by a sequential polymerase chain reaction protocol. The amplified cDNA from this procedure (1730 base pairs) was ultimately cloned into baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac HTb for preparation of a human RGS6 protein with a hexahistidine tag near its amino terminus. A modified RGS6 cDNA lacking the sequences coding for the consensus RGS box domain was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified product (997 base pairs) was cloned into pFastBac HTb. The truncated RGS6 protein (RGS6ΔR, 41.4 kDa) includes amino acid residues 1–324 of human RGS6 in addition to 25 residues of amino-terminal sequences containing the hexahistidine tag and 8 residues of carboxyl-terminal sequence derived from the pFastBac HTb vector. The ability of purified, myristoylated Gαoand Gαq to form heterotrimeric complexes with β1γ2 and RGS6 or 7/Gβ5 complexes was assessed as follows. To 100 μl of buffer A (20 mm Na Hepes (pH 8), 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 μm GDP, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.005% C12E10) was added 10 pmol of myristoylated Gαo or 10 pmol of Gαq and 25 pmol of hexahistidine-tagged RGS6/β5, RGS6ΔR/β5, RGS7/β5, or β1γ2. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, 25 μl of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A was added and incubated for an additional 30 min. The Ni-NTA resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 150 μl of buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 400 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole). Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA resin were eluted with 50 μl of buffer C (buffer A supplemented with 150 mm imidazole). The identity of proteins eluted from Ni-NTA resin was determined by immunoblotting after separation through 11% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The hexahistadine-tagged (His6) RGS6/β5 and RGS7/(His6)β5 complexes were synthesized in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus expression system. Sf9 cells (6 liters) were grown in suspension to a density of 1.4 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium (IPL-41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% Pluronic F68, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin; Ref. 24Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then infected with 1 plaque-forming unit of each virus per cell. The cells were harvested 48 h later by centrifugation, suspended to a density of 2.5 × 107cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (0.02 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.02 mg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.02 mg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 0.03 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor)) and subjected to nitrogen cavitation as described previously (26Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and applied to Ni-NTA resin (5 ml; Qiagen, Chatsworth CA) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). The resin was washed with 80 ml of buffer E (buffer D plus 400 mm NaCl), 80 ml of buffer F (buffer D plus 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole), and 50 ml of buffer G (buffer D plus 50 mm NaCl), and the RGS/β5 complex was then eluted with buffer H (buffer D plus 100 mmNaCl and 150 mm imidazole) in the case of (His6)RGS6/β5 and (His6)RGS6ΔR/β5 or buffer I (buffer D plus 50 mm NaCl and 50 mmEDTA) in the case of RGS7/(His6)β5. The Ni-NTA pool was diluted 5-fold into Mono Q buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and applied to a Mono Q 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of increasing ionic strength (0–400 mm NaCl in Mono Q buffer). The RGS/β5 complexes eluted from the column between 180 and 200 mm NaCl. The purified complexes were exchanged into storage buffer (50 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cultures of Sf9 cells (50 ml, 1.0 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with RGS6 or RGS7 baculoviruses in addition to baculoviruses encoding one of each of the five Gβ subunits. In these experiments, the Gβ proteins were synthesized with a His6 tag at their amino termini; the RGS proteins were not tagged. Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for each virus. Infected cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended to a density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer, subjected to nitrogen cavitation, and clarified by centrifugation as described above. Supernatant fractions were applied to Ni-NTA resin in small columns. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes each of buffer D, buffer E, and buffer J (buffer A plus 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole). Each sample was eluted with buffer H. Column fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the following antibodies: U1895 (anti-RGS6 diluted 1:10,000), U1480 (anti-RGS7 diluted 1:4000), SGS-1 (anti-β5 diluted 1:2000), and B600 (anti-Gβ1–4 diluted 1:10,000). Particulate fractions of the cells were washed once with lysis buffer and then resuspended in lysis buffer, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Hydrolysis of Gα-bound [γ-32P]GTP in solution was monitored at 4 °C essentially as described by Berman et al. (27Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To prepare GTP-bound substrate with Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαz, Gαa proteins (10–500 nm) were incubated with 10–30 μm [γ-32P]GTP (700–25000 cpm/pmol), 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% C12E10 for 30 min at 30 °C prior to passage through a gel filtration column at 4 °C to remove excess [γ-32P]GTP and [32P]Pi (G-50 Sephadex; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gαs-GTP and Gαo-GTP were prepared similarly except that they were incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. Assays were initiated by addition of excess unlabeled GTP, MgSO4, and RGS protein (purified protein or crude Sf9 cell membranes) to Gαsubstrate at 4 °C. The final concentrations of components in the assay were 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm GTP, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.05% C12E10. Reactions were quenched with neutral charcoal (Norit A) at appropriate time intervals. Assays with R183C Gαq and Gα12 were performed as described previously (5Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J.

Measurements of phospholipase C activity and adenylyl cyclase activity were conducted according to published protocols (31Smigel M.D. J. Biol.

A full-length coding sequence for RGS6 was obtained by joining a human expressed sequence tag clone (g874443) encoding all of the 3′ region to a primer-extended and polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA encoding the complete 5′ region of RGS6 (Fig. 1). The full-length clone contains 2946 nucleotides and has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 472 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of 54,422. There are three regions of particular interest in the RGS6 protein. The DEP domain comprises amino acid residues 42–121. It is a highly conserved hydrophobic domain found in RGS6, 7, 9, and 11, in addition to a wide variety of other signaling proteins (9Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second region of interest is the GGL domain, defined by Snow et al. (10Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) as a domain that contains the required elements for interaction with Gβ5. Within the full-length RGS6 protein, the GGL domain is found between amino acid residues 261 and 309 (Fig. 1). The third recognizable motif, the RGS domain, is found between amino acid residues 325 and 451 of RGS6. A series of critical amino acid residues in the RGS domain that contact Gα was identified from the crystal structure of the complex formed between RGS4 and Gαi1 (33Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Although there is a substantial tolerance for amino acid substitutions within the consensus RGS domain of the family, there is an expected conservation of those residues that are critical for the direct interaction with the switch domains of the Gα subunit (at least for those RGS proteins that interact with members of the Gαi subfamily). Within RGS6, those critical residues are: Glu357-Phe-Ser359, Glu361-Asn362, Asn401, Asp403, Leu432, Asp436-Ser437 and Arg440. Based on the conservation of these critical residues, we predicted that RGS6 would function as a GTPase-activating protein. In a previous study with RGS11 (10Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This association required the GGL domain present in RGS11 and RGS7; this domain can also be recognized in RGS6 and RGS9. Although several studies have now shown that RGS7 and RGS9 form heterodimers with Gβ5 (10Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G.

We have addressed this question for full-length RGS6 and RGS7 with a recombinant baculovirus expression system. In these experiments, Sf9 cells were infected with an RGS virus either alone or in combination with one of five viruses encoding known Gβ subunits (Fig.2). When expressed alone or with an RGS protein, significant amounts of Gβ5 were found in the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) produced by high speed centrifugation of cell lysates (Fig. 2 and data not shown). With longer exposure times, it was possible to detect the presence of the other β subunits in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2). When expressed alone or with Gβs 1–4, RGS6 and RGS7 are found predominantly in the particulate fraction. However, concurrent expression of RGS6 or RGS7 with Gβ5 alters this distribution dramatically, and a significant amount of the RGS protein is found in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2). Although attempts to purify an RGS/Gβ complex from the cytosol were unsuccessful in experiments with Gβs 1–4, both RGS6 and RGS7 co-purified with Gβ5 reproducibly (see below). Gel filtration of crude cytosolic fractions also revealed that only Gβ5 formed a heterodimer with these RGS proteins (data not shown). In summary, these data demonstrate strong and specific association of the mammalian GGL-containing RGS family members with Gβ5. The distribution of the RGS6/β5 and RGS7/β5 complexes between the soluble and particulate fractions is similar to that observed for Gβ5 in brain homogenates (18Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both complexes can be purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction (Fig.3) and remain intact when passed through anion and cation exchange resins. Gel filtration analyses indicate a 1:1 complex of RGS7 with Gβ5 (data not shown). Two protein bands are visualized with the RGS7 antibody and migrate electrophoretically near the expected position for the protein (Fig. 3, left panel). The upper band in these preparations disappears after treatment with phosphoprotein phosphatases (data not shown). RGS6 migrates as a single protein species (Fig. 3, right panel). Efforts to purify these RGS/β5 complexes from the particulate fraction have not been successful. This may be due to several factors, including an instability of the complex in the presence of detergent and/or the presence of a large amount of poorly folded or aggregated recombinant protein in the particulate fraction. Although GAP activity that is largely specific for Gαo-GTP was observed previously with the RGS11/β5 complex (10Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangio"
https://openalex.org/W2133172561,"Recent studies have shown thatDrosophila Dishevelled (Dsh), an essential component of thewingless signal transduction, is also involved in planar polarity signaling through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway inDrosophila. Here, we show that expression of a mouse homolog of Dsh (mDvl-1) in NIH3T3 cells activates JNK/SAPK, and its activator MKK7. A C-terminal half of mDvl-1 which contains the DEP domain was sufficient for the activation of JNK/SAPK, whereas an N-terminal half of mDvl-1 as well as the DEP domain is required for stimulation of the TCF/LEF-1-dependent transcriptional activation, a β-catenin-dependent process. A single amino acid substitution (Met for Lys) within the DEP domain (mDvl-1 (KM)) abolished the JNK/SAPK-activating activity of mDvl-1, but did not affect the activity to activate the LEF-1-dependent transcription. Ectopic expression of mDvl-1 (KM) or an N-terminal half of mDvl-1, but not the C-terminal, was able to induce secondary axis inXenopus embryos. Because the secondary axis formation is dependent on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, these results suggest that distinct domains of mDvl-1 are responsible for the two downstream signaling pathways, the β-catenin pathway and the JNK/SAPK pathway in vertebrates.

Genetic evidence reveals that Wg signals through an intracellular cascade that includes Dishevelled (Dsh), Zeste-White3/Shaggy and Armadillo, a β-catenin homolog (13Orsulic S. Peifer M. Curr.

In this study, we have first demonstrated that a murine homolog of Dsh, mDvl-1, is able to potently activate JNK/SAPK and its direct activator MKK7 probably through Rac or Cdc42. We then produced various mutant forms of mDvl-1 and tested their abilities to activate JNK/SAPK, to regulate the TCF/LEF-1-dependent transcription, a β-catenin-dependent process, in mammalian cells, and to induce the secondary axis in Xenopus embryos.

Recently, the Hedgehog family of proteins, which are crucial for the pattern formation in the vertebrate embryogenesis (see Ref. 15Tabin C.J. McMahon A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar for review), was shown to undergo post-translational modification by covalent attachment of a cholesterol molecule to the biologically active amino-terminal fragment of these peptides (16Porter J.A.

Furthermore, Patched, a putative cognate receptor for the Hedgehog protein, shares homology with cholesterol-binding proteins (17Johnson R.L. Rothman A.L. Xie J. Goodrich L.V. Bare J.W. Bonifas J.M.

Together, it is tempting to hypothesize that the derangement of cholesterol synthesis affects the development of the nervous system through distorting Hedgehog signaling. To test the hypothesis that cholesterol itself is essential for normal embryogenesis and whether the reduction of SS activities is associated with cholesterol-lowering effects, we have generated SS knockout mice. The SS−/− mice were lethal between E9.5 and E12.5 and exhibited severe retardation of development. The SS+/− mice expressed only 50% SS activities in the liver and testes compared withSS+/+ mice, whereas their plasma lipoprotein profiles and responses to the dietary challenge were unaffected. A fragment (528 base pairs) of mouse SS cDNA was amplified by using primers that were designed based on reported sequences of mouse SS cDNA (sense primer, 5′-GTCGCAAGGATGGAGTTCGT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GTGGCAGTACTTGTCCCAGT-3′) (19Inoue T. Osumi T. Hara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This polymerase chain reaction product was used as a probe to clone a genomic DNA from the 129/Sv mouse genomic library as described previously (20Osuga J.-I. Inaba T. Harada K. Yagyu H. Shimada M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed; the short arm containing a 1.2-kbPstI/BglII fragment in intron 3 and the long arm containing a 8.5-kb EcoRV fragment spanning exons 6–7 were inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites, respectively, of the vector pPolIIshort-neobpA-HSVTK as described previously (21Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Thus, exons 4–5, which contained a putative catalytic site (22McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straunhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were replaced by a neomycin-resistant cassette. After linearization by digestion with SalI, the vector was electroporated into JH1 embryonic stem cells. Targeted clones, which had been selected in the presence of G418 and 1-(2-deoxy, 2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil, were identified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-ATACAGGGGAGTGTGCCTTTCTTGTG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ (Fig. 1). Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis afterBamHI/EcoRI double digestion using a 0.5-kilobase pair PstI/XhoI fragment as a probe (Fig. 1). Targeted embryonic stem clones were injected into the C57BL/6 blastocysts yielding five lines of chimeric mice, which transmitted the disrupted allele through the germ line. All experiments reported here were performed with 129/Sv-C57BL6 hybrid descendants (F1 and subsequent generations) of these animals. SS+/− mice were cross-bred to the LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLR−/−) (21Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) to produce mice that were heterozygous for the disrupted alleles of both SS and the LDL receptor loci. An intercross of these animals was performed. Three diets were used: (i) a normal chow (MF, Oriental Yeast), (ii) a 1.25% cholesterol diet, which contains 1.25% (w/w) cholesterol, 5% (w/w) cocoa butter, and 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid (23Osuga J.-I. Yonemoto M. Yamada N. Shimano H. Yagyu H. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kamei T. Yazaki Y. Ishibashi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and (iii) a 2% squalene diet, which contains 2% (w/w) squalene (WAKO) (24Storm H.M. Oh S.Y. Kimler B.F. Norton S. Lipids. 1993; 28: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Timed mating was performed and dietary supplementation was initiated 2 weeks before the mating. Liver and testes were homogenized in a buffer containing 15 mm nicotinamide, 2 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resultant pellets, a microsome fraction, were washed, resuspended in the same buffer, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. SS activities were measured according to a modified method of Cohen et al. (25Cohen L.H. Griffioen A.M. Wanders R.J. Van Roermund C.W.T. Huysmans C.M.G. Princen H.M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, the microsome fractions (∼20 μg) were incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 20 μm [1-3H] farnesyl pyrophosphate (25 μCi/μmol), 1 mm NADPH, 5 mmMgCl2, 6 mm glutathione, and 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 15 min. Reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) containing 0.2% unlabeled squalene. After 50 μl of chloroform and 50 μl of 3 m NaOH were added, the reaction mixtures were vortexed and centrifuged. The infranatant organic phase was used for the determination of the radioactivities in the squalene produced. Cholesterol synthesis in the liver was estimated by a modified method of Eiseleet al. (26Eisele B. Budzinski R. Muller P. Roland M. Mark M. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 564-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 6 SS+/+ and 6SS+/− mice (9–10-week-old females) were given food and water ad libitum and injected intraperitoneally with [2-14C]acetate (37 kBq/kg body weight). After 30 min, animals were euthanized, and two pieces of the liver (0.3 g/each) were removed. [1,2-3H]cholesterol (∼10,000 dpm) was added as an internal standard, and tissue samples were saponified in 2 ml of 15% KOH, 90% ethanol at 70 °C overnight. After the addition of 2 ml of water, nonsaponified lipids were extracted withn-hexane, evaporated, and dissolved in ethanol/acetone (1:1, v/v). Sterols were precipitated with digitonin. After washing the precipitates with 50% acetone, the radioactivities were determined. The results were expressed as 14C dpm/g wet weight of liver/30 min. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated and pooled from the livers of six animals. 1.2 μg were subjected to 1% agarose electrophoresis in the presence of formalin. The fractionated RNA was transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA probes: the LDL receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. After a 12-h fast, blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA. Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined enzymatically using kits (Determiner TC555 and Determiner TG555, Kyowa Medex). Lipoproteins were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described (23Osuga J.-I. Yonemoto M. Yamada N. Shimano H. Yagyu H. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kamei T. Yazaki Y. Ishibashi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the cholesterol contents in each lipoprotein fraction were determined. Embryonic tissues were examined by standard histological techniques. Data are represented as mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to compare the mean values between two groups. Two genomic clones were isolated from a library with a cDNA probe. The restriction mapping revealed that one genomic clone (Fig. 1 A) consisted of 8 exons spanning more than 26 kb. A replacement-type vector, which allowed the deletion of exon 4–5, was constructed and used to generate heterozygous SS knockout mice (SS+/−).SS+/− mice, which were viable and fertile, were intercrossed to obtain homozygous SS knockout mice (SS−/−). No viable SS−/− mice were identified among 149 weaned offspring, although 99 were heterozygotes (TableI). To determine the developmental stage where the embryos were lethal, the embryos were genotyped at four different embryonic stages: 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, and 13.5 days postcoitum (Table I, Fig. 1 B). At E9.5–10.5, SS−/− was identified at the frequency significantly lower than the expected mendelian frequency (χ2 = 8.35, p < 0.05). All SS−/− embryos were significantly smaller thanSS+/+ embryos with comparable developmental age.SS−/− embryos exhibit a wide variety of morphology. Among 13 SS−/− embryos, only 1 at E9.5 showed a nearly normal shape with a small forebrain (Fig.2 C), 6 had a shape that is similar to E8.5 embryos, early somite-stage embryos, with an open head fold (Fig. 2 D). Their microscopic examination showed necrotic neuronal cells with condensation of nuclei,i.e. apoptotic cells (Fig. 2, F andG). Four were much smaller and ambiguous and did not have somites (Fig. 2 B). At E12.5–13.5, however, noSS−/− were identified (Table I).Table IGenotypes of offspring from intercrosses of SS+/− miceAgeSS+/+SS+/−SS−/−ResorbedaSignificant number of embryos exhibited appearance of resorption.

Open table in a new tab Genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The SS mRNA levels in theSS+/− mice were reduced by 60% in the liver (Fig.3 A). Consistently, their SS activities were significantly reduced by 50% both in the liver and testes (Fig. 3 B). In the liver, the mRNA levels of the LDL receptor appeared to be increased by 20% in the SS+/−mice (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, the mRNA of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase appeared to be decreased by 20%. There was no significant change in the mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase between the SS+/+ and SS+/− mice. If SS is the rate-limiting step for TC synthesis, cholesterol synthesis is expected to be reduced in the liver. However, the amounts of [14C]acetate incorporated into cholesterol in the liver were not different between the wild-type and SS+/− mice (10,173 ± 6444versus 13,992 ± 10,276 dpm/g liver/30 min,p > 0.05, n = 6). To determine whether the reduction in the SS activities in the liver is associated with the changes in plasma lipoprotein profile, we determined the plasma lipid levels. Neither plasma TC nor TG levels were different between the wild-type and SS+/− mice, which were fed a normal chow (Table II). There was no significant difference in the amounts of VLDL, LDL, or HDL cholesterol as measured by HPLC (Table III). To evaluate the effects of the suppression of SS activities in the liver on the plasma lipoprotein profile in the setting of LDL deficiency, we further cross-bred these animals with LDL receptor knockout mice to generateSS+/−;LDLR−/− mice. Neither plasma TC nor TG levels were different between the SS+/+;LDLR−/− andSS+/−;LDLR−/− mice (Table II).Table IIPlasma lipid levelsLDLR locusSS locusnTCTG+/++/+796.4 ± 18.6132.3 ± 54.5+/++/−1893.8 ± 25.0119.1 ± 38.7−/−+/+11306.4 ± 21.4167.5 ± 30.9−/−+/−7294.4 ± 24.2119.1 ± 38.7Mice aged 10–11 weeks were maintained on normal chow.

After a 12-h fast, blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA. Plasma was subjected to HPLC lipoprotein analyses.

No significant differences were noted between SS+/+ and SS+/− for each lipoprotein. Open table in a new tab Mice aged 10–11 weeks were maintained on normal chow. After a 12-h fast, blood was collected for determination of TC and TG. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. No significant difference was noted between SS+/+ and SS+/− for either plasma TC or TG levels, irrespective of the presence of the LDLR mutation. Five animals aged 8–10 weeks were maintained on normal chow. After a 12-h fast, blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA. Plasma was subjected to HPLC lipoprotein analyses. Total cholesterol contents in three lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) were calculated and expressed as mean ± S.D. No significant differences were noted between SS+/+ and SS+/− for each lipoprotein. If the embryonic lethality of the homozygotes results from the cholesterol deficiency, it is theoretically possible that dietary supplementation of squalene or cholesterol would reverse the phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we fed the pregnantSS+/− mice with the diets supplemented with either 2% squalene or 1.25% cholesterol. No viable SS−/− mice were identified among 21 offspring for squalene rescue (4 +/+versus 17 +/− versus 0 −/−, χ2 = 6.9, p < 0.05,) and 40 offspring for cholesterol rescue (10 +/+ versus 30 +/− versus 0 −/−, χ2 = 6.7, p < 0.05). In the present study, we demonstrate that SS is essential for the normal development of the embryo. 50% reduction in the SS activities in the liver did not result in alterations in the plasma lipoprotein profiles. Moreover, the lethal phenotypes of SS−/− embryos were not reversed by oral administration of either cholesterol or squalene to the dams. During the early development of animals, particularly during fetal stage, there is a marked demand for new sterol. Cholesterol is required for new membrane synthesis, for maintenance of existing membranes, and for the synthesis of hormone and bile acids. As in the adult, this cholesterol is supplied by either de novo synthesis within the fetal compartment or by transfer from the maternal compartment to the fetus through uptake of cholesterol carried in lipoproteins. Previous studies have shown that sterol synthesis is markedly increased in the developing fetus including a preimplantation embryo (27Belknap W.M. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Jurevics H.A. Kidwai F.Z. Morell P. J.

In addition, transport of maternal LDL and HDL to the fetal yolk sac is drastically increased (30Wyne K.L. Woollett L.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 518-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that several lipoprotein receptor systems mediate the transfer of maternal lipoprotein: the LDL receptor, megalin/gp330, VLDL receptor, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein for the uptake of lipoproteins containing either apoB-100 or apoE (reviewed in Refs. 6Farese R.V. Herz J. TIG ( Trends Genet. ). 1998; 14: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 31Yamamoto T. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and scavenger receptor B-1 for the binding of apoA-I containing lipoproteins (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschlz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Because mice lacking the LDL receptor (21Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) or VLDL receptor (33Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) are fertile, there may be some redundancy in the receptor function. On the other hand, mice lacking low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (34Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) or megalin/gp330 (14Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) are embryonic lethal, suggesting the pivotal role of these receptor in embryogenesis. In this concern, it is noteworthy that SS−/− embryos develop to the stage around E9.5. Results indicate that cholesterol required for growth is exclusively supplied from the dams inSS−/− mice. Indeed, it has not been reported that pharmacological doses of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or SS inhibitors cause preimplantation lethality (35Liu G.C. Ahrens Jr., E. Schreibman P. Crouse J. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 38-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that nonpolar squalene, an immediate product of squalene synthase, is transported in association with VLDL in the plasma (36Minsker D.H. MacDonald J.S. Robertson R.T. Bokelman D.L. Teratology. 1983; 28: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and subsequently by a squalene and sterol carrier protein (37Scallen T. Srikantaiah B. Seetharam B. Hansbury E. Gavey K. Fed. Proc. 1974; 38: 1733-1746Google Scholar). Therefore, embryos may utilize squalene that is diffused from extra embryonic tissues for cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, in the rodents, the nutritional supply of the embryo during the immediate postimplantation period is dependent on the resorptive and synthetic capacity of the yolk sac (38Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Presumably, cholesterol transported across this maternal fetal barrier is utilized for development. The embryonic lethality of the SS−/− mice may result from either cholesterol deficiency, toxic precursor buildup, or both. The cholesterol-supplying system in the early gestational period may no longer be effective beyond midgestation when a functional chorioallantoic circulatory system is established (38Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the placental system is too immature to fully compensate for the complete deficiency of the de novocholesterol synthesis around this developmental stage. Belknap and Dietschy (27Belknap W.M. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that the de novo cholesterol synthesis remains highly active during the whole midgestational period and that the contents of newly synthesized sterols are maximal at E17 in the rat fetus. Similar failure to catch up with the increasing demand may underlie the lethality of mice lacking apoB (11Farese R.V. Ruland S.L. Flynn L.M. Stokowski R.P. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternatively, precursor buildup may have lethal effects on the embryos as postulated for SLO syndrome (7Salen G. Shefer S. Batta A.K. Tint G.S. Xu G. Honda A. Irons M. Elias E.R. J.

Karkas J.D. Arison B.H. Bansal V.S. Vaidya S. Germershausen J.I. Kurtz M.M. Bergstrom J.D. J. Biol.

Farnesol has recently been found to be a biologically active substance; it inhibits arterial vasoconstriction through blocking l-type Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (42Roullet J.-B.

Other studies have reported the existence of a farnesol-specific, orphan nuclear receptor in vertebrate cells, the farnesoid X-activated receptor, but its precise functions remain unknown (44Forman B.M. Goode R.E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R. Weinberger C.

This toxic precursor buildup hypothesis may be more plausible, because supplementation of the dams with dietary squalene failed to rescue the lethal phenotype. As mentioned above, neural developmental anomalies are common in mice with the induced mutations in cholesterol transport systems (11Farese R.V. Ruland S.L. Flynn L.M. Stokowski R.P. Young S.G. Proc.

In this regard, it is noteworthy thatSS−/− had an open neural plate (Fig. 2 D). Because the general growth of SS−/− was severely impaired, the defective neural tube closure may simply reflect general growth retardation. Interestingly, the phenotypes of SS−/− mice are different from those of infants with SLO syndrome, despite the fact that the responsible enzymes are involved in the proximal part of cholesterol synthesis (8Fitzky B.U. Witsch-Baumgartner M. Erdel M. Lee J.N. Paik Y-K. Glossmann H. Utermann G. Moebius F.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8181-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the SLO syndrome, Δ7-reductase deficiency may be partially compensated by Δ24-reductase, an alternative enzyme involved in the terminal step of cholesterol biosynthesis, thereby leading to a milder phenotype (9FitzPatrick D.R.

The differences may also arise from either species differences or build up of different precursors. Recently, a link has emerged between cellular cholesterol metabolism and signaling molecules that are crucial for early development, the Hedgehog proteins (16Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

Drosophila Hedgehog and murine sonic Hedgehog proteins undergo post-translational modification in which a cholesterol moiety is attached to its amino terminus (16Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

A certain part of the developmental anomalies of SLO syndrome may be ascribed to the defective function of the sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway; indeed, sonic Hedgehog knockout mice develop a holoprosencephalic phenotype similar to that in some SLO syndrome cases and in megalin-deficient mice (47Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Young K.E. Corden J.L. Westphal H. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of SS−/− are rather similar to Patched-deficient mice that have open and overgrown neural tubes (48Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to elucidate the similarity in the phenotypes of these two mutants. SS+/− mice are apparently normal. Both mRNA levels and enzymatic activities for SS were reduced by 50% in the liver, but the overall hepatic cholesterol synthesis was not reduced, confirming that SS is not the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig.3). The apparent changes in the LDL receptor and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels may reflect hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. In this concern, it is noteworthy that zaragozic acid, an SS inhibitor, caused a compensatory increase in the hepatic mRNA levels of the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase as well as SS itself along with marked suppression of cholesterol synthesis (49Ness G.C. Zhao Z. Keller R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our results, however, strongly indicate that inhibition of SS activities by 50% is not sufficient to reduce the plasma LDL cholesterol levels with or without the functional LDL receptor at least in mice (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2140670281,"In photosynthetic cells of higher plants and algae, the distribution of light energy between photosystem I and photosystem II is controlled by light quality through a process called state transition. It involves a reorganization of the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) within the thylakoid membrane whereby light energy captured preferentially by photosystem II is redirected toward photosystem I or vice versa. State transition is correlated with the reversible phosphorylation of several LHCII proteins and requires the presence of functional cytochromeb 6 f complex. Most factors controlling state transition are still not identified. Here we describe the isolation of photoautotrophic mutants of the unicellular algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii, which are deficient in state transition. Mutant stt7 is unable to undergo state transition and remains blocked in state I as assayed by fluorescence and photoacoustic measurements. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that the distribution of LHCII and of the cytochromeb 6 f complex between appressed and nonappressed thylakoid membranes does not change significantly during state transition in stt7, in contrast to the wild type. This mutant displays the same deficiency in LHCII phosphorylation as observed for mutants deficient in cytochromeb 6 f complex that are known to be unable to undergo state transition. The stt7 mutant grows photoautotrophically, although at a slower rate than wild type, and does not appear to be more sensitive to photoinactivation than the wild-type strain. Mutant stt3-4b is partially deficient in state transition but is still able to phosphorylate LHCII.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). This leads to a redistribution of excitation energy between these two photosystems, which optimizes the photosynthetic yield. The reorganization of the antennae involves the displacement of the mobile fraction of a peripheral antenna complex, the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II (LHCII), within the thylakoid membrane. During transition from state I to state II induced by PSII light (650 nm), the mobile fraction of LHCII is displaced from the PSII-enriched grana region to the PSI-enriched stromal lamellae. In the presence of PSI light (700 nm), the reverse migration of LHCII from PSI to PSII occurs. The redistribution of excitation energy between the photosystems results in changes in room temperature fluorescence with high and low fluorescence levels in state I and II, respectively, and in drastic alterations of the fluorescence emission spectrum at low temperature. As a consequence of this redistribution of energy between the two photosystems, state transition regulates the ratio between cyclic and linear electron flow and thereby modulates the level of ATP in the cells (2Bulté L. Gans P. Rébeillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, state transition is controlled by the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (3Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol (PQH2) induces state II, whereas its oxidation induces state I. Transition from state I to state II correlates with the phosphorylation of a subset of the LHCII proteins on their stromal exposed N-terminal ends (4Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 5Michel H. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17584-17591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that a redox-sensitive kinase (LCHII kinase) could control state transition by phosphorylation of the antenna molecules (1Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). However attempts to isolate this kinase have not been successful (6Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although several kinases tightly associated with the thylakoid membrane have been recently identified (10Race H.L. Hind G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13006-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence yield in response to changes in the PQ redox state can be observed readily in the unicellular algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii (12Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and several important observations concerning state transition have been made with this organism. In particular, an actual increased sensitization of PSI by LHCII has been observed in state II in this microalga (13Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As for higher plants, a correlation between state transition and protein phosphorylation has been reported for C. reinhardtii (12Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,14Delepelaire P. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 277-283Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Vitry C.d. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 444-449Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The major phosphoproteins are CP29, CP26, LHCP11, LHCP13 and LHCP17. CP29 and CP26, corresponding to P9 and P10 in the nomenclature of Chua and Bennoun (16Chua N.-H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), are part of the minor antenna of photosystem II, whereas LHCP11, LHCP13 and LHCP17 are members of the LHCII protein family (17Bassi R. Wollman F.-A. Planta. 1991; 183: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In vivo, state II to state I and state I to state II transitions can be blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor sodium fluoride and by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, respectively (18Delphin E. Duval J.-C. Kirilovsky D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 91-95Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of LHCII is indeed involved in the control of state transition. The analysis of mutants of C. reinhardtii deficient in cytochrome b 6 f activity has shown that absence of this complex prevents transition from state I to state II as well as its associated phosphorylation events (19Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1017: 235-241Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex is involved in the regulation of state transition, most probably by controlling the LHCII kinase activity through plastoquinol-binding to the Qo site of the protein complex (20Vener A.V. van Kan P.J.M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Whereas deficiencies in the activity of PSII or ATP synthase have no direct effect on state transition (2Bulté L. Gans P. Rébeillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1017: 235-241Google Scholar), PSI-deficient mutants do not display fluorescence changes under conditions of state transition (13Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, LHCII protein phosphorylation and migration still occur in these mutants in contrast to cytochromeb 6 f-deficient mutants. To gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying state transition in C. reinhardtii, we have isolated and characterized mutants unable to change the fluorescence yield in response to changes in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. Among the state transition mutants isolated, two were able to grow photoautotrophically. One of these mutants, stt7, is blocked in state I and displays major alterations in LHCII protein phosphorylation. It is able to grow photoautotrophically, although at a slower rate than wild type, accumulates normal levels of functional cytochrome b 6 f, photosystem I and photosystem II complexes, and does not appear to be more sensitive to photoinactivation than wild type. The other mutant,stt3-4b, is partially deficient in state transition but is still able to phosphorylate LHCII under state II conditions. The C. reinhardtii mutantsFuD6, FuD7, and H13 have been described previously (23Sturm N.R. Kuras R. Büschlen S. Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1991; 65: 135-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These mutants are deficient in the accumulation of cytochrome b 6 f, PSII, and PSI complex, respectively. arg7 is auxotrophic for arginine due to a mutation in the ARG7 gene, which encodes argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1) (26Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Gillham N.W. Genetics. 1965; 52: 529-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cw15 is a cell wall-deficient mutant (28Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). The arg7; cw15 mt- strain contains both mutations. Wild-type and mutant strains were grown as described by Harris (28Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). If necessary, the enriched medium (TAP) and the high salt minimal medium were solidified with 2% Bacto agar (Difco) and supplemented with 10−5m 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) (ICN Biochemicals). Nuclear transformation of cell wall-deficient C. reinhardtii cells was carried out according to the protocol of Kindle (29Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii arg7; cw15 mt- cells were grown in TAP containing 110 μg ml−1 arginine until a cell density of ∼2.5 × 106 cells ml−1 was reached. Cells were pelleted at room temperature and resuspended in TAP to a final concentration of 108 cells ml−1. 300 μl of cells, 300 mg of sterile glass beads, and 1.5 μg of plasmid pARG7Φ3 (30Gumpel N.J. Purton S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 299-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Gumpel N.J. Ralley L. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Nugent J.H.A. Purton S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were mixed in a glass tube and vortexed for 15 s at maximal speed. Transformed cells were plated on TAP plates containing 10−6m DCMU. Finally, plates were incubated at 25 °C under low light (6 μE m−2 s−1) until isolated colonies appeared. The transformation efficiency was approximately 200 colonies/μg of DNA. No colonies were obtained when the transformation was performed in the absence of plasmid DNA indicating that the reversion rate of the arg7 mutation was negligible under the conditions used. A qualitative measurement of state transition was obtained by growing C. reinhardtiicells on TAP plates supplemented with 10−6mDCMU. State I (leading to high fluorescence at room temperature) was obtained by oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by illumination of the plates with white light (60 μE m−2 s−1) for 15 min. State II (leading to low fluorescence at room temperature) was induced by reducing the plastoquinone pool by flushing the plates with nitrogen in the absence of light (2Bulté L. Gans P. Rébeillé F. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 59-66Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These conditions prevent ATP synthesis by either photosynthesis or respiration but stimulate instead the glycolytic pathway (Pasteur effect) and lead to an increase in the stromal NADPH concentration and ultimately to the reduction of the plastoquinone pool, presumably via a NADPH/plastoquinone oxidoreductase (33Godde D. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 131: 197-202Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or a succinate dehydrogenase (34Willebrand K.O. Gombos Z. Gibbs M. Plant Physiol. 1989; 190: 1084-1087Google Scholar). Fluorescence pictures of the whole plate corresponding to state I and state II were recorded, quantified and stored using a device similar to that described by Fenton and Crofts (35Fenton J.M. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar) and subtracted numerically. The differential fluorescence signal of each colony provides a measure of state transition. State transition can be measured quantitatively using fluorescence at room temperature. C. reinhardtii cells in liquid culture were shaken vigorously in the absence of light for at least 15 min to oxidize the plastoquinone pool (state I). DCMU at a final concentration of 10−5m was added to the culture 1 min before fluorescence was measured using the plant efficiency analyzer device (Hansatech Ltd., King's Lynn, England). State II was induced by adding glucose and glucose oxidase or sodium azide (250 μm) to the sample to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and to reduce the plastoquinone pool. Cells were incubated for 20 min in the absence of light before the second fluorescence measurement was performed. Finally, state transition was expressed as the relative difference of maximal fluorescence in both conditions: [F m(ox) −F m(red)]/F m(ox). Fluorescence transients were measured on whole cells grown on plates TAP (± arginine) as described previously (35Fenton J.M. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2% SDS, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed for 15 min at 37 °C before the lysate was centrifuged for 2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant containing solubilized proteins was stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protocol (36Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Western blotting and ECL detection were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were harvested in mid-exponential phase by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in TAP medium at 107 cells/ml. Oxidation of the plastoquinone pool to reach state I was achieved by illuminating the cells for 20 min in the presence of 10−5mDCMU. Reduction of the plastoquinone pool to favor state II was obtained by incubating the cells for 20 min in the dark in the presence of 20 mm glucose and 2 mg ml−1 glucose oxidase. Under these conditions oxygen is consumed, and mitochondrial and chloroplast respiration are inhibited. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 mm NaF and rapid cooling to 4 °C. Cells were then pelleted, washed once in TAP medium, and used for 77 K fluorescence. Cells in state I or state II were resuspended in TAP medium at 5 × 106 to 2 × 107cells/ml and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorimeter. The spectral dependence of the quantum yield of photochemistry in the red region (630–705 nm) was measured as described by Delosme et al. (13Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys.

The membrane purification protocol was derived from the procedure described by Owens and Ohad (39Owens G.C. Ohad I. J.

C. reinhardtii cells grown in TAP (± arginine) to a concentration of 5–10 μg of chlorophyll/ml were pelleted at 4 °C, washed once with cold membrane buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a concentration of 200–400 μg of chlorophyll/ml. Cells were broken by sonication at 4 °C and diluted 5-fold in cold membrane buffer. Unbroken cells were pelleted by a low speed centrifugation (1 min, 2,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fractions. The pellet was resuspended carefully in membrane buffer using a paint brush and used immediately for in vitro phosphorylation. Membrane fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of cold phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 100 mmsorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl) at a concentration of 0.1 μg of chlorophyll/ml and preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 μCi nmol−1) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 40 nmol of ATP were added to each sample, and labeling was carried out for 20 min at 25 °C in the presence of light (150 μE m−2s−1). Labeled membranes were washed twice in cold phosphorylation buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 mm sodium fluoride, resuspended in loading buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels containing 6 m urea. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells incubated under state I or state II conditions were resuspended in 25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3m sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and broken with glass beads under vigorous shaking. Thylakoids were then isolated by the flotation procedure described by Chua and Bennoun (16Chua N.-H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thylakoid polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels containing 6 murea and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Phosphoproteins were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Cells were labeled as described by Delepelaire and Wollman (14Delepelaire P. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 277-283Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except that [33P]orthophosphate (specific activity 2,500–3,500 Ci mmol−1) at 1 μCi ml−1 was used. Thylakoid membrane proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea 12–18% polyacrylamide gel. Preparation of C. reinhardtii cells for electron microscope immunoanalysis and counting of the gold granules over appressed and nonappressed thylakoid membranes were as described (41Vallon O.

Transformation ofC. reinhardtii arg7; cw15 cells with plasmid pARG7.8Φ3 restores argininosuccinate lyase activity through random insertions of plasmid sequences into the nuclear genome (30Gumpel N.J. Purton S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 299-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Gumpel N.J. Ralley L. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Nugent J.H.A. Purton S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using this approach, 4,500 transformants were isolated by selection on acetate-containing medium (TAP) lacking arginine. To identify state transition mutants among the transformants, the fluorescence yield of each colony was compared under conditions that lead to the oxidation or reduction of the plastoquinone pool (see “Experimental Procedures”). After subtraction of the fluorescence images of the cells in state I and state II, wild-type colonies give rise to strong signals, whereas the signals originating from colonies deficient in state transition are nearly undetectable. Using this differential fluorescence screen, four mutants deficient in state transition were isolated. These strains were named stt2, stt3, stt5, andstt7 (for state transition-deficient mutants). Growth of the four isolated mutants was tested under different conditions (TableI). As expected from the selection used, all four state transition mutants grow on medium lacking arginine in contrast to the original recipient strain arg7; cw15. This correlates with the presence of sequences from the transformation vector inserted in their genome (data not shown).Table IGrowth properties of state transition mutantsMediumLightstt2stt3stt3–4bstt5stt7FuD6arg7;cw15Wild typeμE m−2 s−1TAP + Arg6+(+)++++++TAP0NDaND, not determined.(+)y+ND++—+TAP6+(+)++++—+TAP60ND(+)*+ND++—+TAP600ND—+ND+——+High salt minimal medium60—(+)*+—+——+State transition——p— p———++A sample of 10 μl from cell cultures of the different strains was spotted on agar plates and grown under the light indicated.

Growth was monitored after 1 week. +, normal growth; (+), reduced growth; *, no confluent growth; −, no growth; y, yellow colonies; p, partially deficient. Transformants stt2 and stt5 are unable to grow in the absence of acetate (Table I) indicating that they are deficient in photosynthetic activity. In contrast, stt3 andstt7 are able to grow photoautotrophically. Because one possible function of state transition that has been proposed is to provide some protection against PSII damage under high light (42Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), we tested the growth properties of stt7 and stt3under different light regimes (Table I). Growth of stt7 is unaffected even under high light (600 μE m−2s−1). In contrast, stt3 grows significantly slower and is sensitive to high light (600 μE m−2s−1) Compared with the arg7; cw15strain, stt3 has also acquired a yellow in the dark phenotype (Table I), suggesting a deficiency in light-independent chlorophyll synthesis. Measurements of fluorescence transients provide a noninvasive means to monitor the activity of the photosynthetic complexes in the thylakoid membrane. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the fluorescence transients of stt7, arg7; ofcw15 and wild type are nearly undistinguishable indicating that the photosynthetic complexes PSII, cytochromeb 6 f, and PSI function at a similar rate in these strains. The fluorescence transients of stt2and stt5 are clearly different from that of wild type (Fig.1) and resemble those of mutants deficient in cytochromeb 6 f activity such as FuD6(23Sturm N.R. Kuras R. Büschlen S. Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6171-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that cytochromeb 6 f is also affected in mutantsstt2 and stt5. In the case of stt3, the fluorescence transient indicates a defect in the electron transport chain. To determine the accumulation of the photosynthetic complexes in the state transition mutants, immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies directed against the polypeptides PsaA (PSI), cytochrome f(cytochrome b 6 f complex), and D1 (PSII). The stt2 and stt5 mutants contain no detectable amount of cytochrome f indicating that they lack a functional cytochrome b 6 f complex (Fig. 2). The absence of the cytochromeb 6 f complex explains the growth phenotype, the fluorescence transients, as well as the lack of state transition in these transformants. Because the relationship between cytochrome b 6 f deficiency and state transition has been extensively studied in C. reinhardtii(13Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1017: 235-241Google Scholar), these mutants were not characterized further. As expected from its growth phenotype and its fluorescence transient,stt7 accumulates all tested photosynthetic complexes to normal levels (Fig. 2). In stt3, cytochrome faccumulates normally, but the amount of PSI-A is considerably diminished and accumulation of the D1 protein is reduced (Fig. 2). To test whether the phenotypes of the mutants stt7 andstt3 are due to single mutations and whether these mutants are tagged, several backcrosses with a wild-type strain were performed. Because the arg7; cw15 strain used for transformation crosses poorly, only incomplete tetrads were recovered. In the case ofstt7, analysis of the progeny from the second backcross revealed that the mutation does not cosegregate with the signals arising from hybridization of the DNA from this progeny with a probe from the transformation vector (data not shown). The half-times of growth on high salt minimal medium of progeny with and without thestt7 mutation were measured to be 10.6 ± 1.0 h and 8.4 ± 0.4 h, respectively (three independent measurements). The corresponding value for wild type was 7.2 ± 0.6 h. The stt7 mutation thus slightly decreases the growth rate. Upon crossing stt3 to wild type, the state transition phenotype of stt3 could be segregated from the PSI deficiency, and the state transition mutant was namedstt3-4b. In this case, analysis of 15 progeny revealed a cosegregation between the stt3 mutation and the hybridization signal obtained with the probe from the transformation vector indicating that this mutant is most likely tagged. Quantitative state transition measurements on strain stt7 show that the fluorescence y"

DECAY, a novel Drosophilacaspase related to mammalian caspase-3 and caspase-7.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 20PreviewThe cDNA clone LP3492 from Berkeley Genome Project that was used to derive the decay sequence reported in this paper contained a possible cloning artifact leading to the deletion of 2 bp in the 5′ region. In the correct DECAY protein sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF130469 ), the first 5 amino acids (MPPRS) reported in our paper are replaced by 26 residues (MDDTDFSLFGQKNKHKKDKADATKIA). Because the entire caspase domain of the DECAY protein lies carboxyl to the amended sequence, and because the molecule used in our study is both biologically and biochemically functional, we believe that the different amino terminal sequence is unlikely to have affected the results and central conclusions reported in the paper. Full-Text PDF Open Access Programmed cell death in metazoans is mediated by caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which cleave their substrates following an Asp residue (1Kumar S. Lavin M.F.

A number of caspases have been described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. To date fourteen caspases have been cloned in mammals, some of which play a critical role in apoptosis, whereas others seem mainly involved in the processing and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (1Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Diff. 1996; 3: 255-267PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

Although four caspases exist in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, only one, CED-3, is essential for all developmentally programmed cell death (6Metzstein M.M. Stanfield G.M. Horvitz H.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 7Shaham S. J. Biol.

InDrosophila melanogaster four caspases, named DCP-1, DREDD/DCP-2, drICE and DRONC, have been reported so far (8Song Z. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev.

Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Among these caspases, DREDD and DRONC contain long prodomains carrying death effector domains and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), respectively, suggesting that these two caspases may act as upstream (class I) caspases. On the other hand, DCP-1 and drICE lack long prodomains and are thus similar to downstream effector (class II) caspases in mammals. Currently, loss of function mutants are only available for dcp-1. dcp-1 mutation results in larval lethality and melanotic tumors (8Song Z. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Additionally, DCP-1 is required for Drosophilaoogenesis, as dcp-1 mutants show a defect in transfer of nurse cell cytoplasmic contents to developing oocytes (13McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1998; 279: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transcript for dredd accumulates in embryonic cells undergoing programmed cell death and in nurse cells in the ovary at a time that coincides with nurse cell death (9Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). droncmRNA is widely expressed during development and appears to be up-regulated by ecdysone in larval salivary glands and midgut before histolysis of these tissues (12Dorstyn L. Colussi P. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The precise roles of drICE and DRONC in programmed cell death in Drosophila have not been established. However, in vitro antibody depletion experiments suggest that drICE is required for apoptotic activity in the S2 Drosophila cell line (14Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Accumulation ofdronc mRNA in salivary glands and midgut may be required to sensitize these tissues for deletion by apoptosis during metamorphosis. These recent studies suggest that specific caspases may mediate tissue and stage specific programmed cell death duringDrosophila development. To fully understand the role of various caspases in cell physiology, it is important to identify all caspases in a given model organism. In this study, we describe the characterization of DECAY, the fifthDrosophila caspase. DECAY is highly similar to class II executioner caspases such as mammalian caspase-3 and caspase-7. We show that decay gene expression is widespread in developing fly embryos, and DECAY has substrate specificity similar to caspase-3 subfamily of caspases. DECAY was identified through a homology search with mammalian caspases as a GenBankTM expressed sequence tag (accession numberAI259958). The expressed sequence tag clone was obtained from BerkleyDrosophila Genome Project in pOT2 vector and was sequenced in full. This clone (clone ID LP3492) contained a 1,797-base pair insert, which was much longer than the 1.1-kilobase predicted size of the transcript (see below). A careful examination of the sequence suggested that ∼700 base pair of the 3′ sequence in this clone may be derived from fusion of a heterologous cDNA. The 5′ 1,101 base pair of the sequence, including a 20 residue poly(A) tail, is likely to represent the authentic full-length decay cDNA containing the entire coding region. This sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession numberAF130469. The 0.85-kilobase coding region ofdecay was amplified from the original pOT2-decayvector by polymerase chain reaction using Pwo polymerase (Roche Biochemicals) and the following oligonucleotides: Primer A, 5′-GGCGGATCCGCCGCCATGGCACCAAGATCCCATACG; and Primer B, 5′-CCGGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGTCTTGGGCTTAACACG(nucleotides corresponding to decay sequence are underlined). Primer A contained a consensus Kozak sequence that required alteration of the initiation site from the original sequence and a BamHI cloning site. Primer B contained anEcoRI site and sequence encoding a FLAG tag. Amplified product was purified and cloned directionally into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The catalytic Cys150 residue of DECAY was mutated to a Gly residue by Quickchange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pOT2-decay as template. Mutant decay cDNA encoding DECAY(C150G) protein was cloned directionally into pcDNA3 as described above. Primer C, 5′-GCGAATTCCATATGCCACCAAGATCCCAT containing aNdeI site and primer D, 5′-GGCGGATCCCGGGTCTTGGGCTTAACACGCAG containing aBamHI site (sequence corresponding to decayis underlined in both primers) were used to amplify wild type and catalytic cysteine mutant DECAY for directional cloning into pET32b vector (Novagen). Recombinant DECAY was generated by transformation of Escherichia coli BL21 cells with DECAY-6xHis or DECAY(C150G)-6xHis constructs in pET32b. Overnight cultures were subcultured 1 in 10 and grown at 37 °C for 2 h. Cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for a further 3 h. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in assay buffer (0.1M HEPES, pH 7.0, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1% CHAPS, 1The abbreviations used are:CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 10 mmdithiothreitol). Recombinant DRONC, caspase-2, and caspase-3 were prepared as described previously (12Dorstyn L. Colussi P. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

YVAD-amino-methylcoumaride (-amc), and DEVD-amc were purchased from Enzyme Systems Inc., Livermore, CA, and VDVAD-amc was from California Peptide Research Inc. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 293T cells were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. For cell death assays, 2 × 105 cells were plated per 35-mm dish the day before transfection. 1.5 μg of pcDNA3-decay, pcDNA3-decay (C150G) or empty vector, were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pEF-βgal) (20Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). All transfections were carried out using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed and stained with X-gal at 24 h or 48 h post-transfection, and β-galactosidase positive cells were scored for apoptotic morphology as described previously (20Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Dorstyn L. Noda M.

At 24 h post-transfection, subcellular localization of DECAY was determined by fixing cells in 47.5% methanol, 47.5% acetone, 5% formaldehyde, and staining with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), followed by anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Biochemicals) for 30 min each. Cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BH2-RFCA). Total RNA from various developmental stages of Drosophila or adult flies was prepared using RNAzol B according to the manufacturer's (Tel-Test Inc.) protocol. Poly(A)+-enriched RNA was prepared using oligo dT magnetic beads (Dynal). Approximately 20 μg of total RNA or 1–2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed onto a 2.2-m formaldehyde gel and transferred to Biodyne A nylon membrane (Pall Corp.). The blot was hybridized to a32P-labeled decay cDNA coding region probe and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. For in situ RNA analysis, antisense and sense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes were prepared using appropriate RNA polymerases from linearized decay cDNA clone. Digoxygenin labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos and larval tissues was essentially as described (23Lehner C.F. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1989; 56: 957-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Embryos and dissected larval tissues were fixed in 0.1 mHEPES, 50 mm EGTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 4% formaldehyde, pH 6.9 for 20 min. The proteinase step was omitted. Dissected ovaries from 3-day-old adult females were fixed as described for embryos and treated with 50% ethanol and 50% xylene for 30 min, washed in ethanol, then in methanol, and finally in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). Ovaries were then refixed for 25 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml) for 8 min at room temperature. After hybridization, nonspecifically bound probe was removed by digestion with RNase A (125 μg/ml in PBS-T) for 1 h at 37 °C. Hybridization was detected using the alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). While searching for new molecules with homology to various mammalian caspases, using TBLASTN program, we identified an expressed sequence tag in the GenBankTM data base which encoded a partial caspase-like molecule. The sequencing of the entire clone revealed that the cDNA has an open reading frame of 287 amino acid residues with a high degree of homology to mammalian caspases, particularly those related to the caspase-3 subfamily (Fig.1). We named this new molecule DECAY, forD rosophila executionercaspase related to Apopain/Yama. DECAY shares approximately 39% identity (54% similarity) withSpodoptera frugiperda caspase-1, 37% identity (56% similarity) with mammalian caspase-3 and caspase-7, 35% identity (53–55% similarity) with Drosophila caspases DCP-1 and drICE, and 32–33% identity (48–52% similarity) with caspase-8 and caspase-10. An alignment of all known Drosophila caspases showed that DECAY is most homologous to an unpublished putative caspase encoded by genomic sequence contained in a data base entry (accession numberAC005466), followed by DCP-1 and drICE (Fig. 1, B andC). Similar to drICE and DCP-1, DECAY lacks a long amino-terminal prodomain. DECAY is distantly related to DRONC and DREDD, the two class I Drosophila caspases. Overall, DECAY is more similar to S. frugiperda caspase-1 and mammalian caspase-3 and caspase-7 than all known Drosophila caspases. Interestingly, DECAY is the only Drosophila caspase that carries a QACRG sequence encompassing the putative catalytic Cys150 residue. In this respect, it is similar to the majority of mammalian caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7. By hybridizing to a filter containing Drosophila genomic P1 clones, we localized the decay gene to the Fas1 contig located within chromosome region 89C6-D4 (data not shown). None of the other published Drososphila caspase genes map to this region. To confirm that DECAY is indeed a caspase, we expressed full-length wild-type and C150G mutant DECAY fused to 6xHis in E. coli. The majority of the protein expressed in E. coliwas insoluble and became inactive upon attempts to purify under both native and denaturing conditions (data not shown). Therefore, we analyzed caspase activity in the soluble fraction of bacterial extracts using fluorogenic peptide substrates. DECAY did not show significant activity on caspase-1 substrate YVAD-amc, however, it efficiently cleaved caspase-3 substrate DEVD-amc (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, DECAY was substantially more active on the pentapeptide substrate VDVAD-amc. This peptide is a preferred substrate for caspase-2, which requires a P5 residue (24Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, in our hands, VDVAD-amc was also a much better substrate for caspase-3, as compared with DEVD-amc (Fig.2 A). As expected, the C150G mutant DECAY did not exhibit any appreciable caspase activity. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is one of the key cellular substrates of caspase-3 (25Tewari M. Quan L.T.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). To check whether PARP can serve as a substrate for DECAY in vitro, we incubated a35S-labeled truncated PARP protein that carries the caspase-3 cleavage site (18Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13134-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with recombinant DECAY and measured its cleavage by electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 B, this protein was efficiently cleaved by DECAY. The cleavage products generated by DECAY were identical in size to those generated by caspase-3 suggesting that both caspases cleave following the same DEVD sequence in PARP. Many caspases, when overexpressed in cultured cells, induce apoptosis to some degree. We therefore analyzed whether DECAY is able to induce apoptosis in transfected cells. In 293T cells, at 24 h following transfections, around 35% of cells transfected with the wild-type decayconstruct showed apoptotic morphology when compared with cells transfected with the empty vector or an expression construct carrying the C150G mutant DECAY (Fig.3 A). In NIH3T3 cells, by 24 h post-transfection, a small number (∼10%) of cells transfected with the wild-type decay were apoptotic (Fig.3 A). By 48 h, decay transfected cells showing apoptotic morphology increased slightly to around 15% (data not shown). This level of cell death induced by DECAY overexpression is similar to that induced by caspase-3 under similar conditions (22Dorstyn L. Kumar S. Cell Death Diff. 1997; 4: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26566-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also assessed the effect of DECAY overexpression in MCF-7 cells andDrosophila S2 cells. In both cases levels of apoptosis similar to those seen in NIH3T3 cells were observed (data not shown). Using FLAG-tagged DECAY, we further investigated the subcellular localization of DECAY protein in transfected cells by immunofluorescence analysis employing an anti-FLAG antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody. In both NIH3T3 and 293T cells, most of the DECAY-FLAG protein was present in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 3 B). In RNA blots, decay was present as an approximately 1.1-kilobase transcript in most developmental stages, larvae, pupae, and in the adult fly (Fig. 4). Relatively high levels of decay transcript were detected in the adult fly (Fig. 4 B). We further analyzed the expression pattern ofdecay during fly development by in situhybridization to Drosophila embryos and larval tissues using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA probe (Fig.5). decay is expressed at low levels throughout embryogenesis and shows no specific up-regulation at stage 11 (Fig. 5, A–C, and data not shown) when programmed cell death first becomes evident in Drosophila(28Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). decay mRNA was present in stage 1–4 syncitial embryos (not shown), suggesting that it is maternally deposited into the embryo, because zygotic expression does not begin before stage 5 (29Edgar B.A. Schubiger G. Cell. 1986; 44: 871-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In stage 6–7 cellularized embyros, decay mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 5 B), but in later stagesdecay mRNA is present at higher levels within the gut (Fig. 5 C). We also examined the expression ofdecay in third instar larval tissues and during oogenesis (Fig. 5, E–L). High levels of decayexpression was observed in salivary glands and midgut tissue from third instar larvae (Fig. 5, E and F), preceding the onset of apoptosis in these tissues, which occurs after pupariation (30Jiang C. Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S. Development. 1997; 124: 4673-4683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only very low levels of decay expression were observed throughout third instar larval eye imaginal discs and brain lobes (Fig.5, G and H), which contain apoptotic cells at this stage (31Wolff T. Ready D.F. Development. 1991; 113: 825-839PubMed Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of decay expression was not observed in eye disc or brain lobe cells undergoing apoptosis.Figure 5In situ mRNA analysis ofdecay expression during Drosophila development. decay mRNA was detected byin situ hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA probe.

J, adult egg chambers showing that decay mRNA is increased at stage 9 compared with earlier stages. K, Hoechst 33258 staining of DNA in adult egg chambers, showing the morphology of nuclei. At stage 12 the nurse cells (see large nuclei on the left in K) are undergoing apoptosis, and decay mRNA has been dumped into the oocyte (shown in J). The oocyte is surrounded by follicle cells (see small nuclei in K), whereas the germinal vesicle is out of the plane of focus. L, decay sense control on adult egg chambers showing no staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During oogenesis decay mRNA is detected in egg chambers of all stages but was present at higher levels in the nurse cells after stage 10a (Fig. 5 I and data not shown). In stage 12 egg chambers, decay mRNA was absent from nurse cells that have initiated apoptosis and present at high levels in the developing oocyte (Fig. 5, J and K), consistent with dumping of the nurse cell cytoplasm into the oocyte that occurs at this stage (32Foley K. Cooley L. Development. 1998; 125: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of decay mRNA in egg chambers is consistent with a role for decay in apoptosis of the nurse cells. We have previously shown that dronc mRNA is up-regulated when isolated salivary glands and midgut from second instar larvae are exposed to ecdysone (12Dorstyn L. Colussi P. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because larval salivary glands and midgut show relatively high expression of decay transcript, it was of interest to check whether decay is also regulated by ecdysone. As shown in Fig. 6, no up-regulation of decay transcript was evident in ecysone treated salivary glands and midgut. Under similar conditions,dronc transcript was up-regulated at least 5-fold in response to ecdysone (Fig. 6). We have described here preliminary characterization of a new Drosophila caspase DECAY. Presence of multiple caspases in Drosophila suggest that cell death pathways in the fly are likely to be complex. DECAY is most similar to caspase-3-like effector caspases and shares a similar substrate specificity. Low levels of decay transcript are widely expressed during Drosophila embryogenesis. Higher expression of decay mRNA in larval salivary glands and midgut suggests a possible role for DECAY in programmed deletion of these obsolete tissues during metamorphosis and tissue remodeling. Additionally, moderate expression of decay mRNA in nurse cells suggests a possible role for DECAY in nurse cell death. Because high levels of decay transcript are also found in the adult animals, DECAY may also be involved in regulating the normal cell turnover in the adult. Generation of loss-of-function decaymutant, or RNA ablation studies would shed further light on the role of DECAY in programmed cell death in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2008907994,"The extra domain-A (EDA), present in fibronectin (FN) molecules arising from alternatively spliced transcripts, appears only during specific biological and pathogenic processes. However, its function is poorly understood. To define the physiologic role of this domain in joint connective tissue, the biological effects on rabbit cartilage explants, chondrocytes, and synovial cells were studied. A recombinant EDA protein (rEDA) increased proteoglycan release (3.6-fold) in cartilage explant cultures and markedly induced production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 in chondrocytes. In addition, rEDA induced MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 in synovial cells. These effects were elicited only by rEDA, while its neighboring type III repeats, III11 or III12, scarcely had any such effects. Interestingly, reorganization of F-actin stress fibers accompanied MMP-1 expression in synovial cells treated with rEDA, suggesting alteration of cellular phenotype. Subsequent Northern blotting revealed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β, was induced by rEDA prior to MMP-1 expression. Delayed MMP-1 expression suggests that rEDA-induced IL-1s promote MMP-1 expression in an autocrine manner. This hypothesis is supported by the reduction of EDA-induced MMP-1 production by IL-1 receptor antagonist. The effect of EDA on MMP-1 production was reduced by connection with an adjacent type III repeat on either the NH2 or COOH side of EDA and was abolished by connection on both sides of EDA, suggesting that exposure of either the NH2 or COOH terminus of EDA domain by proteolytic cleavage releases the inducing activity. In agreement with these results, full-length cellular FN did not induce MMP-1 production. Furthermore, a 160-kDa EDA-positive FN fragment, which was purified from human placental tissue and corresponds to the region from NH2terminus through the EDA, induced MMP-1 production. Taken together, these results suggest that the EDA in FN fragments triggers alterations of cell physiology and plays a role in matrix degradation in joint connective tissue.

Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). It is a dimer of subunits cross-linked by disulfide bonds. Each FN monomer is comprised of three types of repeating units designated type I, II, and III (2Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Vibe Pedersen K. Sahl P. Sottrup Jensen L. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Some of these repeats bind to cell surface and extracellular matrix components such as integrins, collagens, heparin, and fibrin. Several of these binding activities have been assigned to the motif sequences in FN, including the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the type III10 domain (3Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar), the Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (PHSRN) motif in the type III9domain (4Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the CS-1 sequence in the III-CS region (5Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6886-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this multifunctional glycoprotein mediates a variety of cellular functions including cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell differentiation.FN molecules have multiple isoforms generated from a single gene by alternative splicing of combinations of 3 exons: extra domain-A (EDA), extra domain-B (EDB), and III-CS. Both EDA and EDB exons are type III repeating units (6Bennett V.D. Pallante K.M. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5918-5924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma fibronectin (pFN), produced by hepatocytes and abundant in plasma, lacks both the EDA and EDB domains. However, cellular FNs (cFNs), many of which are insoluble and incorporated into the pericellular matrix, contain the EDA and EDB segments in various combinations. The EDA domain is present in FN molecules produced during embryonic development (7Ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, its presence in adults is minimal except in some disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis (8Hino K. Shiozawa S. Kuroki Y. Ishikawa H. Shiozawa K. Sekiguchi K. Hirano H. Sakashita E. Miyashita K. Chihara K. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), wound healing (9Ffrench-Constant C. Van de Water L. Dvorak H.F. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), epithelial fibrosis (10Kuhn C. Boldt J. King Jr., T.E. Crouch E. Vartio T. McDonald J.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and vascular intimal proliferation (11Glukhova M.A. Frid M.G. Shekhonin B.V. Vasilevskaya T.D. Grunwald J. Saginati M. Koteliansky V.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, the highly regulated splicing of the EDA domain into transcripts suggests significantly different FN functions. It was reported that pFN and cFN differ in structural and physical properties such as glycosylation (12Fukuda M. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6856-6860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubility (13Yamada K.M. Schlesinger D.H. Kennedy D.W. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as well as presence of EDA domain. However, the biological functions the EDA domain confers upon these molecules are still poorly understood (7Ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).In this study, the biological functions of the FN EDA domain were studied in synovial cells and chondrocytes, which are integral components of joint connective tissue metabolic regulation. The results show induction of MMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs in response to exposure to the EDA domain. This observation, that a distinct domain of an extracellular matrix protein can trigger gene expression, has profound implications on biological and pathologic processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Recombinant FN Type III Repeat ProteinscDNAs encoding individual human fibronectin type III repeats were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of human liver mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), using Takara RNA PCR kit (AMV) version 2.1 (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR profile consisted of 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. After the final cycle, the reaction was maintained at 72 °C for an additional 7 min. The primers for EDA (from Asn1600 through Thr1689) are the sense primer EDA-s, 5′-CCATATGAACATTGATCGCCCTAAAGGACT-3′ and the antisense primer EDA-a, 5′-AGCGGCCGCTGTGGACTGGGTTCCAATCAGGGG-3′. The primers for III11 (from Glu1510 through Thr1599) are the sense primer III11-s, 5′-CCATATGGAAATTGACAAACCATCCCA-3′ and the antisense primer III11-a, 5′-AGCGGCCGCGGTTACTGCAGTCTGAACCA-3′. The primers for III12 (from Ala1690 through Thr1779) are the sense primer III12-s, 5′- CCATATGGCTATTCCTGCACCAACTGA-3′ and the antisense primer III12-a, 5′- AGCGGCCGCAGTGGTGACAACACCCTGAG-3′. The NdeI site on the sense primers and theNotI site on the antisense primers are underlined. Amino acids are numbered from the amino-terminal pyroglutamate of the mature protein (GenBank accession number X02761). cDNAs encoding FN fragment proteins with several permutations of type III repeats consisting of III11, EDA, and III12, as depicted in Fig. 9 A, were also amplified by RT-PCR as described above. PCR was performed using primer sets, III11-s and EDA-a for the III11-EDA protein, and EDA-s and III12-a for the EDA-III12protein. cDNAs encoding the III11-EDA-III12protein and the III11-III12 protein were amplified using the common primer set, III11-s and III12-a, and they were then separated on agarose electrophoresis according to their molecular sizes. PCR-amplified cDNA was subcloned into the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), digested with NdeI and NotI, then subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-22b (Novagen, Madison, WI), which enables expression of fusion proteins carrying six additional histidine residues (6×His tags) at the carboxyl terminus. Individual FN type III protein genes with 6×His tags were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by TALON Metal Affinity Resin column (CLONTECH). Endotoxin levels in the highest rEDA concentration used were under 0.2 ng/ml, which are insufficient to affect MMP biosynthesis in the culture systems subsequently described.Proteoglycan Degradation AssayRabbit articular cartilage was obtained as described previously (14Saito S. Katoh M. Masumoto M. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cartilage was cut into slices, whose weight was adjusted to approximately 5 mg and placed in the wells of 24-well plates. Explants were cultured in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 48 h, with or without exogenous recombinant FN type III proteins. Glycosaminoglycan in the culture supernatants and papain-digested cartilage were determined by the dimethylmethylene blue assay (15Andrews H.J. Plumpton T.A. Harper G.P. Cawston T.E. Agents Actions. 1992; 37: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the percentage of glycosaminoglycan in the culture supernatant to the sum of glycosaminoglycan contents in the culture supernatants and cartilage digested with papain.Cell CultureSynovial cells and chondrocytes were prepared from Japanese white rabbits. Synovial cells were isolated from synovial tissue incubated with 0.4% collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 3 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C. Chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage slices incubated with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with 0.15% collagenase A for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were cultured to a subconfluent monolayer in DMEM containing 10% FBS. To assess effects of rEDA, cells were stimulated with different recombinant FN type III proteins in DMEM containing 5% FBS. Synovial cells were used for assays after just 1 passage. Chondrocytes were used without passage.Measurement of Marix Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA)MMP-1 in the culture supernatants was measured using a double-antibody sandwich ELISA system that recognizes pro and active forms of MMP-1, as described previously (14Saito S. Katoh M. Masumoto M. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mouse polyclonal antibodies generated against rabbit pro-MMP-1 were used as both the primary trapping antibody and the secondary biotinylated antibody. Briefly, plates were coated with the first antibody and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. The plates were then incubated with the culture supernatants of rabbit synovial cells, followed by incubation with the secondary biotinylated antibody. The plates were developed using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution rate of 1:2000, followed by addition of tetramethylbenzidine. Absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a plate reader.Western Blot Analysis of MMP-1 and MMP-3The culture supernatants of rabbit synovial cells were heat-denatured with 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with Block Ace (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan). The membrane was then incubated with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-rabbit pro-MMP-1 polyclonal antibodies or the mouse monoclonal antibody MP1807, which was generated against rabbit MMP-3 as described previously (16Matsumoto S. Kobayashi T. Katoh M. Saito S. Ikeda Y. Kobori M. Masuho Y. Watanabe T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both antibodies recognize pro and active forms. After washing, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) at a dilution rate of 1:2000, followed by staining using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Gelatin ZymographyThe culture supernatants of rabbit synovial cells were applied without reduction to a 10% polyacrylamide slab gel impregnated with 1 mg/ml gelatin. Gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h and then for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 0.02% Brij-35. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Northern BlottingNorthern blotting was performed as described previously (17Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Saito S. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from rabbit synovial cells using an ISOGEN kit (WAKO, Osaka, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Probes for rabbit MMP-1, rabbit MMP-3, rabbit MMP-2, rabbit MMP-9, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were prepared using a BcaBEST Labeling Kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), as described previously (18Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The probe for rabbit vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was prepared from cDNA fragments obtained according to the method of Maniscalco et al. (19Maniscalco W.M. Watkins R.H. Finkelstein J.N. Campbell M.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Other probes were generated from cDNA fragments corresponding to nucleotide 6–496 for rabbit interleukin-1α (IL-1α) (GenBank accession number X02852) and nucleotide 227–778 for rabbit IL-1β (GenBank accession numberM26295).CytohistochemistryRabbit synovial cells were cultured using a Lab-Tek Chamber Slide system (Nunc, Naperville, IL) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Subconfluent synovial cells were treated with different recombinant FN type III proteins for 48 h. Slides were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with ice-cold acetone, and stained with fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and propidium iodide (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). The coverslips were then mounted using a SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and examined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Preparation and Characterization of FN Proteins and an FN Protein FragmentpFN was purified from human plasma as described previously (17Matsumoto S.

Acta. 1997; 1354: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cFN, obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), was treated with the Kurimover II (Kurita, Tokyo, Japan) column according to the manufacturer's instructions to remove endotoxin. The EDA-positive FN protein fragment was prepared from human placentas. Placental tissue was homogenized and extracted in 4 m urea in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride according to the method of Laine et al. (20Laine R.A. Fisher S.J. Zhu B.C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The extract was diluted 20-fold with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and applied to a Gelatin-Sepharose CL-4B column. The gelatin-column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 mNaCl (TBS), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, then eluted with 1.5 m KBr-TBS, followed by 8 m urea-TBS. The EDA-positive FN fragment was found in fractions eluted with 8m urea by Western blotting using rabbit anti-EDA polyclonal antibodies, which were raised against rEDA. These fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography (CHT-10, BioLogic system, Bio-Rad) with a 10–500 mm linear gradient of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).The binding activities of anti-EDA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes of EDA-positive FN fragment were determined by ELISA, as follows. Plates were coated with a single type of EDA-positive FN fragment, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, then were incubated with the anti-FN mAb being tested, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Anti-FN mAbs, FN9-1, FNC4-4, FN12-8, FNH3-8, and FN8-12, which were obtained from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), specifically recognize the amino-terminal heparin/fibrin-binding domain, the gelatin-binding domain, the cell-binding domain, the second heparin-binding domain, and the COOH-terminal fibrin-binding domain, respectively.RESULTSCartilage Catabolism Is Enhanced by Recombinant EDA ProteinThe recombinant human FN type III repeat proteins, illustrated in Fig. 1 A, were expressed in E. coli as 6×His fusion proteins. Each protein was then purified on a TALON Metal Affinity Resin column and gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). The purified recombinant protein encoding the EDA domain (rEDA) was added to rabbit cartilage explant cultures to determine whether the EDA domain affects cartilage catabolism. rEDA increased proteoglycan release 3.6 times more than the unstimulated control level (Fig. 2). However, its adjacent type III repeat, III11, did not significantly increase proteoglycan release. This result suggests that rEDA facilitates cartilage catabolism, possibly by inducing or modulating protease expression.Figure 1Expression of recombinant FN type III repeat proteins. A, the modular structure of FN is shown schematically. The three alternative spliced domains (EDA, EDB, and IIICS) are stippled.

MMP-1 levels in the culture supernatants were then assessed by ELISA to determine whether rEDA affects protease levels or not. In chondrocyte cultures, Fig.3 A shows MMP-1 levels markedly increased to more than 1.5 μg/ml after treatment with rEDA concentrations ranging from 30 to 300 nm. In contrast, MMP-1 levels were negligible in unstimulated control cultures (Fig.3 A). This induction was specific for rEDA, since treatment with either of its adjacent type III repeats III11 or III12 did not increase MMP-1 levels. Similar increased MMP-1 levels due to rEDA treatment were observed in synovial cell cultures (Fig. 3 B). In addition to ELISA experiments, Western blotting analysis detected pro-MMP-1 (55 and 57 kDa) and pro-MMP-3 (53 kDa) in the culture supernatants of synovial cells treated with rEDA, but not in cell culture supernatants of unstimulated cultures or cultures treated with III11 or III12 (Fig. 4, Aand B). These data are consistent with previous reports that MMP-1 and MMP-3 pro-enzymes were detected in stimulated synovial cell cultures (21Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and chondrocyte cultures (22Arner E.C. Tortorella M.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, gelatin zymography showed that gelatinase activity corresponding to pro-MMP-9 increased slightly in synovial cell cultures after treatment with rEDA, but was negligible in unstimulated control cultures (Fig.4 C). Another gelatinase activity corresponding to pro-MMP-2, which is constitutively expressed (22Arner E.C. Tortorella M.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was not affected by rEDA treatment (Fig. 4C). Thus, it is unlikely that the increased production of MMP-1, -3, and -9 by rEDA is due to a general induction of protein synthesis. Northern blotting analysis of MMP transcripts in rabbit synovial cells was performed to determine whether rEDA induces transcription of MMPs. As shown in Fig.5, rEDA treatment increased MMP-1mRNA level. However, neither III11 nor III12 protein treatment significantly increased MMP-1mRNA level. These observations are in good agreement with the protein results. rEDA also induced transcription of MMP-3and MMP-9 mRNA. Any change was scarcely observed in the level of MMP-2 mRNA, but its doublet signals are consistent with a previous report (18Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, results from protein and mRNA experiments show that FN EDA domain treatment promotes expression of MMPs at the transcription level.Figure 3Dose-related induction of MMP-1 by rEDA.Cells were treated with increasing concentrations (10, 30, 100, and 300 nm) of rEDA or other type III repeats for 48 h.

F-actin microfilaments in synovial cell monolayers were stained with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin after treatment with rEDA for 48 h (Fig.6). In untreated cultures, cell morphology was fibrous, with F-actin stress fibers aligned parallel to the long axis of the cell (Fig. 6, A and D). This is consistent with the fibroblast-like shape of synovial cell monolayers previously reported (23Zvaifler N.J. Tsai V. Alsalameh S. von Kempis J. Firestein G.S. Lotz M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1125-1138PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cells treated with rEDA showed a marked change to a more rounded morphology, with partial disassembly of F-actin stress fibers (Fig. 6, B andE). No morphologic change or change in F-actin fibers was observed in cells treated with III11 protein (Fig. 5,C and F). Thus, rEDA appears to cause reorganization of F-actin stress fibers, leading to morphologic change of synovial cells.Figure 6rEDA induces reorganization of F-actin stress fibers in rabbit synovial cells.

However, cognate E3s and/or substrate proteins have been identified for only a few E2s. To identify proteins that can interact with the human E2 UbcH7, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Two proteins were identified and termed human homologue of Drosophila ariadne (HHARI) and UbcH7-associated protein (H7-AP1). Both proteins, which are widely expressed, are characterized by the presence of RING finger and in between RING fingers (IBR) domains. No other overt structural similarity was observed between the two proteins. In vitrobinding studies revealed that an N-terminal RING finger motif (HHARI) and the IBR domain (HHARI and H7-AP1) are involved in the interaction of these proteins with UbcH7. Furthermore, binding of these two proteins to UbcH7 is specific insofar that both HHARI and H7-AP1 can bind to the closely related E2, UbcH8, but not to the unrelated E2s UbcH5 and UbcH1. Although it is not clear at present whether HHARI and H7-AP1 serve, for instance, as substrates for UbcH7 or represent proteins with E3 activity, our data suggests that a subset of RING finger/IBR proteins are functionally linked to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). In this process, ubiquitin is first activated in an ATP-dependent step forming a thioester bond with an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Ubiquitin is then transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2),1 retaining the high energy thioester bond. Thereafter, the E2, alone or in conjunction with an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), catalyzes the final attachment of ubiquitin to the target protein (2Scheffner M. Smith S. Jentsch S. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, London1998: 65-91Crossref Google Scholar). Ubiquitin itself can then serve as a ubiquitinylation substrate, resulting in the generation of polyubiquitinylated proteins possibly with the aid of an E4 (3Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Finally, ubiquitinylated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. It has been proposed that the selection of an individual protein for proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin pathway requires a unique combination of an E2 and E3. In S. cerevisiae, some 13 E2s or E2-related proteins have been identified, and many more are present in higher eukaryotes (2Scheffner M. Smith S. Jentsch S. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, London1998: 65-91Crossref Google Scholar). E2s are characterized by a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 150 amino acid residues. Despite their functional redundancy, individual E2s appear to be involved in different cellular processes and, therefore, in the ubiquitinylation of different substrate proteins. The distinct substrate specificity of E2s is at least in part explained by the observation that different E2s interact with different E3s. Four classes of E3 have been identified to date; in contrast to E2s, they exhibit no overt sequence homology. These are yeast UBR1 and its mammalian homologues (4Varshavsky A. Byrd C. Davydov I.V.

Despite their different mode of action, it appears that a common feature of all E3s is to specifically interact with distinct E2s.

Over the past decade, it has become clear that many cellular proteins are targeted for degradation by the ubiquitinylation pathway. However, the respective E2s and E3s mediating their ubiquitinylation have been determined for only a few proteins. Furthermore, although several distinct classes of E3 have been identified to date, it seems likely that novel classes of E3s, or other proteins involved in mediating the substrate specificity of E2s, remain to be discovered. Homology cloning has clearly proven successful in the identification of additional members of specific E3 families such as the hect family. However, because of the lack of homology between the different classes of E3, other interaction-based approaches must be employed to identify novel E3s and/or ubiquitinylation “ancillary proteins.” We therefore employed the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate proteins that interact with UbcH7, a human E2 that in vitro appears to be involved in the ubiquitinylation of various proteins including the tumor suppressor p53 (13Nuber U.

A human testis cDNA-GAL4 activation domain fusion library in the vector pACT2 (GAL4 768–881 AD, LEU2, ampr, HA epitope tag) (CLONTECH) was utilized to identify UbcH7-interacting proteins. The bait plasmid was transformed into S. cerevisiae strain HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3, URA3::GAL4 17-mers(x3) -CYC1 TATA -lacZ) (CLONTECH). Clones were selected on minimal synthetic dropout medium in the absence of tryptophan. Yeast clones harboring the bait plasmid were then sequentially transformed with the “prey” library. Positive clones, potentially harboring UbcH7-interacting species, were identified both by their capacity to grow on media without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and the detection of β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast clones, selecting for pACT2 cDNA library plasmids by transformation of the leucine auxotroph Escherichia colistrain HB101. Plasmids were then isolated, the inserts were amplified by PCR using flanking vector oligonucleotide primers, and clones were then grouped by size and analyzed by cross-hybridization. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, pACT2 library plasmids were transformed into the yeast host strain harboring no plasmid, yeast containing pGBT9 vector only, yeast containing pLAM5 (a GAL4 human lamin C fusion), or pGBT-UbcH7. Only those library plasmids demonstrating a requirement for the pGBT-UbcH7 plasmid for induced expression of the lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes were considered further. To assess the specificity of the interaction, UbcH7 was cloned into the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pGAD424 (GAL4 768–881 AD, LEU2, ampr), and inserts derived from the pACT2 cDNA library were cloned into pGBT9 as in-frame fusions. These were co-transformed into two S. cerevisiae strains, HF7c and SFY256 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, canr, gal4–542, gal80–538, URA3::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -lacZ); interaction was assessed in the former strain as described above and in the latter using the β-galactosidase assay. Library clones exhibiting a specific interaction in all assays were selected for DNA sequence analysis. To isolate full-length cDNA clones of human homologue of Drosophilaariadne (HHARI), a human fetal brain cDNA library panel (Origene) was screened by PCR using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to nucleotides 591–611 (dCATGAGCAGGAGGAGGATTAC) and 889–867 (dTTCAAGTAGCAGATCTGACAAGG) of the full-length sequence (GenBanktm accession number AJ243190). Positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Multiple human tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with radiolabeledHHARI or H7-AP1 DNA probes. DNA was generated by PCR from the inserts of the appropriate pACT2 clones and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HHARI primer pairs dATTTCACTGGCCTTGAATGTGGAC and dACTAAGATATCACAACCATGAGCA (nucleotides 904–927 and 1033–1010), and dACCATCTAGAGTGCTCATGCA and dCAATGGTTTATCTACCTTTTTATTAC (nucleotides 2023–2044 and 2177–2152), were used to screen the GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid DNA panel (UK HGMP Resource Center). The data generated was submitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research sequence tagged site mapping server.

The insert from the smallest pACT2 HHARI clone that interacted with UbcH7, encompassing 666–2178 base pairs (GenBankTM accession number AF072832) was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (termed GST-HHARI (118–557)). GST fusion protein was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deletion mutants of GST-HHARI (118–557) were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments of this region into the same vector. GST-HHARI fusion protein binding assays with E2s were performed by incubating ∼0.5 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-HHARI (118–557) or deletion mutant with 10 μl of35S-radiolabeled E2 in 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulphonyl fluoride (0.2 mm), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), EDTA (1 mm), leupeptin (50 μm), and pepstatin (1 μm) at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing the beads five times with binding buffer (1 ml/wash), bound radiolabeled E2 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acylamide gel, 37.5:1 acryl:bis) and detected by autoradiography. To assess the capacity of GST-HHARI (118–557) to bind cellular UbcH7, a HeLa cell lysate was prepared. A 100-mm dish of semiconfluent HeLa cells was lysed on ice for 45 min in 1 ml of binding buffer containing protease inhibitors (see above). Identical aliquots of lysate (300 μl), precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-HHARI (118–557) or, as a negative control, with GST-APC (the C-terminal 268 amino acids of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein that interacts with EB1 protein (26Su L.K. Burrell M. Gyruris J. Brent R. Wiltshire R. Trent J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Re s. 1995; 55: 2972-2977PubMed Google Scholar)). Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using Towbin's buffer containing 20% (v/v) methanol (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). UbcH7 was detected using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-UbcH7 peptide antiserum raised against its C-terminal 18 residues. EB1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Bound antibodies were detected using S-protein horseradish peroxidase and visualized by chemiluminescent detection using SuperSignal ULTRA (Pierce). Specific regions of the UbcH7 cDNA (15Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Robinson P.A.

Genomics. 1998; 51: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and cloned into the BamHI site of pET32a as in-frame thioredoxin (TXD) C-terminal fusion proteins (Novagen). Binding assays were performed as described above using ∼0.5 μg each of TXD fusion protein and GST-HHARI (118–557). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected as described above. 0.5 × 106 independent cDNA clones of a human testis cDNA library were screened for interaction with pGBT-UbcH7. Two groups of cross-hybridizing clones were identified and initially termed H7-AP (UbcH7-associatedprotein) type I clones (seven cross-hybridizing clones) and H7-AP2 clones (six clones). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by performing a “vector-swap” experiment in which UbcH7 was expressed from the pGBT vector and the H7-AP1 orH7-AP2 cDNA inserts from the pACT2 construct. The longest H7-AP2 clone of 1605 nucleotides encompassed amino acids 93–557 (Fig. 1 A). A full-length clone, encoding the entire open reading frame of 557 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) and constituting a protein of approximately 61 kDa, was obtained by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library. A data base search with the full-length H7-AP2 clone revealed that the encoded protein shows striking similarity (72% identity) to the D. melanogaster ariadne protein (see Fig.1 A). Hence, H7-AP2 was renamed HHARI. A secondDrosophila homologue, of lower identity, which we term ariadne2, and a partial murine orthologue were also identified (Fig.1 A). The deduced HHARI protein sequence displays several notable primary structural characteristics: a highly acidic domain and a poly(Gly) tract in the N-terminal region of the protein and three Cys/His-rich motifs located centrally. Two of these motifs, CX 2CX 13CXHX 2CX 2CX 19CX 4C and CX 2CX 9CXHX 2CX 4CX 4CX 2C, encompassing amino acids 186–236 and 344–375, respectively, correspond to the consensus sequence of the RING finger motif, CX 2CX (9–39)CX (1–3)HX (2–3)CX 2CX 4–48CX 2C (28Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The central Cys/His-rich region has recently been termed the “in between RING fingers” (IBR) motif (residues 257–317) (29Morett E. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The largest of the H7-AP1 clones of 2366 nucleotides encompassed the C-terminal 734 amino acids of an open reading frame (Fig. 1 B). A data base search using this cDNA revealed an exact match to the 3′ region of a partial cDNA clone of 5404 base pairs encoding an open reading frame of 1753 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number AB014608). Amino acids 453–482 of the predicted coding region again represent a RING finger motif, CX 2CX 9CXHX 2CX 2CX 4CX 2C. Furthermore, an extended Cys-rich, RING finger-like motif was also identified between amino acids 273 and 422, CXHX 10HCX 2CX 5CX 7CCXHXCCX 2CX 16CX 2CX 4CX 33CX 5CX 5CX 4CX 5CX 3CX 2CX 4CX 6HX 5CXH (Fig. 1 B). This extended motif includes an IBR domain between residues 358 and 422. To assess the expression pattern of H7-AP1 and HHARI, Northern blot analysis was performed using the respective cDNAs as a probe. ThreeHHARI transcripts of approximately 2.2, 2.7, and 6.5 kb were observed in all tissues, although the 2.2-kb species was weakly expressed except in testis, where it is the predominant transcript (Fig. 2 A). The three transcripts share a common open reading frame but have alternative polyadenylation sites (data not shown). Particularly high levels of the 6.5-kb transcripts were observed in skeletal muscle, spleen, testis, and ovary, and high levels of the 2.7-kb transcript were observed in skeletal muscle and testis. A predominant H7-AP1 transcript of approximately 9 kb was observed in all tissues (Fig. 2 B), although relatively higher levels were observed in brain, kidney, and testis. The chromosomal localization of the HHARI gene was determined by radiation hybrid mapping using oligonucleotide primer pairs derived from both the coding region and the 3′ untranslated region. The mapping data for HHARI with both primer sets were in complete agreement, localizing the gene to the long arm of chromosome 15, 2.84 cR from the marker WI-3873 and 79 cR from the top of chromosome 15. H7-AP1 was mapped to chromosome 6p12–21.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. To test whether the observed interaction of UbcH7 with HHARI and H7-AP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system can also be observedin vitro, HHARI and H7-AP1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. The respective GST fusion proteins were then incubated with different radiolabeled E2s generated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and the amount of bound E2s determined in a co-precipitation analysis. The GST-HHARI fusion protein associated with UbcH7 and the closely related UbcH8 (approximately 25% of input radiolabeled E2 was bound to HHARI) but not with the unrelated E2s UbcH1 or UbcH5 (Fig. 3). A similar pattern of interactions was observed with H7-AP1 (data not shown). Next, the ability of GST-HHARI (118–557) to interact with endogenous cellular UbcH7 was tested. Protein extracts were prepared from HeLa cells and incubated with GST-HHARI bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4, α-UbcH7, lane A), and the presence of UbcH7 was detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against UbcH7. This demonstrated that cellular UbcH7 specifically bound to GST-HHARI. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated by the observation that UbcH7 did not bind to GST alone or to an unrelated GST fusion protein encompassing the C-terminal 200 amino acids of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein (Fig. 4, α-UbcH7, lanes G and C,respectively). The binding specificity is further confirmed by the observation that, as expected, the cellular EB1 protein formed a stable complex with the GST-APC fusion protein but not with GST-HHARI (Fig. 4,α-EB-1, lanes L, G, A, and C). To delineate the region of HHARI that mediates the interaction with UbcH7, a series of N- and C-terminal mutants of HHARI were prepared as GST fusion proteins (see Fig. 5 A, fusion proteins A–J). These constructs were then assayed for their ability to associate with radiolabeled UbcH7. The results indicated that the UbcH7 binding region maps to amino acids 118–293 of HHARI, which encompasses the N-terminal RING finger motif (amino acids 186–236) and part of the IBR motif (amino acids 269–327) (see Figs. 1 and 5 B). A second series of GST-HHARI deletion constructs was then used to fine map the E2 binding domain (Fig. 5 A, fusion proteins K–U). Results from these binding assays (Fig. 5 B) indicated that the minimal UbcH7 binding domain lies between residues 167–293. Although the N-terminal RING finger motif was necessary for UbcH7 binding, a fusion protein containing this motif alone (GST-HHARI (118–242) fusion protein P, Fig. 5) failed to bind the E2. This indicated that both the N-terminal RING finger motif and part of the IBR domain are required for stable interaction with UbcH7. Similar studies on H7-AP1 revealed that a larger polypeptide sequence (residues 1–441) was required for interaction with UbcH7. This sequence does not incorporate the classic RING finger motif that lies between residues, 453–482 (CX 2CX 9CXHX 2CX 2CX 4CX 2C) but contains an extended cysteine-rich sequence interspersed with histidine residues (CXHX 10HCX 2CX 5CX 7CCXHXCCX 2CX 16CX 2CX 4CX 33CX 5CX 5 CX 4CX 5CX 3CX 2CX 4CX 6HX 5CXH), which includes the IBR motif between residues 358–422. No other recognized motif is present between residues 1–441. A series of N-terminal and C-terminal UbcH7 TXD fusion protein constructs were employed to map the HHARI binding domain within UbcH7. The capacities of these mutants to bind GST-HHARI (118–557) were compared with full-length TXD-UbcH7 fusion protein (Fig.6). One deletion mutant, encompassing amino acids 101–154, bound to the HHARI fusion protein, but at a level approximately 5-fold lower than the binding exhibited by full-length UbcH7 (Fig. 6). This observation indicated that the C-terminal 54 amino acids of UbcH7 contain a region that is intrinsically involved in binding to HHARI, but other regions of UbcH7 may contribute to stabilize this interaction or may contain additional binding sites for HHARI. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the N-terminal construct, containing UbcH7 amino acids 1–60, can bind HHARI, although with a very much reduced efficiency (Fig. 6). Finally, a larger N-terminal (1–100) or a shorter C-terminal (61–154) construct completely failed to bind to HHARI. This suggests that these fusion proteins are conformationally compromised and prevent the binding of HHARI. We have identified two novel human proteins, HHARI and H7-AP1, that interact with UbcH7 and the closely related E2 UbcH8 but not with the unrelated E2s UbcH1 and UbcH5. No overt structural similarity was identified between them other than the presence of RING finger and IBR motifs. RING finger- and IBR motif-containing domains are proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions (28Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Morett E. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, an N-terminal RING finger domain and part of the IBR motif of HHARI and the IBR motif of H7-AP1 are required for interaction with UbcH7 and UbcH8, although other, as yet undescribed, structural motifs may contribute to these interactions. While this article was under review, it was reported that another RING finger protein, termed Rbx1, recruits the E2 UBC3CDC34 to SCF complexes (30Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Skowyra D. Koepp D.M.

Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that distinct subclasses of RING finger- or IBR motif-containing proteins represent a new family of proteins that specifically interact with distinct E2 enzymes. In support of the hypothesis that RING finger- or IBR motif-containing proteins commonly play a role in protein ubiquitinylation, the presence of these motifs has previously been observed in proteins associated with the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Arabidopsis PRT1 (which, like HHARI, contains two RING finger motifs) appears to be involved in the degradation of proteins via the N-end rule pathway (33Potuschak T. Stary S. Schlogelhofer P. Becker F. Nejinskaia V. Bachmair A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7904-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A subunit of APC, APC11, is very similar to Rbx1 (32Tyers M.

Science. 1998; 279: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Drosophila Sina and its human orthologue Siah contain a RING finger and are involved in the degradation of Tramtrack (35Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), respectively. Of note, the RING finger of Siah is required to induce DCC proteolysis (37Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Finally, the Mdm2 proto-oncoprotein, which mediates the ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation of p53 (39Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 40Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 41Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), contains a RING finger motif that is required for p53 degradation (39Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 41Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 42Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has not yet been demonstrated, it is tempting to speculate that the RING finger motifs of the above mentioned proteins are directly involved in the interaction with their cognate E2s. The ability of HHARI and H7-AP1 to interact with UbcH7 may indicate that these proteins function as E3s or as part of E3 complexes in UbcH7-dependent ubiquitinylation. UbcH7 has previously been demonstrated to interact functionally with members of the hect E3 family, in vitro (6Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These E3s are characterized by their ability to accept activated ubiquitin from UbcH7 or UbcH5 in the form of a thioester complex. However, such an activity was not observed for HHARI (data not shown). Thus, if HHARI and H7-AP1 have E3 activity, they are likely to function similar to SCF complexes (9Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 10Feldman R.M.R. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), namely as “docking proteins,” by bringing the target protein into juxtaposition for direct ubiquitinylation by UbcH7. Interestingly, RING finger domains are often found in the component proteins of multiprotein complexes (28Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). HHARI contains two RING fingers and one IBR motif, suggesting that it has the potential to interact specifically with several different proteins. Indeed, using metabolically labeled cell extracts, we observed that a number of cellular proteins could specifically bind to HHARI (not shown). Whether these proteins represent potential targets for HHARI/UbcH7-facilitated ubiquitinylation is presently unclear. Alternatively, HHARI and H7-AP1 may serve as substrates for UbcH7-mediated ubiquitinylation. Preliminary results suggest that, at least in vitro, HHARI and H7-AP1 are not ubiquitinylated by UbcH7 (not shown). However, this does not exclude HHARI and H7-AP1 as substrates for UbcH7 because it is possible that in the in vitro system a factor(s) is missing that is required for ubiquitinylation of these proteins. Interestingly, Siah and Mdm2 have been reported not only to promote the degradation of DCC and p53, respectively, but also to mediate their own degradation, at least under certain conditions (37Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. La Baer J. Xu T. Fearon E.R.

Thus, even if ubiquitinylation of HHARI and H7-AP1 is observed in vitro or in vivo, this will not exclude the possibility that HHARI and H7-AP1 are actively involved in the ubiquitinylation of so far unknown cellular proteins. HHARI probably represents the direct human orthologue ofDrosophila ariadne as it displays a remarkably high sequence similarity (72% amino acid identity). This high sequence conservation implies that these proteins play an essential role in fundamental cellular processes. Indeed, mutant alleles that result in truncation or point mutation of the RING finger domain of Drosophilaariadne are recessive lethal at the pupal stage, demonstrating a severe disorganization of the central nervous system (43Aguilera M. Oliveros M. Martinez-Padron M. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. A. Conf. Dros. Res. 1998; 39: 522AGoogle Scholar). These data, together with the results presented in this study, suggest that the phenotype may be attributable to aberrant ubiquitinylation. Finally, it is interesting to note that the HHARI gene maps just telomeric of the UBE3A gene on human chromosome 15q24, a region recently associated with a syndrome characterized by severe mental retardation, spasticity, and tapetoretinal degeneration (44Mitchell S.J.

Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar for review), the majority of TNF-α effects, including the initiation of cell death cascades and host responses against a variety of pathogens, appear to be mediated by TNFR1 (3Espevik T.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The ability of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 to transduce signals is dependent upon the interaction of their cytoplasmic tails with intracellular proteins (see Ref. 9Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar for review). The intracellular domain of TNFR1, in contrast to TNFR2, contains a region called the “death domain,” which binds adapter proteins such as TRADD (TNFR-associated deathdomain protein) (10Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). TRADD binds two additional transducers, TRAF2 (TNFR-associatedfactor-2) and receptor-interacting protein (11Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). These proteins, in turn, induce the kinase cascades ultimately resulting in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 12Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and of the cell death pathway (10Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). MADD (MAP kinase-activating deathdomain protein) is another protein that binds to the death domain of TNFR1. However, by contrast to TRADD, MADD does not cause cell death or NF-κB activation, but specifically stimulates the c-Jun NH2-terminal (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases (13Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Notably, the protein partners with which MADD interacts and the genes activated through the MADD pathway remain to be elucidated. Induction of gene expression is an important consequence of TNFR1 and/or TNFR2 engagement and is essential for many of the biological responses of TNF-α. However, gene regulation secondary to the selective signaling of TNF-α through the individual TNF receptors remains poorly understood. Studies using soluble TNF-α, which stimulates both TNF receptors, have identified E-selectin, interleukin-6, and TNF-α itself as TNF-α-inducible genes (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W.

Lymphokine Res. 1987; 6: 119-125PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling through TNFR1 leads to gene induction via activation of the IκB kinase pathway and NF-κB translocation and by activation of the MAP kinase family, which results in the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of AP-1 family members (reviewed in Ref.17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB activation was shown to be critical in the regulation of the E-selectin and interleukin-6 genes by TNF-α (14Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J.

Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This TNF-α CRE site is critical in the regulation of TNF-α by multiple signal transduction pathways and binds ATF-2 and Jun proteins (19Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 458-467Google Scholar, 20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which become transcriptionally active upon phosphorylation by the p38 and JNK members of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases (17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Here, we show that selective signaling through TNFR1 results in the induction of TNF-α gene transcription. Strikingly, this induction is dependent upon p38 MAP kinase activity and the binding of ATF-2/Jun proteins to the TNF-α CRE. Consistent with these findings, overexpression of MADD results in TNF-α gene induction, thus linking signaling through TNFR1 to MAP kinase activation and TNF-α gene induction. Moreover, this study establishes the TNF-α CRE site as the target of TNFR1 signaling and demonstrates the importance of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway in TNFR1-mediated TNF-α gene transcription. The −200TNF-α/CAT construct and the 3′M and C1M TNF-α/CAT constructs (19Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 458-467Google Scholar, 20Tsai E.Y. Yie J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) have all been previously described. The FLAG-TRADD expression plasmid was constructed by isolating TRADD by polymerase chain reaction from a U937 cDNA library and subcloning it into the pZ-FLAG control vector as described previously (13Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The 15TUΔDD vector was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of residues 1343–1345 of 15TU using oligonucleotides DD-mut25S (5′-CGCCTAATGGGAGCGGCGGCCATTGGGCTTGTG-3′) and DD-mut25A (5′-CACAAGCCCAATGGCCGCCGCTCCCATTAGGCG-3′) and subcloned into pZ-FLAG using the restriction enzymes NotI andEcoRV. Murine L929 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 12 mmHEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin and were transfected using DEAE-dextran as described previously (20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 units/ml recombinant human TNF-α (rhTNF-α) (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) and harvested 16 h later. Cells were treated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 where indicated. The SB203580 compound was synthesized based on a published procedure (21Boehm J.C. Smietana J.M. Sorenson M.E. Garigipati R.S. Gallagher T.F. Sheldrake P.L. Bradbeer J. Badger A.M. Laydon J.T. Lee J.C. Hillegass L.M. Griswold D.E. Breton J.J. Chabot-Fletcher M.C. Adams J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3929-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). L929 cells were incubated for 2 h with or without 100 units/ml rhTNF-α where indicated; nuclear extracts were prepared; and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (22Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Antibody competition assays were performed using an anti-ATF-2 antibody (a gift from Dr. D. Thanos); antibodies to Jun family members (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); or antibodies to p50, p65, and c-Rel (gifts from Dr. N. Rice) as described previously (20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as follows: κ3(L), 5′-GATCCTTCCTCCAGATGAGCTCATGGGTTTCTCCACCAAGGAA- 3′; and PRDII, 5′-GATCCAGTGGGAAATTCCTCA-3′. RNA was prepared from L929 cells stimulated with TNF-α as described above, and an RNase protection assay was performed using murine TNF-α and γ-actin probes as described previously (22Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts and whole cell extracts were prepared from L929 cells after a 15-min stimulation with 1000 units/ml rhTNF-α in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (2.5–20 μm) as indicated, which was added 1 h prior to stimulation with rhTNF-α. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis, and phosphorylated ATF-2 and c-Jun proteins were detected using a phospho-specific antibody kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) as directed by the manufacturer. p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and used to perform a kinase assay using GST-ATF-2 as a substrate. Both the immunoprecipitation and kinase assays were performed using the p38 MAP kinase assay kit from New England Biolabs Inc. Human TNF-α binds to murine TNFR1, but not to murine TNFR2 (23Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennet G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and as a result, treatment of murine cells with rhTNF-α results only in TNFR1-mediated effects. Therefore, to determine whether signaling through TNFR1 alone resulted in the induction of TNF-α gene expression, we stimulated murine L929 fibroblast cells with rhTNF-α and measured TNF-α mRNA levels. As shown in Fig.1 A, L929 cells constitutively expressed a very low level of TNF-α mRNA (lane 1), which was induced after stimulation with rhTNF-α (lane 2). Thus, selective signaling through TNFR1 results in the induction of TNF-α gene expression. To identify the TNF-α promoter sequences required for the transcriptional activation of the TNF-α gene via TNFR1 signaling, we first transfected L929 cells with a TNF-α/CAT reporter gene containing either −1045 or −200 nucleotides upstream of the TNF-α mRNA cap site. Consistent with studies in multiple other cell types and using a variety of inducers (19Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 458-467Google Scholar, 20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), −200 nucleotides upstream of the TNF-α transcription start site are sufficient for maximal inducibility of the gene by TNFR1 engagement in L929 cells (Fig. 1 B). In fact, the −200TNF-α/CAT reporter gene construct was consistently more inducible by rhTNF-α than the −1045TNF-α/CAT construct. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that L929 cells are a physiological system in which to characterize TNF-α autoregulation secondary to TNFR1 signaling and that −200 nucleotides are sufficient for maximal TNFR1-mediated induction of the TNF-α gene. MADD recruitment to TNFR1 results in the activation of JNK and ERK MAP kinase pathways, but does not activate NF-κB (13Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By contrast, TRADD interaction with TNFR1 initiates a pathway resulting in NF-κB activation (10Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). To determine whether the signal transduction pathways initiated by MADD and/or TRADD resulted in the activation of TNF-α gene expression, we cotransfected MADD or TRADD expression vectors with the TNF-α/CAT reporter gene. As shown in Fig.2 A, overexpression of MADD, but not TRADD, increased TNF-α/CAT reporter activity. Thus, MADD-stimulated MAP kinase activity activates TNF-α transcription. A truncated form of MADD containing the death domain, called 15TU, also activates the JNK and ERK pathways (13Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We tested whether the MADD death domain was sufficient for activation of TNF-α by cotransfection of 15TU with the TNF-α reporter. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 15TU activated the TNF-α reporter to levels comparable to MADD. However, a mutant form of 15TU, with a 3-amino acid substitution in the death domain (15TUΔDD), was not capable of inducing the TNF-α/CAT reporter (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, our results establish the TNF-α gene as the first identified gene target of MADD and implicate the involvement of MAP kinase activation in TNFR1 stimulation of TNF-α. We note that overexpression of 15TUΔDD did not abrogate rhTNF-α induction of the TNF-α/CAT reporter gene (data not shown), consistent with the involvement of other TNFR1-stimulated pathways not transduced by MADD. The TNF-α composite CRE/κ3 promoter element, which is critical in the regulation of TNF-α by a variety of stimuli, binds ATF-2/Jun proteins (19Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 458-467Google Scholar, 20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Given the facts that ATF-2/Jun become transcriptionally active upon phosphorylation by JNK and that ATF-2 is also phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase (see Ref. 17Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, for example), we tested whether the CRE was required for TNFR1-mediated TNF-α gene expression. As shown in Fig.3 A, a mutation in the TNF-α CRE, called C1M, inhibited TNFR1-stimulated TNF-α/CAT activity in L929 cells, whereas a mutation in the adjacent κ3-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-binding site, called 3′M, had no effect upon TNF-α gene expression. Similarly, MADD-stimulated TNF-α/CAT reporter activity was also inhibited by mutation of the CRE, but not by mutation of the κ3-NFAT site (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the TNF-α CRE site is required for activation of TNF-α gene expression stimulated by TNFR1 or by MADD. Given the functional importance of the CRE in TNFR1-mediated TNF-α gene transcription, we next investigated which activators bind to the CRE in TNFR1-stimulated L929 cells. We prepared nuclear extracts from L929 cells stimulated with rhTNF-α and performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an oligonucleotide probe containing the composite CRE/κ3 site (κ3(L)). As shown in Fig. 4 A(lanes 1 and 2), the κ3(L) probe bound three constitutive complexes, which were not inducible by rhTNF-α. Using antibodies to ATF-2 and Jun proteins, we showed that ATF-2 proteins were contained in the upper two complexes (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3–5, labeled 1 and 2) and that Jun proteins were contained in the two lower complexes (labeled2 and 3). In contrast to ATF-2 and Jun, antibodies to the NF-κB proteins p50, p65, and c-Rel did not react with the κ3(L)-binding complexes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8–10). As a positive control for TNF-α stimulation of L929 cells and NF-κB binding, we used the high affinity NF-κB-binding site, PRDII (24Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), as a probe. PRDII bound a TNF-α-inducible complex (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 1 and 2), which reacted with antibodies to p50/p65 NF-κB proteins in a supershift assay (lanes 3 and 4). From these experiments, we conclude that ATF-2/Jun proteins bind constitutively to the TNF-α CRE site in L929 cells. Since ATF-2 becomes transcriptionally active upon phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase, we studied the role of p38 MAP kinase activity in TNFR1-stimulated TNF-α gene expression and ATF-2 phosphorylation in L929 cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, TNFR1-mediated induction of the TNF-α/CAT reporter was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by SB203580, a pyridinylimidazole that specifically binds to and inhibits p38 MAP kinase (25Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnel P.C. Galager T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). To correlate the phosphorylation status of ATF-2 with the inhibitory effect of SB203580 upon TNF-α transcription, we performed a Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies to ATF-2. Treatment of L929 cells with rhTNF-α resulted in the phosphorylation of endogenous ATF-2 (Fig. 5 B, upper panel, lane 2), whereas addition of increasing amounts of SB203580 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ATF-2 phosphorylation (lanes 3–7). Notably, several groups have reported inhibition of JNK activity by higher doses of SB203580 (26Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 27Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.-T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe an inhibitory effect of our preparation of the p38 inhibitor on the phosphorylation of c-Jun, even at concentrations of up to 20 μm (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). To demonstrate that TNFR1 engagement resulted in an increase in p38 MAP kinase activity, we prepared whole cell extracts of L929 cells stimulated with rhTNF-α and immunoprecipitated cellular proteins with an anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody. A kinase assay using GST-ATF-2 as a substrate was then performed on the immunoprecipitated samples, and they were analyzed by Western blotting. Using a phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody, we demonstrated that TNFR1 engagement resulted in an increase in p38-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C, comparelanes 1 and 3). We demonstrated the specificity of this effect by pretreating the cells with 10 μmSB203580, which, as expected, inhibited the TNFR1-mediated increase in ATF-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C, compare lanes 3and 4). Taken together, this series of experiments links TNFR1-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase to the p38-dependent phosphorylation of ATF-2 and the induction of TNF-α gene expression. Signaling through TNFR1 leads to at least three distinct effector functions, including MAP kinase activation, NF-κB activation, and the induction of apoptosis (see Ref. 26Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, for example). Here, we have shown that TNFR1 engagement leads to TNF-α gene transcription through the p38-dependent phosphorylation and binding of ATF-2/Jun to the TNF-α CRE promoter element. Thus, the p38 MAP kinase pathway is the critical arm of the TNFR1 signaling pathway involved in the transcriptional autoregulation of TNF-α. Recent work from other laboratories supports a role for p38 MAP kinase in TNF-α-mediated gene activation. For example, disruption of the Mkk3 gene, a specific activator of p38 MAP kinase, causes a selective defect in TNF-α-stimulated p38 MAP kinase activation and blocks TNF-α induction of the interleukin-1 and -6 genes (27Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.-T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier studies showing the importance of the CRE and the binding of ATF-2/Jun in TNF-α gene regulation in activated T cells (19Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 458-467Google Scholar, 20Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), p38 has also recently been shown to be involved in the transcriptional and translational control of TNF-α in T cells (28Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufield B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Signaling through TNFR1 and its subsequent association with TRADD, TRAF2, and NFκβ-inducing kinase result in the activation of NF-κB in a wide spectrum of cell types (3Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Engelmann H. Hotmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 7Wong G.H. Tartaglia L.A. Lee M.S. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3350-3353PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments argue against a role for NF-κB in the autoregulation of TNF-α since overexpression of TRADD, which transduces signals resulting in the activation of NF-κB, did not result in the induction of TNF-α gene expression. Furthermore, we did not detect inducible NF-κB binding activity to the TNF-α CRE/κ3 site, which bears a weak sequence similarity to a consensus NFκβ binding site (22Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Rather, we have shown that ATF-2/Jun bind to the CRE site, which is required for TNFR1-mediated TNF-α gene expression. Our data also suggest a role for MADD in TNFR1-mediated TNF-α gene regulation. MADD signaling has previously been shown to activate the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways (13Schievella A.R. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in MAP kinase activation, we show that MADD activation of TNF-α gene expression is dependent upon an intact CRE site. Given that MADD stimulates the JNK pathway, it is likely that MADD mediates phosphorylation of ATF-2 via JNK activation and thereby induces transcription of the TNF-α gene. We note that we could not observe MADD activation of the p38α and p38β MAP kinase forms, although we did observe inhibition of MADD-stimulated TNF-α gene expression by SB203580 (data not shown). Interestingly, SB203580 does not inhibit JNK1, but can inhibit JNK2β (29Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H. Su M.S.-S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that SB203580 did not inhibit the activation of c-Jun (Fig. 5 B) may reflect the activation of both JNK1 and JNK2β by rhTNF-α, whereas MADD may activate only JNK2β. Taken together with our demonstration that TNFR1-mediated activation of TNF-α requires p38 activation, these data indicate that TNFR1 stimulation of TNF-α gene expression involves both MADD-dependent activation of the JNK pathway and MADD-independent activation of p38 MAP kinase. Mice deficient in TNFR1 or TNF-α itself display an overlapping set of pathologies. For example, mice deficient in TNFR1 or TNF-α demonstrate abnormal organization of splenic B cell follicles (30Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Grell M. Pfizenmaier K. Bluethmann H. Kollias G. Proc.

Thus, TNFR1-stimulated TNF-α gene expression is central to normal immunological processes as well as to host defense. The autoregulation of TNF-α, which begins at the level of the transcriptional induction of the gene, is likely to be crucial in several of these disease processes. The study presented here has demonstrated the required and critical roles of p38 MAP kinase and ATF-2 in TNF-α autoregulation. These molecular targets may thus prove useful in the therapeutic modulation of TNF-α gene expression in cases where too much or too little TNF-α is associated with variable patterns of disease pathogenesis.

This 3.7-kilobase gene encodes the first example of a protease in the tryptase family that contains a membrane-spanning segment located at its COOH terminus. Comparative structural studies indicated that the putative transmembrane tryptase (TMT) possesses a unique substrate-binding cleft. As assessed by RNA blot analyses, mTMT is expressed in mice in both strain- and tissue-dependent manners. Thus, different transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms are used to control the expression of mTMT in vivo. Analysis of the corresponding tryptase locus in the human genome resulted in the isolation and characterization of the hTMT gene. ThehTMT transcript is expressed in numerous tissues and is also translated. Analysis of the tryptase family of genes in mice and humans now indicates that a primordial serine protease gene duplicated early and often during the evolution of mammals to generate a panel of homologous tryptases in each species that differ in their tissue expression, substrate specificities, and physical properties.

All known mouse and human tryptases in this family are initially translated as zymogens. They possess an ∼20-residue hydrophobic signal peptide which is presumed to be removed in the endoplasmic reticulum immediately after the translated zymogen is translocated into the lumen. They also possess an ∼10-residue propeptide preceding the mature portion of the enzyme which consists of ∼245 amino acids.

We now describe a novel mouse gene, and its human ortholog, which encode an unusual transmembrane tryptase (TMT). A λ bacteriophage clone (designated GW-1) was isolated by screening a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) under conditions of high stringency with a radiolabeled probe specific for the mMCP-6gene (2Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3847-3853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 6-kb BamHI-derived fragment liberated from GW-1 was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and its nucleotide sequence determined in both directions with standard dideoxy/cycle sequencing methodologies (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51649) Google Scholar). Analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequence data revealed that this portion of chromosome 17 contained exon 6 of themMCP-6 gene, followed by 2.3 kb of flanking DNA, and then the 3.7-kb mTMT gene. The mMCP-6 andmTMT genes were oriented in the same direction in GW-1. To confirm the position and spacing of the two genes in native chromosomal DNA, a long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was carried out in which each 50-μl sample contained 200 ng of BALB/c or 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA, 10 μmol of an oligonucleotide (5′-ACTCACTGCTTCCTGGTCAG-3′) that corresponds to a region in exon 6 of the mMCP-6 gene, and 10 μmol of an oligonucleotide (5′-ACAGTGTGACCGTAAGCTC-3′) that corresponds to a region in exon 3 of the mTMT gene. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed with recombinant Thermus thermophilius-derived DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer); each cycle consisted of a 30-s denaturing step at 94 °C, a 30-s annealing step at 58 °C, and a 4-min extension step at 72 °C. The amplified PCR products were subcloned into the TA vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. To determine if homologous mTMT genes exist in the mouse genome, ∼20-μg samples of BALB/c mouse genomic DNA were incubated separately at 37 °C for ∼17 h with BamHI,ScaI, HindIII, PstI, BglII,SacI, AvrII, or XbaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The digests were fractionated on 1% agarose gels. The separated fragments were blotted onto MagnaGraph nylon membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA) (33Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21180) Google Scholar), and the resulting DNA blots were incubated for 2 h at 65 °C in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) containing a radiolabeled 224-base pair (bp) probe corresponding to a portion of exon 3 of themTMT gene. This probe was chosen because it corresponds to a region in the mTMT transcript that is not present in themMCP-6 and mMCP-7 transcripts. The DNA blots were washed twice for 15 min each at room temperature in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then twice for 15 min each either at 65 °C or 50 °C in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The blots were then exposed to BIOMAX film for ∼3 days. In some instances, the DNA blots were stripped and reprobed with mMCP-6 (2Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol.

The gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 17 h, the separated RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and the resulting blots were analyzed with gene-specific probes for the mTMT, mMCP-6 (2Reynolds D.S.

The cDNA probes used in these analyses were random primed with [α-32P]dCTP using the rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to the RNA blots at 65 °C for 2 h in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene). The blots were washed twice for 15 min each at room temperature in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then twice for 10 min each at 60 °C in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS before exposure to film. Three different approaches were used to demonstrate that the newly identified mouse gene was transcribed in vitro and in vivo in different mouse strains. A search of the GenBank mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data base revealed that clone AA266560probably corresponded to a portion of the mTMT gene. This EST was derived from mixed organs of a FVB/N mouse. Sequence analysis of the EST, obtained from the “Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression” (I.M.A.G.E.) consortium, revealed that it corresponded to residues 109 to 1112 in the 1.2-kb mTMTtranscript. To obtain the 5′ portion of the mTMT transcript, 5′-Marathon RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed on a CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) preparation of BALB/c mouse liver-derived cDNAs, according to the manufacture's instructions. The first PCR was carried out using the anchor oligonucleotide 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ and the oligonucleotide 5′-ATCCACCACAGAGACTTTGGCCTCCTGAGG-3′ which corresponds to a region in exon 4 of the mTMT gene. The second nested PCR was carried out using the second anchor oligonucleotide 5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′ and the oligonucleotide 5′-CATCCCAGGGTAGAAGTCAGCTGAGGCCTC-3′ which corresponds to a region in exon 3 of the mTMT gene. Amplified products were subcloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and their inserts sequenced. A reverse transcription (RT) PCR approach was then used to confirm that themTMT transcript is expressed in W/Wv mBMMCs. Two sets of oligonucleotides were used in these latter reactions. The first (5′-CAGGCTAGCCTCCGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CATCCCAGGGTAGAAGTCAGC-3′) and second (5′-CTGTGAACTCGTCTGATTATC-3′ and 5′-ACACCTCATTCAGAGTTCCGAGGCCGCGTG-3′) sets of oligonucleotides cover exons 2 to 3 and exons 3 to 5, respectively, in the mTMT gene. The RT step was carried out at 55 °C for 30 min with a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Each of the 30 cycles of the PCR consisted of a 15-s denaturing step at 94 °C, a 30-s annealing step at 58 °C, and a 60-s extension step at 72 °C. A PCR approach was used to determine whether or not there is a human ortholog of themTMT transcript. A number of relatively conserved regions were found when the nucleotide sequence of the mTMTtranscript was compared with those of varied mouse and human MC tryptase transcripts. Thus, an oligonucleotide (5′-TGCTGGGTCACTGGCTGG-3′) that corresponds to a relatively conserved region in all mouse and human MC tryptase transcripts and an oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCAGTTCACGTAGGC-3′) that corresponds to the 3′ end of the mTMT transcript were employed to amplify from a pool of human liver cDNAs (CLONTECH) a 326-bp fragment that corresponds to the middle portion of the hTMTtranscript. Based on the nucleotide sequence of this PCR product, more specific oligonucleotides were used in 5′- and 3′-RACE approaches to obtain a more full-length hTMT transcript. In the case of 5′-RACE, the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGCTCACAATGCCAGCCTGCACCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCATGTCGGGCTGAAGGATGCTGC-3′ were employed in the first and second nested PCRs, respectively, with the relevant anchor oligonucleotides. In the case of 3′-RACE, the oligonucleotide 5′-CGTACAGCCTGCGGGAGGTGAAAGTCTC-3′ was used with the anchor oligonucleotide. Reactions were performed with human liver and uterus Marathon cDNAs (CLONTECH) as templates. Using the primers 5′-AGGTGCACCTGGGGGAACTGGAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-AATGCACTTGGATTCCTGCCATCAGTCAG-3′, PCRs were also performed with human skin (Invitrogen) and cecum cDNA libraries. All amplified PCR products were subcloned into pCR 2.1 and their inserts sequenced. A nested PCR approach was then used to elucidate which human adult, fetal, and tumor tissues contained hTMT mRNA. The oligonucleotides 5′-AGGTGCACCTGGGGGAACTGGAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-AATGCACTTGGATTCCTGCCATCAGTCAG-3′ and then the oligonucleotides 5′-ACCGTGAGGCAGATCATCCTGCACTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTCACAATGCCAGCCTGCACCCAG-3′ were used in this two-step process to generate the relevant 410-bp hTMT cDNA from four different human tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH). The obtained products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotides (CLONTECH) were used as a positive control in these mRNA analyses. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the isolated hTMTtranscript, four sets of oligonucleotides were exploited to amplify its gene in three overlapping fragments from human genomic DNA. The oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGTGTGTCCCTCAGGACTTTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CGCCGCACACGTGCATCCTCCGCAG-3′ and the oligonucleotides 5′-AGGTGCACCTGGGGGAACTGGAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-AATGCACTTGGATTCCTGCCATCAGTCAG-3′ were used to isolate the portions of the hTMT gene that span exon 1 to exon 2 and exon 3 to exon 5, respectively. A nested PCR approach with oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCATGGCCATGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTCACAATGCCAGCCTGCACCCAG-3′, followed by the oligonucleotides 5′-GCAGGCCAGCCTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCATGTCG- GGCTGAAGGATGCTGC-3 were used to isolate the portion of the hTMT gene which spans exon 2 to exon 4. A panel of 24 hamster/human somatic hybrid cell lines (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) was probed to locate theTMT gene in the human genome. Each analyzed hybrid cell line contained a single, but different, human chromosome. Approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA from a cell line was utilized as the template in each 50-μl PCR. Normal human genomic DNA and normal hamster genomic DNA served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides in these PCRs were 5′-CGTACAGCCTGCGGGAGGTGAAAGTCTC-3′ and 5-TAATCTGATGCAGAAGACTCAGC-3′, respectively. The obtained products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and then sequenced. The anti-peptide approach used to obtain mMCP-6- (26Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C.

Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar) specific antibodies in rabbits was employed to obtain hTMT-specific antibodies. The 16-mer peptide Val-Pro-Ala-Tyr-Val-Asn-Trp-Ile-Arg-Arg-His-Ile-Thr-Ala-Ser-Gly, which corresponds to residues 221 to 236 in mature hTMT, is not present in any protein in the GenBank protein data base. The models of the three-dimensional structures 3The three-dimensional models for mTMT and hTMT can be downloaded from the Web athttp://guitar.rockefeller.edu/pub/sali/models.of hTMT and mTMT predicted that this peptide would protrude from the surface of the folded tryptase. Thus, antibodies were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptides by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA); the synthetic peptide was then used to affinity purify the antibodies. Immunohistochemistry was carried out essentially as described for other anti-tryptase antibodies (24Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Freelund R. Austen K.F. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Stevens R.L. J.

For these experiments, histologically normal skin (n = 3) or intestine (n = 2) specimens were snap frozen and placed in Tissue-TekTM O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cryostat sections (5 μm) were cut in a Reichert-Jung cryostat, mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, and air-dried overnight at room temperature. Each section was fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. After the sections were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with a 1:50 dilution of anti-hTMT immunoglobulin (Ig) in phosphate-buffered saline, they were sequentially washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 (3.6 μg/ml) (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark), for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Silinus, Hawthorn, Australia), and for 20 min with alkaline phosphatase substrate (0.2 mg/ml solution of naphthol 3-hydroxy-2-naphthonic acid 2,4-dimethylanilide phosphate (Sigma) containing 0.1 mg/ml Fast Red 4-chloro-2-methylbenzenediazonium (Sigma) in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.2). Human skin biopsies were also processed for immunoelectron microscopy in order to determine where TMT resides inside human cutaneous MCs. Tissue blocks (2 mm3) were immersed for 4 h at room temperature in a 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde, and 0.025% CaCl2. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, the blocks were postfixed for 2 h at room temperature in 2% osmium tetroxide. They were then stained for 2 h at room temperature with 2% of uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity media (ProSciTech, Thuringowa, Australia). Sections (60–80 nm) were cut on an Reichert-Jung ultramicrotome and placed on grids. The grids were placed upon drops of reagents on the parafilm, etched for 15 min in 10% of hydrogen peroxide, and washed with water. Each section was equilibrated with Tris-HCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.2, before the 4-h incubation at 37 °C with primary antibody diluted in this buffer. Antibody-treated sections were washed with the Tris-HCl/albumin buffer and then exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (dilution of 1:50) (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). The resulting sections were counterstained with lead citrate before being examined with a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope. For a negative control, sections were not exposed to the primary antibody. Mapping analysis with varied restriction enzymes revealed that the λ phage clone GW-1 contained two homologous but distinct genes in its ∼13-kb insert (Fig. 1 A). These genes were oriented in the same direction in GW-1 and were separated from one another by only 2.3 kb of flanking DNA. Nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that one of the genes encoded mMCP-6; the other encoded a novel tryptase. A long-range PCR approach (Fig. 1 B), carried out with both BALB/c and 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA, confirmed the closeness of the two genes on chromosome 17. The novel mTMTgene in GW-1 was 3.7"
https://openalex.org/W2084005733,"The major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) ofEscherichia coli requires LolA for its release from the cytoplasmic membrane, and LolB for its localization to the outer membrane. We examined the significance of the LolA-LolB system as to the outer membrane localization of other lipoproteins. All lipoproteins possessing an outer membrane-directed signal at the N-terminal second position were efficiently released from the inner membrane in the presence of LolA. Some lipoproteins were released in the absence of externally added LolA, albeit at a slower rate and to a lesser extent. This LolA-independent release was also strictly dependent on the outer membrane sorting signal. A lipoprotein-LolA complex was formed when the release took place in the presence of LolA, whereas lipoproteins released in the absence of LolA existed as heterogeneous complexes, suggesting that the release and the formation of a complex with LolA are distinct events. The release of LolB, an outer membrane lipoprotein functioning as the receptor for a lipoprotein-LolA complex, occurred with a trace amount of LolA, and therefore was extremely efficient. The LolA-dependent release of lipoproteins was found to be crucial for the specific incorporation of lipoproteins into the outer membrane, whereas lipoproteins released in the absence of LolA were nonspecifically and inefficiently incorporated into the membrane. The outer membrane incorporation of lipoproteins including LolB per se was dependent on LolB in the outer membrane. From these results, we conclude that lipoproteins in E. coli generally utilize the LolA-LolB system for efficient release from the inner membrane and specific localization to the outer membrane.

Wu H.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid modification and processing to yield a mature lipoprotein take place in the inner membrane, and then the localization of the mature lipoprotein to either the inner or outer membrane follows. The amino acid residue next to the lipid-modified Cys at the N terminus of a mature lipoprotein is thought to function as a sorting signal (3Yamaguchi K., Yu, F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An Asp residue at this position has been proposed to make lipoproteins specific to the inner membrane, whereas other residues have been assumed to direct lipoproteins to the outer membrane.We have investigated the mechanism underlying the sorting signal-dependent localization of the major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp)1 ofEscherichia coli and found two factors, LolA (4Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and LolB (5Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), involved in this mechanism. LolA, a periplasmic chaperone, forms a water-soluble complex with Lpp, the stoichiometry being 1:1 (4Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Since Lpp is water-insoluble owing to its N-terminal lipid moiety, the complex formation is critical for crossing of the periplasm. LolB, an outer membrane lipoprotein, is a receptor for the LolA-Lpp complex and mediates the outer membrane incorporation of Lpp via the transient formation of a LolB-Lpp complex (5Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recognition of the sorting signal takes place at the release step since an Lpp derivative possessing an Asp residue at position 2 remains in the inner membrane and does not form a complex with LolA (4Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We recently established an in vitro system and found that the release of Lpp from right-side-out membrane vesicles requires ATP (6Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The in vitro release of Lpp strictly depends on the lipoprotein sorting signal, suggesting the possibility that the sorting signal is recognized by the putative ATPase in the cytoplasmic membrane.The complete genome sequence of E. coli suggests that more than 80 lipoproteins are possibly encoded on its chromosome (7Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the functions of LolA and LolB are characterized mainly with Lpp and its derivatives. It is therefore important to determine whether or not the outer membrane localization of other lipoproteins involves the LolA-LolB system. To address this, release from the cytoplasmic membrane and localization to the outer membrane were examined for eight other lipoproteins.We report here that the LolA-LolB system is the general mechanism by which outer membrane-directed lipoproteins are efficiently released from the cytoplasmic membrane and specifically localized to the outer membrane.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here indicate that the LolA-LolB system functions as a general mechanism by which lipoproteins are sorted, released, targeted, and localized in the outer membrane. Not only the LolA-dependent release but also the LolA-independent release observed with some lipoproteins were absolutely dependent on the outer membrane sorting signal. Lipoproteins released in the presence of LolA existed as a complex with LolA, whereas Pal and NlpB released in the absence of LolA existed as heterogeneous complexes. These results most likely indicate that the release and complex formation with LolA are distinct events. It seems plausible that an ATPase that has been suggested to exist in the cytoplasmic membrane (6Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) catalyzes the release of lipoproteins in a sorting signal-dependent manner irrespective of the presence or absence of LolA in the medium. The released lipoproteins can stably remain in the medium by forming a water-soluble complex with LolA, thereby causing efficient release. The lipoprotein in this complex is then transferred to LolB upon the interaction with LolB in the outer membrane. This causes specific localization of lipoproteins to the outer membrane. On the other hand, lipoproteins remaining in the medium in the absence of LolA exist as heterogeneous complexes or micelles, in which the N-terminal lipid moiety is shielded from the aqueous environment. When such a structure comes into contact with membranes, nonspecific incorporation of lipoproteins into the membranes may take place, causing less efficient release. It is not completely clear why the release in the absence of LolA varied depending on the species of lipoproteins. Since the concentration (300 μg/ml) of LolA in vivo (4Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) is substantially higher than that employed for the release assay, lipoproteins are most likely released in a LolA-dependent manner in vivo.The release and localization of LolB are specifically important since the correct localization of LolB is essential for the correct localization of other lipoproteins. Moreover, rapid exclusion of LolB from the inner membrane is also important to prevent the mislocalization of other outer membrane lipoproteins in the inner membrane. Indeed, the LolB release was extremely efficient even with a trace amount of LolA. However, LolB released into the medium existed as a heterogeneous complex even in the presence of LolA, indicating that not only the LolA-LolB complex but also larger complexes are formed. Such heterogeneous complex formation in the presence of LolA was specific to LolB and most likely resulted from the fact that LolB is a receptor for lipoproteins including LolB itself. Therefore, LolB in the LolA-LolB complex seems to be able to accommodate LolB or other lipoproteins, causing the formation of heterogeneous complexes.The in vitro outer membrane localization of LolB required a higher amount of LolB in the outer membrane than that of other lipoproteins. The LolA-LolB complex must be dissociated for the localization of LolB in the outer membrane. These results therefore seem to suggest that a large amount of LolB is required in the outer membrane for dissociation of the tight LolA-LolB complex. The in vivo concentration of LolB was estimated to be about 300 μg/ml (5Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is more than 1000-fold higher than that used for thein vitro assay (0.12 μg/ml). Therefore, it is likely that LolB localization in vivo takes place in a LolB-dependent manner. It would be interesting to determine whether or not LolB localized in the outer membrane in vitrocan function as a lipoprotein receptor.A Blast search of the data base provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information revealed LolA and LolB homologs in various Gram-negative microorganisms such as Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Neisseria menigitidis, indicating that the LolA-LolB system is evolutionarily conserved in various Gram-negative bacteria. All putative lipoproteins having an outer membrane sorting signal inE. coli are hydrophilic except for their N-terminal highly hydrophobic lipid moiety. While anchored to membranes through their N-terminal lipid, most of the structures of lipoproteins therefore seem to be exposed to an aqueous environment and to be involved in various reactions occurring in the cell envelope. The LolA-LolB system may be a potential target for preventing host invasion by pathogenic bacteria. Lipoproteins in prokaryotes are synthesized with a signal peptide at their N termini and are then translocated across the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane in a Sec machinery-dependent manner (1Hayashi S.

The release and localization of LolB are specifically important since the correct localization of LolB is essential for the correct localization of other lipoproteins. Moreover, rapid exclusion of LolB from the inner membrane is also important to prevent the mislocalization of other outer membrane lipoproteins in the inner membrane. Indeed, the LolB release was extremely efficient even with a trace amount of LolA. However, LolB released into the medium existed as a heterogeneous complex even in the presence of LolA, indicating that not only the LolA-LolB complex but also larger complexes are formed. Such heterogeneous complex formation in the presence of LolA was specific to LolB and most likely resulted from the fact that LolB is a receptor for lipoproteins including LolB itself. Therefore, LolB in the LolA-LolB complex seems to be able to accommodate LolB or other lipoproteins, causing the formation of heterogeneous complexes. The in vitro outer membrane localization of LolB required a higher amount of LolB in the outer membrane than that of other lipoproteins. The LolA-LolB complex must be dissociated for the localization of LolB in the outer membrane. These results therefore seem to suggest that a large amount of LolB is required in the outer membrane for dissociation of the tight LolA-LolB complex. The in vivo concentration of LolB was estimated to be about 300 μg/ml (5Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is more than 1000-fold higher than that used for thein vitro assay (0.12 μg/ml). Therefore, it is likely that LolB localization in vivo takes place in a LolB-dependent manner. It would be interesting to determine whether or not LolB localized in the outer membrane in vitrocan function as a lipoprotein receptor. A Blast search of the data base provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information revealed LolA and LolB homologs in various Gram-negative microorganisms such as Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Neisseria menigitidis, indicating that the LolA-LolB system is evolutionarily conserved in various Gram-negative bacteria. All putative lipoproteins having an outer membrane sorting signal inE. coli are hydrophilic except for their N-terminal highly hydrophobic lipid moiety. While anchored to membranes through their N-terminal lipid, most of the structures of lipoproteins therefore seem to be exposed to an aqueous environment and to be involved in various reactions occurring in the cell envelope. The LolA-LolB system may be a potential target for preventing host invasion by pathogenic bacteria.

The anti-C2 monoclonal antibody ESH8, which recognizes residues 2248–2285 and does not inhibit FVIII binding to von Willebrand factor or phospholipid, inhibited FVIII activation by FXa in a clotting assay. Furthermore, analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that ESH8 inhibited FXa cleavage in the presence or absence of phospholipid. The light chain (LCh) fragments (both 80 and 72 kDa) and the recombinant C2 domain dose-dependently bound to immobilized anhydro-FXa, a catalytically inactive derivative of FXa in which dehydroalanine replaces the active-site serine. The affinity (K d) values for the 80- and 72-kDa LCh fragments and the C2 domain were 55, 51, and 560 nm, respectively. The heavy chain of FVIII did not bind to anhydro-FXa. Similarly, competitive assays using overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to ESH8 epitopes (residues 2248–2285) demonstrated that a peptide designated EP-2 (residues 2253–2270; TSMYVKEFLISSSQDGHQ) inhibited the binding of the C2 domain or the 72-kDa LCh to anhydro-FXa by more than 95 and 84%, respectively.

Quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of FVIII result in the congenital bleeding disorder, hemophilia A. FVIII is noncovalently bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF) in plasma. vWF regulates the synthesis, the cofactor activity, and the transport of FVIII to the site of vascular injury (2Hoyer L.W.

FVIII circulates in the plasma as a heterodimer of a heavy chain (HCh) consisting of the A1, A2, and heterogeneous fragments of partially proteolyzed B domains, together with a light chain (LCh) consisting of A3, C1, and C2 domains (6Toole J.J.

Several findings have indicated that the structure and function of the C2 domain is important for the expression and regulation of FVIII. The C2 domain contains a PL binding site (8Foster P.A.

Furthermore, residues Val2248–Gly2285within the C2 domain contain the epitope for a monoclonal antibody ESH8, which reduces the rate of FVIII/vWF dissociation after thrombin activation of FVIII (14Saenko E.L.

FXa-dependent FVIII activation is different from thrombin-dependent FVIII activation in several ways (21Neuenschwander P. Jesty J. Arch. Biochem.

The procoagulant activity of FVIIIa produced by FXa is 4-fold lower and is more stable than that generated by thrombin (22Parker E.T. Pohl J. Blackburn M.N. Lollar P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of vWF moderates the activation of FVIII by FXa but not by thrombin (23Koedam J.A. Hamer R.J.

The role of FXa-dependent FVIII activation in vivo is still uncertain, however. In the present study, we demonstrated that an anti-C2 monoclonal antibody, containing an epitope within residues Val2248–Gly2285, inhibited FXa cleavage of FVIII in the absence of PL. Furthermore, the C2 domain competed with FVIII for FXa cleavage of the LCh and bound directly to immobilized anhydro-FXa, a catalytically inactive derivative of FXa in which dehydroalanine replaces the active-site serine, indicating that the C2 domain contains a FXa binding site. FVIII was affinity-purified using monoclonal antibody NMC-VIII/10, recognizing the FVIII A3 domain. Elution from the monoclonal antibody column was performed with 1 m KI and 40% ethylene glycol as described previously (25Shima M. Yoshioka A. Nakai H. Tanaka I. Sawamoto Y. Kamisue S. Terada S. Fukui H. Int. J. Hematol. 1991; 54: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified FVIII was 2700 units/mg.

Five μg of purified FVIII was radiolabeled by incubation with 0.5 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using IODO-GEN® (Pierce) for 3 min as described previously (35Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Remaining free Na125I was removed by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific radioactivity of 125I-FVIII was 10 μCi/μg protein. The activity of125I-FVIII determined in a one-stage clotting assay was similar to that of unlabeled FVIII. Aliquots of radiolabeled FVIII were stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month. Anhydro-FXa, a catalytically inactive derivative of FXa in which dehydroalanine replaces the active-site serine, was prepared as described for the preparation of anhydrothrombin (36Ashton R.W. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6454-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In outline, FXa was chemically modified with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To convert the phenylmethylsulfonyl residues of the modified FXa to dehydroalanine residues, the product was diluted with 0.05 m NaOH and incubated for 12 min at 0 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5. After dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1m NaCl, anhydro-FXa was purified by benzamidine-Sepharose 4B column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified anhydro-FXa demonstrated <1% coagulant activity, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 43 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), similar to that of the native FXa (data not shown). Synthetic peptides, each consisting of 13–18 overlapping amino acids and corresponding to the known epitope of monoclonal antibody ESH8 (residues 2248–2285), were synthesized by the method of simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis as described previously (37Houghton R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). They were analyzed and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (purity >95%). FVIII (100 nm) was diluted in veronal buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 7 mm sodium barbital, 0.1m NaCl), containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Bovine Fraction V®, Katayama Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and was incubated together with FXa (2 nm), PL vesicles (10 μm), and CaCl2 (2.5 mm) at 37 °C. At timed intervals, samples (10 μl) were taken from the mixture, and FXa action was immediately quenched by 1000-fold dilution in 1 mm PMSF in veronal buffer at 4 °C. Each sample was tested for FVIIIa coagulant activity using a one-stage clotting assay. To assess the inhibitory effects of monoclonal antibodies on FVIII activation by FXa, each antibody was mixed with FVIII prior to FXa activation and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The anti-FVIII activity of each antibody was adjusted to 2 BU/ml. Control experiments indicated that the presence of FXa and PMSF in the diluted samples did not influence the FVIII activity during the coagulation assay. 125I-FVIII (10 nm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, was mixed together with FXa (20 nm) and CaCl2 (2.5 mm) in the presence or absence of PL vesicles (10 μm). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of PL and for 1 h in the absence of PL. At timed intervals, samples (20 μl) were taken, and FXa action was quenched by adding an equal volume of 0.4% SDS and immediately heating the samples to 100 °C for 5 min. Each sample was analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. To assess the inhibitory effects of antibodies on FVIII cleavage by FXa, an equal volume of each antibody (5 μg) was mixed with 125I-FVIII for 2 h at 37 °C prior to incubation with FXa, as described above. To examine the cleavage of FXa in the presence of vWF,125I-FVIII (10 nm) was incubated with vWF (50 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of FXa in the absence of PL. Microtiter wells (NUNC-Immuno Plate MaxiSorp, NUNC, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of each monoclonal antibody (NMC-VIII/5, ESH8, C5, or JR8) per well in 100 μl of coating buffer (0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6). After washing three times with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20), the wells were then blocked for 2 h at 37 °C by the addition of coating buffer containing 4% BSA. After washing, FVIII (10 nm) in washing buffer containing 4% BSA was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. FXa (20 nm) and CaCl2 (2.5 mm) were then added at 37 °C. At timed intervals, the supernatants were removed, and FXa action was quenched by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. Bound FVIII was detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated NMC-VIII/10, which recognizes the amino-terminal acidic region of LCh, followed by the addition of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate dissolved in 25 mm citric acid, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. After 2 m H2SO4 was added as a quenching solution, the absorbance was read at 492 nm (Labsystem Multiskan Multisoft, Helsinki, Finland). Control experiments indicated that the presence of PMSF did not influence this system. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE confirmed that NMC-VIII/10, which was used to detect bound FVIII, did not itself inhibit FXa cleavage. The rate of FVIII LCh cleavage was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound − nonspecific A492/bound at time zero − nonspecific A492)) × 100(%). The absorbance reading in the absence of FVIII was regarded as nonspecific. In competitive inhibition experiments using FVIII fragments (72-kDa LCh, A1, A2, or recombinant C2 domain), 2 μg of NMC-VIII/10 was coated onto microtiter wells as described above. In this assay, a 100 nm concentration of each FVIII fragment was added simultaneously with FXa prior to FXa action, and peroxidase-conjugated NMC-VIII/5 was used for detection of bound FVIII. Six μg of anhydro-FXa in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), pH 7.4, were immobilized onto each well of a microtiter plate. After blocking with 4% BSA, serially diluted FVIII fragments in TBS, containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 4% BSA, were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Bound LCh or HCh fragment was detected by peroxidase- conjugated NMC-VIII/5 or JR8, respectively. In competitive inhibition experiments using FVIII fragments, serially diluted 125I-FVIII was added to the immobilized anhydro-FXa. Bound 125I-FVIII was measured in a γ-counter. In this assay, serially diluted FVIII fragments were mixed with 125I-FVIII (100 nm) prior to adding to the anhydro-FXa. The percentage inhibition was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound − nonspecific count)/(maximum − nonspecific)) × 100 (%). Radioactive counts in the absence of 125I-FVIII were regarded as nonspecific. The kinetics of FVIII and anhydro-FXa interaction were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Anhydro-FXa was covalently bound to an activated carboxymethyldextran-coated CM5 sensor chip surface by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's recommendations (39O'Shannessy D.J. Bringham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 4457-4468Google Scholar, 40Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Binding (association) of all ligands were monitored in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 4 min. Dissociation was monitored over a 5–10 min range after return to buffer flow. After each analysis, regeneration of the chip surface was achieved by 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.0, for 1 min. The values of association rate constants (k a) and dissociation rate constants (k d) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described previously (39O'Shannessy D.J. Bringham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 4457-4468Google Scholar, 40Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using the evaluation software provided by Biacore AB. The values of equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were calculated ask d/k a. Each overlapping peptide was serially diluted and mixed with 100 nm recombinant C2 domain or 72-kDa LCh fragment prior to addition to the immobilized anhydro-FXa. Bound FVIII was detected using peroxidase-conjugated NMC-VIII/5. Control experiments indicated that none of the synthetic peptides affected binding of FVIII fragments to NMC-VIII/5. The percentage inhibition was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound − nonspecific A492)/(maximum − nonspecific A492)) × 100(%). Absorbance at 492 nm in the absence of FVIII was regarded as nonspecific. Five min after incubation of FVIII with FXa there was an initial 4.5-fold increase in FVIII coagulant activity (Fig.1 A). Peak activity was followed by inactivation, and the base-line level was reached within 45 min of incubation. In order to examine the influence of anti-FVIII monoclonal antibodies, FXa-dependent FVIII activation in the presence of each antibody was performed in the presence of PL. Monoclonal antibody ESH8 recognizing the FVIII C2 domain strongly prevented the activation at a concentration of 2 BU/ml (Fig.1 A), and the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the alternative anti-C2 monoclonal antibody, NMC-VIII/5, tended to enhance FVIII activation by FXa when compared with the pattern in the absence of antibody. None of the other monoclonal antibodies, anti-A1 antibody (C5), anti-A2 antibody (JR8), and anti-A3 antibody (NMC-VIII/10), inhibited FXa-dependent activation of FVIII at concentrations of 2 BU/ml (Fig. 1 A) or 5 BU/ml (not shown). We postulated that the inhibitory effect of the anti-C2 monoclonal antibody ESH8 on FVIII activation by FXa might be caused by either a change in the cleaved FVIIIa molecule that alters its coagulant activity or by a direct inhibition of the proteolytic cleavage of FVIII by FXa. To distinguish between these possibilities, we incubated125I-labeled FVIII together with FXa for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of FVIII antibodies and then examined the cleavage pattern by SDS-PAGE. FVIII cleavage by FXa in the absence of antibodies resulted in the conversion of the 90–210 kDa fragments of the HCh into 54- and 44-kDa fragments and proteolysis of the 80-kDa fragment of the LCh into 72- and 67-kDa fragments (Fig.2 A, lane 2). In this instance, however, the 54-kDa fragment was observed only very weakly, and 47- and 40-kDa faint fragments as well as strong bands at dye front were also visible in the lower part oflane 2, suggesting that the 54-kDa fragment had been extensively proteolyzed by FXa. ESH8 completely blocked the cleavage of the 80-kDa LCh fragment and reduced the formation of the 54- and 44-kDa fragments (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). These results suggested that ESH8 completely prevented proteolytic cleavage at Arg1689 and Arg1721 in the LCh and partially inhibited Arg372 in the HCh. In contrast, NMC-VIII/5 did not block the cleavage of the 80-kDa LCh fragment; rather, it tended to promote proteolysis, since the 72-kDa LCh fragment was more strongly evident than in other reactions (Fig.2 A, lane 4). Moreover, the 54-kDa fragment was markedly stronger and the 90-kDa fragment was not observed in the presence of NMC-VIII/5. These findings suggested that the antibody enhanced FXa-induced proteolysis of the HCh as well as the LCh, although selective inhibition of cleavage at Arg336 by NMC-VIII/5 could not be excluded. NMC-VIII/10, C5, and JR8 did not interfere with FXa cleavage of FVIII (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5–7, respectively). The C2 domain contains a PL binding site, and several anti-C2 antibodies are known to inhibit FVIII binding to PL (9Scandella D. Gilbert G.E. Shima M. Nakai H. Eagleson C. Felch M. Prescott R. Rajalakshmi K.J. Hoyer L.W. Saenko E. Blood. 1995; 86: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, since FVIII cleavage by FXa occurs at a faster rate in the presence of PL than in its absence, inhibition of FVIII binding to PL results in indirect inhibition of FVIII cleavage by FXa. Therefore, we further examined the effects of monoclonal antibodies in the absence of PL. ESH8 again completely blocked the cleavage of the 80-kDa LCh fragment and delayed the formation of the 54- and 44-kDa fragments from the 90-kDa HCh fragment (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). This finding indicated that the inhibitory effect of ESH8 was not due to the presence of PL. Also, the cleavages by FXa in the presence of NMC-VIII/5 in the non-PL system were similar to those obtained in the presence of PL and tended to be more marked in the presence of the antibody than in its absence (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Moreover, NMC-VIII/10, C5, and JR8 did not inhibit FVIII cleavage in the absence of PL (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–7, respectively). All of these findings indicated that the inhibitory effect of"

In turn, this kinase is believed to play a critical role in signaling to intracellular kinase cascades controlling gene expression such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), by a yet poorly defined mechanism. Furthermore, whether this tyrosine kinase also mediates the activation of other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), is still unclear. We show here that the activation of FAK by anchoring to the cell membrane is itself sufficient to stimulate potently both ERK and JNK. These effects were found to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent, as FAK effectively stimulated Akt, and wortmannin suppressed Akt but not ERK or JNK activation. As previously reported by others, activation of ERK correlated with the ability of FAK to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Surprisingly, however, stimulation of JNK was not dependent on the kinase activity of FAK or on the ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK substrates. Instead, we provide evidence that FAK may stimulate JNK through a novel pathway involving the recruitment of paxillin to the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of a biochemical route dependent on small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family.

Stimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors causes the rapid elevation of the enzymatic activity of a family of closely related proline-directed serine-threonine protein kinases, known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are:MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseSAPKstress-activated protein kinaseGPCRG protein-coupled receptorFAKfocal adhesion kinaseILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininBSAbovine serum albuminPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent protein (1Cano E. Mahdevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The function of MAPKs is to convert extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals, which, in turn, control the expression of genes that are essential for many cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). At present, 10 mammalian MAPKs have been identified, which can be broadly divided into three families: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminalkinases (JNKs), also termedstress-activated proteinkinases (SAPK), and p38 (also known as CSBP, RK, and SAPK2a) (3Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). ERKs phosphorylate and regulate the activity of certain enzymes, including phospholipase A2, and nuclear proteins, such as the ternary complex factor p62TCF or Elk-1 (4Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter represents a critical event in controlling the expression of several genes, including c-fos (5Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). In the case of JNKs, they have being shown to phosphorylate the transactivating domain of c-Jun and ATF2 (6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), thereby increasing their transcriptional activity. mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase stress-activated protein kinase G protein-coupled receptor focal adhesion kinase interleukin phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin bovine serum albumin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase green fluorescent protein A prototypical model of the pathway linking cell surface receptors to MAPKs of the ERK family has been proposed from studies on the tyrosine kinase class of growth factor receptors (7Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For example, binding of epidermal growth factor to its cognate tyrosine-kinase receptor leads to the rapid phosphorylation of the receptor itself on tyrosine residues, which provides binding sites for the adaptor molecules Shc and Grb2, thus resulting in the recruitment to the plasma membrane of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Sos and the activation of Ras (reviewed in Ref. 7Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). GTP-bound forms of Ras then recruit and activate the serine-threonine kinase Raf, leading to the activation of a kinase cascade composed of Raf, MEKs, and ERKs (1Cano E. Mahdevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases have been also shown to play an important role in signaling from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and integrins to ERKs. For GPCRs, they include tyrosine kinases of the Src family (8Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), as well as the engagement of tyrosine kinases of the receptor class (13Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Similarly, focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-Src complexes also play an important role in mediating the signal from integrins to ERKs through the recruitment of Grb2 and Shc (14Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), in addition to the proposed association of certain integrins with Shc (15Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of activation of JNKs is still poorly understood. JNKs were shown to be activated by a variety of stimuli distinct from those that elevate the enzymatic activity of ERKs, including protein synthesis inhibitors, heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation (6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 16Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). JNKs can be also activated by agents acting on cell surface receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, or epidermal growth factor (16Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that JNK activity can be elevated upon stimulation of GPCRs (17Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). In these cases, the involvement of tyrosine kinases in the signaling pathway from GPCR and integrins to JNK is less clear. One group has provided evidence that Pyk2 (also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, and CADTK) (12Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 20Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 294-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a new member of the FAK family of tyrosine kinases with restricted tissue distribution, may play a role relaying signals from GPCR to JNK. Conversely, it has been established that FAK is activated by cell binding to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (21Guan J.L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and by several agonists acting on GPCRs (22Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Choudhury G.G. Marra F. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F295-F300PubMed Google Scholar, 24Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it can be hypothesized that FAK may participate in a biochemical route linking cell surface receptors to MAPK cascades. Here, we explored the ability of FAK to stimulate signaling events leading to the activation of ERK and JNK, using the expression of an activated form of FAK as an experimental approach. Interestingly, expression of an activated FAK upon targeting this molecule to the cell membrane was sufficient to stimulate potently ERK and JNK activity. The activation of ERK correlated with the ability of FAK to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. In contrast, however, stimulation of JNK was not dependent on the kinase activity of FAK, or on the ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK substrates or to activate PI3K. Instead, we show that recruitment of paxillin to the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a biochemical route depending on small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, thereby providing a likely mechanism by which FAK can stimulate JNK. Lysophosphatidic acid and anisomycin were obtained from Sigma. Human plasma fibronectin and poly-d-lysine were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissue culture plates were treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 μg/ml poly-d-lysine for 15 min before seeding the cells, to prevent them from detaching from the plates when in serum-free conditions. For the stimulation by fibronectin, cells were seeded on the plates coated with human plasma fibronectin (10 μg/ml in PBS). Cells were serum starved for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES before lysis for kinase assays or analyses of tyrosine phosphorylation. Cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method adjusting total amount of DNA to 5–10 μg/plate with the appropriate vector control. Plasmids expressing epitope-tagged ERK, JNK, and Shc (pcDNA3 HA-ERK2, pcDNA3 HA-JNK1, and pcDNA3 HA-Shc, respectively) and the dominant negative mutants of the small GTP-binding proteins RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been described (26Crespo P.

For expression of wild type and membrane-targeted forms of FAK, the cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pCEFL myr (a modified pcDNA3 expression plasmid encoding the NH2-terminal 21 amino acids of chicken c-Src; (27Coso O.A.

Point mutants of FAK were obtained by replacing a lysine in position 454 by arginine (designated FAK KR) and tyrosine in position 925 by phenylalanine (designated FAK YF), using polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis. The mutated cDNAs were subcloned into pCEFL myr between BamHI and NotI sites (pCEFL myr-FAK KR and pCEFL myr-FAK YF, respectively). The expression vector for extracellular and transmembrane domains of interleukin-2 receptor α (pCMV IL2R) have been described (29LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For expression of membrane-targeted form of paxillin, cDNA of human paxillin (a generous gift from Ken Nagata and Kazue Matsumoto) was subcloned in frame into pCMV IL2R, between HindIII and XbaI sites (pCMV IL2R-paxillin). The expression vector for wild type paxillin, pcDNA3 paxillin, was constructed by subcloning the corresponding cDNA between HindIII and XbaI sites. pCEFL HA-paxillin was obtained by subcloning the coding region for paxillin between BglII and EcoRI sites in frame with the sequence for HA. The cDNA for p130cas was kindly provided by Hisamaru Hirai. pCEFL HA-p130cas and pCEFL myr-p130cas were obtained by subcloning betweenBglII, or BamHI and EcoRI sites in frame with the sequence for HA or myr, respectively. The epitope-tagged Akt (pCEFL HA-Akt) has been recently described (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

ERK kinase activity in cells transfected with an epitope-tagged ERK2 (HA-ERK) was determined as described previously, using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as a substrate (26Crespo P. Xu N.

Akt/PKB activity in 293T cells transfected with an expression vector for an epitope-tagged Akt (pCEFL HA-Akt) was determined as described (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S.

Samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels for ERK and JNK, and 15% acrylamide gel for Akt assay. Autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. Radioactivity of phosphorylated substrates were quantified with the use of PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Parallel lysates (50 μg of protein) of cells transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids were processed for Western blot analysis with anti-HA (BAbCO) to confirm the expression levels. Cells were washed twice with PBS, collected by scraping in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized by passing 20 times through a 22-gauge needle. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants and pellets, cytosolic and crude membrane fractions, respectively, were suspended in lysis buffer at a final concentration of 1 mg of total cellular protein/ml. Cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 2 mmNa3VO4), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For co-immunoprecipitation, the same lysis buffer without sodium deoxycholate and SDS was used. Lysates containing approximately 50 μg of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates with the indicated antibodies were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Cappel). Membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. Prior to reprobing with different primary antibody, stripped membranes were washed extensively in TN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 100 mm NaCl) and placed in blocking buffer (TN containing 4% bovine serum albumin). Antibodies against FAK (C20) and Src (N16) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-paxillin and p130cas antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Transfected 293T cells were harvested with 5 mm EDTA, washed in PBS and PBS containing 3% BSA, respectively, prior to incubation with 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD25 (Serotec), at 10 μg/ml, for 60 min on ice. After washes in PBS containing 1% BSA and PBS, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (1 μg/ml). Fluorescence of the cells was analyzed on a Becton FACScan, using the Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with pcDNAIII-βgal, a plasmid expressing the enzyme β-galactosidase. After 2 days in culture, cells were detached by pipetting, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% BSA, and resuspended in the same medium. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated dishes or lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) to determine the total β-galactosidase activity in the cellular sample. Plated cells were allowed to attach at 37 °C and, at different times, washed twice with PBS, lysed, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Cell attachment was assessed by the β-galactosidase activity in the cells attached relative to the β-galactosidase activity present in each total cellular sample. Under these conditions, all control cells attach in 30 min, and approximately 50% of the cells attach in 15 min (data not shown). Thus, we chose a 15-min time point for examining the effect of the expressed molecules in the ability of 293T to attach to fibronectin-coated plates. 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates coated with fibronectin, and transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with pCEFL-GFP, a plasmid expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP). After 2 days, cells were visualized using a phase contrast microscopy, and transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP using fluorescent microscope. Engagement of integrins and stimulation of GPCRs lead to the activation of FAK and of many intracellular signaling pathways, including those controlling the activity of members of the MAPK superfamily of serine-threonine kinases (19Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 31Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports suggest that FAK can participate in biochemical routes resulting in increased ERK activity (32Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As an experimental approach to investigate whether FAK can alone enhance the activity of MAPKs, we overexpressed in 293T cells a wild type and a membrane-targeted form FAK (myr-FAK). The latter was constructed by fusing the amino-terminal myristoylation signal from c-Src with FAK (27Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), a modification that has been shown to render FAK constitutively active (33Chan P.-Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.1 A, similar levels of the two proteins were observed in 293T cells after transfection, as judged by Western blot analysis with an antibody to FAK. Endogenous FAK was detected after prolonged exposure (data not shown) or after immunoprecipitation with a FAK-specific antibody (Fig. 1 A,right panel). However, the mobility of myr-FAK in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was slower, most likely due to the addition of the amino-terminal myristoylation signal from c-Src, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with an anti-Src antibody. As expected, subcellular fractionation revealed that myr-FAK accumulates in the membrane-containing cellular compartment (Fig. 1 B), in contrast to FAK, which is exclusively cytosolic. Interestingly, the myristoylated form of FAK was found to be heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 A, right panel), further supporting that the membrane-targeted form of FAK is constitutively active (33Chan P.-Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next asked whether the membrane-anchored form of FAK could activate biochemical routes enhancing the activity of an epitope-tagged form of ERK2 (HA-ERK) and JNK1 (HA-JNK) when transiently expressed in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2, overexpression of FAK had only a limited effect on ERK and JNK activity, respectively, but in contrast, expression of myr-FAK potently stimulated the phosphorylating activity of the HA-ERK and HA-JNK. These results indicate that the recruitment of FAK to the plasma membrane is sufficient to evoke downstream signaling event(s), including those leading to ERK and JNK activation. These findings prompted us to explore further the nature of the signaling pathway connecting FAK to ERK and JNK. Recent data have shown a role for PI3K in signaling ERK and JNK activation in a number of cellular systems (28Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 34Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GPCR activation and cell attachment to extracellular matrix enhances PI3K activity, resulting in Akt activation (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 35Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, as PI3K is reported to bind FAK (37Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that activation of FAK by integrins and GPCRs may up-regulate PI3K activity, which in turn might mediate the activation of ERK and JNK. To address this possibility, we asked whether the constitutively active form of FAK could stimulate Akt activity, whose enzymatic activity is enhanced in response to PI3K activation (38Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.3, expression of myr-FAK potently stimulated the histone kinase activity of a co-expressed epitope-tagged Akt (HA-Akt), and this activation was abolished by pretreatment of cells with increasing concentrations (25–100 nm) of a PI3K blocker, wortmannin (39Arcaro A. Wymann M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, treatment with wortmannin demonstrated no effect on the ability of myr-FAK to stimulate ERK and JNK (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data suggest that FAK can directly signal Akt activation, likely through PI3K. However, PI3Ks appear not to be involved in the biochemical route(s) linking FAK to ERK and JNK in this cellular system. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc is proposed to be a downstream event of FAK, leading to ERK activation (32Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In addition, two cellular proteins, paxillin and p130cas, are direct substrates of FAK, although the functional consequences of paxillin and p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation are still not fully understood (40Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, we next explored whether these molecules participate in JNK and ERK activation by FAK. We initially engineered epitope-tagged forms of Shc, paxillin, and p130cas (HA-Shc, HA-paxillin, and HA-p130cas, respectively) and confirmed their expression in total lysates and anti-HA immunoprecipitates from transfected 293T cells (Fig.4 A and data not shown). We next examined the status of tyrosine phosphorylation of these molecules when co-transfected with a plasmid control, or together with wild type or myr-FAK. As seen in Fig. 4 B, overexpression of wild type FAK was sufficient to cause the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated species of paxillin and p130cas, which became more prominent when each molecule was co-expressed with myr-FAK. By contrast, Shc was only poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with wild type FAK, but myr-FAK induced a dramatic increase in the level of Shc phosphorylation detectable by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the ability to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, but not of paxillin and p130cas, appears to correlate with ERK and JNK activation. To analyze further whether the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK contributes to its ability to induce the activation of these MAPKs, we generated a kinase-deficient mutant of myr-FAK, by replacing a critical lysine residue in position 454 for arginine (designated myr-FAK KR). In addition, considering the possibility that the binding of Grb2 to FAK may participate in FAK-induced activation of MAPKs, we generated an additional mutant of myr-FAK, replacing tyrosine 925, the Grb2 binding site (42Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), by phenylalanine (designated myr-FAK YF). The former is expected to encode a kinase-inactive form of FAK, and the latter would be expected to have lost the ability to bind Grb2 (42Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). When transfected into 293T cells, all myr-FAK mutants were expressed at similar levels, as judged by Western blot analysis with anti-Src"
https://openalex.org/W2039092258,"Postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/synapse-associated protein (SAP) 90 and synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) are synaptic membrane-associated guanylate kinases. Both the proteins interact with SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein (SAPAP) (also called guanylate kinase-associated protein/Dlg-associated protein). SAPAP is a protein highly enriched in the PSD fraction and may link PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM to Triton X-100-insoluble structures. We found here a novel SAPAP-interacting protein, which was specifically expressed in neural tissue and was present in the postsynaptic density fraction in brain. This protein had a sorbin homology domain in the N terminus, a zinc finger motif in the middle region, and three src homology (SH) 3 domains in the C terminus and was homologous to the ponsin/ArgBP2/vinexin family proteins. We named this protein nArgBP2 because it was the most homologous to ArgBP2. nArgBP2 is a neural member of a growing family of SH3-containing proteins. nArgBP2 bound to the proline-rich region of SAPAP via its third SH3 domain and was coimmunoprecipitated with SAPAP from the extract of rat brain. Furthermore, nArgBP2 was colocalized with SAPAP at synapses in cerebellum. nArgBP2 bound to not only SAPAP but also vinculin and l-afadin, known to bind to ponsin and vinexin. nArgBP2 may be implicated in the protein network around SAPAP in the PSD.

SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein (SAPAP) (also called guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP)/Dlg-associated protein (DAP)) was initially identified as a protein interacting with the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (3Kim E.

Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Later, we have found that SAPAP also interacts with the GK domain of synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) (6Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Südhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). S-SCAM has a molecular structure similar to that of PSD-95/SAP90 and is composed of six PDZ, two WW, and one GK domains. Both PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM interact with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, neuroligin, and membrane-associated guanylate kinase-interacting protein (MAGUIN)-1 and may be implicated in the assembly of synaptic components (6Hirao K.

SAPAP has at least four isoforms (SAPAP1–4), and these isoforms are about 50% homologous to each other. SAPAP has five repeats of 14 amino acids in the middle region, and the interaction with PSD-95/SAP90 is mediated by these repeats (3Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y-P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). SAPAP has a proline-rich region immediately after the 14 amino acid repeats. The sequence of this region is consistent with the consensus motif for the binding of the SH3 domain but does not bind to that of PSD-95/SAP90 (4Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M.

We have recently found an SH3- and PDZ-containing protein interacting with this region and have named it synamon (9Yao I. Hata Y. Hirao K. Deguchi M. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27463-27466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sequence of SAPAP predicts a hydrophilic protein, but SAPAP is highly resistant to Triton X-100 extraction in the PSD fraction as well as in transfected cells (10Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the detergent-insolubility is conferred by the N-terminal region. PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM are Triton X-100-soluble, when expressed in transfected cells, but become Triton X-100-insoluble, when coexpressed with SAPAP (10Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A brain-enriched guanylate kinase-interacting protein (BEGAIN) is a protein interacting with the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 and is Triton X-100-soluble (10Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). BEGAIN is recruited to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, when coexpressed with both of SAPAP and PSD-95/SAP90. Whether the Triton X-100-insolubility of SAPAP reflects the association of SAPAP with the cytoskeleton, the detergent-resistant membrane, or other structures, has not been clarified. To further identify SAPAP-interacting molecules, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using SAPAP3 as a bait. We have obtained a novel brain-specific protein. This protein has three SH3 domains in the C-terminal region. For the last 2 years, several proteins with three SH3 domains in the C-terminal region have been identified. They are ArgBP2 (11Wang B. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), vinexin (12Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and ponsin/c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) (13Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A.

ArgBP2, having two splicing variants, ArgBP2A and -B, is a protein interacting with tyrosine kinases, Arg and c-Abl, and shows the highest homology to the protein which we have identified here (11Wang B. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have named this protein nArgBP2 which stands for neural ArgBP2. Vinexin, having two splicing variants, vinexin α and -β, has been identified as a vinculin-binding protein (12Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Vinculin is an actin-binding protein which is associated with a Ca2+-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecule, cadherins, through catenins and with a cell-matrix adhesion molecule, integrins, through talin, another actin-binding protein (for a review, see Ref.16). Ponsin, having at least 13 splicing variants, ponsin-1 to -12, has been discovered as a protein interacting with l-afadin and vinculin (13Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). l-Afadin is an actin-binding protein which is associated with a Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecule, nectin (17Takahishi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). CAP had been reported as SH3P12 and has been renamed after its interaction with c-Cbl proto-oncogene (14Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ponsin is the same as CAP, and in this paper, we use ponsin to describe this protein just for simplicity. Thus, nArgBP2 is a new member of a growing family of proteins with three SH3 domains interacting with cytoskeletons and signaling molecules. Various expression constructs were prepared by conventional molecular biology techniques and PCR method using pBTM116, pCMV Myc, pClneo Myc, pCMV HA, pGex4T-1, and pGex5X-3. pBTM116 SAPAP1-7, -2-1, -3-1, and -4-1 contain the full-length coding region of SAPAP1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively. The following constructs contain the following amino acids of SAPAP1: pCMV Myc SAPAP1–1, 1–992; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–2, 1–477; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–3, 1–556; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–6, 478–992; pCMV Myc SAPAP1–8, 568–992; and pMal SAPAP1–3, 551–992. pCMV HA SAPAP4 contains the full-length coding region of SAPAP4. The following constructs contain the following amino acids of nArgBP2: pGex4T-1 nArgBP2–1, 1–342; pGex5X-3 nArgBP2–11, 957–1124; pGex5X-3 nArgBP2–12, 1032–1196; and pGex5X-3 nArgBP2–13, 1123–1196. pCMV Myc l-afadin and pCMV Myc vinculin-C2 were described previously (13Mandai K.

Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a rat brain cDNA library as described previously (4Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length cDNA of nArgBP2, a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled insert from the pPrey clone as a probe. A mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against the product of pGex 4T-1 nArgBP2–1. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the products of pGex 5X-3 nArgBP2–11 and pMal SAPAP1–3. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin under 5% CO2 at 37 °C and then transfected with various Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1 or pCMV HA SAPAP4 using the DEAE-dextran method. COS cells of three 10-cm dishes were homogenized in 0.1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 6m urea, 10 μmα-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 2 liters of Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 10 μm APMSF overnight and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 15 min. 1.5 nmol of one of various glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of nArgBP2 or GST was applied to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with Buffer C (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm APMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) to prepare GST-fusion protein columns. 0.1 ml of the supernatant was applied to each GST-fusion protein column and washed with Buffer D (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm APMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The proteins attached to the columns were detected with the anti-Myc tag antibody. The synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction was prepared from adult rat brains as described previously (4Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The SPM fraction (5 mg of protein) was homogenized in 16 ml of Buffer A. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 2 liters of Buffer B containing 10 μm APMSF overnight and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Either 2 μl of the mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, 2 μl of the mouse monoclonal anti-nArgBP2 antibody, 23 μl of the rabbit polyclonal anti-SAPAP antibody, or 23 μl of the rabbit preimmune serum was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with Buffer C. 1 ml of the supernatant was incubated with each antibody fixed on the beads. After the beads were washed with Buffer D, the proteins attached to the beads were detected by immunoblottings. Immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections of mouse brain was done as described (13Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were frozen using liquid nitrogen, and the frozen sections were cut in a cryostat. The samples were mounted on glass slides, air dried, and fixed with 95% (v/v) ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min and with acetone at room temperature for 1 min. The samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, incubated with either the rabbit polyclonal anti-nArgBP2 or the anti-SAPAP antibody at 1:500 dilution, washed again with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.01% (w/v) saponin, and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, embedded, and viewed with a confocal imaging system, MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The subcellular fractionation of rat brain, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein determination were performed as described (4Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using pBTM116 SAPAP3–1 as a bait from a rat brain cDNA library. 11 independent positive clones were obtained from 2 × 106 transformants. Among them, four clones were novel and we focused on one clone, pPrey 4015, containing SH3 domains. To obtain a full-length clone of pPrey 4015, we screened a rat brain cDNA library by plaque hybridization using an insert of pPrey 4015 as a probe. No single clone contained a full-length coding region, but two overlapping clones contained a putative initiation methionine and a putative stop codon. The sequences around the putative initiation and stop codons were confirmed by sequencing more than one clone. We also performed PCR using rat brain cDNAs to obtain a product containing a full-length coding region. The full-length clone of p4015 encoded a protein composed of 1,196 amino acids (Fig.1 A). Analysis of the sequence of nArgBP2 revealed several structural characters. The N-terminal region containing the amino acids 190–325 showed similarity to a peptide hormone called sorbin (Fig. 1 A, shaded). nArgBP2 had one zinc finger motif in the middle region (Fig. 1 A,solid underline) and three SH3 domains in the C-terminal region (Fig. 1 A, boxed). The data base search revealed several mammalian proteins which had three SH3 domains in the C-terminal region. ArgBP2, vinexin, and ponsin belong to this family of proteins (11Wang B. Golemis E.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ArgBP2, vinexin, and ponsin have a sorbin homology domain in the N terminus and three SH3 domains in the C terminus, which are highly conserved, but they do not have a zinc finger motif (Fig. 1 B). nArgBP2 is the most homologous to ArgBP2 but has two additional regions which are not found in ArgBP2A. There are an additional 68 amino acids (amino acid 1–68) at the N-terminal region of nArgBP2 and an insert of 606 amino acids (amino acid 322–927) at the middle region containing a zinc finger motif, in comparison with the amino acid sequence of ArgBP2A. Except for these regions, nArgBP2 is about 90% identical to ArgBP2A, 50% to ponsin-1, and 40% to vinexin α. Considering that nArgBP2 cDNA is cloned from a rat brain cDNA library, and the ArgBP2A cDNA from the human heart library (11Wang B. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), nArgBP2 could be a neural splice variant of the rat counterpart of ArgBP2A. nArgBP2 and SAPAP were coimmunoprecipitated from the rat SPM fraction, suggesting that these proteins interact with each other in vivo (Fig.2 A). nArgBP2 was obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening with SAPAP3 as a bait, but the interactions of SAPAP1, -2, and -4 with nArgBP2 were confirmed in the β-galactosidase assays in yeast (data not shown). Because the original pPrey clone contained only the C-terminal region (Fig. 1,dashed underline), the SH3 domains were expected to be sufficient for the interaction of nArgBP2 with SAPAP. To confirm this assumption, the interactions of HA-tagged SAPAP4 with various GST-fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of nArgBP2 were tested. The GST-fusion protein with the second and third SH3 domains interacted with SAPAP4, whereas the GST-fusion protein with the first and second SH3 domains did not (Fig. 2 B). The GST-fusion protein containing the third SH3 domain alone also bound SAPAP4. The SAPAP-binding activity of the third SH3 domain alone was less than that of the second and third SH3 domains. The reason for this difference is not clear, but the second SH3 domain and the region between the second and third SH3 domains may be also involved in the interaction. Next, to map the nArgBP2-interacting region of SAPAP, various Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1 were prepared (Fig.3 A), and the interactions with the GST-fusion proteins containing the second and third SH3 domains of nArgBP2 were tested. Among the five constructs tested, pClneo Myc SAPAP1–1 and SAPAP1–6, both of which contained the proline-rich region after the five 14-amino acid repeats, bound to nArgBP2 (Fig.3 B). These results indicate that nArgBP2 interacts with the proline-rich region in the middle region of SAPAP1.Figure 3nArgBP2-interacting domain of SAPAP1. A, schematic description of various Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1. The region containing the five repeats of 14 amino acids (amino acid 482 to 556) is shown as an open box. The proline-rich regions are shown as black boxes.

Northern blot analysis was performed using the probe corresponding to the amino acid residues 453–958 of nArgBP2. A 7.4-kilobase transcript was detected only in brain, and no message was detected in heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscles, or kidney (Fig.4 A). Western blot analysis using this antibody recognized a protein with a molecular mass of 160 kDa only in brain (Fig. 4 B). In rat brain subcellular fractions, nArgBP2 was detected in the synaptosomal cytosol but was the most enriched in the PSD fraction (Fig.5 A). SAPAP was also the most enriched in the PSD fraction but was not detected in the synaptosomal cytosol fraction (Fig. 5 B). In rat cerebellum, nArgBP2 was detected in the soma and the dendrites of Purkinje cells and in the glomerulus of the granular layer (Fig.6 A). The pattern of nArgBP2 immunoreactivity was punctate, and the distribution of SAPAP in the same region was similar to that of nArgBP2 (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that nArgBP2 is a neural protein localized at cell bodies, neurites, and synapses.Figure 5Subcellular localization of nArgBP2 in rat brain.

Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether nArgBP2 also interacted with l-afadin and vinculin. Myc-tagged l-afadin or vinculin was expressed in COS cells, and the extracts of COS cells were incubated with the GST-fusion constructs of nArgBP2. The GST-fusion protein containing the second and third SH3 domains of nArgBP2 bound l-afadin and vinculin (Fig.7, A and B). In this paper, we have identified a novel neural protein, nArgBP2, which interacts with SAPAP. The data base search using BLASTp has revealed that 11 mammalian proteins in GenBankTM have three SH3 domains in the C-terminal region. These 11 proteins include 4 independent proteins, namely ArgBP2, vinexin, ponsin/CAP, and a protein named SH3-containing adaptor protein (11Wang B. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The multiple alignment using CLUSTRAW shows that nArgBP2 and ArgBP2 form a subfamily different from that of vinexin and ponsin (Fig. 8). The experiments using the GST-fusion proteins of the SH3 domains of nArgBP2 and Myc-tagged constructs of SAPAP1 suggest that the interaction between nArgBP2 and SAPAP is mediated via the third SH3 domain of nArgBP2 and the proline-rich region of SAPAP, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the regions of nArgBP2 besides the SH3 domains also bind to some region of SAPAP. The third SH3 domain of nArgBP2 interacts with l-afadin and vinculin in vitro, but it remains to be determined whether nArgBP2 interacts simultaneously with vinculin or l-afadin and SAPAP. Because these molecules interact with the same domain of nArgBP2, they may compete in the binding to nArgBP2, and there may be some regulatory mechanism, such as phosphorylation of nArgBP2, to determine which molecule binds to nArgBP2. The precise role of nArgBP2 in organization of synaptic components in the PSD is not known, but it may be intriguing to speculate that by interacting with SAPAP, nArgBP2 may link PSD-95/SAP90, S-SCAM, synamon, and their interacting molecules to cell adhesion systems, such as the cadherin-catenin-vinculin (16Geiger B. Ginsberg D. Salmon D. Volberg T. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and nectin-afadin (13Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H.

SAPAP is highly enriched in the PSD fraction and has the ability to recruit PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM to the Triton X-100-insoluble structures in transfected cells, suggesting that SAPAP may link PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM to the PSD in vivo (10Deguchi M.

SAPAP is composed of three regions with distinct characters. The N-terminal region is highly resistant to Triton X-100 extraction. The middle region contains five repeats of 14 amino acids followed by a proline-rich region. The C-terminal region also has proline-rich regions and is Triton X-100-soluble. PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM bind to the five repeats of 14 amino acids. Synamon binds to the C terminus of SAPAP (9Yao I. Hata Y. Hirao K. Deguchi M. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The nArgBP2-interacting region is different from either the PSD-95/SAP90- and S-SCAM-interacting region or the synamon-interacting region. nArgBP2 may form a complex with PSD-95/SAP90, S-SCAM, and synamon via SAPAP and may link the actin cytoskeleton to the components of the PSD.

Opening of chloride channels in the apical membrane has been identified as one important point for regulation of cholangiocyte secretion and involves the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),1 the protein product of the CF gene. Mutations in this gene inhibit channel function and result in cholestatic liver disease in 17–38% of patients (1O'Brien S. Keogan M. Casey M. Duffy G. McErlean D. Fitzgerald M.X. Hegarty J.E.

It is unclear why the prevalence of biliary disease in CF is less than that of pancreatic or pulmonary disease. One potential explanation for these clinical differences is that CFTR-independent pathways may also regulate biliary secretion. Recently, Cl− channels other than CFTR have been identified in cholangiocytes, and they appear to contribute importantly to modulation of cellular transport to meet changing physiologic demands. In isolated cells, Cl− currents activated by increases in cell volume are 2–3-fold greater than those activated by increases in cAMP (5Fitz J.G. Basavappa S. McGill J. Melhus O. Cohn J.A. J. Clin.

The resulting solute efflux favors movement of water out of the cell and recovery of volume toward basal values, a general process referred to as regulatory volume decrease (9Lang F. Ritter M. Volkl H. Haussinger D. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 16: 48-65PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms mediating channel opening and volume regulation in biliary cells have not been identified. However, cell volume increases appear to stimulate ATP release, and either removal of extracellular ATP or blockade of P2 receptors prevents cell volume recovery (10Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Salter K.D. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1391-G1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, ATP release may serve as a signal activating Cl− channel opening by binding to apical P2 receptors. In other cell types, cell volume increases stimulate parallel activation of multiple kinases (11Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem.

In liver cells, physiologic increases in cell volume have been shown to be a potent stimulus for PI 3-kinase activation (12Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol.

Based on the observations that cell volume and extracellular ATP are potent stimulators of cholangiocyte secretion, the purpose of these studies was to assess the cellular origin of biliary ATP and the potential role of PI 3-kinase as a signal modulating cholangiocyte Cl−secretion. Studies in isolated cells were performed in Mz-Cha-1 cells, originally isolated from human adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder (16Knuth A. Gabbert H. Dippold W. Klein O. Sachsse W. Bitter-Suermann D.

Studies in polarized monolayers were performed utilizing normal rat cholangiocytes (NRC) in culture (17Vroman B. LaRusso N. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). Each model system expresses phenotypic features of differentiated biliary epithelium including receptors, signaling pathways, and ion channels similar to those found in primary cells (6Basavappa S.

Moreover, increases in Mz-Cha-1 (8Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar) and NRC (data not shown) cell volume are followed by opening of membrane K+ and Cl−channels. Mz-Cha-1 cells were passaged at weekly intervals and maintained in culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in HCO3−-containing CMRL-1066 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (8Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar). NRC cells were cultured as described previously (17Vroman B. LaRusso N. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). Mean cell volume was measured in Mz-Cha-1 cell suspensions by electronic cell sizing (Coulter Multisizer, Accucomp software version 1.19, Hialeah, FL) using an aperture of 100 μm. Cells in subconfluent culture were harvested with 0.05% trypsin, suspended in cell culture media, centrifuged for 1 min at ∼1000 × g, resuspended in 3 ml of isotonic buffer, and incubated with gentle agitation for 30–45 min. Aliquots (∼500 μl) of cell suspension were added to 20 ml of isotonic or hypotonic (40% less NaCl) buffer. Measurements of ∼20,000 cells at specified time points after exposure to isotonic or hypotonic buffer were compared with basal values (time 0). Changes in values are expressed as relative volume normalized to the basal period. Membrane Cl− currents were measured using whole cell patch clamp techniques (20Fitz J.G. Sostman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G544-G553PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lidofsky S.D. Xie M.H. Sostman A. Scharschmidt B.F. Fitz J.G. J. Biol.

Cells on a coverslip were mounted in a chamber (volume, ∼400 μl) and perfused at 4–5 ml/min with a standard extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.40). The standard intracellular (pipette) solution for whole cell recordings contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, 0.5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.32), corresponding to a free [Ca2+] of ∼100 nm (22Chang D. Hsieh P.S. Dawson D.C. Comput. Biol. Med. 1988; 18: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass and had a resistance of 3–7 MΩ. Recordings were made with an Axopatch ID amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were digitized (1 kHz) for storage on a computer and analyzed using pCLAMP version 6.0 programs (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (21Lidofsky S.D.

Physiol. 1994; 266: G677-G684PubMed Google Scholar). Pipette voltages (V p) are referred to the bath. Current-voltage relations were measured between −120 mV and +100 mV in 20-mV increments (400-ms duration, 2 s between test potentials). In the whole cell configuration, V p corresponds to the membrane potential, and upward deflections of the current trace indicate outward membrane current. Changes in membrane Cl−permeability were assessed at a test potential of −80 mV (E k) to minimize any contribution of K+ currents and values were reported as current density (pA/pF) to normalize for differences in cell size as recently described (24Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R.M. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). NRC cells were utilized to study vectorial Cl− movement across monolayers. Cells were grown to confluency on collagen-treated polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.4 μm (Costar, Cambridge, MA) until a resistance of >1,000 Ω cm2 was achieved as measured by an epithelial tissue voltmeter (EVOHM; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Cells were mounted in a Trans-24 mini-perfusion system for tissue culture cups (Jim's Instrument Manufacturing Inc., Iowa City, Iowa). All experiments were carried out at 37 °C, and basolateral and apical (luminal) sides were perfused continuously and independently in a closed system with the standard extracellular buffer solution (as described above) by bubbling O2 through air-lift circulators. Transepithelial voltage (V t) was clamped to 0 mV and short circuit current (I sc) was recorded through agar bridges (3% agar in 3 m KCl) connected to Ag-AgCl electrodes (cartridge electrodes; World Precision Instruments). Previous studies indicate that I sc is a reflection of electrogenic Cl− secretion from the basolateral to the apical chamber (19Schlenker T. Romac J.M.-J. Sharara A. Roman R.M. Kim S. LaRusso N. Liddle R. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1108-G1117PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental results were compared with control studies (basal and swelling-induced I sc) performed on the same day to minimize any potential effects of day-to-day variability in current amplitude. Mz-Cha-1 cells were grown, in serum-containing media, to ∼90% confluency on 25-mm dishes. Cells were aspirated free of media, washed once in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in hypotonic buffer (40% decrease in NaCl, ∼205 mOsm) for defined intervals between 0 and 15 min. Samples were aspirated free of buffer solution and dissolved in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis solution (5% SDS, 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-base, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mmNa2VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm NaF). Samples were analyzed by Western blotting for Akt (protein kinase B), a downstream target of PI 3-kinase. Total Akt was detected with a general Akt antibody (Akt antibody, 1:1,000; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and phosphorylated Akt was detected by a phospho-specific Akt antibody (Thr308 antibody, 1:1,000; New England Biolabs). Blots were subsequently developed with actin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to ensure equivalent total protein loading. The blots were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). ATP release into media was detected by means of a bioluminescence assay as described previously (25Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L. Gruenert D.C. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRC cells were grown to confluence in a 35-mm dish, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with OptiMEM-I reduced serum medium plus luciferase-luciferin reagent (lyophilized reagent, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The dish was placed on a platform, lowered into the recording chamber of a Turner model TD20/20 luminometer, and studied immediately in real time. Because background luminescence (cells and medium without luciferase-luciferin reagent) is less than 0.1 arbitrary light unit (ALU), ATP released from cells into the media catalyzes the luciferase-luciferin reaction. Bioluminescence was measured in continuous 15-s photon collection intervals. To induce cell volume increases, the extracellular buffer was diluted 20–40% by adding water. In control studies, an equal volume of isotonic buffer was added to assess possible ATP release because of mechanical stimulation (27Grygorczyk R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small changes in bioluminescence associated with isotonic exposures were <10% of values associated with hypotonic exposure (data not shown). Wortmannin (Sigma) and LY294002 (Calbiochem) were used as PI 3-kinase inhibitors (28Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 29Okada T.

For all studies with wortmannin and LY294002, cells were preincubated with the respective inhibitor for 10 min prior to hypotonic exposure. In separate patch clamp studies, PI 3-kinase was inhibited by intracellular dialysis with a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing a sequence corresponding to residues 1054–1068 of the 110-kDa α-catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (31Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9113: 9185-9189Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated p110 PI 3-kinase antibodies (100 °C, 30 min) and polyclonal rabbit antibodies to β-galactosidase (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) were utilized as controls. The lipid products of PI 3-kinase (PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) were synthesized by previously described methods (32Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1998; 275: 665-668Crossref Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) and were delivered to the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette.l-α-Phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP-2, Calbiochem) was utilized as a control lipid. ATP and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Results are presented as the means ± S.E., with n representing the number of cells for patch clamp studies and the number of culture plates or repetitions for other assays. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used to assess statistical significance as indicated, and pvalues < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Exposure of cells to hypotonic buffer (40% decrease in NaCl, ∼205 mOsm), caused a rapid initial increase in relative volume to 1.20 ± 0.01 (n = 5, p < 0.001) within 3 min. The increase was followed by gradual recovery toward basal values despite the continued exposure to hypotonic buffer (Fig. 1). To evaluate whether PI 3-kinase contributes to cell volume recovery, analogous studies were performed in the presence of wortmannin. Hypotonic exposure after preincubation with wortmannin (50 nm) resulted in a similar initial increase to 1.18 ± 0.01 at 3 min. However, volume recovery was significantly delayed. The relative volume of 1.15 ± 0.01 at 20 min and 1.14 ± 0.01 at 30 min in the presence of wortmannin significantly exceeded control values of 1.10 ±.01 and 1.07 ± 0.01, respectively (n = 5 for each, p< 0.01; Fig. 1). These findings indicate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase impairs recovery from cell swelling. In Mz-Cha-1 cells, cell volume recovery from swelling depends upon opening of Cl− channels in the plasma membrane. To assess whether PI 3-kinase contributes to channel regulation, whole cell currents were measured under basal conditions and following cell volume increases induced by hypotonic exposure. Under basal conditions with standard intra- and extracellular buffers,I Cl− was small (<100 pA, ≤ 2 pA/pF). Exposure to hypotonic buffer (20% decrease in bath NaCl, ∼230 mOsm), resulted in activation of currents in >90% of cells within 2–4 min (representative trace shown in Fig.2 A), increasing current density from −1.6 ± 0.2 pA/pF to −45.9 ± 6.5 pA/pF at −80 mV (p < 0.001, n = 11). Swelling-activated currents exhibited characteristic biophysical features, with reversal near 0 mV (E Cl-), outward rectification, and time-dependent inactivation at depolarizing potentials above +60 mV, as described previously (24Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R.M. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Cl− currents were sustained for the duration of hypotonic exposure and were fully reversible within ∼5 min of return to isotonic perfusate (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of wortmannin (50 nm), the response to hypotonic exposure was inhibited with a maximum Cl− current density of −6.1 ± 2.5 pA/pF (n = 7, p < 0.001; Fig. 2,A and C). Similar results were obtained with LY294002 (10 μm), a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor (−9.5 ± 4.8 pA/pF, n = 5,p < 0.001; Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the effects of PI 3-kinase on volume-stimulated Cl− currents are relevant to transepithelial transport, parallel studies were performed in NRC monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. NRC cells plated on collagen-coated filters form polarized monolayers, and increases inI sc are due in large part to increases in apical Cl− conductance (19Schlenker T. Romac J.M.-J. Sharara A. Roman R.M. Kim S. LaRusso N. Liddle R. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1108-G1117PubMed Google Scholar). Inserts were mounted in the recording chamber and allowed to equilibrate with the standard extracellular buffer, and basal I sc was recorded (7.41 ± 0.29 μA/cm2, n = 8). Simultaneous perfusions of the apical and basolateral chambers with hypotonic buffer (30% less NaCl, ∼217 mOsm), to increase cell volume, resulted in a transient increase in theI sc to 14.01 ± 1.32 μA/cm2(n = 4), consistent with opening of conductive pathways (see Fig. 4 A). The peak I sc response occurred rapidly and tended to return toward basal values over 10 min despite the continued presence of hypotonic buffer. In the presence of wortmannin (50 nm) the I sc response was significantly attenuated (9.12 ± 0.26 μA/cm2,n = 4, p < 0.05; Fig.3). These results extend the observations in isolated cells and demonstrate a role of PI 3-kinase in volume-stimulated transepithelial Cl− secretion.Figure 3Inhibition of PI 3-kinase decreases transepithelial Cl− secretion. Short circuit current (I sc) across NRC monolayers was measured under voltage-clamp conditions in an Ussing chamber. A, in this representative recording, simultaneous perfusion of the apical and basolateral chambers with hypotonic buffer (30% decrease in NaCl, as represented by the bar) resulted in an increase in theI sc (upper tracing). In the presence of wortmannin (50 nm) the I scresponse to hypotonic exposure was attenuated (lower tracing). B, transepithelial Cl− secretion in response to hypotonic exposure. The y axis values are reported as ΔI sc (maximumI sc − basal I sc).

Consequently, three alternative strategies were utilized to assess the specificity of PI 3-kinase in cholangiocyte volume-stimulated ATP and Cl− transport as outlined in the following sections. PI 3-kinase activation from multiple stimuli (mitogens, chemotactic peptides, and osmotic changes) consistently result in phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B), its downstream effector, in all cell types studied (32Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1998; 275: 665-668Crossref Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 33Coffer P. Jin J. Woodgett J. Biochem.

To determine whether increases in cholangiocyte cell volume activate PI 3-kinase as observed in other cell types (12Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), an assay measuring Akt phosphorylation was utilized. In Mz-Cha-1 cells, hypotonic exposure (40% decrease in NaCl) increased Akt Thr308phosphorylation 20–50% by 6–12 min in all trials (n= 4). There was no increase in total Akt or actin levels (Fig.4). This study demonstrates that increases in cholangiocyte cell volume increase PI 3-kinase activity as measured by Akt phosphorylation. Additionally, the rapid activation of PI 3-kinase following hypotonic exposure is consistent with an early role in the response to cell volume increases. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of wortmannin and LY294002 on volume-activated Cl− channel activity represents a specific effect on PI 3-kinase, an alternative strategy utilizing intracellular dialysis with specific antibodies to the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase was evaluated. These antibodies have been shown to inhibit growth factor-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in cultured fibroblasts (31Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9113: 9185-9189Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For these studies, the antibodies were delivered to the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette. Intracellular dialysis with anti-PI 3-kinase antibody (5 μg/ml) completely inhibited Cl− currents in response to hypotonic exposure with a maximal average current density of −2.9 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 5). In contrast, currents measured during intracellular dialysis with either heat-inactivated antibodies (5 μg/ml) or antibodies to unrelated proteins (β-galactosidase, 5 μg/ml) were similar to controls (−36.7 ± 5.9 pA/pF and −39.4 ± 12.2 pA/pF respectively, n = 5 for each,p < 0.005, Fig. 5). These findings support a specific role of PI 3-kinase in volume-sensitive Cl− channel activation. PI 3-kinase phosphorylates the D3 position of the inositol ring forming three lipid products: PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. PtdIns-3-P is constitutively present in unstimulated cells and changes little upon stimulation. In contrast, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 are undetectable under resting conditions but increase rapidly upon stimulation, suggesting that they function as secondary messengers, translating extracellular stimuli to cellular responses (35Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 36Toker A. Cantley L.C.

The development of synthetic lipid products of PI 3-kinase has made the direct study of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathways possible. These synthetic phosphoinositides have been shown to be capable of mediating PI 3-kinase-dependent cellular processes including membrane ruffling and chemotaxis (38Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H.

To determine whether the lipid products of PI 3-kinase lead to Cl− channel opening, the synthetic lipids PtdIns-3-P (10 μm), PtdIns-3,4-P2 (10 μm) and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (10 μm) were individually delivered to the cell interior during isotonic conditions. Whole cell currents (measured at −80 mV) remained small in control cells (−1.6 ± 0.2 pA/pF, n = 22) and cells dialyzed with either inactive lipid PIP-2 (10 μm, −1.4 ± 0.3 pA/pF, n = 10) or PtdIns-3-P (−2.8 ± 1.5 pA/pF, n = 5). In contrast, spontaneous activation of currents was observed during intracellular dialysis with PtdIns-3,4-P2 (−11.7 ± 4.8 pA/pF, n= 8, p < 0.05 (compared with PIP-2)) and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (−7.9 ± 2.5, n = 6,p < 0.01; Fig.6 A). Intracellular dialysis with both PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3together (10 μm each) also resulted in spontaneous current activation, although the magnitude of the resulting current was not statistically greater than the individual lipids alone (−16.2 ± 1.7 pA/pF, n = 5, p < 0.001 (compared with PIP-2); Fig. 6, A and C). These currents demonstrated characteristics of volume-stimulated Cl− currents, with reversal near 0 mV (E Cl−), outward rectification, and time-dependent inactivation at depolarizing potentials above +60 mV (Fig. 6, B and D). Moreover, the current response generated by intracellular dialysis with PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 was inhibited in the presence of extracellular apyrase to remove any ATP released from cells (−2.6 ± 0.1 pA/pF, n = 4,p < 0.05, Fig. 6, A and B). These results are consistent with a model where the lipid products of PI 3-kinase contribute to direct modulation of membrane ATP permeability. In other cell types, increases in cel"
https://openalex.org/W1997494118,"The role of IL-6 in collagen production and tissue remodeling is controversial. In Rat-1 fibroblasts, we measured the effect of IL-6 on matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), c-jun, junB, and c-fos gene expression, binding of activator protein 1 (AP1) to DNA, amount of AP1 proteins, immunoreactive MMP-13 and TIMP-1 proteins, and Jun N-terminal kinase activity. We show that IL-6 increased MMP-13-mRNA and MMP-13 protein. These effects were exerted by acting on the AP1-binding site of the MMP-13 promoter, as shown by transfecting cells with reporter plasmids containing mutations in this element. Mobility shift assays demonstrated that IL-6 induced the DNA binding activity of AP1. This effect was accompanied by a marked increase in c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos mRNA, as well as in c-Jun protein and its phosphorylated form. The latter is not due to increased Jun N-terminal kinase activity but to a decreased serine/threonine phosphatase activity. We conclude that IL-6 increases interstitial MMP-13 gene expression at the promoter level. This effect seems to be mediated by the induction of c-jun, junB, and c-fos gene expression, by the binding of AP1 to DNA, by increasing phosphorylated c-Jun, and by the inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatase activity. These effects of IL-6 might contribute to remodeling connective tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1998850612,"The 120-kDa proto-oncogenic protein c-Cbl is a multidomain adaptor protein that is phosphorylated in response to the stimulation of a broad range of cell surface receptors and participates in the assembly of signaling complexes that are formed as a result of the activation of various signal transduction pathways. Several structural features of c-Cbl, including the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, proline-rich domain, and motifs containing phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues, mediate the association of c-Cbl with other components of these complexes. In addition to those domains that have been demonstrated to play a role in the binding of c-Cbl to other signaling molecules, c-Cbl also contains a RING finger motif and a putative leucine zipper. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously identified putative leucine zipper mediates the formation of Cbl homodimers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we show that deletion of the leucine zipper domain is sufficient to abolish Cbl homodimerization, while Cbl mutants carrying extensive N-terminal truncations retain the ability to dimerize with the full-length Cbl. The requirement of the leucine zipper for the homodimerization of Cbl was confirmed by in vitro binding assays, using deletion variants of the C-terminal half of Cbl with and without the leucine zipper domain, and in cells using Myc and green fluorescent protein (GFP) N-terminal-tagged Cbl variants. In cells, the deletion of the leucine zipper caused a decrease in both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with the epidermal growth factor receptor following stimulation with epidermal growth factor, thus demonstrating a role for the leucine zipper in c-Cbl's signaling functions. Thus, the leucine zipper domain enables c-Cbl to homodimerize, and homodimerization influences Cbl's signaling function, modulating the activity of Cbl itself and/or affecting Cbl's associations with other signaling proteins in the cell.

The requirement of the leucine zipper for the homodimerization of Cbl was confirmed by in vitro binding assays, using deletion variants of the C-terminal half of Cbl with and without the leucine zipper domain, and in cells using Myc and green fluorescent protein (GFP) N-terminal-tagged Cbl variants. In cells, the deletion of the leucine zipper caused a decrease in both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with the epidermal growth factor receptor following stimulation with epidermal growth factor, thus demonstrating a role for the leucine zipper in c-Cbl's signaling functions. Thus, the leucine zipper domain enables c-Cbl to homodimerize, and homodimerization influences Cbl's signaling function, modulating the activity of Cbl itself and/or affecting Cbl's associations with other signaling proteins in the cell. epidermal growth factor EGF receptor phosphotyrosine-binding glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP α-modified Eagle's minimum essential medium monoclonal antibody modified radioimmune precipitation assay Characterization of the mechanisms by which multiprotein signaling complexes are assembled around or downstream of activated cell surface receptors is essential for understanding how signal transduction pathways operate. In addition to receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and their substrates, adaptor proteins, with their specialized modular domains, participate in the assembly of such multiprotein complexes, recruiting signaling molecules into specific networks (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Accumulating experimental data indicates that the c-Cbl protein is such an adaptor molecule, with diverse binding domains that contribute to the assembly of signaling complexes involved in various signal transduction pathways (2Reedquist K.A.

Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar, 6Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylation of c-Cbl has been demonstrated in response to EGF,1 platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, colony-stimulating factor-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin, as well as upon the stimulation of the Fcγ receptor, T and B cell antigen receptors, c-Kit, integrins, and receptors for interferon α, interleukin-3, insulin, and prolactin (6Langdon W.Y.

Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl has been also observed in v-Src-, v-Abl-, and BCR-Abl-transformed cells (6Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J.

These tyrosine phosphorylation events may then lead to c-Cbl's incorporation into molecular assemblies through the binding of the phosphorylated sequences to the Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains of a wide range of other signaling molecules, as has been shown for Crk family members; protein-tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lck, and Abl; the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase; phospholipase Cγ; and the nucleotide exchange factor Vav (2Reedquist K.A.

Conversely, c-Cbl also contains a PTB domain in its N-terminal half that binds to the activated ZAP-70 protein kinase and phosphorylated EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (22Lupher Jr., M.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions, stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor has been reported to induce serine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, which in turn results in the binding of c-Cbl to the members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins (25Liu Y.C. Liu Y.H. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, c-Cbl is a multidomain protein with many potential binding sites that can mediate protein associations through mechanisms other than phosphotyrosine- or phosphoserine-dependent interactions. Domains of c-Cbl that have been demonstrated or predicted to be engaged in protein associations include a RING finger in the middle of the molecule, an extensive proline-rich region in the C-terminal half of the protein, and a putative leucine zipper at the C terminus (6Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, c-Cbl has been shown to associate through the proline-rich region with numerous Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, including the adaptor molecules Grb2 and Nck and the protein kinases Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Src, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (7Tanaka S.

Med. 1995; 182: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). While no involvement of the RING finger of c-Cbl in protein interactions has yet been reported, it is known that small deletions or point mutations in this region activate the transforming potential of c-Cbl (6Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and we have found that this domain binds the ubiquitin-conjugating protein UbcH7. 2Yokouchi, M., Houghton, A., Kondo, T., Bartkiewicz, M., Horne, W. C., Zhang, H., Yoshimura, A., and Baron, R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem.in press. Furthermore, the N-terminal half of c-Cbl contains a nuclear localization signal that could play a role in the transforming activity of v-Cbl (6Langdon W.Y. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1995; 25: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these findings point to an important general role of c-Cbl in signaling downstream of cellular receptors coupled to tyrosine kinases, but specific biological functions of this molecule remain unclear. Recent reports indicate, however, that c-Cbl has the ability, through direct interactions, to regulate the function of signaling proteins. Based on genetic studies, SLI-1, the homologue of Cbl inCaenorhabditis elegans, was identified as a negative regulator of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase, the homologue of the mammalian EGF receptor (29Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A similar regulatory function has been postulated for D-Cbl, the Drosophila homologue of Cbl (30Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernández B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, expression of transforming mutants of Cbl (v-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl) up-regulates the signaling through platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, and the requirement for the PTB domain in this process has been demonstrated (24Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of 70Z-Cbl has been shown to induce increases in both tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the EGF receptor (31Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Cbl inhibits the activity of the Syk nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, with which Cbl forms a complex (32Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Finally, the Cbl PTB domain has been found to bind to the in vivo negative regulatory phosphorylation site of ZAP-70 (33Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Based on these data, the PTB domain-dependent role of Cbl as a negative regulator of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases has been postulated (33Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Cbl may function both as a negative regulator of tyrosine kinases and as a multifunctional adaptor protein. All of these earlier studies have focused on the interactions of c-Cbl with other signaling proteins but have not considered the possibility of its self-association. Some of c-Cbl's protein-binding domains, such as a RING finger and a putative leucine zipper, are, however, known to mediate the formation of homodimers in other proteins. We therefore examined the ability of human c-Cbl to homodimerize using a number ofin vivo and in vitro methodologies and found that Cbl homodimerizes through its leucine zipper domain. This ability to dimerize was found to be necessary for the efficient EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with EGFR, and it is likely to have other important implications for the biological function of c-Cbl. Plasmids containing full-length c-Cbl and various c-Cbl mutants were constructed based on the clone of HA-tagged human c-Cbl in pGEM-4Z, kindly provided by Dr. W. Langdon (Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Australia). Standard polymerase chain reaction and DNA manipulation techniques were used to prepare the constructs (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). The sequence of all polymerase chain reaction products was verified by DNA sequence analysis, and in addition, restriction analysis was performed on all of the plasmids used in this study. c-Cbl constructs were first inserted in frame into theBamHI/SalI sites of pET-28c vector (Novagen), to allow expression of T7·Tag-Cbl fusion proteins. The c-Cbl inserts were subsequently subcloned into BamHI/SalI sites in pGex-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were used to express GST-Cbl fusion proteins. Additionally, c-Cbl constructs were inserted into yeast expression vectors pBTM116 (BamHI/SalI sites) and pVP16 (BamHI/NotI sites) (provided by S. Hollenberg) for use in the two-hybrid assay. The following human c-Cbl constructs were prepared (Fig. 1; numbers in parentheses indicate the amino acids of human c-Cbl included in the construct): full-length c-Cbl (2–906) (Cbl-FL); N-terminal half of c-Cbl (2–450) (Cbl-N half); C-terminal half of c-Cbl (479–906) (Cbl-C half); deletion of leucine zipper domain from the full-length c-Cbl (2–856) (Cbl-ΔLZ); deletion of acidic domain from the full-length c-Cbl (2–710 and 835–906) (Cbl-ΔAc); deletion of both acidic and leucine zipper domains from the full-length c-Cbl (2–689) (Cbl-Δ(Ac + LZ)); deletion of leucine zipper domain from C-terminal half of c-Cbl (479–856) (Cbl-C half, ΔLZ); acidic and leucine zipper domains of c-Cbl (679–906) (Cbl-Ac + LZ); acidic domain of c-Cbl (679–856) (Cbl-Ac); and leucine zipper domain of c-Cbl (829–906) (Cbl-LZ). For transient transfection experiments, constructs for N-terminal Myc-tagged Cbl-FL and Cbl-ΔLZ were prepared by subcloningBamHI/NotI fragments from the pET-28c vector into pBK-CMV-Myc. For N-terminal tagging with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), the Cbl-FL construct was subcloned into theBamHI/NotI sites of the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH). The procedures of Vojtek et al. (35Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 36Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and Hollenberg et al. (37Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) were followed for growing, transforming, selecting, and mating the yeast strains. The yeast strains L40 (MATa) and AMR 70 (MATα) were transformed with plasmids pBTM116, containing Cbl fused to LexA DNA binding domain, and pVP16, containing Cbl fused to VP16 activation domain, respectively. The expression of correctly sized LexA-Cbl and VP16-Cbl proteins in yeast transformants was confirmed by Western blot analysis using c-Cbl monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and c-Cbl (C-15) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To select for diploid growth, yeasts were grown for 3 days at 30 °C on plates with synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (ura−, trp−, leu−), followed by β-galactosidase assays. To select for the interaction of proteins by induction of the HIS3gene, yeasts were restreaked on plates with synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, leucine, lysine, and histidine (ura−, trp−, leu−, lys−, his−), and the yeast growth was followed up to 7 days. Interactions between LexA-Cbl fusion proteins and the VP16 activation domain alone, and LexA-lamin (provided by S. Hollenberg) and VP16-Cbl proteins served as negative controls. For quantitative β-galactosidase assay, yeast diploids were grown in synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (ura−, trp−, leu−), and the assay was performed according to the published procedure (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). At least four independent diploid transformants were assayed. The β-galactosidase unit is defined as A 420 × 103/min × ml × A 600(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Yeast diploid colonies grown on the plates with synthetic medium, ura−, trp−, leu− and ura−, trp−, leu−, lys−, his− were also analyzed by β-galactosidase filter assay as described elsewhere (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar,36Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). At least five independent transformants for each mating combination were analyzed. HEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium, α modification (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected for 5 h using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) in α-MEM following the manufacturer's protocol. A stable cell line expressing EGFP-Cbl-FL was established by transferring cells into culture medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) 72 h post-transfection. Cells were then maintained in this medium until resistant colonies of cells were formed (approximately 2 weeks) and subsequently pooled (>20 colonies). The cells were then routinely maintained in culture medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418. For Fig. 6, HEK293 cells stably expressing EGFP-Cbl-FL were transiently transfected with pBK-Myc-Cbl constructs, and after 72 h they were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay (mRIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For Fig. 7, culture medium was changed 65 h post-transfection to α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured for an additional 36 h. Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF or vehicle for 3 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in mRIPA.Figure 7Deletion of the leucine zipper causes a reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and its association with the EGFR following EGF stimulation. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pBK-Myc (control), pBK-Myc-Cbl-FL, or pBK-Myc-Cbl-ΔLZ; cultured; and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF or vehicle as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins following EGF stimulation was analyzed by immunoblotting 10 μg of cell lysate protein with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr, upper panel). The expression of both Myc-Cbl-FL and Myc-Cbl-ΔLZ were assessed by reprobing with anti-Myc antibody (lower panel). B, the phosphorylation of Myc-Cbl-FL and Myc-Cbl-ΔLZ was compared by blotting the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (IP) of cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr, upper panel), and the association of Myc-Cbl proteins with EGFR was analyzed by blotting with an anti-EGFR antibody (lower panel). The levels of Myc-Cbl proteins in the immunoprecipitates were evaluated by reprobing with anti-Myc antibody (middle panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) T7·Tag-Cbl and GST-Cbl fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) transformed with pET-28c-Cbl and pGEX-5X-3-Cbl constructs, respectively. T7·Tag-Cbl fusion proteins were isolated using His-Bind resin and the His-Bind buffer kit supplied by Novagen following the manufacturer's procedure for the purification under native conditions. Specifically, 500 ml of culture was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, the binding of the fusion protein to His-Bind resin was performed in a batchwise fashion for 2 h at 4 °C, and 0.1% Triton X-100 was included in the buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. GST, GST-Grb2, and GST-Cbl fusion proteins were purified from 500 ml of bacterial culture induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4.5 h, basically following the procedure described elsewhere (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation batchwise on the rocking plate for 6 h at 4 °C, and the protein was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol by gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the eluted fractions was estimated using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Fusion proteins were subsequently concentrated on Centricon concentrators (Amicon), and the concentration of proteins was evaluated visually on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, comparing with bovine serum albumin standards. 250 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C in mRIPA containing 0.5 μg of mouse monoclonal c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (CLONTECH) and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Calbiochem). Beads were then washed three times with mRIPA, and protein was analyzed by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotech), anti-c-Myc mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP mAb (CLONTECH), anti-T7·Tag mAb (Novagen), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Promega). Total cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or purified GST, GST-Grb2, and GST-Cbl fusion proteins (amounts indicated in the figure legends) were heated for 10 min at 37 °C in standard SDS-sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85; pore size, 0.45 μm) (Schleicher & Schuell), and the filters were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 5% milk, TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). For Far Western blots, filters were probed with purified T7·Tag-Cbl fusion proteins at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in 2% bovine serum albumin, TBST, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively five times with TBST containing 0.3% Tween 20, and then analyzed by sequential incubation with mAb anti-T7·Tag (1:10,000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:20,000 dilution) in 2% bovine serum albumin, TBST for 30 min each. Immunoprecipitations and total cell lysates were visualized by immunoblotting with the appropriate primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) and then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody. All blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To verify the quality of all blots, proteins were visualized on the filters by staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 3% trichloroacetic acid. Purified GST and GST-Cbl fusion proteins (1 or 2 μg, as indicated in the figure legends) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by agitation on the rocking plate for 2 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm dithiothreitol with or without competing T7·Tag-Cbl-LZ fusion protein.

https://openalex.org/W1984371704,"Previous studies have shown that (i) the insulin-induced activation of heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2) is wortmannin-sensitive, but is insensitive to rapamycin, suggesting the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; and (ii) protein kinase B (PKB) activates PFK-2 in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-466 and Ser-483. In this work, we have studied the effects of phosphorylation of these residues on PFK-2 activity by replacing each or both residues with glutamate. Mutation of Ser-466 increased the V(max) of PFK-2, whereas mutation of Ser-483 decreased citrate inhibition. Mutation of both residues was required to decrease the K(m) for fructose 6-phosphate. We also studied the insulin-induced activation of heart PFK-2 in transfection experiments performed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Insulin activated transfected PFK-2 by phosphorylating Ser-466 and Ser-483. Kinase-dead (KD) PKB and KD 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) cotransfectants acted as dominant negatives because both prevented the insulin-induced activation of PKB as well as the inactivation of glycogen-synthase kinase-3, an established substrate of PKB. However, the insulin-induced activation of PFK-2 was prevented only by KD PDK-1, but not by KD PKB. These results indicate that the insulin-induced activation of heart PFK-2 is mediated by a PDK-1-activated protein kinase other than PKB."

These observations suggest the possibility of a direct cross-talk between Bcl-2 and PS.

PCR products were cloned in pCR3.1 expression vector by TA cloning (Invitrogene). Human full-length PS1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA prepared from HeLa cells, cloned in pCR2.1 expression vector by TA cloning. Correct cDNA sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. pCR2.1-PS1 and pCR2.1-PS1-hydrophilic-loop were digested byEcoRI-SalI, and the resulting PS1 cDNA fragments were subcloned into the Gal4 binding domain of pGBT9. pCR3.1-Bcl-2 was digested by EcoRI-SalI, and the resulting Bcl-2 cDNA fragment was subcloned into the Gal4 activation domain of pGAD424. The correct insertions and sequences of both cDNAs were confirmed by automatic sequencing. Bait (pGBT9) and prey (pGAD424) plasmids were introduced into CG 1945 yeast cells either alone or together by using standard lithium acetate protocol. The expression of fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies against PS1, the Gal4 binding domain, or Bcl-2. Transformed yeasts were plated on histidine-deficient selective medium in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,3-triazol (3-AT). Synthesis of β-galactosidase was subsequently tested by filter assay (CLONTECH). The monoclonal antibody 124 (mAb 124) directed against residues 41–54 of Bcl-2 protein was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. A polyclonal antiserum (Bcl-2 Δ21) directed against residues 1–205 of Bcl-2 protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal antibody anti-cytochrome c and anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) were purchased, respectively, from PharMingen and Molecular Probes. The polyclonal antiserum R4318 was raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide VQPFMDQLAFHQFYI-C, corresponding to positions 453–467 of the carboxyl terminus of PS1. R4318 precipitated full-length PS1 from the nonionic detergent-soluble cellular fraction; the immunoreactive signal of the R4318 antibody was preadsorbed by the corresponding uncoupled peptide (data not shown). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum R9713 was raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide SQDTVAENDDGGFSEEWEAQ-C corresponding to residues 324–343, and representing the NH2 terminus of the putative caspase cleavage site. For immunoblotting, R9713 was affinity-purified by adsorption to the corresponding antigenic peptide immobilized to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) HiTrap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). On immunoblots, R9713 detected the full-length PS1 and the PS1-CTF as 48- and 21-kDa bands, respectively, that were absorbed by preincubation with the peptide used for immunizations. Cellular amounts of this protein clearly increased upon transfection of the cells with PS1 expression constructs. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min, and protein concentrations in the supernatant fluids were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). The lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitations were done at room temperature by incubating overnight 200 μg of proteins with primary antibodies, or with the preimmune R4318 serum previously bound to protein G-Sepharose. Precipitated proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with PBS, and were eluted by boiling in non-reducing SDS buffer. Proteins were separated by 4–20% Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis. Western blots were performed as described previously (36Gasparini L. Racchi M. Benussi L. Curti D. Binetti G. Bianchetti A. Trabucchi M. Govoni S. Neurosci.

Cells were lysed in 2 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6) in the presence of protease inhibitors. NHS and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride were freshly prepared in Me2SO and MES, respectively, and were added to cell lysates at a final concentration of 2 mm. The cross-linking reaction was done on ice and by twice adding fresh linkers after 10 min. The reaction was stopped after 20 min with 9 mm glycine. Samples were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min. H9 human lymphoblastic cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, and with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified chamber. H4 human neuroglioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified chamber. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the semiconfluent layers of H4 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3 vector alone or with pCR3.1-Bcl-2 construct and by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). At the same time, cells were transfected with pCMV-βGal, followed by a colorimetric assay to test transfection efficiency. Clones were selected in 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Calbiochem). Resistant clones were picked by using cloning cylinders, and were analyzed by Western blot with mAb 124 to confirm the overexpression of Bcl-2. Stable transfected H4 cells expressing the Bcl-2 construct were maintained in G418 at a final concentration of 800 μg/ml. Subconfluent monolayers of stably transfected H4 cells were washed twice with PBS, and exposed overnight to 100 nmstaurosporine in serum-free medium. Apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL system according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). 1 mm stock solution of staurosporine (Sigma) in Me2SO was stored at −20 °C. Cos 7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidifying chamber. The day after seeding, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected by LipofectAMINE with the indicated plasmids; 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested by using a cell lifter. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized in a glass-glass homogenizer using the loose pestle (25 strokes). The homogenate was incubated 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to generate the soluble cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (Buffer A + 1% Nonidet P-40), homogenized using a tight pestle (25 strokes), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was the particulate or membrane fraction. Loading of the samples was normalized for the total content of cellular proteins determined separately with Bradford or BCA method and double-checked with Coomassie staining of the gels. Particulate and membrane fractions were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blots were performed as described previously (36Gasparini L. Racchi M. Benussi L. Curti D. Binetti G. Bianchetti A. Trabucchi M. Govoni S. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 231: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and probed with monoclonal antibody anti-cytochrome c and COII. In order to test the PS1/Bcl-2 interaction in vivo, we set up a yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Full-length PS1, PS1 hydrophilic loop and full-length Bcl-2 were expressed in yeast strain CG-1945 as fusion proteins with a Gal4 DNA binding domain and a Gal4 transcription activation domain, respectively. Whereas growth of yeasts expressing either Bcl-2 or PS1 alone was either undetectable or limited, cells harboring both fusion proteins were able to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). In contrast to the interaction with full-length PS1, we did not observe any interaction when the PS1 hydrophilic loop was expressed (data not shown). Positive control yeasts transformed with pVA3.1 and pTD1 grew at higher rates (Fig. 1, lane 4). The transactivation of the second reporter gene, lacZ, was tested in a filter X-gal assay. Whereas the positive control colonies started to turn blue after 2 h, none of the other transformed yeasts expressed lacZ, even after overnight incubations with X-gal. In order to determine whether Bcl-2 and PS1 interact in human cell lines, we used co-immunoprecipitation assays of proteins extracted from H9 lymphoblastic and H4 neuroglioma cell lines. Proteins immunoprecipitated by mAb 124 were analyzed by Western blot with the PS1 polyclonal antiserum R4318, which recognized ∼50-kDa full-length PS1 both in H9 and in H4 cell lysates. Full-length PS1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 in both cell lines (Fig.2, A and B). Cross-linking of cell lysates of H4 cells reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the Bcl-2 immunoreactive signal in SDS gels (Fig.3 A), whereas cross-linked PS1 proteins migrated with a smear above 200 kDa (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of Bcl-2 immunoprecipitation after cross-linking presented the same shift observed in protein extracts, with a Bcl-2 recovery by mAb 124 comparable in treated and untreated samples (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4). Cross-linkers did affect PS1 co-immunoprecipitation with Bcl-2, as evidenced by weaker signals at ∼50 kDa, and by a concomitant signal at high molecular mass range of the blots (Fig. 3 B). Reciprocal experiments carried out in H9 and H4 cell lysates with different PS1 polyclonal antisera failed to co-immunoprecipitate proteins recognized by mAb 124 (Fig.4; data shown for H4 cell and R4318 polyclonal antiserum). To demonstrate immunoprecipitations of Bcl-2 with PS1, we stably overexpressed Bcl-2 in H4 cells; as compared with native H4 cells, transfected cells had a higher level of Bcl-2 (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2), whereas the amounts of PS1 co-immunoprecipitated by the Bcl-2 antibody were similar in both untransfected and transfected cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and 6); different PS1 polyclonal antisera R4318 and R9713 clearly co-immunoprecipitated Bcl-2 only in transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3and 4). In related control experiments, Bcl-2 immunoreactive signals were absent in R4318- and R9713-conjugated beads as well as in proteins precipitated with the R4318 preimmune serum (Fig.5 B, lanes 1 and 2). To confirm that the 26-kDa immunoreactive product detected by mAb 124 corresponded to Bcl-2, we preadsorbed the signal with the corresponding peptide. Preadsorption eliminated the 26-kDa Bcl-2-related signal, while ∼29-kDa signal, caused by cross-reactivity to IgG light chains (Fig. 5 B, lane 7), remained unchanged.Figure 5PS1 and Bcl-2 interaction analysis by immunoprecipitation assays. We stably transfected and overexpressed Bcl-2 in H4 neuroglioma cells; protein extracts (10 μg) from native H4 and stable transfected H4 cells were loaded onto 4–20% Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis, blotted, and analyzed with polyclonal antiserum Bcl-2 Δ21 (A, lanes 1 and2). Cell lysates (200 μg) from native H4 cells and Bcl-2-overexpressing (overexp.) H4 cells were immunoprecipitated with mAb 124 and analyzed by Western blot with R4318 polyclonal antiserum; PS1 co-immunoprecipitation was similar in native H4 and H4-transfected cells (A, lanes 4 and6). Bcl-2 protein was co-immunoprecipitated (co-IPP) by two different PS1 polyclonal antisera, R4318 and R9713 by using protein extracts (Prot. Extr.) from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Co-immunoprecipitated Bcl-2 were detected as signals at 26 kDa (B, lanes 3 and4); in washed R4318-conjugated beads (B,lane 1) and in proteins immunoprecipitated (IP) by preimmune R4318 serum (B, lane 2), only unspecific signals, probably due to the IgG (∼29 kDa), were detected. Pre-adsorption of mAb 124 with its cognate peptide abolished 26-kDa Bcl-2-related signals (B, lanes 8–10), while unspecific bands remained unchanged (B, lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overnight exposure to 100 nm staurosporine in serum-deficient media induced apoptosis in roughly 40% of stably Bcl-2-transfected H4 cells, as indicated by TUNEL assay (Fig. 6,A and B). Western blots showed that immunoreactive signals of Bcl-2 protein increased in lysates from cells exposed to staurosporine (Fig.7 A, lanes 1 and2) and that levels of full-length PS1 did not change staurosporine (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and2). Despite increased Bcl-2 levels in protein extracts, its recovery by immunoprecipitation following staurosporine exposure was slightly lower as compared with control samples (Fig. 7 A,lanes 3 and 4); and apoptosis strongly reduced co-immunoprecipitated full-length PS1 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 7Apoptosis modified the interaction between PS1 and Bcl-2. Stable transfected H4 cells were exposed overnight to 100 nm staurosporine (STS) in medium without serum (SW). Protein extracts (Prot. Extr., 10 μg) from cells grown in medium without serum or treated with staurosporine were analyzed by Western blot with Bcl-2 Δ21 (A, lanes 1 and 2) and with R4318 (B, lanes 1 and 2). Cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Bcl-2 mAb 124 and then tested by Western blot for immunoprecipitation with Bcl-2 polyclonal antiserum Δ21 (A, lanes 3 and4) and co-immunoprecipitation with R4318 PS1 polyclonal antiserum (B, lanes 3 and 4).

Transient transfections of PS1 increased the release of cytochrome c; this increase was significantly attenuated by co-transfection with Bcl-2 (Fig.8). To rule out the possibility that cytosolic preparations were contaminated with, we determined the mitochondrial marker of COII in the subcellular fractions; COII was present only in the membrane fraction (data not shown). In this study we present evidence from yeast-two hybrid system, from co-immunoprecipitations, and from cross-linking assays that PS1 interacts with Bcl-2. First, full-length PS1, but not the PS1 hydrophilic loop, used as bait, transactivated a histidine reporter gene in the presence of a Bcl-2-Gal4 activation domain fusion protein. The absence of lacZ induction in the same system could be due either to weakness and instability of PS1 and Bcl-2 fusion complex in yeast or to the requirement for a third interaction partner. The yeast two-hybrid system was successfully used to identify interaction between PS1 and β-amyloid precursor protein (37Waragai M. Imafuku I. Takeuchi S. Kanazawa I. Oyama F. Udagawa Y. Kawabata M. Okazawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), filamin (16Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 914-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and β-catenin (38Levesque G., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L., Yu, H. Xu D. Liang Y. Rogaeva E. Ikeda M. Duthie M. Murgolo N.

Together, these data suggest multiple interaction partners of PS1, and possibly, promiscuity of their functional consequences. We co-immunoprecipitated PS1 with a Bcl-2 antibody from human H9 lymphoblastic and H4 neuroglioma cells. Cross-linkers did neither interfere sensibly with the Bcl-2 immunoreactive signals in proteins extract nor with its recovery by mAb 124. In the presence of cross-linkers, PS1 proteins were associated with a high molecular mass complex over 200 kDa. This may be due to self-aggregation or to complex formation with other putative partners. Co-immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 and PS1 by mAb 124 was significantly affected by cross-linkers by shifting the ∼50-kDa full-length PS1 to a signal with a molecular mass higher than 200 kDa. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 with a PS1 antibody was demonstrated in H4 cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2. Co-immunoprecipitation of PS1 with Bcl-2 was similar in transfected and untransfected cells. Our data suggest that the interaction between the two proteins occurs via the formation of a macromolecular complex, rather than a 1:1 stoichiometric association. Apparently, increasing amounts of Bcl-2 in transfected cells can facilitate its aggregation into this macromolecular complex. This hypothesis is further supported by the known formation of both Bcl-2 homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the Bcl-2 family (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar, 40Hanada M. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Alternate interpretations include the possibility that high cellular concentrations of Bcl-2 may modify the intracellular milieu to the effect that interactions of Bcl-2 with its partners are favored. The stably transfected H4 cells used in this study were more resistant to apoptotic stimuli as compared with the native, untransfected cells (data not shown). These data confirm reports from other Bcl-2-overexpressing cell lines in which apoptosis resistance was attributed to higher control of cellular calcium homeostasis (41Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2051-2055PubMed Google Scholar, 42Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It is further known that PS proteins interact with calcium-binding proteins (14Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Tomita T. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 797-799PubMed Google Scholar, 15Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 10: 1177-1181Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and PS1 mutants sensitize to apoptosis through a pathway that modulates intracellular calcium ions homeostasis (32Keller J.N. Guo Q. Holtsberg F.W. Bruce-Keller A.J. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4439-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If maintenance of intracellular calcium concentration is a physiological function shared by PS1 and Bcl-2, we can hypothesize that Bcl-2 overexpression may stabilize their reciprocal association. The broad inhibitor of protein kinases, staurosporine, induces apoptosis in various cell lines by mediating a sustained increase of intracellular calcium ion concentrations (43Kruman I. Gou Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In our experiments, staurosporine increased cellular levels of Bcl-2 protein that were not followed by subsequent increase of immunoprecipitated Bcl-2 by mAb 124, suggesting the possibility that Bcl-2 may be sequestrated in complexes not recognized by mAb 124 antibody. Full-length PS1 immunoreactivity was unchanged by apoptosis, and instead apoptosis promoted the dissociation of PS1 from Bcl-2, as demonstrated by reduced co-immunoprecipitation of PS1 with mAb 124. Thus, reversible association of Bcl-2 and PS1 could account for an anti-apoptotic role played by the two proteins. Moreover, redistribution of cytochromec, one of the best known downstream activators of apoptotic cascade, could be one of the crucial events influenced by PS1/Bcl-2 interaction; the interaction of PS proteins with Bcl-xL, another anti-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family and the subsequent change in cytochrome crelease, further support this idea. 2L. D'Adamio, personal communication. A similar synergism exists in the interaction of Bcl-2 and SMN. Mutations of SMN cause spinal muscular atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal apoptosis. Our data are consistent with similar interactions between PS1 and Bcl-2. In analogy to the role of SMN in muscular atrophy, defective interaction of PS1 with Bcl-2 may underlie the pathophysiology leading to AD. PS1 could thus have a role in apoptosis by providing a part of Bcl-2 protein macromolecular complex, and by liberating from the complex in response to an apoptotic signal. Further characterization of the Bcl-2 interaction with familial AD-associated PS1 mutants will address this possibility. The literature on the role of presenilins in apoptosis is still controversial, in that both sensitization to apoptosis and a protective effects were reported (19Deng G. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W.

Presenilins undergo alternative processing during apoptosis, along with redistribution of their derivatives from an intracellular membrane compartments to a Nonidet P-40-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (45Gasparini L. Moraschi S. Ghidoni R. Alberci A. Benussi L. Moratto D. Trabucchi M. Bianchetti A. Growdon J.H. Nitsch R. Binetti G. Soc. Neurosci. 1998; 24: 8Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by death-effector domains causes the formation of novel cytoplasmic structures, defined death-effector filaments (DEF) that share solubility properties with the cytoskeleton (46Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Procaspases are among the major constituents of DEF. Because presenilins are substrates of activated caspases it is possible that dissociation of PS1 and Bcl-2 is associated with subsequent recruitment in DEF. Insoluble intracellular filamentous inclusions are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative conditions including frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Huntington's disease (47Welch W.J. Gambetti P. Nature. 1998; 392: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), prion disease (48Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Pathophysiologic mechanisms related to apoptosis could be common scenarios in which such novel cytoplasmatic structures as DEF may alter the native folding of different proteins such as Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and prion protein to aggregated and insoluble forms. Investigating whether presenilin 1 redistribution is followed by DEF recruitment and deposition of PS1 containing filaments will provide further insights to a common pathway by which distinct proteins are involved in neurodegeneration."

Recombinant Aplysia cyclase was expressed in yeast and co-crystallized with a substrate, nicotinamide. x-ray crystallography showed that the nicotinamide was bound in a pocket formed in part by a conserved segment and was near the central cleft of the cyclase. Glu98, Asn107 and Trp140 were within 3.5 Å of the bound nicotinamide and appeared to coordinate it. Substituting Glu98 with either Gln, Gly, Leu, or Asn reduced the cyclase activity by 16–222-fold, depending on the substitution. The mutant N107G exhibited only a 2-fold decrease in activity, while the activity of W140G was essentially eliminated. The base exchange activity of all mutants followed a similar pattern of reduction, suggesting that both reactions occur at the same active site. In addition to NAD, the wild-type cyclase also cyclizes nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide to cyclic GDP-ribose. All mutant enzymes had at least half of the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity of the wild type, some even 2–3-fold higher, indicating that the three coordinating amino acids are responsible for positioning of the substrate but not absolutely critical for catalysis. To search for the catalytic residues, other amino acids in the binding pocket were mutagenized. E179G was totally devoid of GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity, and both its ADP-ribosyl cyclase and the base exchange activities were reduced by 10,000- and 18,000-fold, respectively. Substituting Glu179 with either Asn, Leu, Asp, or Gln produced similar inactive enzymes, and so was the conversion of Trp77 to Gly. However, both E179G and the double mutant E179G/W77G retained NAD-binding ability as shown by photoaffinity labeling with [32P]8-azido-NAD. These results indicate that both Glu179 and Trp77 are crucial for catalysis and that Glu179 may indeed be the catalytic residue.

ADP-ribosyl cyclase was first discovered in sea urchin egg extracts as an activity converting NAD to a Ca2+-releasing metabolite, which was later identified as cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) 1The abbreviations used are:cADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNGDnicotinamide guanine dinucleotideHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography (1Lee H.C.

Subsequent work shows that all members of the cyclase family are also functionally similar, since they all are enzymes catalyzing the cyclization of NAD to cADPR (Refs. 12Howard M. Grimaldi J.C.

More surprising is the discovery that all these enzymes also can use NADP as a substrate and catalyze the exchange of its nicotinamide group with nicotinic acid, producing nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (16Aarhus R.

The salient feature of this catalytic model is the proposal that a single intermediate is responsible for cyclization, hydrolysis, and base exchange chemistries of the cyclase family of enzymes. Experimental support for this model has recently been provided (23Sauve A.A. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13239-13249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). x-ray crystallography reveals that theAplysia cyclase is a bean-shaped molecule with a central cleft (24Prasad G.S.

In solution as well as in the crystalline state, the cyclase forms dimers from two monomers in a head-to-head fashion enveloping a central cavity the size of a molecule of cADPR (24Prasad G.S.

This structural feature suggests that the active site of the enzyme may be at the central region of the molecule. In this study, theAplysia cyclase was co-crystallized with nicotinamide, a substrate for the base-exchange reaction. The active site of the enzyme was identified and characterized by x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. ThePichia expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used, and the construct consists of cloning the wild type or mutant cyclase in frame with the yeast mating α-factor signal sequence. The details of the construct were as we have described previously (26Munshi C.B. Fryxell K.B. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Munshi C. Lee H.C.

Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The tightly controlled alcohol oxidase promotor was used to regulate the expression of the construct. Yeast (GS115 strain) transfected with the construct was grown in a fermentation bioreactor, and expression was induced by methanol. The expressed cyclase was secreted as a soluble protein in the fermentation medium, and as much as 0.3 g/liter could be obtained (26Munshi C.B. Fryxell K.B. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Munshi C. Lee H.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Endogenous proteolytic enzymes that normally are responsible for processing the prepro-α-mating factor also removed the α-factor signal sequence from the expressed cyclase. Some of the mutant proteins were also expressed in the X-33 strain (Invitrogen) of Pichia pastoris. This strain is isogenic to the GS115 strain, except that it contains the native alcohol oxidaseAOX1 and HIS4 genes. The AOX1 gene allows the yeast to metabolize methanol and grow to higher densities, particularly during fermentation. The native histidine gene,HIS4, facilitates production of endogenous histidine and allows rapid growth of the yeast without any external supplementation of histidine. The dominant selectable marker, Zeocin, also allows for use of positive selection vectors pPICZαA. With this vector the transformation efficiency was nearly 100%, and no revertants were detected. After a 5-day induction with methanol in a standard culture tube, the yeast produced and secreted up to 40 μg/ml of the mutant cyclase in the culture medium. A 10-ml culture provides more than enough protein for all of the enzymatic characterizations, and a bioreactor is not needed. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The recombinant wild type cyclase produced as described above was used as antigen. Antibodies against the conserved region of the Aplysia cyclase were also raised using a synthetic peptide, TLEDTLLGYL. Western blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The wild type or mutant cyclase (50–3,000 ng/ml) was incubated (2–120 min) at room temperature with various concentrations of NAD (25–1,000 μm) or nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) (10–2,000 μm) at pH 7.8 buffered by 40 mm Tris-HCl. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 0.12 ml, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS (0.17% final concentration). The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC (BioCad) using either a Poros 10 HQ column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or an AG MP-1 column (6.6 × 150 mm). The resin AG MP-1 was obtained from Bio-Rad. The elution was performed either using a gradient of NaCl (HQ column) or trifluoroacetic acid (AG MP1 column) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The base exchange reaction was similarly assayed at pH 4.5 in the presence of 50 mmnicotinic acid and various concentrations of NADP (20–4,000 μm). Enzyme activities of the wild type and mutant cyclases were measured, each using two or three different protein preparations. The results shown are mean ± S.E. of 9–12 determinations. The V max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots, and the results shown are mean ± S.E. of at least five determinations. Primers for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cyclase cDNA were as follows: 1) CYC-F2, hybridizing to the 5′ region of mature soluble cyclase starting with IVPTR … and also generating an EcoRI restriction site, 5′-CAT GAA TTC ATC GTC CCC ACT CGC-3′ and 2) CYC-R, hybridizing to the 3′ region of cyclase as well as generating a NotI site, 5′-AAT GCG GCC GCG AAA TTG GTA AAG AGC-3′. Amplification was carried out using 0.5 unit of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), 280 μm dNTPs (New England Biolabs), and 0.4 μm primers in a 50.0-μl reaction. The mutations were carried out in two sequential amplification steps. During the first amplification, two fragments were generated. The primer CYC-F2 and an antisense primer for a specific mutation were used to generate one fragment, and the primer CYC-R and a sense primer for the same mutation were used to generate the other. For both of these polymerase chain reactions, the native cyclase sequence served as the template. The two fragments were gel-purified and used for the second amplification, during which the purified fragments served as the templates, and primers CYC-F2 and CYC-R were used to generate the 0.77-kilobase pair cyclase containing the mutation. The mutated cyclase was then gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and NotI, and ligated into a yeast expression vector that we had constructed previously (27Munshi C. Lee H.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Some mutations were done using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene. The kit employs the high fidelity PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and mutant oligonucleotide primers to replicate both strands of the supercoiled plasmid containing the insert. A mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks is generated. Following thermal cycling, the reaction mixture is treated withDpnI endonuclease, which digests hemimethylated parent DNA leaving behind the nicked DNA containing the mutation of interest. Plasmid DNA from most Escherichia coli strains isdam-methylated and can be digested away with theDpnI enzyme. This method eliminates the use of various subcloning procedures necessary to generate mutants. The procedure only takes 7 days, starting from the mutation reaction, to transformingE. coli with the mutated DNA and purifying the resultingSacI-digested DNA for use in yeast transformation. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method. Crystallization conditions for the recombinant cyclase were initially determined and optimized. These conditions were subsequently used to co-crystallize the enzyme with nicotinamide. Co-crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (molecular weight of 4,000) and 0.1 m imidazole buffer (pH 7.5). The crystallization drops contained 2.5 μl of the reservoir solution and 2.5 μl of concentrated protein (OD = 12 at 280 nm). Crystallization trays were stored at 18 °C, and crystals displaying thin rod-shaped morphology with a length typically of 0.5 mm generally appeared within 7 days. x-ray diffraction data were collected from a single co-crystal using the A-1 station (λ = 0.919 Å) at the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS). To reduce radiation damage, the crystal was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to this, the crystal was placed in a cryosolvent containing 22% polyethylene glycol 4000 to prevent ice formation within the crystalline lattice. The diffraction data were collected using the 82 × 82-mm 2 K × 2 K Princeton CCD-based x-ray detector (29Thiel D.J. Ealick S.E. Tate M.W. Gruner S.M. Eikenberry E.F. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1996; 67: 1-4Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The data indexed as a triclinic lattice and extended to 2.4 Å, displaying a very high anisotropic mosaicity, which varied from 1.75 to 3.5°. Data reduction and scaling yielded a partially complete data set with a unit cell of 60.4 × 75.3 × 138.1 Å. The overallR sym for the data set was 6.8%, with the highest resolution shell of 2.6–2.4 Å having a highR sym of 31%. The x-ray structure of the nicotinamide-cyclase complex was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (30Navasa J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-167Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed from the previously determined dimeric structure of ADP-ribosyl cyclase. Because the two cyclase monomers of this dimer were built and refined independently, a modified dimer was constructed using only the chain A monomer truncated at residue 247. Side chain atoms were retained in the search model. Four solutions to the rotation function were found. The translation search using these orientations resulted in the position of four individual dimers in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell. The resulting positions of the four cyclase dimers displayed reasonable crystal packing contacts, suggesting that the solutions were correct. The four molecules were found to be independently positioned within the asymmetric unit lacking noncrystallographic symmetry. This was verified by calculating self-rotation functions using the program GLRF (31Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The best solution according to the AMORE statistics had a correlation coefficient of 42.9 and an R-factor of 41.3. The presence of four dimers in the asymmetric unit results in a favorable Mathews coefficient of 2.59. The four dimers give a total molecular mass of 240 kDa. The solvent content of the crystals is calculated to be 53%. Residues 127–129 were mutated to alanines in each of the eight monomers for subsequent check of the quality and bias of electron density maps to be calculated. X-ray structure factors were calculated using the position of the atoms resulting from the placement of the four dimers in the unit cell, and these resulting structure factors were refined against the measured diffraction data. 5% of the reflections were set aside for calculating the R-free parameter. Rigid body refinement was conducted using the program X-PLOR (32Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and all data between 8 and 3 Å. Because the native monomeric structure is composed of two discrete domains (the N-terminal domain consisting of residues 1–66 and residues 100–150, the C-terminal domain consisting of residues 74–97 and residues 153–250), the refinement was carried out with each domain defined as a rigid body. In addition, rigid body refinement was conducted with each monomer defined as a rigid body. The approach where each monomer was refined as two discrete domains gave the lower R-factor. With an overall B-factor assigned as 20, theR-factor after rigid body refinement was 36.3%. Although no proper NCS relations are present in the crystal structure, each domain of each monomer can be related to that of a reference molecule by translation and rotation. In this manner, strict NCS restraints (weight = 500 kcal/mol-Å2 in X-PLOR) were applied to the domains of all of the monomers, thereby reducing the number of parameters to be refined. Simulated annealing refinement was conducted against all data between 8 and 2.4 Å, resulting in anR-factor of 31.2% (R-free = 34.0%). Including a bulk solvent model and using all data between 20 and 2.4 Å in another cycle of simulated annealing refinement resulted in anR-factor of 28.4% (R-free = 31.6%). Finally, tightly restrained individual B-factor refinement gave an R-factor of 24.6% (R-free = 28.0%). The details of the synthesis were as we have described previously (33Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Kerr J.A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26686-26691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Gurnack M.E. Wong L. Breitinger H.-G.A. Gee K.R. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-azido-3′-AMP was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The resulting 8-azido-[5′-32P]3′-AMP was converted to 8-azido-[5′-32P]AMP using nuclease P1 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and subsequently coupled to β-nicotinamide mononucleotide using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. This procedure produced the radioprobe with high specific activity suitable for photoaffinity labeling (33Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Kerr J.A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26686-26691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Gurnack M.E. Wong L. Breitinger H.-G.A. Gee K.R. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nonradioactive 8-azido-NAD was synthesized by coupling 8-azido-AMP with β-nicotinamide mononucleotide using the same carbodiimide reaction. Wild type or mutant cyclases (0.3 μg) were incubated on ice in 50-μl droplets containing 50 μm[32P]8-azido-NAD (∼530,000 cpm), 0–5 mmβ-NAD, and 0.5 mm α-NAD. The droplets were exposed to 160 mJ of ultraviolet light energy (∼45 s) in a Stratalinker chamber (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Pilot experiments showed that this amount of UV energy produced optimal labeling without detectable protein-protein cross-linking. α-NAD is not a substrate for the cyclase (5Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and was included in all samples to reduce potential nonspecific labeling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity associated with the proteins was measured using a phosphor imager (Packard, Meriden, CT). The phosphor images were collected at 16-bit resolution for quantitative analyses but reduced to 8-bit for printout. We have previously shown that nicotinamide, similar to nicotinic acid, can serve as a substrate for the base exchange reaction (16Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this case, the product is the same as the substrate (NAD or NADP), and the enzyme appeared inhibited. However, the rapid exchange can be readily demonstrated using radioactive substrate (16Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). That nicotinamide is a substrate indicates that it should have affinity for the active site of the cyclase. We thus crystallized the recombinant cyclase with nicotinamide. The structure of the complex was refined using various procedures as described under “Materials and Methods,” giving anR-factor of 24.6% (R-free = 28.0%). Electron density maps calculated from these refined coordinates suggest that there are additional atoms present in the crystal structure. None of the maps were biased by substrate assignments, yet in the initial unaveraged 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps and all subsequent maps, strong peaks appeared where the assignments had been made. Before map averaging, the peaks were around 2.75 ς in theF o − F c map. After 8-fold averaging using the RAVE programs (35Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 91-105Google Scholar), the peaks were as large as 6 ς. In particular, between Glu98 and Trp140there was strong density of the shape of a six-member ring resembling nicotinamide. Fig. 1 A shows the van der Waals contact surface of a cyclase dimer with one monomer coloredlight blue and the other dark blue. Each monomer was a bean-shaped molecule consisting of two domains separated by a central cleft. The two monomers associated with each other in a head-to-head fashion forming a donut-like molecule with a central cavity (24Prasad G.S. McRee D.E. Stura E.A. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have previously shown by chemical cross-linking and dynamic laser light scattering that the cyclase forms dimers in solution as well (25Munshi C. Baumann C. Levitt D. Bloomfield V.A. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The tentative assignment of the bound nicotinamide is shown inyellow in Fig. 1 A. The binding site was in a pocket at the central cleft of the monomer and was very close to the central cavity of the dimer. Nicotinamide was bound to each monomer. The binding pocket of the monomer colored dark blue was not visible, because it was on the other side of the monomer. The cyclase has a stretch of six amino acids (TLEDTL) that are highly conserved with CD38, a homolog that also possesses similar enzymatic activities as the cyclase (10States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). This conserved region formed part of the binding pocket and is shown in orange in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 1 B shows the three amino acids in the binding pocket that were closest to the placement of the bound nicotinamide (yellow) and appeared to complex the bound substrate. These three residues were Trp140 (2.8 Å), Glu98 (3.5 Å), and Asn107 (3.1 Å). The conserved sequence is shown as orange sticks, and Glu98 is part of this sequence. Trp140, although not in the conserved region, is nevertheless conserved among two species of the cyclase and three species of CD38 (24Prasad G.S. McRee D.E. Stura E.A. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Asn107, on the other hand, is not a conserved residue. If these amino acids are indeed responsible for substrate binding, their alteration by site-directed mutagenesis should result in reduction or elimination of the enzymatic activities of the cyclase. Various mutations of the three amino acids closest to the bound nicotinamide were produced, and the resulting mutant cyclases were expressed in yeast as secretory proteins. The yeast media containing the mutant proteins were dialyzed and purified by treatment with an anion exchange resin (DEAE), which removed nondialyzable contaminants in the yeast media. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the preparations of the mutant proteins after the DEAE treatment contained essentially a single protein with molecular weight of about 29,000, similar to that of the wild type protein (Fig.2). Examples of Western analysis of some of the mutant proteins are shown in Fig. 2. All mutant proteins are recognized by the polyclonal antibody against the wild type cyclase. On the other hand, the antibody raised against the conserved peptide (anti-ConPep) recognized the wild type, N107G, and W140G proteins but not the mutant proteins E98L and E98G. Since Glu98 is one of the amino acids in the conserved sequence, its change to leucine or glycine is expected to render the mutant proteins unrecognizable by the antipeptide antibod"
https://openalex.org/W1999947611,"The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U·G mismatches (Gallinari, P., and Jiricny, J. (1996)Nature 383, 735–738) and is named mismatched uracil glycosylase (Mug). It has also been described to remove 3,N 4-ethenocytosine (εC) from εC·G mismatches (Saparbaev, M., and Laval, J. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 8508–8513). We used a mug mutant to clarify the role of this protein in DNA repair and mutation avoidance. We find that inactivation of mug has no effect on C to T or 5-methylcytosine to T mutations in E. coli and that this contrasts with the effect of ung defect on C to T mutations and of vsr defect on 5-methylcytosine to T mutations. Even under conditions where it is overproduced in cells, Mug has little effect on the frequency of C to T mutations. Because uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) and Vsr are known to repair U·G and T·G mismatches, respectively, we conclude that Mug does not repair U·G or T·G mismatches in vivo. A defect inmug also has little effect on forward mutations, suggesting that Mug does not play a role in avoiding mutations due to endogenous damage to DNA in growing E. coli. Cell-free extracts frommug + ung cells show very little ability to remove uracil from DNA, but can excise εC. The latter activity is missing in extracts from mug cells, suggesting that Mug may be the only enzyme in E. coli that can remove this mutagenic adduct. Thus, the principal role of Mug in E. coli may be to help repair damage to DNA caused by exogenous chemical agents such as chloroacetaldehyde. The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U·G mismatches (Gallinari, P., and Jiricny, J.

If unrepaired, uracil can pair with an adenine during replication causing a C to T mutation. For this reason, cells contain uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung), an enzyme that removes the uracil and initiates its replacement with cytosine. The importance of Ung in mutation avoidance is evidenced by the observation that ung strains of Escherichia coli (1Duncan B.K. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 750-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (2Burgers P.M. Klein M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 905-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) accumulate C to T mutations. Cytosines methylated at position 5 similarly deaminate to create T·G mismatches, which are not subject to repair by Ung. In E. coli, a specialized mismatch correction process called very short patch repair corrects these mispairs to C·G (3Lieb M. Bhagwat A.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The key enzyme in this repair pathway is a sequence-specific, mismatch-specific endonuclease, Vsr, which hydrolyzes the phosphodiester linkage preceding the mismatched T (4Hennecke F. Kolmar H. Bründl K. Fritz H.-J. Nature. 1991; 353: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No eukaryotic sequence homologs of this enzyme have been reported; instead a DNA glycosylase is thought to serve the same function (5Wiebauer K. Neddermann P. Hughes M. Jiricny J. Exs (Exper. Suppl.). 1993; 64: 510-522PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme excises thymines from T·G mismatches (6Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and prefers mismatches that are followed by a G·C pairs (7Sibghat U. Gallinari P. Xu Y.Z. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. Jiricny J.

This enzyme, thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG),1 could prevent mutations when 5-methylcytosines within CG dinucleotides deaminate to thymine. The cDNA for TDG was cloned and its sequence was determined (9Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a sequence homolog of this protein was found in E. coli and Serratia marcescence (10Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The investigators who made this observation suggested that the bacterial homolog was a uracil-DNA glycosylase specific for U·G mismatches and named it mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (Mug). Their conclusions were based on properties of truncated forms of TDG, and biochemical assays done using E. coli cell-free extracts. They further suggested that it may act as a backup enzyme for Ung and may be important in avoiding mutations during stationary phase of cell growth (10Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because there was no evidence in previous work by any research group that such a backup enzyme existed, we tested this possibility. For this purpose, we studied the repair of U·G and T·G mismatches inmug + and mug strains. Our results clearly indicate that Mug plays no role in the repair of U·G or T·G mismatches and may repair 3,N 4-ethenocytosine·G mismatches as suggested recently by Sapabaev and Laval (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). JM253.140 (F- araD139 Δ(argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 relA1 deoC1 rbsR22 flhD5301 fruA25 mug::mini-Tn10) was kindly provided by J. Reiss (Princeton University). GM31 (dcm-6 thr-1 hisG4 leuB6 rpsL ara-14 supE44 lacY1 tonA31 tsx-78 galK2 galE2 xyl-5 thi-1 mtl-1) and RP4182 {(flaD-flaP)DE4trp gal rpsL} are from our collection. BH156 is GM31 withung-1 tyrA::Tn10 and was obtained from M. Lieb (University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA). BH161 (BH156 with λ DE3 lysogen) was constructed by A. Beletskii (Wayne State University) using a kit from Novagen (Madison, WI). Construction of BH157 and BH158 is described below. P1vir phage is from our collection. Plasmid pET11-d was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). BH157 and BH158 were constructed by the P1 transduction ofmug::mini-Tn10 from JM253.140 into GM31 and BH156, respectively. LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 5 mm CaCl2 was inoculated with an overnight culture of JMR253.140 and was shaken vigorously at 37 °C for 30 min. P1vir phage was added to the culture at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, and the infected cells were further incubated 37 °C for 3 h with continued shaking. The cells were lysed with chloroform, the culture was centrifuged to clear the cell debris, and the supernatant was removed. The phage in the supernatant was titered and was used to infect GM31 or BH156. For the infection, 10 ml of overnight cultures were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of a buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgSO4. One hundred μl of the suspensions were infected with 10, 50, or 100 μl of the P1 phage, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min without shaking. One hundred μl of 1 m sodium citrate and 1 ml of LB were added to each tube, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Following concentration by centrifugation, the cells were spread on LB plates containing 12 μg/ml tetracycline. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and three colonies from each transduction were studied further. The DNA from these colonies was amplified by PCR using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GATCACCTATCTGCTGGAACAGTACGATCGTG-3′; and primer 2, 5′-CTGTATGTCTGCGATGAATCCGGAATG-3′. The colonies that gave rise to a larger PCR product than mug + cells were chosen for further analysis. The successful transfer ofmug::mini-Tn10 allele was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The region flanking the mug gene in BH156 chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers 1 and 2 mentioned above. The 2.6-kilobase pair PCR product was excised from a low melting point agarose gel and labeled with nonradioactive digoxigenin using the digoxigenin High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Chromosomal DNAs from BH156, BH157, and BH158 were digested with PvuII, and the fragments were separated in 0.7% agarose gel. The DNA was blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with probe labeled with digoxigenin. After treatment with alkaline phosphotase-conjugated antibodies raised against digoxigenin, the membrane was incubated with solution containing the chemiluminescence substrate for the enzyme CSPD and exposed to x-ray film for 1 h. The autoradiograph showed that themug + strain BH156 contains a 3.0-kilobase pairPvuII fragment containing mug, whereas the corresponding fragment in BH157 and BH158 is 6 kilobase pairs. This confirms the disruption of mug in BH157 and BH158. The open reading frame of mug + gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of RP4182 using the following primers: primer 3, 5′-CCCGCTCTATCGCGGATCAGGCGCGCA-3′; and primer 4, 5′-CCCCCCCATGGTTGAGGATATTTTGGCTCCAGGG-3′. The amplification was done with the Pfu DNA polymerase, and the ∼500-base pair PCR product was isolated from a low melting agarose gel. The DNA was digested withNcoI and MboI (compatible with BamHI), and ligated to pET11-d expression vector digested with NcoI and BamHI. Two clones with the expected inserts were picked for further analysis. The plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3), and one transformant from each plasmid was grown in LB medium containing 1 mm IPTG. The cells were broken by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cell-free extract from one of the two clones showed the presence of a new protein of the expected size. This plasmid clone, pF168, was used in further studies. To confirm that pF168 bears a wild-type copy of the mug gene, both strands of the insert were sequenced using the following primers: primer 5, 5′-CTAGTT ATTGCTCAGCGGTGGCAGC-3′; and primer 6, 5′-TATAGGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAAC-3′. The sequence of the cloned mug + was compared with the sequence in the GenBankTM data base (GenBankTM accession number U28379), and the two sequences were identical. The genetic reversion assays were performed as described previously (12Lutsenko E. Bhagwat A.S. Mutat. Res. 1999; 437: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except in the case where the cells carried the plasmid pF168. In this case, E. colistrain (BH161), carrying the overproducer pF168, was electroporated with pAKS2. The latter plasmid contains the kan allele cloned in pACYC184 (13Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Following plating, three independent colonies were picked and grown in 10 ml of LB containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C until theA 550 reached 0.3. One hundred μl of each culture was used to inoculate 10 ml of prewarmed LB containing appropriate antibiotics and 30 μm IPTG. The cells were again grown till A 550 reached 0.3. The cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of LB. Appropriate dilutions of these cultures were spread on LB plates to determine the number of viable cells, and the remaining culture was spread on kanamycin plates to determine the number of revertants. The principal source of variation in mutation frequency data is the existence of mutational “jackpot” (14Luria S.E. Delbrück M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We eliminated such data points from our data sets using the following procedure: the data point suspected of being from a jackpot was set aside and the mean and S.D. of the remaining data points were calculated. If the suspected data point was greater than 3 times the S.D. away from the mean, it was declared to be a jackpot and eliminated from the data set. If the data point was within 3 S.D. of the mean, it was included in the set, and the mean and S.D. of the complete data set were used in further analysis. Appropriate E. colistrains were grown from single colonies in 5 ml of LB for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking. To determine the frequency of 5-fluorocytosine-resistant cells, the cultures were centrifuged to pellet the cells, and the pellets were washed twice in 5 ml of M63 minimal medium. The cells were ultimately resuspended in 1 ml of M63 medium and were spread on LB plates to determine the total number of viable cells. They were also spread on M63 minimal plates supplemented with 0.1% of casamino acids, 10 μg/ml 5-fluorocytosine, and 20 μg/ml each leucine, threonine, and histidine to determine the number of 5-fluorocytosine-resistant cells. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The mutant frequency is the number of 5-fluorocytosine resistant cells divided by the total number of viable cells. To determine frequency of rifampicin-resistant cells, the overnight cultures were centrifuged to pellet the cells, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of LB. The cells were spread on LB plates or LB plates containing 100 μg/ml rifampicin. The mutant frequency is the number of rifampicin-resistant cells divided by the total number of viable cells. Five ml of overnight cultures of the appropriate E. coli strain were used to inoculate 250 ml of LB and grown at 37 °C to an A 550 of 1.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with 50 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 1 mm ETDA. The cells were again harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of the lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm ETDA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were kept on ice for 30 min and sonicated five times with 30-s pulses. Between pulses, they were chilled on ice for 30 s. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 rpm 4 °C, and the supernatant was divided in aliquots. The aliquots were stored at −70 °C. The DNA oligonucleotides containing uracil (oligo vsr-U) or 3,N4-ethenocytosine (εC1) were labeled with32P at the 5′ end and hybridized to the unlabeled oligomer, oligo dcm-94b, at a molar ratio 1:10 to form the duplexes with a single U:G or etheno-C:G mismatch. The duplexes were subjected to treatments with different dilutions of cell-free extracts for 30 min at 37 °C in a treatment buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmEDTA) and then were treated with 0.1 m NaOH or FA-PY glycosylase to cleave at the AP sites for another 30 min at 37 °C. The FA-PY glycosylase protein was purified in collaboration with B. Taffe (Wayne State University). The products were separated in a 20% sequencing gel and identified by autoradiography and by scanning with a phosphorimager. The sequences of the oligos used in these experiments were as follows: vsr-U, 5′-GACTGGCTGCTACUAGGCGAAGTGCC-3′; εC1, 5′-GACTGGCTGCTAC(εC)AGGCGAAGTGCC-3′; and dcm-94b, 5′-GGCACTTCGCCTGGTAGCAGCCAGTC. Duplex DNA containing a U·G mismatch was treated with cell-free extract prepared from ung mug + cells. The DNA was further treated with NaOH to convert the abasic sites created by the extract to strand breaks, and the products were separated on a denaturing gel. The reactions were carried out in pairs, one with the Ung inhibitor UGI (15Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other without the inhibitor. The use of UGI in one reaction assures that any uracil excision activity seen in that reaction must be due to an enzyme other than Ung. The cell extract contained a weak uracil glycosylase activity (Fig.1 A, lane 4) that was resistant to UGI (lane 5). This activity was reproducible and is probably the same activity reported by Gallinari and Jiricny (10Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Compared with this weak activity, the uracil excision activity in extracts prepared from ung + mug + cells was much easier to detect. Whereas 8 μg of cell-free extract from ung cells had barely detectable activity, 38 ng of extract from ung + cells cleaved all the uracil in DNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). The latter activity was completely inhibited by UGI confirming that it was due to Ung. Based on these and other results we conclude that uracil excision activity in E. coli due to Ung is at least 400 times greater than uracil excision due to any other enzyme including Mug. We used a genetic reversion system involving a defective kanamycin resistance gene (13Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to assess the role of Mug in avoiding spontaneous C to T mutations. The reversion to kanamycin resistance results exclusively from C to T mutations at a site for cytosine methylation and either a 5-methylcytosine to T change or C to U to T change can be studied with this system in appropriate genetic backgrounds. T·G and U·G mismatches are, respectively, the intermediates in these mutagenic pathways, and hence any excision of T or U by Mug should reduce C to T mutations. We compared the antimutagenic effects of Mug to those of Ung and Vsr using this assay. The presence of Mug did not affect mutations by either pathway (Table I). Whereas the presence of Ung reduced the reversion frequency by a factor of ∼10, Mug did not significantly affect the frequency. We have previously shown that in a mug + strain, Vsr reduces the frequency of 5-methylcytosine to T mutations by a factor of about 4 (16Bandaru B. Wyszynski M. Bhagwat A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2950-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Mug reduced these mutations only slightly, and this reduction was not statistically significant (Table I).Table IRepair of U·G and T·G mismatchesGenetic backgroundaThe following strains were used in these assays- GM31 (dcm ung +), BH157 (dcm ung+ mug), BH156 (dcm ung), BH158 (dcm ung mug), GM31 with pDCM72 (dcm+ ung+ vsr), and BH157 with pDCM72 (dcm+ ung+ vsr mug).GrowthbThe number of independent cultures used in each experiment is shown in parentheses.Revertant frequencycMean ± S.D.mug +mugdcm ung +Exponential (8)(1.4 ± 0.6) × 10−7(1.1 ± 0.6) × 10−7Stationary (4)(4.2 ± 1.2) × 10−7(4.9 ± 2.1) × 10−7dcm ungExponential (8)(1.7 ± 0.2) × 10−6(2.6 ± 1.3) × 10−6Stationary (6)(5.7 ± 2.4) × 10−6(7.0 ± 2.7) × 10−6dcm+ ung+ vsrExponential (3)(2.1 ± 0.8) × 10−6(1.3 ± 0.6) × 10−6a The following strains were used in these assays- GM31 (dcm ung +), BH157 (dcm ung+ mug), BH156 (dcm ung), BH158 (dcm ung mug), GM31 with pDCM72 (dcm+ ung+ vsr), and BH157 with pDCM72 (dcm+ ung+ vsr mug).b The number of independent cultures used in each experiment is shown in parentheses.c Mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab In the experiments discussed above, cells were dividing at the time of their selection for kanamycin resistance. To assess the role of Mug in stationary phase of cell growth, cells were shaken at 37 °C for ∼24 h and then plated to select for kanamycin-resistant revertants. Growing the cells to stationary phase increased the reversion frequency by a factor of ∼2 compared with growing cells, but there was no significant effect of Mug on the mutant frequencies (Table I). In contrast, the Ung defect again increased the mutant frequency by a factor of approximately 10. Based on these results, we conclude that Mug does not play a significant role in the repair of U·G or T·G mismatches in E. coli. It seemed possible that the inability of mug + ung cells to repair U·G mismatches was due to inadequate expression of Mug in the cells. To see whether overexpression of Mug in the cells can reduce C to T mutations, the mug +gene was cloned in a multicopy plasmid and expressed from a bacteriophage T7 promoter. A plasmid carrying this construct was introduced into mug + ung cells along with the tester plasmid containing the kan gene. The expression of Mug was optimized by varying the concentration of IPTG used to induce the promoter, and the level of Mug in the cells was monitored by gel electrophoresis. The amount of free Mug in the cells increased with IPTG concentration, reaching a maximum between 20 and 100 μm of the inducer (Fig.2). The level of soluble Mug did not increase at higher concentrations of the inducer, probably because Mug tends to aggregate at high concentrations. 2E. Lutsenko and A. S. Bhagwat, unpublished results. The cell viability is also low at concentrations above 40 μm. Consequently, the assays were done at 30 μm IPTG. Cell extracts containing high levels of Mug are able to excise uracils from DNA (Fig. 3, lane 4). In this case, nearly all the uracil was excised from U·G mismatches regardless of the presence of UGI in the reaction (Fig. 3, lane 5). Purified Mug is also able to excise uracil from U·G mismatches (not shown). Surprisingly, induction of mug + had little effect on the frequency of C to T mutations. In one data set there was a slight decrease in mutant frequency as a result of Mug overproduction, but this effect was not reproducible (TableII). The mutant frequencies reported in this table are lower than that in Table I, because in this case thekan gene was on a low copy number plasmid. Induction of the T7 promoter with lower concentrations of IPTG or with 40 μm IPTG also did not affect the mutant frequency (not shown), suggesting that even at high concentrations, Mug cannot effectively substitute Ung to repair U·G mismatches in DNA.Table IIU·G repair in Mug overproducerGenetic backgroundaStrain BH161.

Open table in a new tab We wondered whether Mug could repair endogenous DNA damage other than U·G and T·G mismatches. If this were true, a mug mutation would have a mutator phenotype. We tested this possibility by comparing the frequencies of rifampicin-resistant and 5-fluorocytosine-resistant mutants in mug + and mug strains. The results were largely negative (TableIII). The frequency of rifampicin-resistant mutants was slightly higher in a mugstrain, but the the frequency of 5-fluorocytosine-resistant mutants was the same in the two genetic backgrounds. It is possible that Mug does prevent a small number of mutations and that this is not evident in the 5-fluorocytosine-resistant mutation assay because the background frequency of mutations is high in this assay (Table III). In any case,mug is at best a very weak mutator and hence is unlikely to be important for correcting endogenous damage to DNA in E. coli.Table IIIForward mutation frequenciesGenetic backgroundMutant frequencyaMean ± S.D.Rifampicin resistance5-Fluorocytosine resistancemug +bStrains BH156 (mug +) and BH158 (mug).mug bStrains BH156 (mug +) and BH158 (mug).mug +mugung (3)cThe number of independent cultures used in each experiment is shown in parentheses.(2.4 ± 1.0) × 10−7(6.5 ± 2.9) × 10−7(4.4 ± 1.3) × 10−4(3.4 ± 1.8) × 10−4a Mean ± S.D.b Strains BH156 (mug +) and BH158 (mug).c The number of independent cultures used in each experiment is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab A wide range of chemicals react with bases in nucleic acids to form ethenobases. These chemicals include vinyl compounds, haloaldehydes, α-haloketones, haloalkanes, halothioketenes, halo- ketenes, and products of lipid peroxidation (17Bartsch H. Barbin A. Marion M.J. Nair J. Guichard Y. Drug Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 349-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Guengerich F.P. Drug Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 47-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After the work presented above was completed, Saparbaev and Laval purified a protein from E. coli that removes 3,N 4-ethenocytosine (εC) from DNA and showed that it was Mug (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Purified Mug excised εC from duplex DNA with εC·G pairs, but not from single-stranded DNA. It also excised uracils, but its catalytic efficiency for the removal of εC excision was 50 times higher than for the removal of uracil from U·G mismatches (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the ability of Mug to excise εC from DNA. Cell-free extracts from cells containing overproduction of Mug and purified Mug excised εC from DNA (not shown). We also wanted to find out whether εC removal activities other than Mug existed in E. coli. For this purpose, we used the mug strain described above. When duplex DNA containing a εC·G pair was treated with various cell-free extracts in a manner similar to that described for U·G mispairs, removal of εC was readily detected inmug + extracts (Fig.4). This treatment converted the labeled substrate to shorter products of expected length or products that were ∼1 nucleotide longer or shorter (Fig. 4, lane 2). Although the shorter product is likely to have resulted from the action of an AP endonuclease in the extract to the 5′ side of the abasic site created by Mug, the source of the longer product is not known. Regardless, these results confirm the existence of εC removal activity inE. coli (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extract prepared frommug cells did not possess the ability to create abasic sites at the εC (Fig. 4, lane 3). Thus mug appears to code for the principal εC excision activity in E. coli. We have shown here that although concentrated cell extracts containing Mug can be used to show a small amount of excision of uracils from DNA, this enzyme does not act as a U·G correction enzyme in growing or stationary E. coli. Furthermore, Mug does not appear to play a significant role in repairing any other DNA damage that occurs spontaneously in the cells. Mug is clearly more efficient at excising εC from εC·G pairs, and this may be the only activity of the kind in E. coli. It is surprising that despite its ability to excise uracils from U·G mispairs, overproduction of Mug from a strong T7 promoter does not result in the reduction of C to T mutations (Table II). A possible reason for this apparent inactivity of Mug in vivo is that Mug may aggregate to form inclusion bodies. Consistent with this hypothesis we have found that purified Mug rapidly aggregates to form stable high molecular weight complexes. As a result, very little Mug may be available to repair the mismatches despite overproduction. An alternate possibility is that C to U deaminations mostly occur in single-stranded regions of the genome and that Mug is unable to excise these uracils because of its strict requirement for U·G mismatches. In contrast, Ung acts preferentially on uracils in single-stranded DNA (19Krokan H. Wittwer C.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Leblanc J.P. Martin B. Cadet J. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3477-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and should efficiently repair such uracils. If so, Mug is poorly suited to be a backup enzyme for Ung. At this time, the biological role of Mug in E. coli remains a matter of speculation. If the role is in the removal of εC from DNA—and this is very likely—then the lack of a strong mutator phenotype for mug is not surprising. Defects in genes that code for enzymes that repair alkylated bases also do not have a mutator phenotype. This has been interpreted to mean that there is little alkylation damage to DNA bases in exponentially growing E. coli. By analogy, it is likely that there is very little endogenous εC, or any other damaged base that may be removed by Mug, in E. coli. It is important to note that some of the enzymes involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by exogeneous agents are induced by the damaging treatment. These include the the nucleotide excision proteins and the 3-methyl adenine glycosylase II, AlkA. It would be interesting to know whether mug + is similarly inducible in response to damage to cellular DNA. We are grateful to J. Reiss (Princeton University) for providing a bacterial strain and to A. Beletskii (Wayne State University) for constructing a phage lambda lysogen."

The soaking of the inhibitor into the “binary” crystals was conducted for 4 h using a stabilizing solution containing 5 mm thienodiazaborine and 3 mm NAD+ or NADH. Co-crystallization experiments were conducted in hanging drops, containing 7.5 mg/ml ENR A138G, 1.5 mm NAD+, 0.75 mm thienodiazaborine, 2.25 m NaCl and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, suspended over a well solution containing 4.5 m NaCl and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3. The latter crystals represent a new crystal form (hereafter referred to as form B) and belong to the space group I4122 with cell dimensions a =b = 104.6 Å, c = 284.0 Å and with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data for both the binary complexes as well as for the diazaborine-soaked crystals were collected at room temperature on a twin San Diego multiwire systems (SDMS) area detector with Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source. The data were processed and merged using SDMS software (11Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data for the form B crystal complex were collected from a crystal cooled to 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream device to 2.5 Å on a MAR image plate detector on station 9.6 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source Daresbury Laboratory. A cryoprotectant solution contained 20% glycerol, 3.7m NaCl, 3 mm NAD+, 1.5 mm thienodiazaborine, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3. The data were processed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The starting coordinates were those of the wild type B. napusENR complex with NAD+ (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1eno) or NADH (PDB code 1enp) (14Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Fawcett T. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with Ala138 replaced by Gly, and the cofactor and all waters excluded. These models were used to calculate initial electron density (2F obs −F calc) and (F obs −F calc) maps, which showed readily interpretable electron density either for the reduced or for the oxidized form of the cofactor. In case of the NAD+-complex, the electron density in the region of the nicotinamide ring, its associated ribose, and the pyrophosphate moiety was very weak. The cofactors were incorporated into the respective models, which were then submitted to rounds of restrained positional and isotropic B-factor refinement using the TNT program (15Tronrud D.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), including a correction for the solvent continuum (16Moews P.C. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 201-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The structures were rebuilt where necessary using the FRODO program (17Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-270Crossref Google Scholar). Water molecules were introduced during the course of the refinement at geometrically reasonable positions, but those with the refined value of the B-factor above 70 Å2 were deleted from the coordinate list. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was accomplished using the PROCHECK program (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. For each of the ternary complexes obtained by soaking, the starting coordinates were those of the respective binary complex with the cofactor and all waters excluded. These models were used to calculate initial electron density (2F obs −F calc) and (F obs −F calc) maps, which in both cases clearly showed the position of the diazaborine and a cofactor in the active site of ENR A138G. Both cofactor and inhibitor molecules were incorporated into the models, which were then submitted to the refinement procedure that was essentially the same as described for the binary complexes. Refinement statistics are presented in TableI. Since the crystallization of ENR A138G in the presence of NAD+ and thienodiazaborine led to the appearance of a previously unobserved crystal form (form B), the structure was solved by molecular replacement using a search model based on a dimer of the ternary ENR A138G-NAD+-diazaborine complex, produced by soaking the drug into crystals, with the cofactor, diazaborine, and all waters excluded. Molecular replacement was performed using the AMORE program (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The rotation function yielded one hit that was clearly above the others (α = 39°, β = 90°, γ = 281°). This top hit was then used in a translation search. The top hit from the translation function (TF = 19.7 ς, fractional translation parameters tx = 0.122,ty = 0.596, tz = 0.048) was then rigid-body refined from a starting R-value of 0.41 to 0.35 using data in the range 10–3.5 Å. The resultant electron density maps with coefficients (2Fo − Fc) and (Fo − Fc) at 2.5 Å showed clear density for the NAD+ molecules bound in the active site of each monomer as well as density for the inhibitor. Inspection of electron density maps in the region of the enzyme active site also revealed a substantial conformational change for the part of the chain comprising residues 236–246 in both of the subunits. These residues were moved to the correct positions indicated by an omit map, and the NAD+ and diazaborine molecules were also incorporated into the model. Following restrained positional refinement of the atomic coordinates with all B-factors fixed at 25 Å2, the R-factor of the model dropped to 0.299 for data in the range 10–2.5 Å. From then on, the structure was refined by successive cycles consisting of restrained positional and isotropic B-factor refinement, including a correction for solvent continuum followed by manual rebuilding using the FRODO program. Water molecules were introduced during the course of the refinement at geometrically reasonable positions, but these only retained upon refinement if their B-factors remained below 60 Å2. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The ENR A138G mutant crystallizes in the presence of both the oxidized and reduced forms of the cofactor isomorphously to the corresponding binary wild type enzyme complexes (14Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Fawcett T. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structures of both the binary complexes were solved directly by refinement starting from the corresponding coordinates of the binary complexes of the wild type enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). For both the complexes, the overall protein structure was found to be essentially identical to that of the wild type enzyme and no structural rearrangements were observed in the vicinity of the mutation. Like in the structure of the wild type ENR-NAD+ complex, the electron density for the NAD+ in the mutant enzyme was good for the adenine ring and its associated ribose sugar, very poor for the pyrophosphate moiety, and there was no interpretable density for the nicotinamide moiety and its associated ribose sugar, consistent with the temperature factor for these parts of the cofactor molecule reaching the upper cut-off limit of 100 Å2 during refinement. In the ENR A138G-NADH complex, the density for the entire NADH molecule was readily interpretable, although that for the pyrophosphate moiety was somewhat less well defined. The location and the extended conformation for the NADH molecule with both ribose sugars being in C2′-endoconformation was found to be very similar to that described for the corresponding wild type ENR binary complex (14Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Fawcett T. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structures of ENR A138G with NAD+ and NADH bound shows that the only major difference in the conformation of the protein occurs in the position of the side chain of Tyr32. In the NAD+-bound structure, this residue adopts a well defined conformation and occupies part of the binding pocket for the nicotinamide moiety. In the NADH-bound ENR A138G structure, the side chain of Tyr32 moves so that the volume of the binding pocket increases compared with the complex with NAD+, allowing the reduced nicotinamide ring to occupy the binding site where it is stabilized by van der Waals contact with the edge of the phenolic ring of the tyrosine. This situation is equivalent to the structural change that occurs on NADH versus NAD+ binding with the wild type enzyme. Previous enzyme inhibition assays on E. coli ENR and B. napus ENR A138G (4Kater M.M. Koningstein G.M. Nijkamp H.J.J. Stuitje A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10de Boer G.-J. Pielage G.J.A. Nijkamp N.I.J. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Baldock C. Rice D.W. Stuitje A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which followed the oxidation of NADH in the presence or absence of diazaborine, have been carried out using crotonyl-CoA as a substrate. These kinetic studies showed that, whereas the initial velocity of the reaction was hardly affected by diazaborine, the inhibitory effect increased during the course of the reaction, pointing to the involvement of a reaction product, NAD+, rather than NADH, in the mechanism of diazaborine inhibition. However, our experiments on soaking thienodiazaborine (Fig.1 a) into the “binary” crystals of ENR A138G with NAD+ or NADH produced electron density maps for both complexes, which are qualitatively very similar and show clear electron density for the entire cofactor and the drug in both structures. Thus, binding of diazaborine to the ENR A138G-NAD+ complex has resulted in the ordering on the enzyme surface of those parts of the NAD+ molecule that are disordered in the binary complex. In addition, the movement of Tyr32 associated with localizing the nicotinamide ring, which had previously only been observed in the structure of the binary complex with NADH, was also seen. Analysis of the structure of the complex obtained through soaking crystals of the binary complex with NADH in diazaborine shows no features different from the complex with NAD+ and diazaborine. In both structures, thienodiazaborine stacks onto the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor (Fig. 1b) and makes further van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Tyr188, Met202, Lys206, Ile244, and Ile247 and with the main-chain peptide between Gly138 and Gly140. The boron hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr198. Of considerable importance in stabilizing the diazaborine in the active site are extensive π-π stacking interactions formed between the bicyclic rings of the diazaborine and the nicotinamide ring. The stacking involves only partial overlap of the rings so that the carbamide group of the nicotinamide moiety forms close contact with the adjacent ring system. This stacking interaction is closely related to that observed in theE. coli ENR-NAD+-diazaborine complex (7Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the structures of the B. napus ENR A138G complexes with either the oxidized or reduced form of the cofactor and thienodiazaborine, the boron atom of the drug and the 2′ hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose are clearly covalently linked, and the arrangement of the four atoms closest to the boron is tetrahedral in both the ternary complexes. This is similar to the situation with theE. coli enzyme and indicates that on diazaborine binding, the boron atom undergoes conversion from sp 2hybridization state to sp 3 and forms a covalent bond with the 2′ oxygen of the nicotinamide ribose of either NAD+ or NADH. Superposition of the two ternary complexes based on the overlap of 296 Cα with a root mean square deviation of 0.2 Å shows that, within the limit of the experimental error in the coordinates (0.23 and 0.29 Å for the ENR A138G-NAD+-diazaborine and the ENR A138G-NADH-diazaborine complexes, respectively, as determined by SIGMAA; Ref. 20Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), their structures are essentially identical. Taking into account the results of kinetic studies (4Kater M.M. Koningstein G.M. Nijkamp H.J.J. Stuitje A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 771-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10de Boer G.-J. Pielage G.J.A. Nijkamp N.I.J. Slabas A.R. Rafferty J.B. Baldock C. Rice D.W. Stuitje A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which indicate that diazaborine acts as an inhibitor of the enoyl reductase in the presence of NAD+ and not NADH, the energetics of the formation of these two distinct complexes would be expected to be significantly different. Therefore, at first sight the structural similarity of the B. napus ENR A138G-NAD+-diazaborine and the ENR A138G-NADH-diazaborine complexes is surprising. There are currently two possible explanations for this. First, the structures of the ternary complexes might be very similar, but the difference in the oxidation state of the nicotinamide ring for NAD+ and NADH would result in a distinct difference in the strength of the interactions with the enzyme and diazaborine. Thus, for NAD+, the charge on the nicotinamide ring, the presence of aromaticity, and the loss of the hydride could influence the affinity of the site for diazaborine. In particular, a possible stabilizing feature could be the full negative charge on the boron of the diazaborine interacting with the oxidized nicotinamide ring. If this is the case, then the difference in affinity is not reflected in any dramatic changes in the structure. Indeed, the only difference of the complex with NADH compared with that with NAD+ appears to be an apparent increase of 9 and 14 Å2 in the average temperature factors of the nucleotide and diazaborine molecules, respectively, in the NADH complex (TableI). However, at this stage, we attach little significance to this difference since it is small and the lower resolution of the analysis of the complex with NADH and diazaborine precludes accurate refinement of the temperature factors. The second possibility is more complicated and arises from the presence in most samples of NADH of contaminating quantities of NAD+. In the binary complexes of B. napus ENR A138G, the identity of the respective oxidized or reduced cofactor in the structures can be inferred from the clear difference in the electron density maps and the ordering of the nicotinamide ring in the complex with NADH. However, for the structures of the two ternary complexes, we cannot preclude the possibility that during the soaking of the crystals of the binary ENR A138G-NADH complex in a solution containing diazaborine and NADH, the NADH initially present in the crystal has been exchanged for contaminating NAD+, which, while binding to the enzyme with lower affinity than NADH, could be stabilized by the binding of diazaborine. At the resolution of this study, we cannot expect to distinguish the difference in the structure of the cofactor due to the different nature of the oxidized and reduced states of the nicotinamide ring. Therefore, our current interpretation of the data is complicated by a potential uncertainty concerning the nature of the bound cofactor in the complex with NADH and thienodiazaborine. Further work is needed to clarify this. The search for conditions for co-crystallization of the enzyme with both the cofactor and the inhibitor yielded crystals for the ternary ENR A138G-NAD+-thienodiazaborine complex, that grew from a buffered solution of NaCl. These crystals were found to belong to a different space group (I4122). The structure of the complex was determined by the molecular replacement procedure and revealed that the part of the chain comprising the residues 236–246 is significantly shifted from the position observed in the binary complexes with NAD+ or NADH. In the new crystal form, this loop adopts a regular helical conformation, which forms an additional edge of the diazaborine-binding site and makes it less accessible to the solvent (Fig. 2,a and b). This motion draws the residues Ala240 and Ala241 closer to the diazaborine so that now both their side-chain and main-chain atoms make extensive van der Waals contacts with the edge of the fused rings of the inhibitor. In addition, the hydroxyl of Ser238 now approaches within hydrogen bonding distance of one of the oxygens of the pyrophosphate moiety. Given that diazaborine is thought to mimic the enzyme's natural enoyl substrate (7Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), these findings provide a potential explanation for the strong conservation of the alanine residue at position 240 of B. napus ENR in the aligned sequences of representative enoyl reductases (Fig. 3). Furthermore, at position 238, the ENR sequences show a preference for either serine or threonine, both of which contain a hydroxyl that could interact similarly with the pyrophosphate moiety of the nucleotide cofactor. Overall, this suggests that these two residues are essential for ENR activity and the conformational change of the 236–246 loop seen in the crystal structure of the B. napus ENR A138G-NAD+-thienodiazaborine represents a key step in the enzyme's catalytic cycle. This important structural adjustment, which favors the tight binding of both the cofactor and the inhibitor, was not observed when the ternary complex was produced by soaking diazaborine into the crystals of the binary complex of the mutant enzyme with either reduced or oxidized form of the cofactor. One possible explanation for this is that in the crystal form observed for the binary complexes of B. napus ENR A138G with NADH or NAD+ the loop 236–246 is involved in crystal packing interactions in which the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala241 and peptide nitrogens of Ala241 and Lys242 make hydrogen bonds with the side-chain amide group of Gln70 in a symmetry-related molecule.Figure 2a, ribbon representation of the ENR A138G-NADH binary complex in the region of the active site.

Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reveals that 204 Cα atoms can be overlapped with a root mean square deviation of 0.9 Å (Fig. 2,c and d), indicating the overall similarity of the two enzymes, despite there being only 35% sequence identity between them (9Kater M.M. Koningstein G.M. Nijkamp H.J.J. Stuije A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inspection of the superimposed structures further revealed that the mode of diazaborine binding is remarkably similar, with a large number of conserved residues involved in interaction with diazaborine in B. napus ENR A138G and in E. coliENR (in parentheses) as follows: Gly138(Gly93), Tyr188 (Tyr146), Tyr198 (Tyr156), Met202(Met159), Lys206 (Lys163), Ile244 (Ile200), and one conservative amino acid substitution (Ile247 (Phe203)) (Fig.2 d). The most noticeable difference between the two structures concerns the position of the 236–246 loop in B. napus ENR A138G and the corresponding loop 192–202 in theE. coli wild type enzyme. In the structure of the E. coli ENR complex with NAD+, this loop is completely disordered (21Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rice D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1529-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas in the co-crystal of the E. coliENR with NAD+ and thienodiazaborine it is observed in a well defined position in one of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit. A comparison of the latter structure with that of the co-crystal of B. napus ENR A138G with NAD+ and diazaborine shows that the 236–246 loop in the B. napus enzyme and the 192–202 loop in the E. coli enzyme adopt different conformations (Fig. 2 c). In contrast to the situation in theB. napus ENR A138G complex with NAD+ and diazaborine, where strongly conserved residues Ser238 and Ala240 make contacts with the NAD+ and inhibitor molecules, the equivalent residues in the structure of theE. coli complex (Thr194 and Ala196) make no such contacts. However, recent further refinement of the structures of the diazaborine complexes of E. coliENR 2C. W. Levy and J. B. Rafferty, personal communications. has revealed that the two subunits in the asymmetric unit of these crystals adopt different conformations for the 192–202 loop, one of which is closely related to the helical loop structure seen in the B. napus ENR A138G. Together, these data suggest that the flexibility of this part of the structure is essential for the enzyme's function. Furthermore, close contacts of the inhibitor and the strongly conserved residues Ser238 and Ala240 seen in the structure ofB. napus ENR A138G co-crystallized with NAD+ and thienodiazaborine suggest that the helical loop conformation is more likely to represent a catalytically important conformation than that previously reported for the E. coli enzyme. A proposed catalytic mechanism for enoyl ACP reduction by B. napus ENR involves hydride transfer from the C4 position of NADH to the C3 carbon atom of the enoyl moiety of the substrate followed by donation of a proton to the oxygen of the resultant enolate anion from the side chain of Tyr198 (14Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Fawcett T. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lys206 is thought to be a second catalytic residue, whose amino group might stabilize the negatively charged transition state. Analysis of arrangement of the key residues around the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor in the ENR active site and the mode of diazaborine binding to ENR allows us to propose a model for the binding of the natural enoyl substrate. In this model (Fig. 2, e and f), the acyl chain of enoyl ACP is placed above the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor in such a way that the double bond reduced by ENR during catalysis (between the C2 and C3 positions in the enoyl moiety of the substrate) lies over and parallel to the C4-C5 double bond in the nicotinamide ring, with the carbonyl group and the C2, C3, and C4 atoms of the enoyl moiety lying in the plane of the aromatic bicyclic ring of diazaborine. The angle formed between the C3 atom of the enoyl moiety of the substrate and the C4 and N1 atoms of the nicotinamide ring is close to 100°. With this arrangement of the modeled enoyl moiety of the substrate and the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, the geometry requirements for hydride attack on the natural enoyl substrate are fulfilled (24Burgi H.W. Dunitz J.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 153-161Crossref Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 25Wilkie J. Williams I.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 1559-1567Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The proposed position of the carbonyl oxygen atom of the enoyl moiety is close to that of the boron atom in diazaborine and implies formation of the hydrogen bonds with both the 2′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose and the phenolic oxygen of catalytic Tyr198. In this mode of binding of the substrate, the pantetheine moiety, covalently attached to the C1 atom of the enoyl moiety of the substrate, would fit into the tunnel formed by the protein residues 139–140, 202, and 240–244 and the atoms of the nicotinamide ribose. Although the conformation of the pantetheine arm of the substrate cannot be unambiguously defined in this model, the general similarity of the substrate to diazaborine strongly suggests that, in the enzyme-substrate complex, the 236–246 loop might adopt a closely related helical conformation, stabilizing the substrate bound to ENR through van der Waals contacts.

In recent years, dynamic palmitoylation of G protein α subunits and of their cognate receptors has attracted considerable attention. However, very little is known concerning the acylation/deacylation cycle of the proteins in relation to their activity status. In particular, the relative contribution of the activation and desensitization of the signaling unit to the regulation of the receptors and G proteins palmitoylation state is unknown. To address this issue, we took advantage of the fact that a fusion protein composed of the stimulatory α subunit of trimeric G protein (Gαs) covalently attached to the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as a carboxyl-terminal extension (β2AR-Gαs) can be stimulated by agonists but does not undergo rapid inactivation, desensitization, or internalization. When expressed in Sf9 cells, both the receptor and the Gαs moieties of the fusion protein were found to be palmitoylated via thioester linkage. Stimulation with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol led to a rapid depalmitoylation of both the β2AR and Gαs and inhibited repalmitoylation. The extent of depalmitoylation induced by a series of agonists was correlated (0.99) with their intrinsic efficacy to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity. However, forskolin-stimulated cAMP production did not affect the palmitoylation state of β2AR-Gαs, indicating that the agonist-promoted depalmitoylation is linked to conformational changes and not to second messenger generation. Given that, upon activation, the fusion protein mimics the activated receptor-G protein complex but cannot undergo desensitization, the data demonstrate that early steps in the activation process lead to the depalmitoylation of both receptor and G protein and that repalmitoylation requires later events that cannot be accommodated by the activated fusion protein.

Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This thioesterification of cysteine residues by palmitate distinguishes itself from other lipid modifications such as prenylation and myristoylation by its reversibility. Indeed, in contrast to myristoyl and prenyl moieties that are added co-translationally and generally remain attached to the proteins until the protein gets degraded, the protein-bound palmitate is added post-translationally and turns over more rapidly than the protein itself (2Omary M.B.

Moreover, the palmitoylation state of several proteins has been shown to be dynamically regulated. In particular, biological regulation of the palmitoylation state of heterotrimeric G proteins and of their cognate receptors has been demonstrated (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M.

Activation of Gαs1 through receptor stimulation, following direct activation with aluminum fluoride and cholera toxin or as a result of site-directed mutagenesis, has been shown to lead to an increased incorporation of [3H]palmitate into Gαs during pulse labeling experiments. Because pulse-chase labeling experiments clearly indicated that stimulation increased the depalmitoylation rate, the enhanced incorporation was attributed to an accelerated turnover rate of the Gαs-bound palmitate (10Mumby S.M.

Interestingly, Joneset al. (8Jones T.L. Degtyarev M.Y. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found that, despite the increased turnover rate, activation of Gαs did not significantly affect its stoichiometry of palmitoylation, thus challenging the notion that stimulation ultimately favors the depalmitoylation reaction (12Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) has also been shown to increase the amount of covalently attached [3H]palmitate (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a result of an increased turnover rate of the receptor-bound palmitate (7Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15923-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A similar agonist-promoted increase in the turnover rate of receptor-bound palmitate was observed for the α2AAR (13Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31915-31922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the D2-dopamine receptor (14Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M. Dennis M. Brann M.R. George S.R. J.

Biophys. 1997; 340: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Biologically regulated changes in the palmitoylation state of either receptors or G proteins may have important functional consequences. For example, mutations that prevent palmitoylation of various Gα subunits have been found to inhibit their association with the plasma membrane and thus their signaling function (15Grassie M.A. McCallum J.F.

Palmitoylation of Gαs has also been reported to increase its affinity for Gβγ (19Iiri T. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) acylation reactions have been proposed for Gα, whereas an enzyme that can catalyze the depalmitoylation of Gα proteins has recently been identified (35Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which activation of the signaling pathway could control the acylation/deacylation cycle remain unknown. Analysis of the effects of stimulation on the palmitoylation status of receptors and G proteins is complicated by several factors (for a review, see Ref. 36Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These include the fact that, following the initial conformational changes and protein-protein interactions that are promoted by receptor stimulation, multiple processes that limit the extent of the activation and contribute to signal termination come rapidly into play. It follows that it is difficult to temporally distinguish between the early events that lead to activation from the ones involved in rapid desensitization of the signaling system. This is an important problem because these two sets of events could theoretically have opposite effects on the palmitoylation reaction. Indeed, on a time scale that is virtually indistinguishable from that of the activation of the G proteins, stimulation of the receptors leads to their progressive functional inactivation. This desensitization results largely from agonist-promoted phosphorylation, uncoupling, and internalization of the receptors (37Benovic J.L. Bouvier M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 405-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 38Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochemical J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Internalization of the G proteins has also been suggested to contribute to desensitization of the signaling unit (39Svoboda P. Milligan G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Drmota T. Novotny J. Kim G.D. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. Svoboda P. J. Biol.

Logsdon C. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In an effort to distinguish between the effects of activation and desensitization on receptor and G protein palmitoylation, we took advantage of a β2AR-Gαs fusion protein that can be activated but not desensitized, internalized, or down-regulated (44Bertin B. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Recept. Chann. 1997; 5: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The pharmacological properties of such receptor-G protein fusion constructs has recently attracted considerable attention and many of their properties have been recently reviewed (46Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 47Milligan G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The agonist-bound β2AR-Gαs fusion protein presumably mimics an early intermediate in the normal activation cycle. Also of interest to the present study is the fact that complete physical dissociation between the receptor and Gαs, which normally follows the initial stimulatory interaction, is not permitted in the fusion protein. These features of the fusion protein allow study of the effects of early activation events on the palmitoylation state of the receptor and G protein independently of those resulting from the inactivation processes. Furthermore, the use of fusion protein restricts the analysis to those receptors and G proteins that did physically interact in the course of the experiment. We report that stimulation of β2AR-Gαs with β-adrenergic agonists promotes rapid depalmitoylation and inhibits repalmitoylation of both the receptor and the Gα subunit. This contrasts with the facilitated repalmitoylation that is observed when the two proteins are expressed individually and suggests that early events in the activation process lead to the depalmitoylation of the two proteins, whereas later deactivation mechanisms, that do not occur for the fusion protein, are required for the repalmitoylation reaction. Grace's insect medium, lactalbumin, yeastolate, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, fungizone, pluronic acid, and phosphate-buffered saline were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Immunocorp. [125I]CYP, [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]cAMP, and (9,10)-[3H]palmitate were purchased from Mandel.

The recombinant c-Myc-β2AR baculovirus was generated by subcloning the cDNA of a c-Myc-tagged human β2AR (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the pJVELTZ recombination plasmid (InVitrogen). The pBacPAK-pHIS-β2AR-Gαs was constructed by inserting in phase the Klenow-filled NcoI-SalI cDNA fragment of the fusion protein β2AR-Gαs (45Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D.

The viruses were then produced by homologous recombination in Sf9 cells according to standard procedures (52O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus encoding the β2AR-Thr-Gαs construct was generated as described previously (53Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Gether U. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following infection of Sf9 cells with the appropriate viruses, expression of β2AR and β2AR-Gαs was assessed by radioligand binding assays and Western blot analysis. Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace's supplemented media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.001% pluronic acid in spinner flasks (Bellco Glass) at 27 °C. Cells (2 × 106/ml) were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection varying between 2 and 5 for 48 to 72 h. [3H]Palmitate labeling was then carried out in cells expressing the β2AR or β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins. Cells were harvested and placed in serum-free medium for 1 h prior to the start of metabolic labeling. [3H]palmitate dissolved in a minimal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide was then added (100 μCi/millions of cells), and the cells were incubated at 27 °C in the presence or absence of β-adrenergic ligands for various periods of time as described previously (7Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15923-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In some experiments, labeling was allowed to proceed for 45 min before β-adrenergic ligands were added. Labeling was stopped by chilling the reaction on ice. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 20 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and the following protease inhibitors: 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine. Cells were disrupted by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged 5 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pelleted membranes were then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and protease inhibitors (solubilization buffer). Solubilization was carried out for 90 min at 4 °C, and solubilized receptors were purified as described below. Alprenolol-Sepharose affinity purification matrix was synthesized according to the method of Benovic et al. (54Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This matrix was used to purify the Sf9-derived β2AR, β2AR-Gαs, and β2AR-Thr-Gαs as described previously (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity purified preparations were concentrated using Centriprep and Centricon cartridges (Amicon), and the amount of β2AR, β2AR-Gαs, or β2AR-Thr-Gαs in each sample was determined by [125I]CYP soluble radioligand binding assay as described elsewhere (55Bouvier M. Hnatowich M. Collins S. Kobilka B.K. De Blasi A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 133-139PubMed Google Scholar). For hydroxylamine treatment, purified β2AR or β2AR-Gαs was mixed to an equal volume of 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, containing or not 1m NH2OH and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage was carried out following a protocol described by Luo et al. (56Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, affinity purified β2AR-Gαs were separated by SDS-PAGE in nonreducing condition. The proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. The band corresponding to β2AR-Gαs was cut out and the strip submerged in 500 μl of 70% (v/v) formic acid. The cleavage reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 5 m CNBr in acetonitrile. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 180 min at room temperature in the dark. The thrombin cleavage of the β2AR-Thr-Gαs construct was carried out on affinity purified fusion protein using 10 NIH units/ml of thrombin from human placenta in the solubilization buffer containing only 0.03%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside for 30 min at room temperature. Affinity purified β2AR, β2AR-Gαs, β2AR-Thr-Gαs, β2AR-Gαs cleaved with CNBr, or β2AR-Thr-Gαs cleaved with thrombin were resolved on nonreducing (or mildly reducing, 10 mmdithiothreitol, when specified) 10–15% slab gels containing 6m urea. The gels were then fixed, incubated in Enlightning (DuPont), or in 1 m salicylic acid, dried, and exposed to DuPont REFLECTION™ films from 10 to 60 days at −80 °C. Fluorograms were scanned and digitized (Hewlett Packard laser scanner), and densitometric analysis was carried out using the NIH Image program. When Western blot analyses were performed, aliquots of the samples were loaded in parallel gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The β2AR-Thr-Gαs and β2AR moiety of the fusion protein were first visualized using the Flag M2 antibody (dilution 1:10,000) and the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent plus (Mandel). The same membrane was then stripped using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.2 (57Legocki R.P. Verma D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and reprobed, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl-terminal portion of Gαs subunit (dilution 1:8, 500) (a generous gift of Dr. A. D. Strosberg, Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire, Paris), to reveal the β2AR-Thr-Gαs and Gαs moiety of the fusion protein. Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant β2AR or β2AR-Gαs baculoviruses were harvested and rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the membranes were prepared according to Mouillac et al. (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane suspensions were added to obtain a concentration of 2–10 μg/ml in a final volume of 500 μl of 75 mm Tris, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA containing a saturating concentration (250 pm) of the radiolabeled β-adrenergic antagonist [125I]CYP. Nonspecific binding was determined as the residual binding observed in the presence of 10 μmalprenolol. Binding reactions carried out at room temperature for 90 min were stopped by rapid filtration over glass-fiber filters. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined in membrane preparations according to the method of Salomonet al. (58Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Activities were determined in the presence or absence of the following activators: 1 μm isoproterenol, 10 μm alprenolol, 10 μmdichloroisoproterenol, or 100 μm forskolin. Data were expressed as picomoles of cAMP produced per min per mg of protein. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard (59Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Fig.1 illustrates the two fusion protein constructs between β2AR and Gαs(β2AR-Gαs and β2AR-Thr-Gαs) that were used in the present study. Infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding either of the two β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins conferred both β2AR binding (data not shown) and β-adrenergic-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities (Fig.2) confirming that, as observed in mammalian systems (44Bertin B. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Recept. Chann. 1997; 5: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer. 1997; 71: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the fusion proteins are synthesized, translocated to the plasma membranes, and functional. Also in agreement with what was observed in mammalian systems, sustained stimulation of β2AR-Gαs with an agonist does not promote any desensitization of the β-adrenergic-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. This is in sharp contrast with the rapid desensitization observed in Sf9 cells expressing the wild type β2AR. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2, pretreatment of β2AR expressing cells with 1 μmisoproterenol for 30 min reduced the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by 23% without significantly affecting the basal activity, thus leading to a desensitization of 40% of the net agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. The same treatment was without effect on the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells expressing the β2AR-Gαsfusion protein. Agonist pre-treatment for as long as 24 h was also unable to promote any desensitization of the fusion protein. This characteristic of β2AR-Gαs was interpreted by Bertin et al. (44Bertin B. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Recept. Chann. 1997; 5: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar) as an indication that the covalent complex can become activated but does not enter the deactivation path upon agonist stimulation. This contention is also supported by the observation that the formation of the nucleotide-sensitive high affinity state for agonist can be readily observed for β2AR-Gαs in both mammalian (44Bertin B. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Recept. Chann. 1997; 5: 41-51PubMed Google Scholar) and Sf9 (49Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Membrane preparations derived from Sf9 cells infected with the wild type human β2AR or the β2AR-Gαsrecombinant baculoviruses were used to measure the adenylyl cyclase activity. The activity was determined in the presence of vehicle (control) (CTL) or 1 μm of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO). To determine the extent of agonist-promoted desensitization, membranes were prepared from cells pretreated (hatched bars) or not (dotted bars) with 1 μm isoproterenol for 30 min. Receptor expression level as assessed by [125I]CYP binding was: 8.9 ± 2 and 2.8 ± 1.1 pmol/mg of protein for β2AR and β2AR-Gαs, respectively, and was not affected by the agonist pre-treatment. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of five independent experiments. * indicates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It follows that β2AR-Gαs provides a convenient model to study the early events involved in the activation of the β2AR-Gs complex without the confounding effects of the regulatory events leading to deactivation. This may be particularly important when considering that, following their initial activating interaction, the receptor and Gαs may be targeted to distinct cellular compartments upon dissociation. Therefore, β2AR-Gαs allows study of the early events linked to the activation of a single G protein by a unique receptor molecule at equimolar ratio in a common cellular compartment. Based on the premises described above, we undertook study of the dynamics of β2AR-Gαs palmitoylation and the effect of agonist activation on the palmitoylation state of this complex. As shown in Fig. 3, metabolic labeling of Sf9 cells expressing either β2AR or β2AR-Gαs led to the incorporation of [3H]palmitate in the two proteins. The major radiolabeled bands of ∼45 and ∼96 kDa obtained following alprenolol-Sepharose affinity purification corresponded to the expected molecular masses for the β2AR and β2AR-Gαs, respectively, when expressed in Sf9 cells (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular species with identical electrophoretical mobilities were detected in Western blot analysis using anti-β2AR and anti-αs antibodies (data not shown), thus confirming the identity of the fusion protein. In Fig. 3 A, identical numbers of β2AR and of β2AR-Gαs, as assessed by radioligand binding, were loaded but densitometric analysis revealed around 1.7 times higher [3H]palmitate incorporation into the β2AR-Gαs than β2AR, consistent with the fact that two palmitoylation sites are present in the fusion protein as compared with only one in the receptor. Fig.3 B illustrates the sensitivity of the labeling to hydroxylamine treatment, indicating that the [3H]palmitate was covalently attached to both β2AR and β2AR-Gαs via thioester bonds. To assess the effect of receptor stimulation on the dynamics of palmitoylation, pulse labeling experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of agonists for periods varying between 5 and 60 min. In the absence of agonist, incorporation of palmitate into β2AR-Gαsincreased almost linearly for the first 30 min of labeling and remains stable thereafter (Fig. 4). The presence of isoproterenol during the labeling period greatly inhibited the incorporation of [3H]palmitate in the fusion protein. This unexpected result contrasts sharply with the agonist-promoted increase in palmitate incorporation observed on β2AR and Gαs when these proteins are expressed individually (5Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T. Bouvier M.

For the β2AR and Gαs expressed separately, the increase in palmitate turnover was linked to a faster rate of depalmitoylation upon agonist stimulation (7Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15923-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The apparent increase in [3H]palmitate incorporation was thus attributed to a concomitant acceleration of the repalmitoylation reaction. It follows that the agonist-promoted reduction of [3H]palmitate incorporation into the β2AR-Gαs fusion protein could result from a slower depalmitoylation or reflect an inhibition of the repalmitoylation reaction. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate in the absence of agonist. Following a 45-min pulse period, corresponding to the period required to attain steady state labeling, isoproterenol was added or not in the continued presence of [3H]palmitate and incubated for an additional 5 or 15 min. As seen in Fig. 5, incubation with isoproterenol rapidly reduced the extent of β2AR-Gαs palmitoylation, thus suggesting that agonist stimulation promotes its rapid depalmitoylation and that repalmitoylation of the active complex cannot occur. This is in sharp contrast with the increased repalmitoylation that is observed when identical treatment is carried out in cells expressing the wild type β2AR as an individual protein (Fig. 5 B). Because the β2AR-Gα2 fusion protein can be activated but that later processes of inactivation such as G protein dissociation, desensitization, or internalization do not occur, it could be hypothesized that early events leading to activation of the receptor-G protein complex promote depalmitoylation but that later processes are required for repalmitoylation. The fact that the depalmitoylation and repalmitoylation reactions may occur with very similar kinetics when the β2AR and Gαs are expressed as individual proteins may explain why Jones et al. (8Jones T.L. Degtyarev M.Y. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) did not observe any change in the stoichiometry of palmitoylation of Gαs upon activation despite the universally observed increase in the turnover rate of the Gαs-bound palmitate. The stabilization of the activated receptor-G protein complex using β2AR-Gαsallowed isolation of the effects that resulted solely from the activation process. The effect of β-adrenergic ligands of various levels of intrinsic activity was then assessed on the palmitoylation of β2AR-Gαs. As shown in Fig.6, the addition of all ligands caused a significant reduction in the incorporation of the labeled fatty acid into β2AR-Gαs. Interestingly, the extent of the decrease in labeling was directly correlated (r 2 = 0.992) to the intrinsic activity of the compounds toward β2AR-Gαs as assessed in a membrane adenylyl cyclase assay (Fig. 6 B). However, direct stimulation of cAMP production by forskolin did not affect the palmitoylation of β2AR-Gαs (Fig.6 C), thus suggesting that the agonist-promoted depalmitoylation is linked to conformational changes imposed by the agonists and not to second messenger generation. Cysteine 341 of β2AR and cysteine 3 of Gαs, corresponding to position 358 and 428 in β2AR-Gαs, respectively, represent the confirmed palmitoylation sites of these two proteins (20O'Dowd B.F.

Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the experiments described above, palmitoylation of β2AR-Gαs was studied as a whole with no specific consideration of the individual palmitoylation sites. To determine whether the two sites were indeed palmitoylated and to assess if agonist treatment had similar effects on the palmitoylation state of the two proteins, we took advantage of another fusion protein construct in which a thrombin cleavage site was engineered between the receptor and Gαs (β2AR-Thr-Gαs; see Fig. 1). As a control, thrombin treatment was performed on wild type β2AR without any effect on the palmitoylation state nor the integrity of the receptor (data not shown). Fig.7 A shows that thrombin treatment of the purified fusion protein, following metabolic labeling, generated two labeled proteins corresponding to the expected mobility for β2AR and Gαs, indicating that the two proteins were palmitoylated within the fusion construct. The identity of the cleaved fragments was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using the anti-αs antibody to detect Gαsand the anti-Flag M2 antibody to detect the Flag epitope-bearing β2AR. The apparently higher [3H]palmitate incorporation observed into the β2AR band when compared with Gαs most likely reflects the presence of some background labeling observed in this region of the gel even in the absence of thrombin. As previously observed for β2AR-Gαs, the presence of isoproterenol during the metabolic labeling induced a significant reduction of the [3H]palmitate incorporation into β2AR-Thr-Gαs. Thrombin cleavage revealed that the overall decrease in the radiolabeling of the fusion protein was the consequence of a reduction of [3H]palmitate incorporation into both the receptor and Gαs. The agonist-induced Gαsdepalmitoylation that we observed could be mediated, in part, by the receptor-promoted dissociation of βγ subunits from the activated fusion protein. Indeed, as reported by Iiri et al.(19Iiri T. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14592-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), βγ did protect GDP-bound αs but not αs-GTP[γS] from depalmitoylation by a recombinant esterase. Because, nonreducing SDS-PAGE conditions could lead to aggregation of some proteins, including the receptor, reducing conditions were also used. As shown in Fig. 7 B, identical results were obtained when receptor and Gαs were resolved under mildly reducing conditions (10 mm dithiothreitol) that diminished aggregation and promoted only partial chemical depalmitoylation. Palmitoylation of both receptor and Gαs and the effect of isoproterenol on the two proteins was further confirmed using CNBr hydrolysis of the 3H-palmitoylated β2AR-Gαs construct. The primary sequence of β2AR-Gαs containing 18 methionines, complete cleavage should generate 19 fragments (Fig.8 A). Given that the two palmitoylation sites are located on two distinct fragments, two peptides distinguishable by their size are expected to be3H-palmitoylated. Calculated masses for the expected palmitoylated fragments are 16.4 and 7.2 kDa corresponding to the β2AR- and the Gαs-derived peptides, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 B, CNBr treatment yielded two peptides of the expected electrophoretic mobility, confirming that both the receptor and Gαs were palmitoylated within the fusion protein. The difference in the labeling intensity of the two bands most likely results from quantitatively different elution and recovery of the two fragments from the nitrocellulose membrane during the hydrolysis. Weakly labeled bands at 21 and 44 kDa represent partial cleavage products. Addition of isoproterenol following a 45-min pulse labeling with [3H]palmitate promoted the depalmitoylation of both the 16.4 and 7.2 kDa fragments, confirming once more that agonist activation favored the depalmitoylation of both the receptor and Gαs. Taken together, the data presented in this study show that the initial events leading to activation of the β2AR-Gαs complex promote the rapid depalmitoylation of both receptor and Gαs and that sustained activation prevents repalmitoylation occurring. The extent of depalmitoylation is directly proportional to the intrinsic activity of the agonist and most likely depends on conformational changes and protein-protein interactions that are stabilized by the activating ligands. Also, this study demonstrates for the first time that depalmitoylation and repalmitoylation occur during distinct phases of the receptor-G protein activation/inactivation cycle. Further studies are now required to determine how receptor activation leads to depalmitoylation of the receptor-G protein complex and why deactivation is required for repalmitoylation to occur. In particular, the role played by the newly characterized acyl-protein thioesterase (35Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) in the activation driven depalmitoylation will need to be assessed."

When isolated, specific domains of FN display activities not exhibited by the intact molecule. For example, the central cell binding domain of FN (FN 120) induces rabbit synovial fibroblasts (1Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J.

Another function recently attributed to FN is protection against programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Apoptosis is generally characterized by cell rounding, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation and by signaling pathways that activate a cascade of cell death proteases. Intact FN as a substrate for cell adhesion can rescue cells from apoptosis, although it is not known whether specific domains of FN regulate this function. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of FN seems to involve integrin-mediated signaling and activation of the focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) (10Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This difference in utilization of pp125FAK as the signaling molecule may depend on cell type. We tested the hypothesis that specific domains of FN are important in protecting fibroblasts from undergoing apoptosis. Specifically, we tested the roles of the high affinity heparin-binding domain and the alternatively spliced V region of FN in this process. Primary cultures of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were routinely obtained from human teeth extracted from patients undergoing therapeutic removal of third molars or orthodontic treatment. To obtain cells, the periodontal ligament (PDL) was scraped from the midroot section of extracted teeth with a scalpel blade using standard protocols (2Kapila Y.L. Kapila S. Johnson P.W. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The tissue was placed under a coverslip and kept in culture medium (α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone) until cells grew out of the explant and covered the bottom of the tissue culture plate. Once the cells became confluent, they were trypsinized and passaged. Cells from passages 2 to 6 were used for all experiments. Five different PDL cell isolates derived from five different patients were used for these experiments. Four recombinant FN proteins were tested in these experiments (see Fig. 1). These proteins, described elsewhere (15Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), either included (V+) or excluded (V−) the alternatively spliced V region and contained either an unmutated (H+) or mutated, nonfunctional high affinity heparin binding domain (H−). In brief, the heparin binding domain was mutated and rendered nonfunctional by changing two arginines (Arg-6 and Arg-7) to threonines (Thr-6 and Thr-7) in the heparin binding consensus sequence (16Bober-Barkalow F.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found in type III-13 of FN. All four proteins also contained the arginine, glycine, aspartic acid (RGD) cell binding site and the alternatively spliced EIIIA domain of FN. These proteins were designated as V−H+, V−H−, V+H+, and V+H−. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted under centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in culture medium (serum-free α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). For experiments, the four recombinant FN proteins were either added to the wells immediately before cells were plated (see Fig. 2 A only) or added approximately 2 h after cell spreading, yielding a final protein concentration of 0.1 mm. Unless otherwise specified, cells were plated in 100 μl of medium at a density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. Cell shape changes were generally assessed by photography at 400× magnification 2 h after cells were plated with the recombinant proteins. To test the effect of the V+H− protein as a coated substrate, wells in a 96-well tissue culture plate were precoated with 0.1 mmV+H− or V+H+ proteins or PBS control overnight and rinsed with PBS the next day, before cells were plated as described above. In experiments testing whether the V+H−protein could induce cells that had already spread to round up, the V+H− protein was added in culture medium 1.5 and 2.5 h after cell spreading on plastic, intact FN (30 μg/ml plasma FN, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), collagen type I (5, 10, and 50 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or vitronectin (22 and 44 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). In experiments testing whether plasma FN could reverse the phenotype triggered by the V+H− protein, the medium containing the protein was replaced with medium containing 0.1 mm FN. The FN-containing medium was added 2 h after adding V+H−. For ICE (caspase-1) and caspase-3 inhibitor experiments, the V+H− protein and inhibitors (ICE Inhibitor III: acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-acyloxymethylketone; caspase-3 inhibitor III: acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-carboxymethylketone; Calbiochem) were added simultaneously immediately before cell plating. The inhibitors were used at concentrations of 2.5, 1.25, 0.125, and 0.0125 μg/ml. Cell shape changes for the caspase inhibitor experiments were photographed 5 or 6 h after plating. Cells were fixed for nuclear staining after 6 and 14 h of incubation time. DNA fragmentation was assayed after 14 h of incubation. To identify the receptor(s) triggering V+H−-mediated apoptosis, several blocking experiments were performed. To evaluate the possible role of the integrin α4, α5, and αv subunits in this mechanism, blocking antibodies (0.1 mg/ml for clones P4G9 (anti-α4), P1D6 (anti-α5), and P3G8 (anti-αv), Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to these subunits were incubated with prespread cells for 1 h, and then cells were treated with V+H− or V+H+ to determine whether apoptotic cell shape changes could be reversed. Before testing on cells, the blocking antibodies anti-α4 and -α5 were first dialyzed against 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS using the Tube-O-Dialyzer (1-kDa cut-off, Chemicon) to remove sodium azide from the antibody packaging solution. To determine the possible role of proteoglycans, cells in suspension were first pretreated with glycosaminoglycan digestive enzymes (0.04 units of chondroitinase ABC, 0.5 units of heparinase I, and 0.2 units of heparitinase I/heparinase III, Sigma) for 30 min. Then cells were plated and allowed to spread for approximately 1.5 h before being treated with V+H− or V+H+. In addition, prespread cells were treated with various glycosaminoglycans (2 μg/μl chondroitin sulfate A sodium salt from bovine trachea, 2.5 μg/μl heparan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa, and 4 μg/μl heparin low molecular weight sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa; Sigma) for 1 h and then with V+H− or V+H+to determine whether apoptotic cell shape changes could be reversed. Nuclear staining of DNA was used to assess the quality of the nucleus in cells incubated with the recombinant FN proteins or with control medium in 16-well chamber slides for 6 or 14 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with ice cold 100% methanol for 15 min, stained with a fluorescent groove binding probe for DNA, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) for 10 min, rinsed three times with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS, dried, and sealed with a coverslip using mounting medium. Cells were photographed at 400× magnification with an Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with a filter for DAPI stain detection (Zeiss, West Germany). DNA fragmentation in cell lysates and supernatants was assayed after a 14-h incubation with the four recombinant FN proteins or with control medium using the cell death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ELISA, which measures cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments after induced cell death, was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colorimetric detection and quantification of the ELISA were performed on a V max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Levels of pp125FAK protein were assessed by standard immunoprecipitation. Cells were plated in 100 μl of culture medium at a density of 3.0 × 104cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. The test wells contained 0.1 μm/well V+H+ protein or the V+H− protein. Cells were incubated for 0 to 1 h such that cells were harvested at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, lysed, and analyzed. Cell lysates were prepared using 100 μl/well TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm sodium chloride in Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing various protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm sodium molybdate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were adjusted for protein concentration using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and then precleared with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supernatants were incubated with 2 μl of an anti-pp125FAK mouse monoclonal antibody (2A7, Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h. Next, samples were incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Samples were then pelleted, washed four times with TNE buffer, pelleted again, and eluted from the beads by the addition of sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiling for 2 min. Samples were loaded and electrophoresed by standard methods on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose by standard methods. The immunoblot was probed with a primary antibody, anti-pp125FAK rabbit antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to peroxidase (ECL-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound antibody was detected using the ECL-plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The integrin subunits expressed on the cell surface were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Trypsinized cells were harvested from tissue culture plates, rinsed twice with PBS, then resuspended (3 × 106cells/ml) with the following primary antibodies (1:40 antibody dilution in PBS containing 10% serum as a carrier protein for the antibody): anti-human α4 mouse monoclonal (clone P4C2, Life Technologies, Inc.), anti-human αv mouse monoclonal (clone VNR 147, Life Technologies, Inc.), anti-rat α5 (BIIGII, gift from Dr. Caroline Damsky, University of California San Francisco), and anti-rat β1 (AIIBII, gift from Dr. Caroline Damsky). Nonimmune mouse and rat IgGs (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as negative controls. The antibody-containing cell suspension was rocked for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween and incubated with the secondary fluoresceinated antibodies (1:1000 antibody dilution in PBS with 10% serum; fluorescein isothiocyanate-rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate -F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-rat IgG (H+L) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.)) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were rinsed three times with PBS, fixed (fix buffer made up of 1:10 dilution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 1:8 dilution of 2% sodium azide in PBS), and analyzed on a flow cytometer (Lysis II Version 1.0, FACSCAN, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Fluorescence intensity was expressed on a log scale for a replicate of three experiments. To determine the cellular response to the high affinity heparin binding domain and the alternatively spliced V region of FN as presented in the four recombinant proteins (Fig.1), we first examined their effects on cell spreading. Cells were rounded, and cell membranes exhibited blebbing when incubated with the V+H− protein (Fig. 2 A, e) but not when incubated with control serum-free medium or medium containing the other three FN proteins tested (Fig. 2 A,a–d). Although photographs were typically taken after 2 h of incubation to show early events, cells were observed up to 48 h. Up to this time, cells incubated with the V+H− protein failed to spread. In contrast, the V+H+ protein accelerated cell spreading during the initial 2 h after plating (Fig. 2 A,d) compared with the other proteins tested or the control (Fig. 2 A, a–c). The effects of the V+H− protein on cell shape were triggered only when the protein was provided in soluble form (Fig. 2 B, d) and not as a coated substrate (Fig. 2 B, c). In addition, as we and others have shown (15Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Woods A.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 43-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the heparin binding domain of FN is critical for cell spreading; however, the characteristic cell rounding and membrane blebbing triggered by V+H− were not due to the inability of cells to spread, since cells that had been allowed to spread first on plastic, intact FN, collagen type I, or vitronectin (Fig.3, a, c, e, and g, respectively) still exhibited the V+H−-mediated cell rounding and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3, b, d, f, and h, respectively). These data demonstrate that the V+H− protein triggers apoptotic-like cell rounding and membrane blebbing irrespective of cell shape. Adhesion to FN promotes cell survival in a number of cell types (11Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar,14Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

Given the cell shape changes in these cells, we hypothesized that the mutation in the high affinity heparin binding domain in conjunction with the alternatively spliced V region in the V+H− protein triggered an apoptotic response in these cells and that the wild-type heparin binding domain was therefore critical to cell survival. We thus investigated the effects of the V+H− protein on nuclear morphology and integrity. The V+H− protein induced nuclear condensation and some disintegration by 6 h, seen as intensely staining, small nuclei (Fig. 4,e). By 14 h, more distinct nuclear fragmentation was evident. Nuclei appeared as condensed, bright, and lobulated fragments (Fig. 4, f). Cells exposed to the other fragments as well as control cells retained the larger oval-shaped, pale nuclei characteristic of living cells (Fig. 4, a–d). More DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, was induced in cell lysates and supernatants by the V+H− protein than by the other proteins tested or the control medium (Fig.5). These nuclear changes support our hypothesis that the V+H− protein triggers apoptosis in fibroblasts.Figure 5DNA fragmentation in cells incubated with the four recombinant FN proteins for 14 h. Both cell lysates and supernatants were evaluated in the assay. The fragment levels are represented as optical density units; bars show mean values and S.D. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because FN has been shown to rescue cells from apoptosis, we asked whether intact plasma FN might also rescue cells from the rounded cell phenotype and nuclear breakdown triggered by the V+H− protein. We found that FN is indeed capable of reversing the rounded phenotype up to 2 h after incubation of cells with the V+H− protein (Fig. 6, c and d). However, if FN and the V+H− protein were co-cultured in the wells simultaneously (Fig. 6, a andb), cells spread more than if cells were incubated first with the V+H− protein alone (Fig. 6, comparea or b with d). Intact FN also reversed the nuclear morphology exhibited by cells incubated in the presence of the V+H− protein (Fig. 8,B, b, and D, b). These data indicate that intact plasma FN opposes the apoptotic effects of the V+H− protein in fibroblasts.Figure 8Responses of cells incubated with the V+H− protein to a caspase-1/ICE and caspase-3 inhibitor (Inh). The caspase-1/ICE (A) and caspase-3 (C) inhibitors were added with the V+H− protein (c) to determine whether the rounded cell phenotype induced by the V+H− protein (b) could be reversed. Cells incubated in control serum-free medium are shown in a. Photographs were taken 5 or 6 h after cells were plated under these different conditions. B and D, cells were stained with DAPI to demonstrate nuclear morphology after 14 h of incubation with the V+H− protein alone (a) or with the V+H− protein plus FN (b), serum (c), or the caspase inhibitor (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Others have shown (10Ilic D.

Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 124: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar) that inactivation of pp125FAKfunction can trigger apoptosis in anchorage-dependent fibroblasts. We therefore tested whether pp125FAK was differentially altered by V+H−. Indeed, we found that in cells incubated with the V+H−fragment, pp125FAK levels were decreased within minutes, and before any changes in cell shape (Fig.7). However, the control samples containing intact FN (C) or the V+H+fragment demonstrated no change in pp125FAK levels throughout the 60-min observation period. Since the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase family of cell death proteases is a key component in the signaling pathways of apoptosis (23Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6178) Google Scholar), we tested whether effector caspases such as caspase-1/ICE and caspase-3 were critical to the mechanism by which V+H− triggers apoptosis in fibroblasts. A caspase-1/ICE- and caspase-3 inhibitor were tested for their ability to reverse the apoptotic phenotype induced by the V+H− protein. The ICE inhibitor partially rescued the cells from the rounding (Fig.8 A, c) and nuclear disintegration (Fig. 8 B, d) induced by the V+H− protein. The caspase-3 inhibitor almost completely reversed the cell rounding (Fig. 8 C, c) and nuclear disintegration (Fig. 8 D, d) induced by the V+H− protein. The partial rescue with the ICE inhibitor may be explained by the fact that at the highest concentration of ICE inhibitor (2.5 μg/ml), the vehicle required to dissolve the inhibitor was itself inhibitory. To determine the receptor involved in triggering V+H−-mediated apoptosis, we used several approaches. To evaluate whether integrins were involved in this mechanism, we used blocking antibodies to integrins α4, α5, and αv to determine whether these antibodies could rescue the apoptotic cell shape changes induced by V+H−. The data demonstrated that anti-α4 on its own induced the rounded cell shape phenotype, similar to that induced by the V+H−protein, and co-treatment of cells with this antibody and V+H+ partially rescued the cell shape changes. The other antibodies tested, anti-α5 and -αv, had no or a minimal effect on cell shape, either on their own or after treatment with V+H− (Fig.9). To verify the expression of the α4 integrin, we performed FACS analysis on these cells. The FACS data demonstrated that indeed these cells express not only α4 but also α5, αv, and β1 on their cell surface. The data further revealed that there is relatively more αv present on these cells than any of the other three integrin subunits. The α5 and β1 subunits are the next most abundant, and the α4 subunit is the least abundant (Fig.10). To explore the possible role of glycosaminoglycan receptors in this mechanism of apoptosis, we treated cells with glycosaminoglycan digestive enzymes (chondroitinase, heparinase, and heparitinase) and with glycosaminoglycans themselves (chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin) to determine whether any of these treatments could rescue the apoptotic cell shape changes triggered by V+H−. Both chondroitinase treatment and chondroitin sulfate substantially rescued the apoptotic cell shape changes induced by V+H− (Fig.11, A and B, respectively). The other treatments had a more minimal ability to rescue the apoptotic cell shape changes (Fig. 11, A andB). Several studies have shown that intact FN promotes cell survival (11Crouch D.H.

We have found that a fragment of FN, V+H−, induces apoptosis. The decrease in pp125FAK levels in the presence of V+H− suggests that this fragment interferes with transduction of extracellular matrix survival signals mediated by pp125FAK, which have been shown to be essential in anchorage-dependent fibroblasts cultured in the absence of serum (10Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 13Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 124: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Our data further suggest that a caspase cascade is activated in V+H−-mediated apoptosis via a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan receptor and the α4 integrin. Taken together, these data support our original hypothesis that specific domains of FN regulate cell survival. Specifically, our data demonstrate that the high affinity heparin binding domain plus the V region of FN are critical to the mechanism by which FN promotes survival, since mutating the heparin binding domain in a V-containing fragment triggers apoptosis in fibroblasts. The combined functions of the heparin binding domain and the V region of FN are an important regulatory component in cell survival. This is suggested by the fact that the V+H+ protein, which is exactly the same as V+H− except for the mutations in the heparin binding domain, promotes survival. In addition, since the V−H− protein does not induce apoptosis, the V region is critical to this apoptotic mechanism. Therefore, these findings suggest that the signal (or lack of signal) triggered by the V+H− protein that leads to apoptosis is likely the result of at least two features specific to this protein: 1) the two point mutations in its heparin binding domain, which abrogate heparin-binding function, and 2) the potential loss of cooperative interactions between its heparin binding domain and V region. Therefore it is the combined presence of the heparin binding mutation and the V region that is critical to this ability of the protein to trigger the apoptotic phenotype. The apoptotic effect induced by the V+H−protein in primary fibroblasts does not affect all cell types and may be cell type-specific. We previously showed that this same FN fragment induces increased invasion by human oral"

IL-8 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level in part by the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB. We compared intracellular signaling mediating IL-8 gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells culturedin vitro and exposed to two inducers of cellular stress, sodium arsenite (AsIII), and vanadyl sulfate (VIV). Unstimulated bronchial epithelial cells expressed IL-8, and exposure to both metal compounds significantly enhanced IL-8 expression. Overexpression of a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB depressed both basal and metal-induced IL-8 expression. Low levels of nuclear NF-κB were constitutively present in unstimulated cultures. These levels were augmented by exposure to VIV, but not AsIII. Accordingly, VIV induced IκBα breakdown and NF-κB nuclear translocation, whereas AsIIIdid not. However, both AsIII and VIV enhanced κB-dependent transcription. In addition, AsIII activation of an IL-8 promoter-reporter construct was partially κB-dependent. These data suggested that AsIII enhanced IL-8 gene transcription independently of IκB breakdown and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in part by enhancing transcription mediated by low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB.

(1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). However, numerous subsequent studies have shown that NF-κB is polymorphic. It is composed of homo- or heterodimers of at least five structurally related mammalian proteins that have a broad tissue distribution. Likewise, NF-κB modulates the expression of a large number of genes whose products participate in immune, inflammatory, and environmental stress responses (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar).In many tissues NF-κB mediates transient changes in gene expression in response to humoral and environmental stimuli. In this case, NF-κB is held inactive in the cytoplasm by IκBs, a family of inhibitor proteins that mask its nuclear translocation signal. The activation of NF-κB is mediated in part by the inactivation of IκBs through stimulus-specific posttranslational modifications of IκBs. To date, the most commonly observed mechanism of IκB inactivaton involves phosphorylation of two N-terminal serine residues by IκB kinase, a large multimeric complex that receives input from a variety of signal transduction pathways (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 5Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκBs by the IκB kinase complex targets IκBs for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. Upon its release from IκB, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and binds to κB response elements (RE) in the enhancer regions of target genes.A number of pharmacological interventions that inhibit inducible κB-dependent transcription, however, do not inhibit the translocation of cytoplasmic NF-κB into the nucleus or its DNA binding activity (6Zhong H.

So an increase in nuclear NF-κB alone is not sufficient for the maximal activation of κB-dependent transcription. Conversely, enhanced κB-dependent transcription has been observed in the absence of an increase in nuclear NF-κB in cells that have low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB (11Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This indicates that the mobilization of cytoplasmic NF-κB is not invariably necessary for the activation of transcription. Thus κB-dependent transcription is dependent upon both the abundance of nuclear NF-κB and additional cooperative factors and regulatory processes that influence the transcription activating (transactivating) potential of NF-κB.Of the five known mammalian NF-κB family members, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100, only three, p65, RelB, and c-Rel, are capable of transcriptional activation (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The transactivation potential of the p65 subunit of NF-κB has been shown to depend upon specific p65 protein domains. NF-κB family members share a conserved 300-amino acid, N-terminal Rel homology domain that mediates dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. Phosphorylation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase site in the Rel homology domain of p65 strongly increases κB-dependent transcription and requires IκBα degradation (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies using constitutive nuclear chimeric transcription factors have suggested that the transactivation potential of p65 can also be regulated by nuclear processes that are independent of IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of p65. Transcriptional regulation by these processes requires one or both of two C-terminal transactivation domains of p65 (11Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J.

We have recently demonstrated that two metal compounds, sodium arsenite and vanadyl sulfate, activate MAP kinases in airway epthelial cells in vitro (16Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J.L. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These metals also evoke a proinflammatory response as indicated by enhanced production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), an α-chemokine that is a neutrophil chemoattractant and stimulant (17Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 18Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 gene transcription is induced by phorbol esters and the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). This induction depends upon an enhancer region of the IL-8 gene located upstream of the transcription start site (base pairs −126 to −72), which includes activator protein-1, C/EBP, and NF-κB response elements. All three of these cis-acting elements are necessary for maximal transcriptional activation, although there are tissue-specific differences in this dependence. The activator protein-1 and C/EBP elements are employed in a tissue-specific fashion, whereas the NF-κB element is necessary in all tissues examined (19Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S.

Our results suggest that in cultured airway epithelial cells both AsIII and VIV activated κB-dependent transcription; however, VIV mobilized cytoplasmic NF-κB, whereas AsIII did not.DISCUSSIONIn this study we investigated AsIII- and VIV-induced NF-κB activation pathways, which culminate in IL-8 gene expression in airway epithelial cells. Both the AsIII- and VIV-induced IL-8 expression were NF-κB-dependent; however, VIV induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB translocation, whereas exposure to AsIII failed to do so. Thus, despite the κB dependence of arsenite-induced gene expression, there was no detectable mobilization of cytoplasmic NF-κB, suggesting that the response to arsenite was mediated by low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB that were detected in the airway epithelial cell cultures.The presence of low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB was suggested by several pieces of evidence: (i) Nuclear p65 was detected by immunoblotting of nuclear extracts of unchallenged cultures (Fig.5); (ii) EMSA of nuclear extracts using a recognized functional compound C/EBP/NF-κB response element of the IL-8 gene revealed basal nuclear levels of a κB-dependent DNA binding activity (Fig. 9 B); (iii) unstimulated cultures supported κB-dependent transcription from both 5xNF-κB-reporter (Fig. 6) and IL-8 promoter-reporter constructs (Figs. 7 and 8); and (iv) basal expression of IL-8 mRNA was κB-dependent (Fig. 3).The κB dependence of basal IL-8 mRNA expression and basal activities of the promoter-reporter constructs was suggested by their suppression following global inhibition of NF-κB function by overexpression of a dominant negative IκBα mutant (Figs. 3, 6, and7). The mutant IκBα was present not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus (Fig. 6 B). This is in accordance with observations that IκBα is imported into the nucleus when uncharged with NF-κB (30Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a likely situation when IκBα is overexpressed. Nuclear IκBα inhibits κB-dependent transcription (31Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 32Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell.

The specificity of the inhibition for κB-dependent processes was suggested by a number of observations. Overexpression of IκBα(S32A,S36A) did not inhibit the AsIII-induced increase in c-Jun message (Fig.3) or the κB-independent activity of the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 7). Additional studies indicate that overexpression of the mutant IκBα does not inhibit basal or phorbol myristate acetate-induced activator protein-1-dependent transcription but does inhibit phorbol myristate acetate-induced κB-dependent transcription. 2W. Reed, unpublished observations. Thus, it is clear that IκBα(S32A,S36A) overexpression did not inhibit transcription in a nonspecific fashion. The data consistently supported the notion that there were low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB and basal IL-8 expression in airway epithelial cell cultures.The origin of the low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB and IL-8 expression is not clear. Environmental stresses because of artificial cell culture conditions have been shown to elicit IL-8 from cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas freshly isolated (naı̈ve) peripheral blood mononuclear cells do not express IL-8 (35Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that stresses because of artificial culture conditions in addition to AsIII are acting on the primary cell lines and that these stresses establish the low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB and IL-8 expression that are a prerequisite for the AsIII-induced κB-dependent transcription. Alternatively, the constitutive nuclear NF-κB and IL-8 expression may be a tissue characteristic of airway epithelium in vivo and in vitro. Recent clinical studies using RT-PCR have shown that IL-8 mRNA is expressed in naı̈ve (uncultured) biopsies of airway epithelium (36Becker S.E. Clapp W.A. Quay J.L. Frees K.L. Koren H.S. Schwartz J. Am.J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, low levels of IL-8 are invariably found in the airway lining fluid of normal healthy individuals (36Becker S.E. Clapp W.A. Quay J.L. Frees K.L. Koren H.S. Schwartz J. Am.J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 37Richman-Eisenstat J.B. Jorens P.G. Hebert C.A. Ueki I. Nadel J.A. Am. J.

Care Med. 1999; 159: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although there are other cell types in the airway that can produce IL-8, epithelial cells are by far the most abundant. The expression of IL-8 by airway epithelium in vivo may be related to the role the epithelium plays in host defense. The airway is in an unusual physiological situation. It is constantly exposed to respirable environmental pathogens and toxicants, protected only by a thin layer of fluid containing mucus and proteins. Many of the pathogens and toxicants to which airway epithelial cells are constantly exposed are capable of inducing translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus in vitro (41Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S. Sharland M. Becker S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1007-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 42Janssen Y.M. Barchowsky A. Treadwell M. Driscoll K.E. Mossman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 20: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the IL-8 expression detected in normal airway epithelium may be a consequence of chronic low levels of stress because of environmental pathogens and toxicants. Alternatively, airway epithelium may constitutively express low levels of IL-8 that mediate heightened immune surveillance of the airways. Even though these possibilites cannot be distinguish at the moment, the primary cell lines appear to be a reasonable model of airway epithelium in vivo.Constitutive nuclear NF-κB has been observed previously in mature B cells (46Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), activated monocytes and macrophages (47Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), neurons (48O'Neill L.A. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial cells (49Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23077-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts (11Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the proportion of NF-κB that is constitutively nuclear and that the subunit composition of nuclear NF-κB varies with tissue type as well as with cellular differentiation and activation state. How constitutive nuclear levels of NF-κB are set remains unclear. In neurons it may be determined by an autocrine activation loop (48O'Neill L.A. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). B lymphocyte maturation is associated with decreased stability of IκBα as well as de novo expression of nuclear RelB-p52/p100 heterodimers, which are not efficiently inhibited by IκBα (50Rice N.R. Ernst M.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4685-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 51Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In certain tumor cell lines, elevated constitutive nuclear NF-κB is associated with decreased stability of IκBα (52Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar,53Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S.C. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas dysfunctional IκBα mutants have been observed in other tumor cells (54Wood K.M. Roff M. Hay R.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Generalizing these observations leads to the suggestion that levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB may also vary as a consequence of genetic polymorphisms in NF-κB or in the macromolecules that regulate NF-κB expression or activity. The findings presented here may provide a framework for anticipating variation in the effects of arsenite exposure depending on tissue type, cellular differentiation or activation state, and possibly individual susceptibility.Arsenite activated κB-dependent transcriptional activity of a 5xNF-κB-reporter and IL-8 promoter-reporter construct in airway epithelium without increasing the low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB. This finding is consistent with a recent study in which enhanced κB-dependent transcription induced by Ras or Raf transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was mediated by constitutive nuclear NF-κB (11Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In this case, transformation was shown to activate a chimeric transcription factor composed of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor and the C-terminal TA1 transactivation domain of p65. This suggested that transcriptional activation was due to functional activation of p65. Using the same strategy, the transcription promoting activity of the TA1 and TA2 transactivation domains of p65 have also been shown to be responsive to tumor necrosis factor-α (12Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Both of these studies suggested that activation does not depend upon translocation of the hybrid transcription factor into the nucleus but rather is a consequence of nuclear processes that are dependent upon activation of p38 and/or ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Arsenite has been shown to activate ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 MAP kinases in a variety of tissues (55Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Taken together, these studies present a plausible mechanism by which arsenite may activate κB-dependent gene transcription in the presence of low levels of constitutive nuclear NF-κB. Currently, we are addressing the role of MAP kinase activation in arsenite-induced κB-dependent transcription in airway epithelium.The arsenite-induced activation of the IL-8 promoter-reporter construct was shown to depend upon the compound C/EBP/NF-κB response element of the IL-8 gene (Fig. 8). Previously, this compound RE was shown to be essential for the activation of IL-8 promoter-reporter constructs by phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β (20Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J.

Both p65 and the β isoform of C/EBP (C/EBPβ) family of transcription factors (61Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind this RE in vitro (21Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar,27Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and synergistically activate transcription dependent upon the C/EBP/NF-κB RE (21Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar, 34Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that other combinations of C/EBP and NF-κB isoforms may cooperate at this site, because numerous synergistic combinations of the six known isoforms of C/EBP with NF-κB isoforms have been suggested (61Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In this study, analysis of nuclear extracts by EMSA indicated the presence of a DNA binding activity for the compound RE in unstimulated cultures whose activity was transiently enhanced by arsenite exposure (Fig.9 A). This activity correlated with the basal and arsenite-enhanced activity of the IL-8 promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 8). Additional analysis of nuclear extracts by EMSA indicated that a nuclear factor that binds a solitary C/EBP RE is present in unstimulated cultures and its activity is enhanced by arsenite exposure (Fig. 9 D). C/EBP isoforms can be phosphorylated on independent regulatory sites by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and MAP kinase, and these modifications influence nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity (61Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 62Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Dransfield D.T. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30356-30361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based upon our data, we would predict that a C/EBP-like factor complexed with constitutive nuclear p65, both in functionally activated states, explain the arsenite-induced DNA binding activity for the C/EBP/NF-κB RE, as well as the dependence of arsenite-induced IL-8 promoter-reporter activity upon the compound RE. Further studies are necessary to identify the factor or factors binding to the C/EBP/NF-κB RE of the IL-8 promoter as well as their individual transactivation potentials in unstimulated and arsenite-treated airway epithelium.In conclusion, the study presented here describes a distinct mechanism of enhanced κB-dependent gene expression in airway epithelium. In the absence of IκBα breakdown and mobilization of cytoplasmic NF-κB, exposure to arsenite increased κB-dependent transcription and gene expression, implying a potential role for basal levels of nuclear NF-κB in inducible gene transcription. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 was originally described as a constitutive nuclear transcription activator in mature B lymphocytes that bound a specific DNA sequence in the intronic enhancer of the immunoglobulin κ-light chain (Igκ) gene and mediated constitutive Igκ expression. (1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). However, numerous subsequent studies have shown that NF-κB is polymorphic. It is composed of homo- or heterodimers of at least five structurally related mammalian proteins that have a broad tissue distribution. Likewise, NF-κB modulates the expression of a large number of genes whose products participate in immune, inflammatory, and environmental stress responses (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar). In many tissues NF-κB mediates transient changes in gene expression in response to humoral and environmental stimuli. In this case, NF-κB is held inactive in the cytoplasm by IκBs, a family of inhibitor proteins that mask"

The deletion of residues between positions 53 and 122 resulted in a strongly decreased tendency to form dimers, whereas all the polypeptides that included that sequence exhibited high levels of dimer formation. b dimers existed in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium and when mixed with other b truncations formed heterodimers efficiently, provided both constructs included the 53–122 sequence. Sedimentation velocity and 15N NMR relaxation measurements indicated that the dimerization region is highly extended in solution, consistent with an elongated second stalk structure. A cysteine introduced at position 105 was found to readily form intersubunit disulfides, whereas other single cysteines at positions 103–110 failed to form disulfides either with the identical mutant or when mixed with the other 103–110 cysteine mutants.

This complex synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by utilizing a transmembrane proton gradient as an energy source. Structurally and functionally the complex can be divided into two major domains: the membrane intrinsic F0 domain and the peripheral F1 domain. The F0 domain of the prototypical Escherichia coli enzyme consists of three polypeptides in the stoichiometry ofa 1 b 2 c 9–12that function in proton translocation across the inner membrane. The F1 domain, which has the subunit composition of α3β3γ1δ1ε1, performs the ATP catalytic functions. (For recent reviews of ATP synthase function and structure, see Refs. 1Boyer P. Annu. Rev.

Girvin M.E. Jiang W. Valiyaveetil F. Hermolin J. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 163-168PubMed Google Scholar.) Structural studies have shown that the 3α and 3β polypeptides form a ring of alternating subunits surrounding a central region occupied by the N- and C-terminal helices of the γ subunit (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). The remainder of γ lies outside of the α3β3 domain and is closely associated with the ε subunit (5Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This γε subcomplex extends for 45 Å from F1 to the membrane where interactions with the c subunits of the F0domain occur (6Watts S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15065-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, γε forms the central “stalk” often seen in electron micrographs (7Lücken U. Gogol E.P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The binding change model (reviewed in Ref. 1Boyer P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) suggests that rotation of the γε stalk relative to the α3β3domain results in sequential changes in the catalytic sites on the β subunits, causing them to cycle through conformations favoring substrate binding, then catalysis, and finally product release. This mechanism requires a stator structure to hold the α3β3 hexamer as the γε stalk rotates within it. Recently, a structure that reaches from the membrane domain to the periphery of the catalytic domain and that is distinct from the central γε stalk has been observed in electron micrographs (8Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This “second stalk” may function as a stator formed by theb and δ subunits. The b subunit is necessary for the stable binding of F1 to the membrane and for correct assembly of the complex (9Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). b is a 156-residue polypeptide with a hydrophobic N-terminal membrane-spanning α helix. The remainder of the protein is highly polar and extends into the cytoplasm where it interacts with the δ subunit and the α3β3 domain. The cytoplasmic domain of b, consisting of residues 24–156, has been expressed separately from the membrane spanning domain and forms a soluble, highly extended homodimer that can bind F1 in a manner similar to the intact protein (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the two b monomers in the complex can be covalently cross-linked without abolishing activity, confirming that the dimeric state is the functional form of the protein (11Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The affinity ofb for F1 or the isolated δ subunit is strongly correlated with its ability to form dimers (12Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The only significant stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain occurs between Val124 and Ala132. Mutation of Ala128 to aspartate has been shown to disrupt dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain (13Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-linking has demonstrated that the b-δ interaction is between the C-terminal domains of each of the polypeptides (14McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). δ can also be cross-linked to the N-terminal region of the α subunit located near the top of the of the catalytic hexamer (15Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the second stalk is believed to be formed by the b subunits extending upward from the membrane to interact with δ, which binds on the top third of the αβ domain. The second stalk could function as a relatively passive, rigid stator or play a more active role in catalysis by transiently storing energy in an elastic manner. Much of the cytoplasmic region of the b dimer is expected to exist as a pair of extended helical rods to span the 140–150 Å from the membrane to the top of F1. In this study, we have characterized a series of N- and C-terminal truncations of the soluble b domain to identify the minimal region necessary for formation of the homodimer. In addition we have made inferences about the structure of the b dimer based on sites of intersubunit disulfide formation and on changes in hydrodynamic behavior upon truncation of the sequence. Molecular biological procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Constructions were confirmed by restriction endonuclease mapping and regions of DNA derived from PCR1 products were sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutations had been introduced. Plasmid pDM3, which carries a synthetic sequence encodingb 24–156 2b x–y indicates a polypeptide containing the amino acid sequence of b from positionx to position y, generally preceded by a short leader sequence derived from the plasmid. For example,b 24–156 refers to a construct consisting of residues of Tyr24 to Leu156 of the bsubunit. Assuming removal of the N-terminal methionine, those constructs beginning with Tyr24 have a leader sequence of TMITNSH, whereas all other constructs used in this study have a leader sequence of SYW (Fig. 1).in pUC8, has been described previously (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To stabilize mRNAs and enhance expression of various forms of b, a 202-base pairBfaI-HindIII fragment of pSD100 (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) carrying theunc transcriptional terminator was inserted downstream of the b 24–156 synthetic gene, using theHindIII and NdeI sites. The resulting plasmid was called pDM3T. A number of plasmids encoding N- or C-terminal truncations of the soluble form of b were used in this work; these plasmids and polypeptides are summarized in Fig. 1. Previously, work from this laboratory described three plasmids, pSD114, pSD111, and pKK1, which express soluble b polypeptides lacking 33, 52, or 66 residues, respectively, from the N-terminal of b (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the current studies a series of plasmids encoding C-terminal truncations was constructed by PCR mutagenesis. In these constructions, PCR using plasmid pDM3 as a template was carried out using the M13 reverse universal primer coupled with mutagenic primers containing aHindIII restriction site and a sequence complementary to a stop codon and the desired region of synthetic b sequence. PCR products were co-digested with HindIII and a second enzyme, both unique in plasmids pDM3 or pDM3T, and inserted into one of those plasmids using the same restriction sites. Sequences encoding some of the C-terminal truncations were pasted into pSD114 or pSD111 to produce forms of soluble b bearing deletions at both ends. Another set of plasmids was constructed; each of these plasmids encoded a mutant form of b 24–156 in which one of the amino acid residues between Ala103 and Glu110of the normal b sequence was replaced by cysteine. The residue numbers cited refer to the position in the wild typeb sequence. These plasmids were constructed by PCR mutagenesis and cloned into pDM3 using standard techniques as described previously (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Induced cells expressing the polypeptide of interest were suspended in a volume of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride equal to 10 times their packed wet weight and disrupted by one passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 9,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. The supernatant solution was centrifuged for another 1.5 h at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The purification of polypeptides b 24–156,b 34–156, b 53–156,b 24–152, and b 67–156have been described previously (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Other b truncated polypeptides were purified from the high speed supernatant solutions using generally similar techniques of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography, with the modifications summarized below. During purification, fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the final products were essentially pure, as judged by this technique. b 24–145 was precipitated with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, redissolved and dialyzed against TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The protein was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with TE buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in TE buffer. Fractions containing the protein were again dialyzed and loaded onto a second DEAE-Sepharose column; this second column was eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl in 25 mmimidazole-HCl buffer at pH 6.4. The protein was precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S-300. b 24–134 and b 24–138were both purified using the following procedure. The proteins were precipitated with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, redissolved, and dialyzed against TE buffer. Upon application to a column of DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with TE buffer, the proteins did not bind but upon elution with TE buffer were retarded slightly. This step was repeated on a second column of DEAE-Sepharose to remove yet more impurities. The protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and finally purified by size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S-300. b 24–122 was precipitated with 35–55% saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against TE buffer, and run through two columns of DEAE-Sepharose, similar to the procedure described forb 24–134 and b 24–138, to remove other proteins. After precipitation with ammonium sulfate, final purification was by size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-75. b 24–114 was unlike the other polypeptides described above in that a part of the protein was insoluble and precipitated during low speed centrifugation. The purification was continued with the portion of the protein that remained in the supernatant. Following high speed centrifugation, theb 24–114 was precipitated from the supernatant by adding ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 55% saturation. The precipitate was redissolved in TE buffer and dialyzed, and most contaminating proteins were removed by passage through a column of DEAE-Sepharose, as for b 24–134 andb 24–138. Appropriate fractions were pooled, the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and final purification was by size exclusion chromatography on a column of Sephacryl S-200. b 34–122 was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against TE buffer, and run through a column of DEAE-Sepharose, similar to the procedure described forb 24–134 and b 24–138. Appropriate fractions were pooled and adjusted to pH 4.8 by addition of acetic acid. Final purification was achieved by loading the sample on a column of CM-Sepharose and elution with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8. b 53–122 was precipitated with 45–70% saturated ammonium sulfate and run through two columns of DEAE-Sepharose, similar to the procedure described forb 24–134 and b 24–138. Appropriate fractions from the second column were pooled, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0 by the addition of acetic acid. Final purification was achieved by loading the sample onto a column of CM-Sepharose equilibrated with 30 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and elution with a linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Protein purity was assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE gels using standard glycine running buffers except for the constructs of molecular weight less than 10 kDa (b 34–122,b 53–122) where improved resolution was obtained using 15% Laemmli gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) but with a running buffer of 100 mm Tris, 100 mm Tricine, 0.1% SDS. All chemicals and solvents used were reagent grade. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm exceptb 67–156, which lacked an aromatic chromophore and was observed at 240 nm. The extinction coefficients at 280 and 240 nm were based on concentrations determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Purified protein samples were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, or 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 for ultracentrifugal analyses. Initial concentrations of the polypeptides analyzed were between 20 and 50 μm of monomer. Unless otherwise noted all reported concentrations refer to monomer. Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected in a Beckman Optima XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge with absorbance optics. A four-hole An-60Ti rotor and six-channel cells with Epon charcoal centerpieces were used. Absorbance measurements were taken in 0.002-cm radial steps and averaged over 10 observations. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h at the desired speed (30,000 or 36,000 rpm) and temperature (5, 20, or 40 °C) before scanning. After the 40 °C scan the samples were cooled to 20 °C, allowed to equilibrate, and scanned again to ensure the reversibility of the monomer-dimer transition and to confirm that no degradation had occurred. Software supplied by Beckman was used for data processing and curve fitting. The reported observed molecular weight,M obs, for a single species was calculated based on the average of three data sets. The monomer molecular weight,M c, was calculated from the amino acid sequence. The partial specific volumes of proteins were determined from the amino acid sequence by the method of Cohn and Edsall (19Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Reinhold, New York1943: 157-161Google Scholar). The density of the solvents were measured in a pycnometer or, in some cases, calculated from published tables (20Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. Chemical Rubber Company, Cleveland, OH1970: D-176-D-215Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity samples were run at 60,000 rpm in double-sector cells at 5 and 20 °C. Once full speed was attained the samples were scanned every 10 min for a total run time of up to 300 min. Each scanned point was the average of five observations, and all data reported were the averages of at least three runs. The data sets were processed using the SVEDBERG program (21Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (212) Google Scholar) utilizing the modified Fujita-MacCosham model fitted for a single species. When necessary the observed values for sedimentation coefficients,s obs, were converted tos 20,w. Frictional coefficients (f) and frictional ratios (ƒ/ƒmin) were calculated fromM r and s 20,w by standard methods. NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and z axis pulsed field gradients. A sample of15N-labeled b 53–122 in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was equilibrated at 25 °C. One-dimensional T1, T2, and 15N NOE spectra were collected using the pulse sequences described in Farrow et al. (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.F. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The T1 relaxation was measured in an array of 25 steps from 11.2 ms to 1.36 s in 56-ms increments. The T2 signal was measured from an array of 11 spectra with relaxation delays from 16.6 to 183.6 ms in 16.6-ms steps. For the T1 and T2 data the signal envelopes were integrated and fit to determine the first order exponential decay constant. The NOE experiments were run with either a 5-s relaxation delay for the no NOE base-line experiment or a relaxation delay of 2 s followed by a 3-s 1H presaturation period to determine the magnitude of 15N NOE. The ratios between the intensities of selected peaks in the NOE and no NOE experiments were calculated. Global correlation times, τm, were calculated as described previously by Farrow et al. (22Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.F. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The cross-linking ofb 53–122, b 67–156,b 24–114, and b 34–156was carried out for 10 min at room temperature using 1 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Pierce). The cross-linking reactions occurred in the presence of 50 mmtriethanolamine buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and were quenched by the addition of ethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 100 mm. Complete quenching was achieved by leaving the reactions standing for 10 min at room temperature followed by heating in SDS sample buffer. The products of the reactions were then run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels using the Tricine running buffers previously specified. Forms ofb 24–156 bearing mutations incorporating cysteine into one of the positions between Ala103 and Glu110 were partially purified and tested for their ability to form disulfide bonds as described previously (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the partially purified proteins were reduced by dialysis into buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and then dialyzed in buffer containing 0.1 m NaHCO3, 10 μmCuCl2, and 10 mm cysteine at 4 °C to induce disulfide bond formation. After 24 h, samples were treated with 15 mm N-ethyl maleimide in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to block unreacted thiol groups and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Previous and current studies of the b subunit suggest a four-domain model, which is shown in Fig.1 A to assist in the presentation of data. The N-terminal 24-residue sequence is highly hydrophobic and is embedded in the membrane with the other F0 subunits. The sequence from residues 25 to 52, which is not essential for dimer formation (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is designated the tether domain, because it joins the membrane region to the beginning of the sequence essential for dimerization. The extent of the remaining sequence that is necessary for homodimer formation is defined in this report. Near the C terminus are sites required for binding to the δ subunit and the F1 sector; we refer to this region as the δ-binding domain. Previous work from this laboratory has characterized soluble forms of b lacking the N-terminal membrane spanning domain (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three deeper N-terminal deletions (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and minor C-terminal truncations (14McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the current work, a series of plasmids encoding deeper C-terminal truncations of b was constructed (Fig. 1), and the polypeptides were purified and characterized. All of the new forms were extracted as soluble polypeptides, exceptb 24–114, which was partly soluble and partly inclusion body. The purification of these proteins by conventional techniques of ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography is described under “Experimental Procedures.” A number of properties of these polypeptides became apparent during this work. All C-terminal deletions redissolved easily following ammonium sulfate precipitation, unlike forms with an intact C terminus. Little difference in the percentage of ammonium sulfate required for precipitation was apparent, however, until the hydrophobic region between residues 124 and 132 was removed. Forms truncated at residue 138 or earlier in the sequence failed to bind to DEAE resin at pH 8.0, underscoring the acidic nature of the C-terminal region that had been removed. There are six acidic and two basic side chains between 134 and 156; deletion of this region changes the pI for the protein from about 6 to over 8. DEAE-Sepharose was nevertheless used during the purification of these polypeptides, because it absorbed most of the other proteins in the samples. The less acidic nature of these proteins resulted in a much enhanced solubility at pH 5.0 in comparison with forms like b 34–156, which precipitate as the pH is lowered toward 5.0 (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This property was exploited through purification on CM-Sepharose. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation allows accurate determination of the molecular weight of soluble proteins under native conditions and hence the stoichiometry of multimeric complexes. Previous studies of the b 24–156construct have demonstrated that the isolated cytoplasmic domain exists primarily as a dimer (10Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study of the molecular weight of the b subunit truncations, sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted to a single component model to determine the average observed molecular weight,M obs, of the purified protein in solution. The data are presented in Table I asM obs/M c, the ratio ofM obs to the molecular weight of the monomer calculated from the sequence, M c. The presence of equilibrium mixtures of monomers and dimers is reflected in the nonintegral values for these ratios.Table IOligomerization of the b polypeptides determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysisPolypeptideMcMobsaMc5 °C20 °C40 °CCytoplasmic domain of b b24–15615,5081.87 ± 0.062.11 ± 0.081.39 ± 0.06N-terminal truncations b34–15614,0181.88 ± 0.062.13 ± 0.111.36 ± 0.04 b53–15611,8982.02 ± 0.072.40 ± 0.021.71 ± 0.12 b67–1569,8631.08 ± 0.041.18 ± 0.031.10 ± 0.05C-terminal truncations b24–15214,9331.81 ± 0.011.89 ± 0.011.16 ± 0.03 b24–13813,6391.81 ± 0.051.81 ± 0.021.29 ± 0.03 b24–12211,9761.79 ± 0.041.76 ± 0.031.09 ± 0.01 b24–11410,7741.29 ± 0.081.16 ± 0.011.08 ± 0.01N- and C-terminal truncations b53–1228,3651.96 ± 0.051.89 ± 0.031.25 ± 0.03 b53–122, pH 5.08,3651.95 ± 0.021.99 ± 0.021.39 ± 0.01The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at pH 7.5 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA buffer except where pH 5.0 is noted.

Open table in a new tab The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at pH 7.5 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA buffer except where pH 5.0 is noted. In those studies a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer was employed. a The M obs/M cvalues reported are the average and standard error of three experiments. In previous work it was demonstrated thatb 24–156, b 34–156, andb 53–156 exist primarily as dimers, whereas theb 67–156 truncation was monomeric in solution (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the current work an analysis of the effect of temperature on the properties of these polypeptides was undertaken. The average oligomerization states of the solution species at 5, 20, and 40 °C are listed in Table I. Comparison of the values at 5 and 20 °C for the three dimeric constructs revealed that there was a trend for theM obs/M c ratio to increase from about 1.9 at 5 °C to slightly more than 2 at 20 °C. We have previously reported that b 24–156 has a slight tendency to aggregate at 20 °C when its concentration is higher than about 1 mg/ml (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the values reported in Table I reflect average molecular weights of species present in the ultracentrifuge cell, this slight aggregation can raise theM obs/M c ratio to values above 2.0. At 40 °C, theM obs/M c ratio dropped to less than 1.4 for b 24–156 andb 34–156, indicating that the higher temperatures destabilized the dimer interaction, shifting the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward the monomeric state. Theb 53–156 polypeptide gave higher values than the less truncated forms b 24–156 andb 34–156 at all temperatures examined; theM obs/M c value of 2.40 obtained at 20 °C for this construct indicates that it is especially prone to aggregate to species higher than dimer. It is likely that the value obtained at 40 °C, 1.71, was higher than those forb 24–156 and b 34–156because of the effect of this aggregation on the average molecular weight, rather than because removing residues 34–52 caused the remainder of the protein to form a tighter dimer. As expected, theb 67–156 construct exhibitedM obs/M c values below 1.2 for the entire tempe"
https://openalex.org/W2104055664,"Amino acid alterations were designed at the C terminus of the hinge segment (amino acids ∼51–59) that links two functional domains within lactose repressor protein (LacI). Gly was introduced between Gly58 and Lys59 to generate Gly58+1; Gln60 was changed to Gly or Pro, and up to three additional glycines were inserted following Gln60 → Gly. All mutant proteins exhibited purification behavior, CD spectra, assembly state, and inducer binding properties similar to wild-type LacI and only small differences in trypsin proteolysis patterns. In contrast, significant differences were observed in DNA binding properties. Gly58+1 exhibited a decrease of ∼100-fold in affinity for O1 operator, and sequential Gly insertion C-terminal to Gln60 → Gly resulted in progressively decreased affinity for O1operator, approaching nonspecific levels for insertion of ≥2 glycines. Where sufficient affinity for O1 operator existed, decreased binding to O1 in the presence of inducer indicated no disruption in the allosteric response for these proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that flexibility and/or spacing between the core and N-terminal domains did not significantly affect folding or assembly, but these alterations in the hinge domain profoundly altered affinity of the lactose repressor protein for its wild-type target sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2076330550,"Although mutation of ras gene is rare in human breast cancer, overexpression of normal c-Ha-rasgene is frequently observed. Using a mouse mammary metastasis model consisting of genetically related mammary tumor sublines with variant metastatic potential, we have previously (i) demonstrated a direct correlation between c-Ha-ras mRNA and protein levels and metastatic potential and (ii) identified a novel hormone-responsive transcriptional regulatory element in intron 1 of the mouse c-Ha-ras gene that contains the consensus half-site of a glucocorticoid response element and flanking consensus half-sites for estrogen response element. Here, we have examined the functionality of intron 1 sequence in context of upstream sequences by using transient transfection assays with plasmids expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Intron 1 sequence and sequences similar to intron 1 element located in exon 1 function as transcriptional regulatory elements that confer hormonal inducibility to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression both independently and in context of 5′-flanking sequences. Measurement of c-Ha-rastranscription rates and protein expression by nuclear run-on and metabolic labeling assays showed a 5–12-fold enhancement, respectively, following treatment with 17β-estradiol that was blunted by ICI 182,780 in the nonmetastatic variant. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of c-Ha-ras transcripts and protein in the metastatic subline was unaffected by estrogen and ICI 182,780. Gel shift assays demonstrated specific interaction of c-Ha-rasexon 1 sequence with nuclear proteins of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with formation of two complexes, one of which contains estrogen receptor. Our data demonstrate a direct (i) interaction of c-Ha-ras sequence with estrogen receptor and (ii) stimulatory effect of estrogen on c-Ha-ras gene transcription and suggest that alteration in transcriptional regulation of c-Ha-ras gene by estrogen may play an important role in progression of breast cancer. Although mutation of ras gene is rare in human breast cancer, overexpression of normal c-Ha-rasgene is frequently observed.

Intron 1 sequence and sequences similar to intron 1 element located in exon 1 function as transcriptional regulatory elements that confer hormonal inducibility to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression both independently and in context of 5′-flanking sequences. Measurement of c-Ha-rastranscription rates and protein expression by nuclear run-on and metabolic labeling assays showed a 5–12-fold enhancement, respectively, following treatment with 17β-estradiol that was blunted by ICI 182,780 in the nonmetastatic variant. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of c-Ha-ras transcripts and protein in the metastatic subline was unaffected by estrogen and ICI 182,780. Gel shift assays demonstrated specific interaction of c-Ha-rasexon 1 sequence with nuclear proteins of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with formation of two complexes, one of which contains estrogen receptor. Our data demonstrate a direct (i) interaction of c-Ha-ras sequence with estrogen receptor and (ii) stimulatory effect of estrogen on c-Ha-ras gene transcription and suggest that alteration in transcriptional regulation of c-Ha-ras gene by estrogen may play an important role in progression of breast cancer. estradiol estrogen receptor estrogen response element glucocorticoid response element chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid Ras proteins are responsible for regulating the flow of information that is triggered by diverse extracellular signals that stimulate their respective cell surface receptors. The relay of their signals via ras proteins ultimately regulate the activities of nuclear transcription factors that control the expression of key genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation (1Bortner D.M. Langer S.J. Ostrowski M.C. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 137-160PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of transcription of members of the ras gene family plays an important role in controlling cell growth. Theras genes are classified as “housekeeping genes,” which are expressed at relatively constant levels in all tissues and stages of development. Alteration in structure and expression of theras gene family has been found in human tumors (2Bos J.L. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) as well as in animal tumor model systems (3Zarbl H. Sukumar S. Arthur A.V. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Nature. 1985; 315: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 4Balmain A. Pragnell I.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Sukumar S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 148: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although mutation ofras genes is rare in human breast cancers, 50% of human breast carcinomas express elevated levels of normal Ha-rasprotein (6De Biasi F. Del Sal G. Hand P.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Thor A. Ohuchi N. Hand P.H. Callahan R. Weeks M.O. Theillet C. Lidereau R. Escot C. Page D.L. Vilasi V. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar, 8Spandidos D.A. Agnantis N.J. Anticancer Res. 1984; 4: 269-272PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental induction of ras levels has been shown to lead to transformation of certain recipient cell types (9Chang E.H. Furth M.E. Scolnick E.M. Lowry D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Tumors that lack activated Ha-ras genes frequently show overexpression of ras proteins, perhaps a result of transcriptional deregulation of the ras gene (10Westaway D. Paplioff J. Moscorini C. Varmus C. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 5′ region of the murine Ha-ras gene is highly homologous with the 5′ upstream region of both the rat (11Damante G. Filetti S. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and human (12Reddy E.P. Science. 1983; 220: 1061-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) c-Ha-ras genes. The Ha-ras promoter regions for mouse, rat, and human are all very G-C rich and contain numerous repeats of the core consensus sequences for binding Sp1 transcription factor, lack TATA box, and contain a consensus sequence for the CAAT box. The cloned mouse Ha-ras upstream region has been shown to possess powerful transcriptional machinery when tested in transient gene expression assays in primary cultures of mouse epidermal cells (13Neades R. Betz N.A. Sheng X.Y. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This high level of expression in transfected cells is surprising in view of the low level of expression of the endogenous mouse Ha-ras gene in normal mouse epidermis (14Pelling J.C. Fischer S.M. Neades R. Strawhecker J. Schweickert L. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Pelling J.C. Ernst S.M. Strawhecker J.M. Johnson J.A. Nairn R.S. Slaga T.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1599-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that transcription of c-Ha-ras is tightly regulated in normal tissues, which when lost or deregulated could result in constitutive overexpression of Ha-ras that is frequently observed in tumor tissues. Estrogen plays a crucial role in cell growth and proliferation of reproductive tissues such as uterus and mammary gland (16Galand P. Leroy F. Chretien J. J. Endocrinol. 1971; 49: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Mueller G.C. Herranen A. Jervell K. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1958; 14: 95-99PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise role of estrogen in the biology of breast carcinogenesis is not known, the effects of estrogen on proliferation of target breast cells are believed to be mediated through transactivation of specific genes that are recognized by estradiol-estrogen receptor (E2-ER)1 complex. This process stimulates DNA synthesis, cell division, and production of biologically active proteins, such as pS2, tumor growth factor-α, and epidermal growth factor (18Adami H.O. Adams G. Boyle P. Ewertz M. Lee N.C. Lund E. Miller A.B. Olsson H. Steel M. Trichopoulos D Tulinius H. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 5: 22-39Google Scholar), that influence cell growth and differentiation. Although a sequence motif, 5′-GGTCGN3TGACC-3′, having 92% homology to the vitellogenin estrogen response element (ERE) and differing from the consensus sequence by one base, is present in the Ha-rasgene at position −1420 (numbered according to Brown et al. (19Brown K. Bailleul B. Ramsden M. Fee F. Krumlauf R. Balmain A. Mol. Carcinog. 1988; 1: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), no significant induction of transcription of reporter gene from the mouse Ha-ras promoter was observed in presence of estrogen in estrogen-dependent human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (13Neades R. Betz N.A. Sheng X.Y. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have previously reported identification of a novel dexamethasone-responsive transcriptional enhancer element in the intron 1 of the mouse c-Ha-ras gene (20Shekhar P.V.M. Miller F.R. Invasion Metastasis. 1994–95; 14: 27-37PubMed Google Scholar). This regulatory sequence contains the consensus half-site of a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) that is point mutated in a metastatic mammary tumor line and has three 5′-flanking ERE half-sites in its immediate vicinity. To investigate the relevance of sequences similar to ras intron 1 element in the hormonal regulation of Ha-ras gene expression, we carried out functional analysis of intron 1 in the presence of intron 0, a region that is conserved in mouse, rat, and human c-Ha-ras genes and previously demonstrated to possess strong transcriptional regulatory activity (21Telliez J.B. Plumb M. Balmain A. Bailleul B. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 12: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our data show that sequences similar to the ras intron 1 element are present both in exon 1 and intron 1 and confer strong estrogen and dexamethasone inducibility to CAT reporter gene expression independently or in context of 5′-flanking sequences. The presence of the naturally occurring point mutation in the consensus GRE half-site of the ras intron 1 element selectively eliminates inducibility by dexamethasone. Pretranslational control of Ha-ras synthesis by estrogen or dexamethasone could be exerted at transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional levels. To investigate the molecular sites of action of estrogen, we estimated the relative rates of Ha-ras gene transcription following treatment with 17β-estradiol in two genetically related mouse mammary tumor sublines with variant metastatic capacities. Our data show that E2 enhances Ha-ras gene transcription in the otherwise low ras-expressing nonmetastatic variant and has no effect on constitutive overexpression observed in the metastatic subline. The E2-mediated enhancement of Ha-rassynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level and is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Gel shift assays demonstrated specific interaction of Ha-ras exon 1 sequence with nuclear proteins of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with formation of two specific complexes, one of which contains estrogen receptor. This is the first report demonstrating direct (i) interaction of Ha-ras sequence with estrogen receptor and (ii) stimulatory effect of estrogen on Ha-ras gene transcription and suggests that alteration in transcriptional regulation of Ha-ras gene by estrogen may play an important role in progression of breast cancer. In this study we have utilized MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line and two mouse mammary tumor sister sublines that are highly tumorigenic but differ in their ability to complete specific steps of the metastatic cascade (22Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). Line 168FAR is nonmetastatic because of a defect in its ability to extravasate, whereas the related 4T1 subline is highly metastatic and metastasizes spontaneously from the orthotopic site to lungs and liver (22Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). 168FAR and 4T1 sublines are grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmnonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Both sublines used for the study had been maintained in culture for <20 passages. MCF-7 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For hormone response studies, cells were stripped of endogenous steroids by successive passages in phenol red-free medium supplemented with sera that were unable to support growth of the ER-positive estrogen-dependent cell line, MCF-7, indicating absence of biologically significant levels of E2 or other estrogenic compounds. To generate 5′ deletions within the proximal mouse c-Ha-ras regulatory region, fragments containing various lengths of the previously characterized positive regulatory region, intron 0, but including the entire intron 1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA isolated from normal mouse liver. Fig. 1 illustrates the position of primers used for PCR amplification of the ras fragments, YQ, ZQ, WQ, and PQ, used in the study. PQras containing the naturally occurring A → G nucleotide change at base 210 of the mouse Ha-ras gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from the 4T1 subline. The minimal glucocorticoid-responsive transcriptional regulatory sequence,ras intron 1 element, was used as a 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide (base 191–220) with and without the A → G nucleotide change at base 210 of the mouse Ha-ras gene (Fig. 1). The human c-Ha-ras exon 1 sequence, 5′-GTGCGCTGACCATCCAGCTGATCCAGAACC-3′ (base 1713–1742; GenBankTM accession number J00277; Ref. 23Reddy E.P. Reynolds R.K. Santos E. Barbacid M. Nature. 1982; 300: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) that shares 80% homology with the 10 base pair palindrome (underlined regions) in the mouse Ha-ras intron 1 was also used as a 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide. DNA fragments were blunt end-ligated upstream of the −37-base thymidine kinase (TK) gene promoter driving the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (p-37TK-CAT; Ref 24Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The minimal TK promoter contains only the binding site for RNA polymerase II (24Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All plasmids were sequenced to verify their insertion, sequence, and orientation. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: 5′-CGCGTTGGGCCCGAACCAG-3′ (Y+); 5′-GGAGGGTCCTTCTCCAGC-3′ (Z+); 5′-GGTTCCTCACACAGCGATTAAG-3′ (W+); 5′-GCCCTGACCATCCAGCTGATC-3′ (P+); and 3′-TCTCCCCATCAATGACCACC-5′ (Q-). 168FAR, 4T1, and MCF-7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (25Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). One day prior to transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or fetal calf serum as discussed above. Cells were fed with fresh phenol red-free medium 3 h prior to transfection with 10 μg of the appropriate recombinant or empty plasmid DNAs. When β-galactosidase expression was used as an internal control, 5 μg of plasmid pSVβ-gal (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) was added. Following 6 h of transfection, medium was removed, and cells were shocked with 10% glycerol. After washes with phosphate buffered saline, cells were grown in phenol red-free media supplemented with E2(0.001–10 nm; Sigma), dexamethasone (0.01–1000 nm; Sigma), or vehicle (ethanol to final concentration of 0.01%, v/v). The specificity of the hormone-induced effects were tested by including the inhibitors, ICI 182,780 (a gift from Dr. A. Wakeling, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, UK) or RU486 (Center de Recherche Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France) at 100-fold molar excess of E2 or dexamethasone, respectively. Cells were harvested 48 h later for measurement of CAT activity. CAT assays were done as described by Gorman et al. (26Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's directions. For quantitation, the acetylated and nonacetylated spots were scraped from the TLC plates, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Results are expressed as fold induction produced by E2 or dexamethasone relative to control based on acetylated chloramphenicol formed per unit protein or per unit β-galactosidase activity. There was no significant difference in induction when radioactivity was normalized by protein or β-galactosidase activity. c-Ha-ras, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from 2 μg of RNA prepared from normal mouse liver in the presence of 1 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 20 μm random primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 units/μl reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature and 1 h at 42 °C followed by 10 min at 95 °C. PCR was performed using 0.5 μm concentration of each primer pair and 0.5 unit ofTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers used for Ha-ras cDNA amplification were 5′-ACGTATGACAGAATACAAG-3′ (−4/+15; Ref. 19Brown K. Bailleul B. Ramsden M. Fee F. Krumlauf R. Balmain A. Mol. Carcinog. 1988; 1: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and 3′-CACTCTCATCAGGCGGGTTCAG-5′ (+532/+511; GenBankTM accession number X00740); β-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCAGGCACCAA-3′ (+25/+44) and 3′-GATGGAGCCACCGATCCACA-5′ (+938/+919; GenBankTM accession number X03765); GAPDH, 5′-CCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGT-3′ (+146/+171) and 3′-CATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTT-5′ (+733/+ 713; GenBankTMaccession number M32599). The following conditions were employed for PCR amplification: Ha-ras cDNA, 95 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 2 min and 65 °C for 3 min; β-actin, 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min; GAPDH cDNA, 95 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. PCR products were further characterized by restriction mapping and cDNAs purified from gel slices following separation by electrophoresis. 32P-Labeled probes for Ha-rasand GAPDH cDNAs were random primed (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 1–2 × 108 cpm/μg. Ha-ras mRNA transcription rate was measured by nuclear run-on assay (27Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1983: 4.10-4.10.4Google Scholar). 1 × 106 168FAR or 4T1 cells were seeded in 75-cm2culture flasks in phenol red-free medium as described above. When cells reached ∼60% confluence, fresh medium containing the appropriate ligand(s) were added for the indicated times: 1 nmE2 (2, 6, 12, or 24 h), 1 nmE2 + 100-fold molar excess of ICI 182,780 (6 h), or vehicle (0.01% ethanol, v/v; 6 h). Cells were lysed on ice in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Run-on transcription was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction mixture containing 1 × 107 nuclei, 5 mmeach of ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in a final volume of 200 μl. After RNase-free DNase I (75 units) and proteinase K (200 μg/ml) digestions, the labeled reactions were extracted with phenol chloroform (v/v) and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v). The precipitation procedure was repeated with ethanol, and the RNA pellets were resuspended in 10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl at 5 × 106 cpm/ml. 10 μg of cDNAs for c-Ha-ras and β-actin prepared as described above were denatured by 0.4m NaOH treatment for 30 min at room temperature, neutralized with 2 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, and applied to Magna Charge nylon membranes (Microseparations Inc., Westborough, MA) using a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide (v/v), 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized with 5 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled RNAs at 65 °C for 3 days in prehybridization buffer. Membranes were extensively washed with increasing stringency and subjected to autoradiography. Several different exposure times were chosen to obtain densitometric scans in the linear response range of the x-ray film. The autoradiograms were analyzed by measurement of band densities by scanner-densitometer (model 300A, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Ha-ras band densities were expressed as a ratio to β-actin. 168FAR cells were grown in phenol red-free medium as described above. Cells were treated with vehicle (0.01% ethanol, v/v), 1 nm E2, or a combination of 1 nm E2 and 100-fold molar excess of pure antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, for 6 h. Media were then removed, rinsed, and replaced with fresh medium or medium containing actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and incubated for another 6 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by slot blot method. 10 μg of total RNA was denatured by heating at 65 °C in 2.2 m formaldehyde and applied on Magna Charge nylon transfer membrane (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA) by vacuum filtration using a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The integrity and specificity of Ha-ras mRNAs in the samples were tested by Northern blotting. Filters were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with random primed 32P-labeled c-Ha-ras cDNA in buffer containing 6× SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.5% SDS. Filters were washed with 1× SSC and subjected to autoradiography. Loading of RNA was monitored by rehybridizing stripped membranes to32P-labeled GAPDH probe. Amounts of c-Ha-rasmRNA relative to GAPDH bands were quantitated with a scanner-densitometer (model 300A, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). Exponentially growing 168FAR or 4T1 cells (5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were incubated in methionine- and phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum supplemented with vehicle, 1 nm E2, or a combination of 1 nm E2 plus 100-fold molar excess of ICI 182,780 and 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (specific activity 1083 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Cells were labeled for 12 h, after which the monolayers were gently rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 1,000 × g and used immediately for immunoprecipitation of c-Ha-ras protein. Lysate volumes containing equivalent amounts of radiolabel incorporated into trichloroacetic acid insoluble material (∼107 cpm) were immunoprecipitated by incubating overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of mouse monoclonal anti c-Ha-ras antibody (clone F235–1.7.1; Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) or normal mouse IgG. Protein A/G Sepharose (Oncogene Science) was then added to the lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic separation, gels were processed for fluorography and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. Amounts of c-Ha-ras protein bands were quantitated with a scanner-densitometer as described above. Nuclear extracts were made by the procedure of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 14755Crossref Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) from estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bradford protein assay; Bio-Rad). Three pairs of complimentary oligonucleotides were used for DNA binding assays: (i) wild type intron-1, 5′-GTTATGGGGTATGATCCATCAGGGTATCAG-3′, which contains the palindromic sequence (underlined region) found between nucleotides 191 and 220 of the mouse c-Ha-ras gene; (ii) exon 1 sequence, 5′-GTGCGCTGACCATCCAGCTGATCCAGAACC-3′, found between nucleotides 1713 and 1742 of the human c-Ha-ras gene (23Reddy E.P. Reynolds R.K. Santos E. Barbacid M. Nature. 1982; 300: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar); and (iii) NF-1, 5′-TGGGGCTTGGTCATGGGCCATCAGCGCATG-3′, a putative NF-1 binding element occurring in hepatitis B virus enhancer region (nucleotides 1209–1238; Ref. 29Galibert F. Mandart E. Fitoussi F. Tiollais P. Charnay P. Nature. 1979; 281: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) to test specificity of binding. This oligonucleotide was chosen because the underlined sequence has 80% homology to the palindrome in the ras wild type intron-1. The oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl containing 20,000–25,000 cpm (0.5 ng) of 32P-labeled double-stranded human exon 1 DNA fragment, 2 μg of the synthetic copolymer poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 12% glycerol) and 2.5 μg of MCF-7 nuclear proteins for 20 min at room temperature. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. In competition experiments, indicated amounts of unlabeled double-stranded competitor (human exon 1 motif, wild type mouse Ha-rasintron 1 element or NF-1 sequence) were added together with the labeled human exon 1 probe. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min in binding buffer with 0.5 μg of ER antibodies or equivalent amounts of rat or mouse preimmune IgG before the addition of the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. The following ER antibodies were used: rat monoclonal ER antibody H222 and D75 (a generous gift from Dr. Geoffrey Greene) and mouse monoclonal ER antibody clone 33 (Affinity BioReagents, Neshanic Station, NJ). The gels were dried and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −80 °C. Previous studies have identified the presence of functional GREs and a putative ERE in the distal promoter region of the murine Ha-ras gene at nucleotides −1506, −1655, and −1420, respectively (13Neades R. Betz N.A. Sheng X.Y. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the GREs conferred responsiveness to dexamethasone in transient reporter gene expression assays, the putative ERE failed to confer estrogen inducibility to the Ha-ras promoter in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (13Neades R. Betz N.A. Sheng X.Y. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have previously reported identification of a transcription enhancing palindromic sequence in the intron 1 of the mouse c-Ha-ras gene that confers dexamethasone responsiveness to CAT reporter gene (20Shekhar P.V.M. Miller F.R. Invasion Metastasis. 1994–95; 14: 27-37PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the functional relevance of this sequence in the regulation of c-Ha-ras gene expression in two genetically related mouse mammary tumor subpopulations that differ in metastatic potentials (22Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar) and Ha-ras mRNA and protein expression levels (30Shekhar P.V.M. Lane M.A. Werdell J. Christman J.K. Miller F.R. Cancer Mol. Biol. 1995; 2: 529-539Google Scholar). We constructed reporter plasmids containing the minimal 30-bp ras intron 1 element (+191/+220) with (pmutras) and without (pwtras) the naturally occurring point mutation (A → G at nucleotide 210) identified in 4T1 subline (Fig. 1). Reporter plasmids containing the entire intron 1 and various lengths of 5′ sequences, pYQras (−686/+355), pZQras (−545/+355), pWQras (−246/+355), and pPQras (+51/+355) were also constructed (Fig. 1). All these sequences were ligated upstream of the −37 TK promoter, which in turn was linked to the bacterial CAT gene and the SV-40 poly(A) signal.

The released TGFβ1 can then act on nearby vascular cells to mediate subsequent vessel repair. In addition, TGFβ1 may circulate to bone marrow and regulate megakaryocyte activity. It is not known what effect, if any, TGFβ1 has on platelets. Adult TGFβ1-deficient mice exhibit thrombocythemia and a mild bleeding disorder that is shown to result from faulty platelet aggregation. TGFβ1-deficient platelets are shown to contain functional receptors, and preincubation with recombinant TGFβ1 improves aggregation, demonstrating that TGFβ1 plays an active role in platelet aggregation. TGFβ1-deficient platelets fail to retain bound fibrinogen in response to aggregation agonists, but they possess normal levels of the αIIb/β3 fibrinogen receptor. Signaling from agonist receptors is normal because the platelets change shape, produce thromboxane A2, and present P-selectin in response to stimulation. Consequently, activation and maintenance of αIIb/β3 into a fibrinogen-binding conformation is impaired in the absence of TGFβ1. 4-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment and protein kinase C activity measurements suggest a defect downstream of protein kinase C in its activation cascade. Because platelets lack nuclei, these data demonstrate for the first time a non-transcriptionally mediated TGFβ1 signaling pathway that enhances the activation and maintenance of integrin function.

Normally inactive, platelets adhere to vascular matrices exposed during injury and become activated (1Vlodavsky I. Eldor A. HyAm E. Atzom R. Fuks Z. Thromb.

Storage granules are then mobilized to the platelet surface, releasing a variety of molecules that mediate subsequent hemostatic events (3Rink T.J. Smith S.W. Tsien R.Y. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). TGFβ11 is stored in large amounts as a latent peptide in the secretory α-granules of circulating platelets and is one of the molecules released during platelet activation (4Assoian R.K. Komoriya A.

Active platelets can release enough TGFβ1 to raise the local concentration of TGFβ1 to as much as 40 ng/ml at the injury site and in the developing thrombus (5Grainger D.J. Wakefield L. Bethell H.W.

In nucleated cells, members of the Smad gene family are believed the primary mediators of intracellular signaling from the TGFβ receptor types I and II (12Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

These findings suggest that there are possible transcription-independent signaling pathways for TGFβ1 (19Sandhu C. Garbe J. Bhattacharya N. Daksis J. Pan C.H. Yaswen P. Koh J. Slingerland J.M. Stampfer M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2458-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary defect in the TGFβ1-deficient mouse is a severe multifocal inflammatory disease resulting in death by the 3rd week after birth (20Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J.

Genetic combination of Tgfb1 knockout and Scid alleles eliminates the inflammation and increases longevity by 3–5 months (23Diebold R.J. Eis M.J. Yin M. Ormsby I. Boivin G.P. Darrow B.J. Saffitz J.E. Doetschman T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12215-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), thereby permitting investigation of adult phenotypes primary to the absence of TGFβ1 and not compromised by secondary effects resulting from inflammation. Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice have thrombocythemia and a mild bleeding disorder that is associated with faulty platelet aggregation resulting from a failure to sustain fibrinogen binding. Preincubation with active TGFβ1 improves platelet aggregation, indicating the presence of a TGFβ1 signaling pathway in platelets. Because TGFβ1 signaling in platelets is necessarily independent of transcription, these results demonstrate the existence of a non-transcriptional TGFβ1 signaling pathway that mediates platelet function by affecting the state of integrin activation. Tgfb1 −/− mice are on a mixed strain background of 129S2/SvPas × BL/Swiss × CF-1 (approximately 25%, 25%, and 50%, respectively) (20Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar). To place the null Tgfb1 allele on an immune-compromised background, they were back-crossed for three generations to C3H mice homozygous for theScid allele (23Diebold R.J. Eis M.J. Yin M. Ormsby I. Boivin G.P. Darrow B.J. Saffitz J.E. Doetschman T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12215-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For all strains, experimental animals were obtained through Scid Tgfb1 +/− ×Scid Tgfb1 +/− matings. When possible, Scid Tgfb1 +/+ andScid Tgfb1 +/− siblings of Scid Tgfb1 −/− offspring were used as controls. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture of anesthetized mice using EDTA (10 mm) as an anticoagulant. Platelets in diluted whole blood were counted in duplicate with a thin hemocytometer under 100× phase microscopy. Bone marrow was collected from bare femurs and tibiae of mice by flushing with a 10-ml empty syringe fitted with a 21-gauge needle rinsed with 10 mm EDTA. Drops of marrow were smeared on glass slides and stained with Wright and Giemsa stains. The average number of megakaryocytes per 10× field covering the entire smear was determined. Bleeding times were determined by a previously reported method (24Oyekan A.O. Onabanjo A.O. Haemostasis. 1991; 21: 360-369PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the base of each tail was treated with a depilatory, cleaned with alcohol, and air-dried. A puncture was made along the lateral side of the tail using a sterile lancet with a blade depth of 2.5 mm and width of 1.5 mm (Microlance; Becton and Dickinson). The average bleeding time was measured by constant observation under a dissecting microscope while blotting with filter paper every 15 s so that the bleeding stop could be accurately observed. Measurements from three separate punctures were made for each mouse. Blood samples were collected with a butterfly needle (25 g × 3/8, 3.5-inch tubing, Abbott Laboratories) and a 3-ml syringe containing 3.8% sodium citrate through a clean abdominal vena cava puncture. Typically, we obtained 0.6–0.8 ml of blood from Scid Tgfb1 +/+ mice and 0.5–0.6 of blood fromScid Tgfb1 −/− mice. A blood:citrate ratio of approximately 6:1 was used in the collections by using 100 μl and 80 μl of citrate for Scid Tgfb1 +/+ and Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice, respectively. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of blood at 150 ×g for 15 min. The remaining portion was then centrifuged 10 min at 2000 rpm to recover platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Previous experience indicated that samples showing signs of red blood cell hemolysis did not perform well and thus were discarded. PRP recovered from 3–5 mice were pooled and the platelet concentration adjusted to 3 × 108 platelets/ml with PPP. Aggregation experiments were performed with 225 μl of PRP at 37 °C with constant stirring in an optical aggregometer (Chrono-log Corp.). Aggregation was initiated by adding 25 μl of 10× agonist. Experiments involving thrombin included 0.25 mmglycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline peptide (GPRP, Sigma), to prevent fibrin clot formation (25Warkentin T.E. Powling M.J. Hardisty R.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 76: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For experiments involving preincubation with TGFβ1, 250 μl of PRP was incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h with active recombinant human TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) prior to performing the aggregation experiment. Detection of bound fibrinogen was carried out essentially as described previously (25Warkentin T.E. Powling M.J. Hardisty R.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 76: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 platelets in 3–5 μl of PRP were added to a tube containing 50 μl of HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, pH7.4) and 5 μl of FITC-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human fibrinogen antibody (Dako Patts) with or without 5 μl of ADP (10 μm final), the radiolabeled TXA2 mimetic ((1S-[1α,2β(5Z),3α(1E,3R*),4α])- 7-(3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4′-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl)-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP), 10 μm final) or thrombin (0.4 units/ml final). After incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, 0.5 ml of 0.2% formalin was added. To follow the release of bound fibrinogen by platelets, the anti-fibrinogen antibody was added at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min after stimulation by ADP to separate aliquots of PRP diluted in HEPES buffer. The experiment continued as described above. For detection of P-selectin, 1 μg of a FITC-conjugated monoclonal rat antibody to mouse P-selectin (PharMingen) was used in place of the anti-fibrinogen antibody and was present at the time of agonist addition. Samples stimulated with thrombin contained 0.25 mm GPRP. Analysis was performed on a FACSTAR instrument (Becton Dickinson) using the FACSTAR Lysis II software. Specificity of the anti-fibrinogen antibody for fibrinogen was determined in two ways. Wild type platelets were activated in the presence of a FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse T lymphocyte antibody (Thy1.2, PharMingen) to control for nonspecific binding of IgG by platelets. In the other control experiments, an excess of non-immune rabbit IgG was included with the anti-fibrinogen antibody during platelet activation. Activated wild type mouse platelets gave a slightly higher background signal with the anti-Thy1 antibody than resting platelets incubated with the anti-fibrinogen antibody. The excess IgG did not affect the positive fluorescent peak typically obtained with activated wild type platelets (data not shown). PAC-1, an antibody that specifically recognizes the activated form of human αIIb/β3 (26Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not interact with the mouse platelets (from eitherTgfb1 +/+ or Tgfb1 −/−mice) used in our experiments. PRP containing 2 × 107 platelets was incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm ADP at 37 °C for 10 min without stirring. Samples were immediately centrifuged and the supernatants transferred to fresh tubes. An aliquot (25 μl) from each supernatant and plasma collected during preparation of the PRP were assayed for thromboxane B2 levels using a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay (Biotrak, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Identification of platelet surface TGFβ1-binding proteins was performed by affinity cross-linking of125I-TGFβ1 with disuccinimidyl suberate (27Massague J. Like B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were collected by venipuncture and washed twice with cold binding buffer (128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm HEPES, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7.5) containing 1 μm prostacyclin to prevent activation. Washed platelets (3 × 107) were incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h with 150 pm125I-TGFβ1 in 0.5 ml of binding buffer. All incubations were performed in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes to minimize binding of the125I-TGFβ1 to tube surfaces. Following three washes in cold binding buffer, platelets were incubated in 0.5 ml of binding buffer with 0.25 mm disuccinimidyl suberate at 4 °C for 15 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by washing the platelets twice in cold stop buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Each platelet pellet was solubilized for 40 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of detergent buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged to remove the insoluble material and the supernatants boiled for 5 min in an equal volume of SDS loading buffer under reducing (50 mm dithiothreitol) or non-reducing (no dithiothreitol) conditions. Samples were separated on a 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–2 days. Confluent cultures of human iliac vein endothelial cells (HIVE) in 100-mm dishes were collected without trypsin and affinity-labeled as above. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating HIVE with 7.5 nm cold TGFβ1 (a 50-fold excess) for 30 min before the addition of 125I-TGFβ1. The extent of phosphorylation of a protein kinase C (PKC)-specific peptide substrate by platelet lysates was measured using a kit supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All procedures were performed on ice and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal numbers of platelets (3 × 107) in PRP were centrifuged, washed with calcium-free Tyrode's buffer, and sonicated in lysis buffer. 25 μl of lysate was added to a mixture containing reaction buffer, artificial membranes, 10 μm4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), peptide substrate, and [γ-32P]ATP. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped with acid and the peptide substrate was captured on binding paper, washed in acid, and counted in a scintillation counter. Controls included reactions lacking platelet lysates or the peptide substrate to determine background counts and endogenous PKC substrate levels, respectively. Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice exhibit outward signs of a mild bleeding disorder. Brains of 5/6Scid Tgfb1 −/− neonates exhibited multiple petechia indicative of microhemorrhages, while none of theScid Tgfb1 +/+ neonates examined (0/4) had this condition. Adult Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice routinely have “flushed” small bowels that show no signs of inflammation by histology. Furthermore, these mice tend to bleed more readily from incisions.Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice have bleeding times nearly twice as long as wild type litter-mates (TableI). The numbers of peripheral blood platelets in both Scid and non-Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice are elevated approximately 3-fold over those from Scid or non-Scid Tgfb1 +/+ and Scid or non-Scid Tgfb1+/− controls. Megakaryocyte counts from bone marrow are also significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in all Scid or non-Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice.Table IPlatelet counts, megakaryocyte counts, and bleeding timesPlatelet countMegakaryocyte count/10× fieldLateral tail stick bleeding time+/+, +/−−/−+/+, +/−−/−+/+, +/−−/−× 103/mm3sScid (C3H)188 ± 34578 ± 129*3.0 ± 0.55.4 ± 1.1*97.6 ± 4.4190 ± 5.0**129 BSw CF1163 ± 54550 ± 190**3.0 ± 0.95.0 ± 1.8***ND129 BSw CF1 mice are 129S2/SvPas × Black/Swiss × CF-1.Scid (C3H) refers to 129 BlSw CF1 mice backcrossed for three generations to a C3H strain homozygous for theScid locus.

To test for a deficiency in platelet aggregation, PRP collected from mice via venipuncture was assayed for aggregation competence. When stimulated with the agonists ADP, collagen, or the TXA2 analog I-BOP (28Dorn G.W. DeJesus A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H327-H334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets fail to properly aggregate as compared with Scid Tgfb1 +/+control platelets (Fig. 1). Similar results are obtained with ADP using platelets recovered fromRag2 −/− Tgfb1 −/−mice, which also have no inflammatory disease (data not shown).Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets show a range of aggregation responses to 10 μm ADP from approximately 0–80% of controls. In contrast to ADP-mediated responses, Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets consistently fail to aggregate properly following stimulation with either 20 μg/ml collagen or 1 μm I-BOP. TGFβ1-deficient platelets that show an 80% aggregation response to ADP fail to aggregate when stimulated with I-BOP (data not shown), indicating an agonist-specific aggregation response that is not due to variability in platelet collection. Unlike these other agonists, thrombin induces maximal, yet delayed, aggregation in platelets fromScid Tgfb1 −/− and Scid Tgfb1 +/+ mice (Fig. 1). Flow cytometry experiments using a fluorescent antibody to fibrinogen reveals that only 39 ± 25% (n = 7) of Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets bind normal levels of fibrinogen after stimulation with ADP as compared with 75 ± 15% (n = 7) of platelets from littermate controls (Fig.2 A). In response to I-BOP, only 46 ± 9% (n = 3) of Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets bind normal levels of fibrinogen compared with 75 ± 8% (n = 3) of control platelets. Similar numbers of Scid Tgfb1 −/− and control platelets bind normal levels of fibrinogen in response to thrombin (Fig. 2 B) (96 ± 3% versus 97 ± 2%, respectively), consistent with the ability of thrombin to induce full aggregation. The reduced fraction of Scid Tgfb1 −/−platelets that bound fibrinogen after stimulation with ADP reflects the fact that these platelets release fibrinogen faster thanScid Tgfb1 +/+ control platelets following ADP activation (Fig. 2 C). Normal fibrinogen binding in response to thrombin indicates normal levels of αIIb/β3 receptors on TGFβ1-deficient platelets, which was confirmed by flow cytometric measurement of αIIb/β3 receptor density. TGFβ1-deficient platelets exhibit β3-specific mean fluorescence/platelet of 59.1 ± 16.4 (n = 3) versus46.2 ± 8.6 (n = 4) for control platelets. Plasma from TGFβ1-deficient mice contains normal levels of calcium and fibrinogen and can support normal aggregation of wild type platelets in response to ADP (data not shown). Platelets from Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice exhibit a rapid shape change in response to agonists as detected by the drop in light transmission during in vitro aggregation to ADP, I-BOP, and collagen (Fig. 1). In addition, TGFβ1-deficient platelets produce normal levels of TXA2 and mobilize P-selectin to the platelet surface in response to ADP (Table II). P-selectin levels of non-stimulated platelets from both Scid Tgfb1 −/− and Tgfb1 +/+mice were similar to background levels, indicating that our collection protocol does not prestimulate the platelets (Table II). Stimulation ofScid Tgfb1 −/− platelets with PMA, which activates PKC independently of receptor-mediated upstream events, also results in delayed aggregation (Fig.3 A). However, when measured directly, total PKC activity in Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets is not different from control platelets (Fig. 3 A), indicating that there is no reduction in PKC enzymes. Consequently, the defect in aggregation lies downstream of PKC in its activation cascade.Table IIProduction of thromboxane B2 and expression of P-selectin following ADP activationScid Tgfb1 +/+Scid Tgfb1 −/−TXB2aThromboxane B2 (TXB2) (pg/μl), a stable metabolite of TXA2, in plasma or supernatants of 1.6 × 107 platelets (in PRP) activated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μm ADP was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

To test if the presence of TGFβ1 affects platelet aggregation, Scid Tgfb1 −/−platelets were incubated with human recombinant TGFβ1 before and during ADP stimulation.

The degree of rescue by TGFβ1 is independent of the extent of aggregation by TGFβ1-deficient platelets prior to addition of TGFβ1. Those platelets that initially fail to respond to ADP show the same absolute degree of response when preincubated with TGFβ1 as do platelets from Scid Tgfb1 −/−mice that exhibit 80% responsiveness to ADP alone (Fig.3 B). Co-incubation with a neutralizing antibody against TGFβ1 prevents the effect of added TGFβ1 on aggregation (data not shown). In order for the added TGFβ1 to facilitate aggregation, it is necessary to preincubate mutant platelets with at least 20 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 1 h or longer before inducing aggregation. Shorter incubation times or lower concentrations result in no improvements to aggregation. Furthermore, the addition of TGFβ1 to wild type platelets has no effect on aggregation responses to ADP, nor does TGFβ1 alone induce aggregation in either Scid Tgfb1 −/− or Scid Tgfb1+/+platelets (data not shown). The effect of exogenous TGFβ1 on Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets demonstrates that TGFβ1 signals in platelets. To address whether the receptors are present to mediate TGFβ1 signaling, we examined mouse platelets for125I-TGFβ1 binding. Platelets from both Scid Tgfb1 +/+ and Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice bind 125I-TGFβ1 mainly through types I and II receptors (Fig.4). Human platelets also have the type II receptor (data not shown). In contrast to human iliac vein endothelial cells, murine platelets do not possess endoglin. Furthermore, murine platelets lack the type III receptor. Mice lacking TGFβ1 produce increased numbers of bone marrow megakaryocytes and circulating platelets. Previous studies have indicated that TGFβ1 inhibits bone marrow-derived megakaryocyte growth, colony formation, and platelet production (29Ishibashi T. Miller S.L. Burstein S.A. Blood. 1987; 69: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kuter D.J. Gminski D.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 619-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zauli G. Vitale L.

Hematol. 1992; 20: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar). The results observed in both the Scid and non-Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice are consistent with this role for TGFβ1 as a negative regulator of megakaryocyte growth and hence platelet production. Additionally, these mice exhibit a mild bleeding disorder characterized by a 2-fold longer bleeding time, cerebral petechia in neonates, and a “flushed” appearing small bowel in adults. Associated with the elevated platelet numbers is an aggregation deficiency in response to ADP, collagen and I-BOP, a TXA2analog. Thrombin, a potent platelet agonist, induces slightly delayed but full aggregation. The platelet aggregation defect is sufficient to explain the bleeding disorder. However, contributing factors such as vascular fragility or endothelial cell dysfunction cannot be discounted. Essential thrombocythemia, a human myeloproliferative disorder, is characterized by clonal expansion of megakaryocytes, persistent elevated platelet counts, and abnormal platelet function (33Tobelem G. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1989; 2: 719-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Wehmeier A. Sudhoff T. Meierkord F. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1997; 23: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The similarities between TGFβ1-deficient mice and essential thrombocythemia patients suggest that defects in the TGFβ1 signaling pathway or a pathway regulated by TGFβ1 may be altered in essential thrombocythemia patients. Platelet aggregation in response to ADP is poor but variable. The cause of this variability is not clear. Platelets from Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice that responded well to ADP failed to aggregate in response to the thromboxane A2 analog, I-BOP, suggesting that the variability is specific to ADP. The difference in responses to ADP and I-BOP also indicates that, unlike human platelets, murine platelets do not depend on TXA2 as an intermediate in ADP-stimulated aggregation. Recently, murine platelets were shown to be insensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors (35Johnson E.N. Brass L.F. Funk C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), consistent with our observations. From this, we conclude that ADP activates mouse platelets through a direct, TXA2-independent pathway and that ADP is a stronger platelet agonist in mouse than in human. Thus, the variability in Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelet response to ADP may reflect the strong stimulation by ADP that can partially override the defect. Even though TGFβ1-deficient platelets do not aggregate properly in response to ADP, they do change shape and generate TXA2. Furthermore, TGFβ1-deficient platelets exhibit normal agonist-induced α-granule secretion. However, platelets from Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice exhibit impaired fibrinogen binding, which can fully account for the defective aggregation. These observations suggest that this defect occurs late in the activation cascade, specific to αIIb/β3 activation. Similar to Scid Tgfb1 −/− mouse platelets, normal human platelets treated with phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors change shape, produce thromboxane, and mobilize P-selectin in response to agonists. However, PI3-K-inhibited platelets are unable to induce and maintain αIIb/β3in an active form (36Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The similarity strongly suggests the aggregation defect observed in Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets reflects impaired PI3-K-mediated αIIb/β3 activation. Our results show that murine platelets bind TGFβ1 through a competent TGFβ type I/II receptor system. Binding of TGFβ1 to both receptor types requires receptor heterodimerization, thereby forming the active signaling complex (38Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In murine platelets binding of125I-TGFβ1 to both types I and II receptors indicates that heterodimerization is occurring. Unlike endothelial cells, which share a common lineage with platelets, murine platelets do not bind TGFβ1 through endoglin (Fig. 4). Furthermore, platelets do not posses the type III binding protein. Thus, any TGFβ1-derived signals would be transduced from primarily the classic type I/II receptor system. Because platelets lack a nucleus, TGFβ1 must be regulating platelet activity independent of transcription. In other cell types the type II TGFβ receptor can interact with the α subunit of farnesyltransferase (18Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Wang T. Danielson P.D. Li B.Y. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K. Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that TGFβ1 may be affecting protein prenylation states in platelets. In addition, TGFβ1 can regulate protein translation and stability (19Sandhu C. Garbe J. Bhattacharya N. Daksis J. Pan C.H. Yaswen P. Koh J. Slingerland J.M. Stampfer M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2458-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Finder J. Stark W.W.J. Nakayama D.K. Geller D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L862-L867PubMed Google Scholar) and may play a similar role in platelets. The length of preincubation required for TGFβ1 to facilitate platelet function is consistent with either of these two mechanisms. Preliminary studies using puromycin suggest that TGFβ1 does not signal through protein translation (data not shown). Further studies involving TGFβ1-deficient mouse platelets should prove useful in identifying non-nuclear mediators of TGFβ signaling and may reveal additional insights into platelet activation mechanisms. Preincubating platelets from Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice with active TGFβ1 facilitates aggregation. However, TGFβ1 alone does not induce aggregation. Thus TGFβ1 augments rather than initiates aggregation. The time of TGFβ1 preincubation (>1 h) needed to affect platelet activity and the relatively short time of ADP aggregation (5 min) suggest that TGFβ1 is not acting during platelet aggregation. Instead, it may precondition the platelet to ensure a vigorous response in conditions requiring rapid and complete formation of a hemostatic plug. In this regard, the long preincubation period may mimic the continual exposure to low levels of TGFβ1 during the life of the platelet in the wild type mouse. This may also explain why platelets from control mice are unresponsive to exogenous TGFβ1. Plasma contains low levels of circulating, active TGFβ1 bound to carriers such as α-macroglobulin (41Kropf J. Schurek J.O. Wollner A. Gressner A.M. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 42Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The presence of the TGFβ1 carriers in the plasma ofScid Tgfb1 −/− mice may account for why a relatively large amount of TGFβ1 (20 ng/ml) was needed to improve aggregation responses of Scid Tgfb1 −/− platelets. Presumably, these carrier molecules are depleted of TGFβ1 in the Scid Tgfb1 −/− mice and may sequester a significant portion of the exogenously added active TGFβ1 during our experiments. In conclusion, the absence of TGFβ1 in mice leads to compromised platelet aggregation resulting in a mild bleeding disorder. The inability of TGFβ1-deficient platelets to aggregate properly is due to faulty fibrinogen binding involving downstream targets of PKC (e.g. PI3-K). The compromise in platelet activity within theScid Tgfb1 −/− mouse demonstrates that TGFβ1 is important in hemostatic activities other than putative vascular cell regulation. Because platelets lack a nucleus, such activities would be independent of nuclear-mediated responses such as gene transcription.

An E2F-like sequence was found not to bind protein, and its removal did not affect promoter activity. This was supported by the observation that cotransfection of a hamster TK reporter gene construct with E2F-1 does not lead to transactivation of the promoter. A 122-base pair region that contains a single Sp1 site, a CCAAT box, and a TATA element was found to be sufficient for serum-responsive expression of a reporter gene.

Mammalian cells carry two TK genes, one coding for the mitochondrial enzyme and the other one for the cytoplasmic enzyme, which is the subject of this report. The expression of cytoplasmic TK is strongly growth- and cell cycle-regulated at the transcriptional as well as at several post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in Refs. 1Wintersberger E. Rotheneder H. Grabner M. Beck G. Seiser C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 2Wintersberger E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TK mRNA is hardly detectable in growth-arrested cells, whereas its synthesis is dramatically stimulated at the border of G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Many genes coding for enzymes involved in DNA replication and precursor production are regulated similarly. Not surprisingly, the promoters of such genes exhibit high degrees of sequence homology between organisms. For instance, the promoter of another gene involved in precursor production, that of dihydrofolate reductase, is very similar between human and various different rodents (reviewed in Ref. 3Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is not true for the TK genes, where different species show remarkably divergent sequences in the promoter region, whereas the expressed part of the genes is highly homologous. This might indicate variation in the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of these genes. The TATA-less murine TK promoter (4Seiser C. Knöfler M. Rudelstorfer I. Haas R. Wintersberger E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), for example, contains one Sp1-binding site and a binding motif for the growth-regulated transcription factor family E2F within the region important for growth-regulated expression (5Ogris E. Rotheneder H. Mudrak I. Pichler A. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dou Q.-P. Zhao S. Levin A.H. Wang J. Helin K. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1306-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter closely resembling a similar motif present in the promoter of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. Both the Sp1 and E2F sites are necessary for regulated expression of the murine TK gene (5Ogris E. Rotheneder H. Mudrak I. Pichler A. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dou Q.-P. Zhao S. Levin A.H. Wang J. Helin K. Pardee A.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1886-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Sp1 and E2F-1–3 have in fact been shown to directly interact (8Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The human TK promoter, on the other hand, carries Sp1 sites, several motifs resembling E2F-binding sites, two reversed CCAAT boxes, and a TATA element (9Arcot S.S. Flemington E.K. Deininger P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2343-2349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream region of the TK gene from Chinese hamster cells was reported previously (10Lewis J.A. Shimizu K. Zipser D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Lewis J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Lewis J.A. Matkovich D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2262-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, transcription factor-binding sites and the proteins involved in the regulation of the gene have not been identified. We were intrigued by the differences in the structures of the TK promoters, which contrast with the high homology displayed by the expressed part of the genes, and report here on our detailed analysis of the hamster TK promoter derived from BHK cells. We present evidence that this TATA-containing promoter is regulated by Sp1 and the CCAAT-binding transcription factor NF-Y, whereas the E2F-like sequence is dispensable and does not bind transcription factors of the E2F family. The transcription factor pair Sp1/NF-Y is active on the hamster promoter and appears to functionally replace the transcription factor pair Sp1/E2F, which is active on the murine TK promoter. Thus, although the murine and hamster TK genes are regulated very similarly during growth, the mechanism of this regulation is clearly distinct. Furthermore, from the results presented in this report, it appears questionable to generally regard TK as an E2F-regulated gene. Genomic DNA was prepared from BHK cells using standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The TK promoter was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primer sequences derived from the upstream region (5′-CAAGCGGTACCTGCCCTGAAG-3′) and from exon 1 (5′-GTAATTGCTAGCGGCTGTGCG-3′) of the Chinese hamster TK gene (11Lewis J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products contained engineered restriction sites for KpnI and NheI, which were used for subcloning into pGEM3Zf(−). Four different clones were sequenced to avoid polymerase chain reaction-generated mutations. Mutations within the promoter region were produced using the Bio-Rad system for oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis. The mutations were chosen to produce a unique restriction site at the selected position and are schematically presented in Fig.5 C. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Wild-type and mutated TK promoter fragments were cloned into the KpnI andNheI sites of the plasmid pGL2neo. This plasmid was constructed by introducing the neo gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter into the BamHI site of plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega). For the construction of truncated promoter fragments, the unique restriction sites in the mutated transcription factor-binding sites were used. The fragments were cut at these sites; blunt-ended; and then digested with NheI, followed by cloning into correspondingly digested pGL2neo. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. To generate stably transfected cells, 5 μg of the plasmid of interest were linearized with XmnI and transfected into BHK cells using Polybrene-assisted gene transfer (14Aubin C.C. Weinfeld M. Paterson M.C. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1988; 14: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of Geneticin (600 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones were pooled after 12–14 days and expanded in medium containing Geneticin (300 μg/ml). The drug was removed only shortly prior to the experimental assays. Harvesting of cells and preparation of cell extracts for luciferase assays were performed as described elsewhere (15Baker A. Saltik M. Lehrmann H. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Growth arrest of cells in G0 was accomplished by reducing the concentration of serum to 0.5% for 72 h. Restimulation was achieved by the addition of serum to 20%. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 85% ethanol. The fixed cells were suspended in a few drops of 0.05% pepsin, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Merck) and sulforhodamine 101 (Sigma), and analyzed in a Partec PAS-2 cytofluorometer. For transient transfections, the wild-type hamster TK promoter or a SmaI-NheI fragment (564 base pairs) of the 5′-upstream sequence of the mouse TK gene (8Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) was cloned into the KpnI and NheI sites of the plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega). The E2F-1 expression vector, pRcCMV-HA-E2F-1(wt), was a gift of Dr. Wilhelm Krek; the DP-1 expression vector, pCMV-HA-DP-1, was kindly provided by Dr. Kristian Helin. SAOS-2 cells (9 × 104) or BHK cells (6.5 × 104) were seeded in 3-cm diameter Petri dishes and transfected the following day with a total of 1.8 or 1.2 μg of DNA, respectively, using polyethyleneimine-assisted gene transfer (15Baker A. Saltik M. Lehrmann H. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 6 μl of polyethyleneimine (10 mm polyethyleneimine,M r 25,000) were diluted with 250 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and added dropwise to 6 μg of DNA diluted in 250 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), with gentle agitation after the addition of each drop. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the appropriate amounts of DNA-polyethyleneimine complexes were added to the cells, which, prior to the transfection, had their growth medium replaced by 800 μl of serum-free medium. The transfection medium was replaced by fresh medium after 4 h. After 48 h, luciferase/β-galactosidase assays were performed using the Dual-Light system (Tropix Inc.) as recommended by the vendor. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing BHK cells as described previously (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in a conical tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm. The cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 3 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After 20 min on ice, the cells were homogenized using a syringe with a 27-gauge needle, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 8 min at 5000 rpm. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 volume of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and the lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle mixing. The nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. For the preparation of whole cell extracts, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected in an Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged for 5 s. The cell pellet was suspended in 3 volumes of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mNaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed by one freeze/thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen and at 37 °C, respectively. After 20 min on ice, the extracts were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 μl by incubating 10 μg of protein extract and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 10 min on ice, end-labeled oligonucleotides were added, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for 20 min. This was followed by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography of the dried gel. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA was incubated with the protein extract for 10 min before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. The sequences of the top strands of the individual oligonucleotide probes were as follows: E2F-like motif, 5′-CTCCTGGCTTTGCAGGGACACGAGGAGGC-3′; GC box 1, 5′-CACGAGGAGGCAGGGGGCGGGGCCCACACG-3′; GC box 2, 5′-CACACGCGCCCCGCCCTCGCCACG-3′; GC box 3, 5′-CCCTCGCCACGCCCCTGTCTGCGGCT-3′; and CCAAT box, 5′-GATCCGGCTGCGATTGGTCGGT-3′. The assays were performed as described (17Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The coding strand of the TK promoter fragment between positions −319 and +51 was end-labeled by filling in the NheI site at position +51. Binding reactions were carried out by incubating 30 μg of nuclear protein in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 10 min on ice, the end-labeled DNA fragment was added, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before 3 units of DNase I were added, and digestion was allowed for 60 s. The DNase was inactivated by the addition of 0.6m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then analyzed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. The TK gene, the cDNA sequence, and the 5′-upstream region were previously identified from Chinese hamster cells (10Lewis J.A. Shimizu K. Zipser D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Lewis J.A. Mol. Cell.

However, a functional analysis of the promoter sequence has not been carried out. The presumptive promoter sequence differs significantly from that of other rodents as well as from the human TK gene. In fact, there is little homology among six TK promoters, five mammalian and the chicken promoter (reviewed in Ref. 2Wintersberger E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the high homology of sequences within both the transcribed regions of the genes and the more distant upstream regions. We used these homologous sequences to design oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction to isolate the TK promoter from BHK cells (derived from the Syrian hamster). As shown in Fig. 1, the promoter carries several GC motifs (potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1), one reversed CCAAT box, and a TATA element. In this respect, the sequence reported here is similar to the previously described 5′-upstream sequence of the Chinese hamster gene (11Lewis J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1998-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a sequence with some resemblance to a binding site for E2F is discernible. This is of particular interest since E2F was shown to play an important role in the regulation of the murine TK promoter (5Ogris E. Rotheneder H. Mudrak I. Pichler A. Wintersberger E. J.

We used the TK promoter from BHK cells to clarify which transcription factors are involved in the growth-dependent regulation of the hamster TK gene. To identify protein-binding sites within the hamster TK promoter, we carried out DNase I protection assays. A clear protection of the three GC boxes and of the reversed CCAAT box was observed when the coding strand of the promoter fragment from positions −319 to +51 (relative to the transcription start site) was incubated with nuclear extract from exponentially growing BHK cells (Fig. 2 A). To further map the region of protection contributed by individual transcription factors, single mutations were introduced in the binding motifs. The results shown in Fig. 2 A indicate the binding of four protein complexes, which correspond to the number of putative binding sites, and that protein binding was abolished within the mutated element, whereas protection of other elements was not affected. We next wished to define the transcription factors binding within the upstream protected region. The region between positions −99 and −57 accommodates three GC boxes, representing potential binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor family. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were performed with nuclear extracts from logarithmically growing BHK cells. Each of the GC-containing oligonucleotide probes produced three shifted complexes, which could be supershifted with antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig.3, B–D). All three complexes were competed by a 100-fold excess of an oligonucleotide probe containing the previously demonstrated motif for Sp1 in the murine promoter (8Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), but not by probes containing a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein or YY1 recognition site (Fig. 3 E). The same result was verified in DNase I footprint experiments using the murine Sp1 probe in competition with the end-labeled wild-type promoter fragment (Fig. 2 B). The fact that protein binding to GC boxes of the hamster TK promoter is strongly inhibited by an oligonucleotide carrying an Sp1/Sp3-binding motif present in another promoter, together with the supershift induced by Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies, provides compelling evidence for the conclusion that the region between positions −99 and −57 is indeed protected by three protein complexes of the Sp1 transcription factor family. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transcription factor binding to the CCAAT box is NF-Y, as antibodies against NF-YA and NF-YB, two of the three subunits of NF-Y, shifted the protein complex formed on the CCAAT oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A). An independent strong indication for an involvement of NF-Y in hamster TK promoter activity was obtained as follows. Promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into BHK cells alone or together with an expression plasmid carrying the information for a dominant-negative NF-YA subunit (20Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. van Huisjduijnen R.H. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutated NF-YA interferes with the formation of a functional, heterotrimeric DNA-binding complex. As shown in Fig.4, the activity of the hamster TK promoter was significantly reduced by cotransfection of the dominant-negative NF-YA mutant, but not by cotransfection of wild-type NF-YA.Figure 4TK promoter activity is repressed by a dominant-negative mutant of NF-YA. BHK cells growing on 3-cm Petri dishes were transiently transfected with 1.2 μg of DNA from a mixture made up of 1 μg of wild-type hamster TK promoter-luciferase construct (pGL3haTK), the indicated amounts of expression vectors encoding dominant-negative NF-YA (pNF-YA29; Ref. 20Mantovani R.

The relative activity of luciferase to β-galactosidase is presented. The means ± S.D. of two independent experiments are shown as -fold induction of the activity obtained with the TK promoter-luciferase construct transfected alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, no protein complexes were detected with the E2F-like sequence within the hamster TK promoter, in contrast to what was found with the functional E2F-binding site from the murine TK promoter (Fig.3 E). More important, the binding activity for the hamster E2F-like sequence was absent in whole cell extracts from both quiescent and serum-stimulated BHK cells. To examine which of the transcription factor-binding sites are essential for promoter activity and growth-dependent regulation, two approaches were taken. Luciferase reporter constructs were created, first with shortened versions of the promoter and second with individual transcription factor-binding sites mutated so as to eliminate their capacity to bind the factor. The promoter-luciferase constructs were stably transfected into BHK cells, and a pool of selected cells, rather than individual clones, was used to avoid effects due to site of integration and copy number. Results from the first approach, the deletion analysis of the promoter, are summarized in Fig. 5. Stable cell lines of BHK cells were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation for 72 h, and the promoter activity was analyzed after serum stimulation. Deletion of much of the upstream region, including the E2F-like sequence (pTK(−114)-Luc), had little influence on promoter strength and no effect on growth-regulated expression (∼4-fold). More important, neither the down-regulation of the promoter in quiescent cells nor the induction after serum addition was affected by removal of the E2F-like sequence (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that neither a repressor element acting in G0 nor an activator element acting in S phase was removed. Furthermore, the additional removal of GC boxes 1 and 2 (pTK(−92)-Luc and pTK(−73)-Luc) had only minor consequences for promoter strength and no influence on promoter regulation (∼4-fold). The 122-base pair region between positions −73 and + 51, carrying a single GC box, the reversed CCAAT motif, and the TATA box, therefore functions as a minimal promoter that is still growth-regulated like the full-length promoter (pTK(−319)-Luc). This indicates that one of the three binding elements, or a combination of them, is essential for the observed activity. When the most proximal Sp1-binding site was deleted, leaving only the reversed CCAAT box and the TATA box (pTK(−65)-Luc), promoter activity was dramatically reduced (∼4% of wild-type expression). Still, this construct exhibited growth-regulated expression of luciferase similar to the transgenes carrying the extended promoters (Fig. 5 B). Having shown that GC box 3, the CCAAT motif, and the TATA box are sufficient for regulated expression of the promoter-luciferase constructs, these motifs were individually mutated, as indicated in Fig.6 C, to examine their involvement in promoter activity. Furthermore, because of the importance of a potential role of the upstream E2F-like sequence, we also mutated this sequence. Evidence that the mutations of the GC box and the CCAAT motif abolished protein binding is demonstrated by the DNase I protection assay (Fig. 2 A). For all the mutations analyzed, this was also confirmed by mobility shift experiments (data not shown). The respective promoter-luciferase constructs were stably integrated into BHK cells, and the activity and regulation were analyzed using a pool of selected clones. In agreement with the results obtained with promoter constructs in which the E2F-like motif was deleted (Fig. 5), point mutations in this motif had little effect on promoter activity and growth-dependent regulation (Fig. 6,A and B). Together with the observation that no protein complexes were observed in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments with the E2F-like sequence (Fig. 3 E), we can exclude that this upstream E2F-like element has a functional role in the expression of the hamster TK gene. In contrast, a dramatic reduction in hamster TK promoter activity was observed when either the TATA or CCAAT box was mutated (Fig. 6, A and B). Mutation of GC box 3 also led to a significant reduction in promoter activity (∼16% of that of the wild type); however, this residual activity was still growth-dependent (Fig. 6 B). This contrasts with the results obtained with the promoter construct carrying a mutated CCAAT box. This not only exhibited strongly reduced activity, but this activity increased maximally 2-fold upon serum stimulation. The transgene under the promoter with the mutated TATA element displayed background activity indistinguishable from that measured with an empty plasmid lacking any promoter. As expected for a promoter containing a TATA element, this is absolutely essential for promoter activity. Under these conditions, it is impossible to exclude any role of this element in growth regulation. However, if we mutated the TATA box within the context of the regulated minimal promoter such that it resembled the TATA element active in the growth-independent promoter of the muscle actin gene, this had no effect on promoter regulation (data not shown). Taken together, the results summarized in Figs. 5 and 6 show that GC box 3, the CCAAT box, and the TATA element are essential and sufficient to confer efficient promoter activity. They furthermore indicate that binding of NF-Y to the reverse CCAAT box is not only required for transcriptional activation, but also plays an important role in growth-dependent regulation of the hamster TK gene. Since it has been shown that members of the E2F transcription factor family, which heterodimerize with DP-1 and DP-2, are involved in the regulation of numerous genes that are expressed at the G1 to S phase transition (21Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 8-35Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that E2F transactivates the hamster TK promoter through an as yet unidentified element. To test this possibility, reporter constructs containing the wild-type −319/+51 hamster TK promoter fragment (pGL3haTK) or the murine TK promoter (pGL3mTK) were transiently transfected into SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells together with an expression vector for E2F-1. As expected, overexpression of E2F-1 transactivated the murine promoter, which was further stimulated by cotransfection of DP-1 or inhibited by pRb (Fig.7, bars 5–10). In contrast, the activity of the hamster promoter remained unchanged when cotransfected with E2F-1 alone or together with DP-1 (Fig. 7,bars 1–3). These results strongly suggest that the hamster TK promoter is regulated in an E2F-independent manner. Initiation of DNA replication requires the expression of a large number of genes at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Prominent among these are the enzymes involved in DNA replication and precursor production as well as G1 and S phase-specific cyclins, especially cyclins E and A. In many cases, a family of transcription factors, called E2F, is found to be involved in this regulation. E2F binds as a heterodimer with another group of proteins, called DP, to a DNA-binding motif present in the promoters"

In this report, we characterize the corresponding murine gene, mCCR4, and its human homologue, thus providing the first description of CCR4-like factors in mammals. cDNA cloning revealed two mCCR4mRNAs of 2.7 and 3.1 kilobases, differing by their transcription start sites within the native mCCR4gene promoter, and encoding a putative 430-amino acid protein. The mCCR4gene contains three exons and two introns spanning almost 27 kilobases. The IAP insertion, detected only in some laboratory mouse strains, is recent and lies within the first intron. The 5′-region of the gene has features of housekeeping gene promoters. It lacks a TATA box but contains a CpG island and Sp1 sites. This region discloses strong promoter activity in transient transfection assays and also stimulates transcription in the reverse orientation, a feature common to other CpG island-containing promoters. Transcripts were detected in all the organs tested, although at a variable level, and displayed no strain-dependent differences relative to the IAP insertion, suggesting the existence of mechanisms preserving mCCR4transcription from the usually deleterious effects of intronic transposition. The strong amino acid conservation between the human, murine, and the previously identified XenopusCCR4-like proteins, is consistent with an important and conserved role for this protein in vertebrates.

Genetics. 1984; 108: 833-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Denis C.L. Malvar T. Genetics. 1990; 124: 283-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is part of a multi-subunit complex, several components of which have been characterized including DBF2, a cell cycle-regulated protein kinase (3Liu H.-Y. Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnson L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and proteins of the NOT family, involved in repression of transcription (4Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). yCCR4 displays a glutamine-rich N terminus, like many factors involved in transcriptional activation, and a leucine-rich repeat motif that is necessary for protein-protein interactions within the complex (5Malvar T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both motifs are required for transcriptional activation by yCCR4. The yCCR4 complex was demonstrated to function at a post-chromatin remodeling step in the case of the ADH2 gene (7Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to play an important role in several cellular processes: yCCR4 affects the expression of genes involved in cell wall integrity (3Liu H.-Y. Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnson L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), in UV sensitivity (8Schild D. Genetics. 1995; 140: 115-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in methionine biosynthesis (9McKenzie E.A. Kent N.A. Dowell S.J. Moreno F. Bird L.E. Mellor J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of how yCCR4 functions remains undefined (yet the yCCR4 protein does not bind DNA by itself, Ref. 6Draper M.P. Liu H.-Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that the complex plays an important and conserved role in vertebrate gene regulation as well. Actually, there is increasing evidence for the existence of yCCR4-like proteins in higher eucaryotes. First, a gene encoding a yCCR4-like protein (named nocturnin) has been identified in Xenopus (10Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nocturnin displays a strong similarity to the C-terminal part of yCCR4 and contains a leucine zipper-like dimerization domain. Interestingly, nocturnin expression discloses a strong circadian regulation in the retina, suggesting that it could be involved in the circadian clock system. Second, the existence of yCCR4-like proteins in mammals is strongly supported by the results of Draper et al. (11Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Those authors identified a mouse protein (mCAF1) which can functionally interact, in a yeast two-hybrid assay, with the yeast yCCR4 factor, thus indicating a strong evolutionary conservation of at least some components of a CCR4-containing transcriptional regulatory complex. Finally, our group identified, at the 3′-end of an intracisternal A-particle chimeric murine transcript, a 1-kb1open reading frame (ORF) with significant similarity to the yCCR4 C-terminal domain (12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) sequences are moderately reiterated transposable elements (∼1000 copies in the mouse genome) which are closely related to retroviruses and transpose via the reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (13Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTR), with a U3-R-U5 organization, that contain the signals for the initiation and regulation of transcription (5′-LTR) and for the polyadenylation of the transcripts (3′-LTR). IAPs are one of the most potent insertional mutagens in the mouse, and it is well documented that their insertion can perturb the normal pattern of expression of the targeted cellular genes (reviewed in Refs. 13Kuff E.L. Lueders K.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 183-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar and 15Kuff E.L. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 398-400PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, we had previously characterized three IAP transcripts of abnormal size (3, 6, and 10 kb, named IAP-AR transcripts), which are induced exclusively in the liver of old mice (16Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have shown that the 10-kb IAP-AR transcript is initiated within the 5′-LTR of an IAP gene and corresponds to a transcriptional read-through extending beyond the 3′-LTR into a cellular sequence containing the 1-kb ORF with significant similarity to the yCCR4 C-terminal domain (12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This 10-kb transcript gives rise to the two smaller transcripts by one or two splicing events using donor and acceptor sites within the IAP sequence and an acceptor site 5′ to the yCCR4-related ORF. We hypothesized that the IAP sequence was inserted into an intron of a mouse gene related to the yCCR4gene. As a first step to elucidate the potential role of this factor in mammals, we have now characterized this gene, tentatively named mCCR4. We present an analysis of its genomic organization and of the structure of its associated transcripts. mCCR4has all the characteristics features of a “housekeeping gene,” with a CpG island-containing promoter and a ubiquitous expression in the mouse. We further show that the IAP insertion, in the first intron, is a recent phenomenon, being absent in some laboratory mouse strains. A comparison of the mCCR4 transcripts in both types of mice discloses no effect of the IAP insertion on the structure and pattern of expression of the mCCR4 gene (with the exception of the liver of aged mice, see above). This rather unusual situation suggests a strong selective pressure for maintaining mCCR4 function, a result consistent with the high amino acid conservation found with the human homologue of mCCR4, which we have also characterized in the present work, and a central role for these factors in vertebrates. Cloning the murine yCCR4-related cDNA was achieved by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a Marathon-ReadyTM mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, constructed from normal whole brains pooled from 9–11-week old BALB/c males). Primers complementary to the adaptator sequence and various primers derived from the mCCR4 sequence were used in nested PCR reactions. For exons 2 and 3 of the human yCCR4-related cDNA, we used a Marathon-ReadyTM human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) and low-stringency PCR reactions (a first step at 94 °C for 60 s; then 4 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 61 °C for 50 s; 4 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s and 59 °C for 50 s; 4 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s and 57 °C for 50 s; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; and ending with a step at 72 °C for 2 min). Characterization of the 5′-end of the human cDNA (exon 1 and 5′-UTR) was achieved using an oligo(dT)-primed human cDNA library 2T. Tchénio and T. Heidmann, manuscript in preparation. in which the cDNAs, prepared from mRNA isolated from NTera2D1 teratocarcinoma cells, are inserted into a retroviral vector. Successive 5′-RACE PCR reactions were performed using primers in the human sequence and primers in the retroviral vector. All PCR reactions, except the low-stringency PCRs, were performed using the Advantage-GC cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH, specifically designed for GC-rich cDNAs) with a 95 °C denaturation step for 80 s followed by 60 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 66 °C for 3 min, and final extension at 66 °C for 10 min. Amplification products were subcloned into the T-vector (Promega) and sequenced. PCR amplifications with genomic DNA were performed using the Advantage-GC cDNA Polymerase Mix or the Advantage-GC Genomic Polymerase Mix (both fromCLONTECH). Mapping of exon-intron boundaries was achieved by PCR amplification of intronic sequences with primers designed from the cDNA sequences. For large introns, long distance PCR was performed after a 95 °C denaturation step for 2 min, by 60 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, and 66 °C for 14 min. Final extension was at 66 °C for 10 min. Inverted PCR amplification was performed as described in Ref. 14Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar using genomic DNA first digested by restriction enzymes and then self-ligated, and pairs of primers in opposite orientation. A mouse 129/sv lambda genomic library (Stratagene) was screened using a PCR-based method (17Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with primers bracketing the exon 1/intron 1 junction. 105 plaque-forming units were amplified in an XL1-Blue MRA host strain, distributed in 96-well plates, and then subjected to PCR amplification. 200 plaque-forming units of a single positive well were further analyzed using a conventional plaque hybridization assay, leading to the isolation of an mCCR4-containing phage. High molecular weight DNA was extracted from the tail of various inbred strains. Tails were lysed overnight in 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS and 500 μg/ml Proteinase K. DNA was then extracted by phenol-chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. For each restriction analysis, 10 μg of DNA was cleaved with at least a 4-fold excess of restriction enzyme for 10 h, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and then analyzed by Southern blotting (18Dupressoir A. Heidmann T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4495-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A SpeI-BstXI fragment (460 bp) isolated from an inverted PCR product containing the region 5′ to the IAP was first used as a probe. After dehybridization, the same blot was then rehybridized with an intronic probe generated by PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA using primers AR-B11 and AR-B12 (probe A in Ref. 12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pGL3 expression vector (Promega) containing the firefly luciferase as a reporter gene was used to assay the promoter activity of cloned genomic DNA fragments from the 5′-region of the mCCR4 gene. Several fragments were excised from an inverted PCR product containing the 5′-region of the mCCR4 gene, blunt-ended, and cloned bidirectionally into theSmaI site of the pGL3 vector: aXbaI-BglI fragment, [−500/+114] pGL3 and [+114/−500] pGL3 constructs); a XmaI-BglI fragment, [−227/+114] pGL3 and [+114/−227] pGL3 constructs anAlwNI-BglI fragment, [−100/+114] pGL3, and [+114/−100] pGL3 constructs; and a DraIII-BglI fragment ([+4/+114] pGL3 and [+114/+4] pGL3 constructs). The [BssHII-BglI] pGL3 construct ([−30/+114] pGL3) was subsequently generated by deleting theSacI-BssHII fragment from the [XbaI-BglI] pGL3 vector, and the [BglI-BssHII] pGL3 construct ([+114/−30] pGL3) was obtained by deleting the BssHII-HindIII fragment from the [BglI-XbaI] pGL3 vector. A basic pGL3 promoterless luciferase vector and an SV40 promoter/enhancer luciferase vector were used as negative and positive control vectors, respectively. NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected using the LipofectAMINE PLUSTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (5 ×105) were transfected with 1 ng of luciferase construct and 1 ng of a β-galactosidase gene containing vector (CMVβ, Stratagene) as a control for transfection efficacy. Two days post-transfection, cells were assayed for luciferase using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and for β-galactosidase using CPRG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total cellular RNAs from various tissues were extracted using a pre-packed spun column containing silica gel-based membrane (RNeasy kit, QIAGEN). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA/lane were fractionated on agarose/formaldehyde gels. RNAs were transferred to a nylon charged membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC and hybridized with DNA probes. Loading of equal amounts of RNA in each lane was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNAs upon UV illumination of the membrane and hybridization of the blots with a β-actin probe. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mNa2HPO4. A PCR fragment (1.2 kb) containing exons 2 and 3 from mCCR4 cDNA was used as a probe. Hybridized blots were washed twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Filters were then exposed for at least 3 days. A 966-bp open reading frame with similarity to the yeast CCR4gene was previously identified at the 3′-end of IAP LTR-initiated chimeric transcripts (IAP-AR) resulting from a read-through into flanking cellular sequences and detected exclusively in the liver of old mice (12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These included a 10-kb transcript and two processed transcripts of 6 and 3 kb (Fig. 1 A). We hypothesized this ORF to be part of the coding region of a putative murine homologue, mCCR4, of the yeast CCR4 gene. To characterize mCCR4-specific transcripts not initiated within the IAP LTR but initiated, possibly, within the mCCR4promoter, we used RNA from the brain as (i) no chimeric, IAP-promoted, transcript had ever been detected in this organ (Ref. 16Dupressoir A. Puech A. Heidmann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, and Fig.1 B), and (ii) this organ expresses a high level of mCCR4-related transcripts (Fig. 1 B and extensive analysis in Fig. 6). A pre-made Marathon-Ready brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) was therefore used for 5′- and 3′-RACE, with primers designed based on the previously characterized ORF sequence (see Fig. 1 B for the strategy of cloning). 3′-RACE PCR amplified a 1.5-kb fragment, which was found to contain the 3′-end of the previously identified ORF and the same 1104-nt sequence as that of the 3′ noncoding region of the IAP-AR chimeric cDNAs (including the same polyadenylation sequence). Characterization of the 5′-end of the brain cDNAs proved to be particularly difficult, most probably because of the high G/C content of this region (see below). Actually, a 5′-RACE fragment that extended 200 bp 5′ to the yCCR4-related ORF was obtained, but larger fragments were recombinants most probably generated by jumps of the reverse transcriptase in the cDNA library construction. The complete characterization of the extreme 5′-end of the cDNAs was finally rendered possible only by the cloning, and direct sequencing, of the corresponding genomic region from a phage library and the use, for 5′-RACE, of reverse primers designed from the new 5′ genomic sequence (see Fig. 1 B and “Experimental Procedures”). Two mCCR4 cDNAs, of 2628 and 3026 bp, were finally characterized, which only differ by their transcription initiation sites (see also next sections). Their length is compatible with that of the two transcripts detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B), with a major transcript of 2.7 kb and a minor, and not always visible, transcript of 3.1 kb. These two cDNAs contain a single ORF of 1475 nt, that could encode a protein of 430 amino acids. A series of stop codons are present 185 bp upstream of the first methionine codon, strongly suggesting that no longer protein can be generated.Figure 6Pattern of expression of the murine mCCR4gene in several organs from DBA/2 and CBA mice.DBA/2 mice have the IAP insertion in the mCCR4 first intron (+) but not the CBA mice (−). 15 μg of total RNA from the indicated organs (except for the retina in lane ret*, 4 μg) were analyzed on Northern blots using the mCCR4 probe indicated in Fig.1 A. Mice were 2–3 month old, except for lanes liver°, loaded with RNA from the liver of 2-year old mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also looked for possible human homologues of these mCCR4transcripts. Previous data base searches had revealed several human expressed sequence tags that exhibited high levels of similarity to the 3′-region of the murine CCR4 and the Xenopus nocturnin cDNAs (10Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore performed low-stringency PCR amplifications using a human pre-made Marathon-Ready placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH), with one primer derived from the T87026 human expressed sequence tag sequence and a second primer derived from the murine CCR4 3′-coding regions to identify the 3′-part of the human homologue (exons 2 and 3). As previously observed for the murine sequences, cloning of the cDNA 5′-region was rendered difficult by its high G/C content, at a position similar to that of the murine gene. We performed several successive 5′-RACE PCRs using an oligo(dT)-primed human cDNA library cloned into a retroviral vector,2 with primers derived from human and vector sequences. We finally obtained a partial hCCR4 cDNA sequence of 2397 bp. This cDNA contains a complete ORF of 1317 nt that could encode a protein of 439 amino acids. The chromosomal localization of this human sequence was further determined by the Radiation Hybrid Mapping method (Genethon/Evry) using, for PCR screening, oligonucleotides designed from the sequence of an intronic region. The corresponding transcription unit was localized on chromosome 4, close to the D4S1576-D4S1579 interval (LOD scores of 15.56 and 16.06, respectively). Interestingly, this locus is synthenic with (i.e. contains a set of genes conserved in) the locus containing the murine CCR4 gene (chromosome 3, B–D region; see Ref. 12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid coding regions of the human, murine,Xenopus, and yeast proteins were compared, using the J. HEIN Multiple Sequence Alignment Program (Fig.2). The Xenopus, murine, and human proteins appear to lack the N-terminal region of yeast CCR4 (from amino acids 1 to 432), which contains a leucine-rich repeat region (amino acids 350–467) and two activation domains (6Draper M.P. Liu H.-Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Yet, they display a significant similarity (close to 30%, including conservative amino acid changes) with the yeast CCR4 protein within their C-terminal domains, in a region corresponding to the second and third exons of theXenopus, murine, and human genes. High sequence similarity (76% similarity) is also observed between the mammalian andXenopus proteins but again severely restricted to the region corresponding to the second and third exons of the genes, the coding region of the mammalian CCR4 first exons being significantly longer (62/64 versus 22 amino acids) than, and divergent from, that of Xenopus. Finally, the murine and human CCR4 proteins display strong similarity (93%) equally distributed over the three exons. This similarity stops immediately upstream of their respective initiation codon, suggesting that these codons are those actually used for initiation of translation. A search for putative amino acid motifs in the sequence of mCCR4 (using MOTIF finder) revealed several phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. The leucine-rich repeat region present in the yCCR4 protein at position 350–467 (5Malvar T. Biron R.W. Kaback D.B. Denis C.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 951-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could not be found in the amino acid sequence of the mammalian proteins. Moreover, although a consensus leucine zipper-like motif was identified close to the N-terminal region of the putative nocturnin protein (from 64 to 91; Ref. 10Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), no such motif could be found in the human and mouse proteins, in particular because of the absence of a leucine at position 125 and 123, respectively (indicated with a star in Fig. 2). Interestingly, search against a data base of conserved blocks (19Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) revealed an 8-amino acid homology (PDILCLQEV, amino acids 186–194 in mCCR4) with a conserved motif involved in Mg2+ or Mn2+ binding among the AP- (Apurinic/Apyrimidinic) endonuclease family I (20Seki S. Ikeda S. Watanabe S. Hatsushika M. Tsutsui K. Akiyama K. Zhang B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This motif is one of the most conserved from yeast to human CCR4. The genomic organization of the murine mCCR4 gene was assessed by different methods. Introns and locations of intron/exon boundaries were identified by PCR reactions using a series of primers derived from the sequence of the regions corresponding to the characterized cDNA. To explore the 5′ genomic region of the gene, a 129/sv mouse genomic library (constructed with Sau3AI-restricted DNA) was screened by a PCR-based method (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the unique phage clone obtained was directly sequenced. It contained part of intron 1 and 430 nt of exon 1, up to a Sau3AI site in exon 1. More 5′-domains were characterized by inverted PCR using genomic DNA, first restricted and then self-ligated, and divergent primers derived from the newly identified sequences. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, the mouse mCCR4 gene spans almost 27 kb of genomic DNA, with three exons and two introns (as previously observed, interestingly, for theXenopus nocturnin gene, see Ref. 10Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exon 1 contains 185 bp of coding region. Intron1 is large (25 kb) and contains the IAP insertion described in Ref. 12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. The previously described ORF (12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is in fact composed of exon 2 (268 bp) and exon 3 (that contains 836 bp of coding sequence and 1.2 kb of 3′-untranslated region). In mouse genomic DNA, these two exons are separated by 1.8 kb of intron 2 sequence. Surprisingly, genomic analysis of intron 1 revealed that the IAP insertion is not common to all laboratory mouse strains. In a previous paper (12Puech A. Dupressoir A. Loireau M.-P. Mattei M.-G. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5995-6003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we had reported that the IAP-AR transcripts observed in the liver of aged mice were induced in the four inbred strains tested,i.e. C57BL/6, C57BL/10, BALB/c, and DBA/2. We have now characterized eight inbred laboratory strains as well as two strains of wild-type mice (PWK and SEG strains; gift from J. L. Guenet, Pasteur Institute) for the presence of the IAP gene in intron 1, by Southern blot analysis using probes flanking the IAP insertion (data not shown). As indicated in Fig. 3 B, the IAP insertion is observed for DBA/2, C57BL/6, C57BL/10, Swiss, and BALB/c mice, whereas no insertion could be detected for the C3H, SJL, CBA, and 129/sv mice, as well as for the two wild-type mice. For the latter six mouse strains, PCR reactions carried out with primers bracketing the IAP target site yielded fragments of the expected size (730 bp). Sequencing of these PCR fragments confirmed the absence of an IAP, and comparison of the sequence (e.g. for the CBA mouse, Fig. 3 C) with the sequence flanking the IAP insertion in a BALB/c mouse revealed a 6-bp duplication of the target sequence (see Fig. 3 C), as usually observed for IAP insertions (14Heidmann O. Heidmann T. Cell. 1991; 64: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data show that the germ-line transposition of the IAP into intron 1 occurred recently, after the emergence of the laboratory strains,i.e. less that 100 years ago. The high level of similarity between the two IAP LTRs supports this conclusion. The transcription start sites of the murine mCCR4 gene were determined using 5′-RACE PCR with reverse primers in exon 1 (Fig. 1 B). Two major bands were amplified and cloned. For each band, the 5′-end of several products was sequenced and found identical, ending at the same positions (Fig. 4 A): the"

Included in the immediate-early gene class are numerous transcription factors such as c-myc and c-fos and cytokines such as M-CSF 1, KC/gro, and MCP-1 (see Ref. 1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar for review by Herschman). By definition, transcription of immediate-early genes is induced even in the presence of drugs such as cycloheximide that inhibit protein synthesis. In fact transcription of immediate-early genes is more robust when PDGF is added together with cycloheximide: the “superinduction” response (2Cochran B.H. Zullo J. Verma I.M. Stiles C.D. Science. 1984; 226: 1080-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 3Kruijer W. Cooper J.A. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 4Kelly K.

The superinduction response shows that regulatory factors for immediate-early genes pre-exist within the cell. Thus, immediate-early genes define useful end points for analysis of PDGF-regulated signal transduction pathways. Significant insights into PDGF signal transduction have been made using the c-fos gene as an experimental paradigm. Three functionally distinct cis-acting control elements are located within ∼350 nucleotides of the c-fos transcription start site. These elements, known as “SRE”, “CREB,” and “SIE”, respond to serum, cyclic AMP, and PDGF B:B homodimers, respectively (8Pollock R. Treisman R.

Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Comparative sequence analysis and promoter function studies show that several other immediate-early genes, notably those encoding zinc finger transcription factors, contain fos-like regulatory elements in their 5′-flanking sequences, and require these elements for induction in response to a stimulus (16Christy B. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The c-fos gene, however, does not stand as a prototype for all members of the immediate-early gene set. The MCP-1 gene, one of the first immediate-early genes to be cloned and characterized as such, contains no fos-like regulatory sequences within the MCP-1 promoter, 3′-flanking region, or within the coding sequence (19Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The MCP-1 gene contains structurally distinct regulatory elements within both the 5′ and 3′-flanking regions (20Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Freter R.R.

The differential structure of the c-fos and MCP-1 genes is further reflected at the level of gene regulation, where the temporal responses ofc-fos and MCP-1 to PDGF are radically offset. In tandem nuclear run-on assays, transcription of c-fos is up-regulated within minutes following activation of PDGF receptors, while the transcription of MCP-1 is not up-regulated until at least 90 min following receptor activation (23Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite the 90-min temporal offset, transcription of MCP-1 is a primary response to PDGF receptor activation, as treatment with cycloheximide does not prevent but augments transcriptional up-regulation (23Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Hall D.J. Alberta J.A. Stiles C.D. Oncogene Research. 1989; 4: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional nature of this delayed response can also be observed using reporter gene constructs (20Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). With the structure of these “fast” (c-fos) and “slow” (MCP-1) genes so divergent, it is not surprising that they can respond to non-overlapping extracellular cues. For example in Balb/c-3T3 cells, MCP-1, but not c-fos, is induced by interleukin 1 (IL-1) (19Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Likewise, MCP-1, but not c-fos, is induced by double-stranded RNA (23Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Conversely, induction ofc-fos in Balb/c 3T3 cells appears to be channeled through activation of protein kinase C, whereas MCP-1 induction is independent of protein kinase C activation (24Hall D.J. Alberta J.A. Stiles C.D. Oncogene Research. 1989; 4: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). What is unclear is whether the common inducer of these genes, PDGF, regulates expression ofc-fos and MCP-1 through common or distinct cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Activated PDGF receptors are known to drive the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase cascade. PDGF receptors also activate src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases and Janus kinase kinases. Directly or indirectly via Janus kinase kinase activation, PDGF receptors can phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins (25Vignais M.L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activated PDGF receptors also generate two lipid second signals, diacylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate. Which component(s) of this signal-generating repertoire is used by PDGF to stimulate expression of MCP-1? Are they identical to the ones that drive expression of c-fos? In studies presented here, we show that lipid signaling via the alternative lipid signaling pathway involving PI 3-kinase is necessary and sufficient for the stimulation of MCP-1 mRNA levels. Further, only a transient period of PI 3-kinase activity is sufficient to drive this response, and that response may involve protein kinase B/Akt. All reagents were of molecular biology grade or better. Recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB and interleukin-1α were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Wortmannin was from Sigma; anti-Akt and PD98059 were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; LY294002, was a gift from Lilly Pharmaceuticals; STI571 was a gift from Novartis Pharmaceuticals; rapamycin was from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Human deficient platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared as described (26Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Balb/c 3T3 clone A31 cells as well as the stably transfected cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were made quiescent by replacement of the culture media with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% platelet-poor plasma for 24 h. Except where noted, all compounds were added to the media 15 min prior to PDGF BB (30 ng/ml final) or IL-1 (1 ng/ml) stimulation. Transient exposure of cells to PDGF was performed by treatment of the cultures with PDGF BB (30 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time followed by washing the cells three times with prewarmed media containing 5% PPP. Cells were then maintained in 5% PPP/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the duration of culture. mRNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method and purified through a CsCl cushion (27Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total mRNA (10 μg/lane) was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in the presence of 0.6% formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight by capillary action. The mRNA was cross-linked to the membrane and processed according to standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA probes were generated using random priming reactions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Quantitation of mRNA for MCP-1 was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All experiments were performed at least three times, and representative examples are shown here. Nonidet P-40 lysates were generated for routine examination of PDGF receptor activation after washing a 100-mm plate containing cells twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl), and then scraping the cells into 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), containing 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Extracts were gently mixed for 10 min at 4 °C, and then spun 5 min in a microcentrifuge (10,000 × g) to remove cellular debris. Soluble fractions were then used in either immunoblot analyses or in activity assays. For monitoring PDGF receptor activation (tyrosine phosphorylation), we employed an antibody, anti-pY751, generated against a phosphopeptide corresponding to the Tyr-751 site in the human PDGF β-receptor (29Shamah S.M. Alberta J.A. Giannobile W.V. Guha A. Kwon Y.K. Carroll R.S. Black P.M. Stiles C.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4141-4147PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes the PDGF receptor phosphorylated at the PI 3-kinase binding site(s) corresponding to Tyr-740 and Tyr-751. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). In vitro PI 3-kinase activity assays were performed as described previously (31Auger K.R. Songyang Z. Lo S.H. Roberts T.M. Chen L.B. J. Biol.

In vitro MAP kinase assays using myelin basic protein as substrate were performed as described previously (32Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at least three times. Error bars reflect standard deviation of the results. STI571 is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine class originally developed as an inhibitor of the abl oncoprotein (33Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Muller M. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar). However, STI571 is also a potent and reasonably selective inhibitor of subgroup III receptor tyrosine kinases including the PDGF receptors α and β. With the exception of Abl, a broad range of other growth factor receptors, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and serine/threonine protein kinases are refractory to inhibition by STI571 at concentrations 100–1000-fold in excess of those needed to inhibit PDGF receptor activation (33Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Muller M. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar). We treated Balb/c 3T3 cells with PDGF in the presence or absence of STI571 (34Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Muller M. Regenass U. Lydon N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2558-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As shown, STI571 inhibited both PDGF receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 1 A) and MCP-1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1 B). STI571 did not, however, prevent the induction of MCP-1 when cells were treated with a different stimulator of MCP-1 transcription, IL-1. Thus, STI571 blocks PDGF receptor activation and PDGF-mediated gene induction. However, the drug does not interfere with the basic transcriptional machinery needed for MCP-1 gene induction by other agents. This result also demonstrates that IL-1-mediated induction does not involve the PDGF receptor via any feedback mechanism. One of the best described pathways for transmitting a signal from a growth factor receptor to the nucleus is the Ras-Raf/MEK-MAP kinase pathway. However, the well characterized MEK inhibitor PD98059 (35Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) was unable to inhibit the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA (Fig.2 B) at levels that inhibit MAP kinase activation as monitored by autophosphorylation (Fig.2 A). Collectively, these data with small molecule kinase inhibitors map the PDGF-activated signal generator(s) for MCP-1 gene induction downstream of PDGF receptor kinase but other than MAP kinase. To investigate the possible role of PI 3-kinase in the PDGF-mediated immediate-early gene induction of MCP-1 in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, we used two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase: wortmannin (36Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Vlahos C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar), an irreversible inhibitor; and LY294002 (37Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a reversible competitor of ATP binding to the enzyme. As shown in Fig.3 A, these PI 3-kinase inhibitors suppress PDGF induction of MCP-1 mRNA. Good correlation between inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity and the reduction in MCP-1 mRNA levels was observed (Fig. 3 B). It should be pointed out that, while 100 μm LY294002 was sufficient to completely abolish MCP-1 expression, 100 nm wortmannin was not. Larger doses of wortmannin were more effective in inhibiting MCP-1 mRNA expression, but the specificity of the compound at such high doses is somewhat suspect. Within the human PDGF β-receptor subunit, tyrosines 740 and 751 serve, in the phosphorylated state, as binding sites for the p85 adapter subunit of PI 3-kinase (38Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As shown by immunoblot analysis with phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (29Shamah S.M. Alberta J.A. Giannobile W.V. Guha A. Kwon Y.K. Carroll R.S. Black P.M. Stiles C.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4141-4147PubMed Google Scholar), neither wortmannin nor LY294002 interfered with phosphorylation of the p85 recognition sites (Fig. 4). Moreover, as shown by immunoblot using a generic antibody to phosphotyrosine, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 diminish the overall level of phosphorylation on PDGF receptors (data not shown). Finally, neither compound had an affect on the IL-1-mediated induction of MCP-1 mRNA (Fig.3 A), indicating the independence of at least the primary steps in the mechanisms behind these two stimuli. Previous studies using nuclear run-on assays have shown a 60–90-min lag between activation of PDGF receptors and enhanced transcription of the MCP-1 gene (23Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig.5 A, only a brief (10 min) pulse of PDGF is necessary to fully stimulate MCP-1 mRNA accumulation. Since a brief exposure of fibroblasts to growth factor is sufficient to stimulate MCP-1 mRNA accumulation, we wondered if the activation of PI 3-kinase need only be transient as well. We treated fibroblasts with wortmannin at various times with respect to the time of PDGF stimulation, and examined the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA 2 h following growth factor addition. Stimulation for 2 h resulted in approximately maximal accumulation of MCP-1, and was used as a standard accumulation period. Fig. 5 B shows a Northern blot analysis of MCP-1 mRNA levels in these cells. Pretreatment of these cells with wortmannin for 15 min greatly inhibited the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA. However, if the inhibitor was added as little as 5 min following stimulation of the cells by PDGF, little or no effect was observed on the mRNA levels. To ensure that we were not missing a delayed stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity following breakdown of wortmannin or a reversibility problem with LY294002, we measured activity of PI 3-kinase after 2 h of stimulation with PDGF. Only basal levels of activity could be observed at the 2 h time point (data not shown). This is in good agreement with the results of Domin et al. (39Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for the examination of PI 3-kinase activity following growth factor treatment. We examined several fibroblast cell lines that were stably transfected with a myristoylated form of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase p110. These cells express slightly elevated levels of p110 relative to wild-type fibroblasts (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6 A, these cells exhibited significant levels of PI 3-kinase activity in the absence of PDGF (somewhat greater than PDGF-stimulated wild-type cells). The increased basal levels of PI 3- kinase activity in these cells coincide with constitutive expression of the MCP-1 gene in the absence of PDGF (Fig.6 B). Constitutive MCP-1 gene expression in cells transfected with the myristoylated p110 subunit is decreased to near base line upon treatment of the cells with wortmannin for 6 h (Fig.6 C). The lipids generated by PI 3-kinase regulate gene expression via activation of downstream protein kinases. One well characterized downstream affector of PI 3-kinase is the 70-kilodalton ribosomal S6 protein kinase (pp70S6K) (40Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Treatment of fibroblasts with rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of this kinase (41Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the PDGF-mediated induction of MCP-1 mRNA (Fig.7 A). As a positive control, we examined the PDGF induced, phosphorylation-dependent, mobility shift of pp70S6K in cells treated (or not) with rapamycin. 1 nm rapamycin was sufficient to completely inhibit the shifted signal in stimulated fibroblasts (Fig. 7 B). Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by lipid products of PI 3-kinase (42Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 43Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 44Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O.

Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We transfected Balb/c 3T3 cells with a myristoylated, constitutively active Akt/PKB construct. As shown, these cells express approximately 3-fold excess myristoylated Akt/PKB over wild-type protein (Fig. 8 A). This Akt/PKB exhibits increased activity over base line, but less than in PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts (data not shown). These cells also have constitutively high levels of MCP-1 mRNA relative to untransfected, control 3T3 cells (Fig. 8 B). This suggests that a subsequent step in the PI 3-kinase-mediated pathway may involve Akt/PKB. Further studies in this direction are obviously necessary to define the role of Akt/PKB in PDGF mediated MCP-1 stimulation.Figure 8Akt/PKB is an affector of PDGF-stimulated MCP-1 expression.

Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). We have evaluated several of these pathways for their involvement in the regulation of MCP-1 gene expression by PDGF. MCP-1 is a member of the immediate-early gene family whose growth factor-stimulated RNA expression mirrors that of c-myc in that accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA occurs with slow kinetics. The data presented here clearly define a role for PI 3-kinase in PDGF-mediated induction of the MCP-1 gene. The involvement of PI 3-kinase in this process is transient in nature. Activity for 10 min is sufficient to stimulate the downstream cascade of events that culminate in MCP-1 stimulation. This temporal window for PI 3-kinase function in MCP-1 gene expression fits very well with previous studies from other workers showing that the association of PI 3-kinase with activated PDGF receptors and the accumulation of in vivo lipid products is transient in nature (39Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity appears to be sufficient for MCP-1 mRNA accumulation. Increased levels of MCP-1 mRNA were readily observed in cell lines that expressed a myristoylated, constitutively active, p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. Treatment of the transfected cells with either of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 for an extended period of time did decrease the amount MCP-1 mRNA in these cells, indicating that the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA was indeed PI 3-kinase-dependent rather than an artifact of the generation of the stable cell lines. Thus, we conclude that PI 3-kinase is necessary and sufficient for the induction of the immediate-early gene MCP-1 in fibroblasts. This induction does not appear to involve the rapamycin-sensitive pp70S6 kinase, nor the MAP kinase cascade. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (48Wagle A. Jivraj S. Garlock G.L. Stapleton S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14968-14974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and hexokinase II (49Osawa H. Sutherland C. Robey R.B. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16690-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are examples of genes whose stimulated expression is PI 3-kinase-dependent. The stimulation of these genes by insulin is rapamycin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of pp70S6K in this stimulatory mechanism. Fatty acid synthase is an example of a gene that is activated through a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism that is not sensitive to rapamycin (50Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25420-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These genes are not, however, members of the immediate-early gene set as MCP-1 clearly is. There have been reports of immediate-early genes induced in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. The response of c-fosto EGF stimulation of HeLa cells has been shown to involve PI 3-kinase via the serum response element (51Wang Y. Falasca M. Schlessinger J. Malstrom S. Tsichlis P. Settleman J. Hu W. Lim B. Prywes R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 513-522PubMed Google Scholar). Growth hormone stimulation ofc-fos, egr-1, and jun B in fibroblasts has been shown to involve PI 3-kinase (52Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), as has vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation of c-fos in endothelial cells (53Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the stimulation of the target gene was also sensitive to PD98059, indicating involvement of the MAP kinase cascade. The finding that MCP-1 expression is mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent, rapamycin-insensitive, and MAP kinase-independent mechanism suggests that other affectors are involved in this pathway. One excellent candidate is the serine threonine kinase Akt/PKB. This kinase is thought to be activated by a phospholipid product of PI 3-kinase, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (42Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 54Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25420-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transcription factors of the forkhead family (FKHR and FKHRL1) have been shown to be substrates of the Akt/PKB kinase activity (55Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 56Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation of these factors results in inhibitory effects on the transcription factor. Similar repressive effects have been noted genetically in Caenorhabditis elegans for Akt homologues akt-1 and akt-2 and the transcription factor Daf-16 (58Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that members of the forkhead family play a role in the positive elements of MCP-1 regulation; however, it is intriguing to consider these factors in the context of the recently described negative regulatory element of the promoter of the MCP-1 gene by Sridhar et al. (59Sridhar P. Liu Y. Chin L.D. Borja C.E. Mann M. Skopicki H.A. Freter R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4219-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies of the role of Akt/PKB in PDGF-mediated MCP-1 stimulation are obviously necessary to further describe the complete pathway between the receptor and the nucleus. The inability of wortmannin or LY294002 to inhibit IL-1-mediated MCP-1 expression in fibroblasts suggests that in this cell type, IL-1 stimulation is via another mechanism. IL-1 has been shown to activate NF-kB and AP-1 in human epidermoid carcinoma cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells via a PI 3-kinase-mediated pathway (60Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results are especially intriguing when considered with our results implicating NF-kB in the PDGF-mediated activation of MCP-1. We have previously demonstrated functional NF-κB sites in the MCP-1 promoter. These studies have implicated accessory serine/threonine phosphoproteins in the stimulatory complex (21Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to identify the role of PI 3-kinase and Akt/PKB in the inducible binding of these proteins to the regulatory sequence upstream of MCP-1. Does the PI 3-kinase/Akt/PKB signaling axis account for induction of all slow immediate-early genes? Unification theories break down immediately upon analysis of another PDGF-responsive slow immediate-early gene, c-myc. As shown by Barone and Courtneidge (61Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the induction of c-myc by PDGF appears to be channeled through activation of Src family kinases. Utilization of two distinct signaling pathways by these two slow immediate-early genes may, in part, explain a striking difference in mRNA abundance levels. In quiescent, PDGF-starved 3T3 cells, there are approximately 100 copies of MCP-1 mRNA per cell. Within 3–4 h following exposure to PDGF, the abundance level rises to approximately 3,000 copies of MCP-1 mRNA per cell. For c-myc, the corresponding abundance levels are approximately 0.1 and 5–10 copies of mRNA per cell in the absence and presence of PDGF. The c-myc and MCP-1 genes exhibit non-coordinate control in multiple other contexts. For example, in 3T3 cells IL-1 and double-stranded mRNA are potent and powerful inducers of MCP-1. The c-myc gene shows little or no response to these agents (19Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that c-myc expression is suppressed by the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product and activated by β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells (62He T.C. Sparks A.B.

The role of this signaling pathway, if any, in MCP-1 gene expression is unknown. In compliance with Harvard Medical School Guidelines on possible conflict of interest, we disclose that two of the authors (T. M. R. and C. D. S.) have consulting relationships with Upstate Biotechnology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Inc."

Gain-of-function alleles of fgfr2 andfgfr3 have been linked to several dominant skeletal disorders in humans, while null mutations in fgfr3 result in the overgrowth of long bones in a mouse model system. Interestingly, the expression pattern of fgfr3 in growth plate chondrocytes overlaps that of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor, a signaling molecule that also regulates endochondral ossification. The coincident expression of these two receptors suggests that their signaling pathways may also interact. To gain insight into the regulatory mechanism(s) that govern the expression of the fgfr3 gene in chondrocytes, we have identified a cell-specific transcriptional regulatory element (CSRh) by measuring the activity of various promoter fragments in FGFR3-expressing (CFK2) and nonexpressing (RCJ) chondrocyte-like cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of PTH/PTHrP receptors, either by stimulation with PTH or through the introduction of activating mutations, represses CSRh-mediated transcriptional activity. Finally, the transcriptional repression of the CSRh element was mimicked by treatment with forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A.

Intramembranous ossification, the primary pathway for flat bone development, relies upon the direct differentiation of condensed mesenchyme into osteoblasts. These osteoblasts then secrete various matrix components until they are encapsulated by calcified bone, thus linking the rate of intramembranous bone growth to the rate of osteoblast differentiation. Alternatively, endochondral ossification, the primary pathway for formation of the axial and appendicular skeleton, differs from intramembranous ossification in that condensed mesenchymal cells (chondrocytes) elaborate a complex cartilaginous template as they progress through a series of developmental stages at the epiphyseal growth plate. The epiphyseal growth plate is organized into distinct cellular compartments: the resting zone, which serves as a renewable source of chondrocytes; the proliferative zone, where rapid cell division results in stacked columns of chondrocytes; and the hypertrophic zone, where the cells terminally differentiate, hypertrophy, and secrete a specialized matrix. After the encapsulated hypertrophic chondrocytes mature, the associated extracellular matrix is rapidly invaded by blood vessels and bone-forming osteoblasts, which synthesize trabecular bone. Thus, the overall rate of longitudinal bone growth is regulated by the progression of chondrocytes through these distinct developmental stages within the epiphyseal growth plate. In vitro and in vivo model systems have been utilized to study both the commitment and subsequent differentiation of chondrocytes (1Ballock R.T. Reddi A.H. J.

Achondroplasia is the most common genetic form of dwarfism in humans and results from a mutation in the transmembrane domain (G380R) of FGFR3, while thanatophoric dysplasia is the most common neonatal lethal skeletal dysplasia in humans and results from any of three independent point mutations in the fgfr3 gene. Clinically, all of these mutations result in a characteristic disruption of growth plate architecture and disproportionate shortening of the proximal limbs. Biochemically, these mutations activate FGFR3 signaling (13Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,14Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast, inactivation of FGFR3 signaling in mice results in an increase in the size of the hypertrophic zone, as well as a coincident increase in bone length (15Colvin J.S.

Such complementary phenotypes suggest that FGFR3 signaling is an essential component of the hierarchy of regulatory mechanisms that regulate endochondral bone growth. Recent studies have demonstrated that PTH/PTHrP receptor signaling, like FGFR3 signaling, regulates the process of endochondral bone growth (17Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A.

Inactivation of either PTHrP or the PTH/PTHrP receptor in mice results in the premature ossification of proliferating chondrocytes as well as a marked decrease in the size of the proliferative zone (17Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H.K. Ho C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1611-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), a phenotype resembling that seen with constitutive activation of FGFR3 signaling. The hypothesis that PTHrP signaling regulates the proliferation of chondrocytes by modulating FGFR3 activity provides an explanation for the similarity in these phenotypes. Such control may involve transcriptional, translational, and/or post-translational mechanisms. To this end, we have examined whether PTH/PTHrP receptor signaling regulates the transcriptional activity of the fgfr3 gene. To examine the mechanisms governing expression of the fgfr3gene in chondrocytes, an “enhancer” element capable of recapitulating the chondrocytic expression pattern of fgfr3 in vitro was identified and shown to be suppressed by PTH/PTHrP receptor signaling. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, either through the elevation of cAMP levels or through the overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA, also suppressed the transcriptional activity of the enhancer element and decreased the steady state levels of the endogenous fgfr3 gene. These results suggest a model whereby the attenuation of PKA signaling, by effectors such as the PTH/PTHrP receptor, serves to regulate endochondral ossification by modulating the chondrocytic expression of fgfr3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to identify a single hexameric “orphan” receptor half-site in the enhancer element that interacts with nuclear protein(s). Elevation of cAMP levels failed to disrupt this DNA-protein complex; however, mutations in this motif that inhibit nuclear protein(s)/DNA interactions do dramatically impair chondrocytic transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, these same mutations did not prevent the cAMP-mediated suppression of transcriptional activity, thus suggesting that there are additional DNA/protein interactions within the enhancer element that are required for the cAMP-dependent regulation offgfr3 expression. p(−2951/−27)FR3-luc, p(−2311/−27)FR3-luc, p(−1537/−27)FR3-luc, p(−220/−27)FR3-luc, p(−175/−27)FR3-luc, p(−126/−27)FR3-luc, and p(−79/−27)FR3-luc were constructed as described previously (21McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To generate pCSR-luc, the appropriate fragment was amplified from p(−2311/−27)FR3-luc using the primers DM62 (5′-TGT ATC TTA TGG TAC TGT AAC TG-3′) and DM144 (5′-GTC GAC CCA TGG GCC CAA CAG ACC-3′). The amplified product was sequenced, digested with SalI and XhoI, and concatamerized through self-ligation with T4 DNA ligase. A three-copy, head-to-tail array was subcloned into pRSV-luc (22Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) digested withXhoI. Orientation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Additional deletion constructs were generated using the same protocol and the following synthetic oligonucleotides: pCSRa-luc, DM62, and DM159 (5′-GTC GAC TTC CTG TAT TGA GCC GAC TTC C-3′); pCSRb-luc, DM144, and DM160 (5′-CTC GAG GGA AGT CGG CTC AAT ACA GG-3′); pCSRc-luc, DM62, and DM162 (5′-GTC GAC CTC AGT CTA GTC TCT GCC TCT CC-3′); pCSRd-luc, DM161 (5′-CTC GAG GGA GAG GCA GAG ACT AGA CTG AG-3′) and DM159; pCSRe-luc, DM163 (5′-CTC GAG ATG AAC AAC TCT AAA TCC-3′), and DM164 (5′-GTC GAC AGA AGT CTG AGG TCA AGT TGG-3′); pCSRf-luc, DM62, and DM175 (5′-GGG AGT GTC GAC TCC TCC CCA CGT CTC CTG-3′); pCSRg-luc, DM62, and DM176 (5′-GGG AGT GTC GAC GGA TTT AGA GTT GTT CAT-3′); pCSRh-luc, DM62, and DM177 (5′-GGG AGT GTC GAC CGT TAT GCT TGC AAG ACT-3′). A trinucleotide substitution in the 5′-PuGGTCA-3′ sequence motif of CSRh was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified product (mCSRh) was sequenced, and a three-copy array was cloned into pRSV-luc as described above. To generate pCRE-luc, CREB-A (5′-GGT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG A-3′) and CREB-B (5′-CCT CTC TGA CGT CAG GCA A-3′) synthetic oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) were 5′-phosphorylated with T4 kinase and annealed. The annealed oligonucleotides were concatamerized by ligation with T4 ligase, blunted with Klenow and deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and then subcloned into the SmaI site of RSV-luc. Clones were sequenced to verify insert identity and orientation. pCRE-luc (TL IV 179.22) contains three copies of CREB-A in a head-to-tail array upstream of the RSV minimal promoter. The rat FGFR3 RNase protection probe was generated by amplifying rat cDNA with the following primers: DO80, 5′-GTC ATG GAA AGT GTG G-3′; and DO113, 5′-GCT CCG ACA CAT TGG-3′. The resulting product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega Corp.), and both the identity and orientation of the insert was confirmed through sequencing. The plasmid pTRI-β-Actin-125-Rat was purchased from Ambion, Inc. The expression plasmid for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (MT-Cα) was obtained from S. McKnight (23Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H.

Biol. 1990; 142: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (clone 3.1C5.18) cell lines were obtained from J. Henderson and J. Aubin, respectively. Cell lines were maintained subconfluent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cells were transfected in triplicate using a modified calcium phosphate precipitant (28Ausubel F.M. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.1.3-9.1.4Google Scholar). The day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well plate (Corning). Four hours prior to transfection, cells were provided with 0.8 ml of fresh media. Five micrograms of each DNA construct (double-banded on a CsCl2 gradient) and 0.5 μg of pCScytoβ-gal (29Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 30Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) were diluted to a final volume of 20 μl with distilled, deionized water. To that was added 250 μl of 0.272m CaCl2 and 270 μl of 2× BBS (50 mm N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4). The DNA mixture was then allowed to precipitate at room temperature for 15 min, and 80 μl of the precipitant was then added directly to the cells. Cells were incubated (5% CO2, 37 °C) with the precipitate for 20 h, at which point they were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and returned to fresh media. When cells were exposed to various pharmacological agents, cells were serum-starved (0.5% serum/Ham's F-12 medium) for 12 h prior to treatment. Sixty hours post-transfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of 1× PBS and subsequently lysed in the well with 250 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid , 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Insoluble materials were removed from all lysates by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 4 min, and 50–100 μl of the cleared lysate was used to analyze luciferase reporter expression as described previously (31Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with the Galacto-Light Plus system, as described by the manufacturer (Tropix, Inc.). Forskolin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO (Sigma) to generate a 1000× stock. The stock solution was diluted to 100× with Ham's F-12 prior to addition to cells. Synthetic human PTH-(1–34) (Sigma) was resuspended in 0.01 m acetic acid and stored at −80 °C. A 2000× stock of PTH was diluted 1:20 with Ham's F-12 medium prior to the stimulation of PTH/PTHrP receptor-transfected cells. Gene expression was determined by RNase protection analysis. Briefly, total cellular RNA was purified from a confluent 10-cm dish using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Twenty micrograms of RNA was lyophilized prior to resuspension in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 80% formamide), which contained 0.5–5×105 cpm of the appropriate [α-32P]UTP (800 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) transcribed probes. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 50 °C for 8 h. Unhybridized probe was removed by adding 350 μl of RNase digestion buffer (10 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 14 μg of RNase A, 248 units of RNase T1) and incubating the reaction for 30 min at 30 °C. Duplex RNA hybrids were then purified with RNAzol B (Teltest, Inc.), dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 8 μl of RNA loading buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanole FF, 80% formamide). Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, chilled on ice, and resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Long Ranger; J. T. Baker). Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. When RNase protection assays were quantified, gels were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified with ImageQuant software (version 3.3, Molecular Dynamics). The sizes for the protected fragments are as follows: rat FGFR3, 291 nt; rat β-actin, 126 nt. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the protocol of Dignam et al. (32Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 10-cm or six 15-cm plates of confluent cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and scraped into 15 ml of 1× PBS. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed with 5 cell volumes of 1× PBS and pelleted as described above. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9, at 4 °C), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT). The cell suspension was then incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, transferred to an ice-cold sterile Dounce homogenizer, and lysed with 30 strokes of a tight fitting pestle. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). The nuclear suspension was transferred to a sterile 50-ml tube, and the proteins were extracted for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the extract was dialyzed against two 100-volume changes of buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). Finally, aliquots of the nuclear extracts were transferred to silanized tubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Extracts were stored at −80 °C. To analyze DNA binding proteins from treated cells, micronuclear extracts were isolated as described (33Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent 35-mm dishes were starved in 0.5% fetal calf serum/F-12 medium for 12 h, followed by treatment with various agents for 12 h (see the legend for Fig. 5). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and collected by scraping into 1.5 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 20 s at 14,000 rpm and resuspended in 100 μl of modified buffer C (17.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 22% (v/v) glycerol, 368 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 175 μm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 350 μmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors) with gentle pipeting. Proteins were eluted for 1 h on ice, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined with a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and used directly. Complementary oligonucleotides encompassing the desired binding site sequences were synthesized locally. All oligonucleotides used were gel-purified and subsequently annealed in 1× oligo buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl) by mixing in a 1:1 molar ratio, heating to 95 °C for 2 min, 97 °C for 30 s, and cooling to 25 °C over a period of 2 h. Duplex oligonucleotide probes were then end-labeled with exo− Klenow (Stratagene, Inc.) and purified over an S-200 HR size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific activity of the probe was estimated and ultimately diluted to 25,000 cpm/0.1 pmol prior to hybridization. Hybridizations were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a volume of 20 μl, which consisted of 0.1 pmol of probe (25,000 cpm), 3 μg of bovine serum albumin (Fisher), 1.25 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 μg nuclear extract, and buffer D. Duplex oligonucleotide competitors were preincubated with the nuclear extract for 5–10 min at 25 °C. The resulting complexes were resolved on a 4–20% gradient gel (Novex) prerun in 0.375× TBE (33 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 75 μm EDTA) at 100 V for 100 min as described (31Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gels were dried under vacuum and subsequently exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. The sense strand of each oligonucleotide used for EMSAs are shown in Table I. To demonstrate the functionality of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), thyroid hormone response element (TRE), and retinoid-like orphan receptor α family 1 (RORα1) competitors, the duplex DNA binding sites were radiolabeled and used to probe CFK2 nuclear extracts. All competitors were able to form gel shift complexes (data not shown).Table ISense strand oligonucleotide sequences used for EMSAsCSRh5′-CGCGTGATCCACAAATGTGACCTTATTTGGAAAAAGAGTCTTGCAAGCATAACGC-3′DM2015′-CGCGTGATCCACAAATGTGACCTTATTTGGAAAAAGAGTC-3′DM2215′-CGCGTGATCCACAAATGTGACCTTCGGGGGAAAAAGAGTT-3′DM2235′-CGCGTGATCCACAAATGTTCCTTTATTTGGAAAAAGAGTT-3′TRE5′-GGTTCAGGTCATGACCTGC-3′C/EBP5′-GAGCTTCATTATGCAATGGAATCTTGCCTTTCG-3′CREB5′-GGGTACAGTGACGTCAGTGGGGT-3′RORE 15′-TCGACTCGTATATCAAGGTCATGCTGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression of fgfrs was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as described previously (34McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). FGFR3 is an essential regulator of endochondral ossification and is expressed in a subset of chondrocytes found within the developing epiphyseal growth plate (15Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 16Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P.

Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The specific expression pattern of fgfr3 suggests that it has stage-specific effects on the process of chondrocyte maturation. To examine the regulation of fgfr3 gene expression, two chondrocytic cell lines, CFK2 and RCJ, were utilized. CFK2 cells and RCJ cells, both derived from fetal rat calvarial mesenchyme, express chondrocyte-specific genes and elaborate a cartilage-like matrix (26Bernier S.M. Desjardins J. Sullivan A.K. Goltzman D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,27Grigoriadis A.E. Heersche J.N.M. Aubin J.E. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CFK2 cells express the fgfr1 (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2), fgfr2 (Fig. 1 A,lane 2), and fgfr3 (Fig.1 A, lane 1) genes, while RCJ cells only express fgfr1 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5) and fgfr2 (Fig.1 A, lane 5). Neither cell line expresses fgfr4 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 6). These data demonstrate that expression of the endogenous fgfr3 gene is regulated in a cell-specific manner and may reflect differences in the stage of chondrocyte differentiation. To define the cis-acting sequences that are responsible for the CFK2-specific expression of the fgfr3 gene, we compared the activities of various fgfr3 promoter fragments in both the fgfr3-expressing (CFK2) and nonexpressing (RCJ) chondrocyte-like cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Previous work has demonstrated that basal promoter elements from the fgfr3gene function equally well in both cell lines (21McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, by exploiting cell-specific differences, we demonstrated that the sequences located between −2311 and −1537 selectively enhanced the transcription of luciferase reporter constructs in the CFK2 cell line and failed to alter basal transcriptional activity in the RCJ cell line (Fig. 1 B), thus recapitulating the cell-specific expression pattern of the endogenous fgfr3 gene in these cell lines. To verify that the chondrocyte cell-specific region (CSR; nucleotides −2311 to −1537) alone was responsible for the observed CFK2-specific transcriptional activity, the CSR sequences were multimerized into a three-copy, head-to-tail array and placed 5′ of the Rous sarcoma virus minimal promoter (pRSV-luc; Ref. 22Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

We investigated the mechanism underlying thepgsA-dependent suppression of the two mutations using purified mutant SecA and inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) prepared from pgsA-overexpressing cells. The acidic phospholipid content increased by about 10% upon pgsAoverexpression. This increase resulted in the stimulation of proOmpA translocation only when mutant SecA or SecG-depleted IMVs were used. The translocation-coupled ATPase activity of SecA was significantly defective with the mutant SecA or SecG-depleted IMVs, but it recovered to a near normal level when the acidic phospholipid level was increased. The stimulation of ATPase activity was observed only at low temperature. The steady-state level of membrane-inserted SecA was low with the mutant SecA or SecG-depleted IMVs, and it decreased further upon the increase in the acidic phospholipid content. However, the level of SecA insertion markedly increased upon the inhibition of SecA deinsertion by the addition of β,γ-imido adenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-PNP), especially with IMVs containing increased levels of acidic phospholipids.

Membrane insertion and deinsertion of SecA coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, have been proposed to be the direct driving force for protein translocation (7Economou A. Wickner W.

SecG, a small membrane protein, also undergoes a membrane topology inversion cycle, which is assumed to be coupled to and to stimulate the SecA cycle (9Nishiyama K. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, SecA insertion significantly decreases upon SecG depletion (10Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki H.

A secG null mutant exhibits cold-sensitive growth, albeit in a strain-specific manner (13Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Bost S. Belin D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pgsA, which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (15Gopalakrishnan A.S. Chen Y.C. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3389-3392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suppresses the cold-sensitive phenotype of the secG null mutant (17Kontinen V.P. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of gpsA encoding a biosynthetic sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is involved in phospholipid synthesis (18Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Raetz C.R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 614-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also suppresses the cold-sensitive property of the secG null mutant (20Shimizu H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 26: 1013-1021Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the absence of the SecG function is compensated for by the manipulation of the phospholipid composition in membranes, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We previously found that among six cold-sensitive mutants, i.e. secAcsR11, secDcs57, secEcs501, secFcs62, secYcs39, and ΔsecG::kan, only the first and last ones restored growth at low temperature upon the overexpression of pgsA (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We then found that asecAcsR11-ΔsecG::kan double mutation causes synthetic lethality that is no longer suppressed bypgsA overexpression (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results revealed the functional interaction between SecA and SecG. However, it is not clear how the pgsA overexpression specifically restores the growth of the two mutants. The translocation of proOmpA in KN425, theΔsecG::kanderivative of W3110 M25, was found to be stimulated when the strain harbored a multicopy plasmid carryingpgsA (17Kontinen V.P. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, because the cold-sensitive growth of theΔsecGmutant is strain-specific, it remains uncertain whether the stimulation of protein translocation by pgsAoverexpression is general or strain-specific. Furthermore, it is not known whether or not pgsA overexpression also stimulates protein translocation in the secAcsR11 mutant.In vitro protein translocation into SecG-depleted inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs)1 (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Hanada M. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is defective even at 37 °C in the absence, but not the presence, of PMF. PMF thus overcomes the translocation defect caused by the SecG depletion or the cold-sensitive SecA at 37 °C, both of which retard the SecA cycle (10Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We recently found that acceleration of the SecA cycle underlies the PMF-dependent stimulation of protein translocation (22Nishiyama K. Fukuda A. Morita K. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). From these observations, it seems likely thatpgsA overexpression also stimulates the SecA cycle, thereby suppressing the translocation defect caused by the SecG-depletion or cold-sensitive SecA mutation. We report here that the increase in the acidic phospholipid content onpgsA overexpression stimulates the SecA cycle specifically in the secAcsR11 and ΔsecG::kanmutants.

Acta. 1992; 1122: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). [35S]proOmpA was synthesized in vitro in the presence of Tran35S-label (4 MBq/mmol) and partially purified by means of gel filtration to remove small molecules (32Tani K. Shiozuka K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP, AMP-PNP, and creatine kinase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Proteinase K was from Merck. Succinate and creatine phosphate were from Sigma. Na125I (629 GBq/mg I) and Tran35S-label (37 TBq/mmol as [35S]methionine) were from ICN. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was from NEN Life Science Products. A DNA fragment containing thepgsA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a pair of primers (5′-GCCAGATCTATAGTTACCCGTCATTAT-3′ and 5′-GCCGGATCCACGCCGAAACGATCAC-3′) and pJVK43 carryingpgsA (17Kontinen V.P. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), followed by digestion with BamHI andBglII. The resultant fragment (680 base pairs) was inserted into the BamHI-BglII site of pUC19BgΔK (9Nishiyama K. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a derivative of pUC19, to construct the pgsA overproducer, pUPA1. E. coli PR520, PR518, KN370, and KN553 harboring pUC19 or pUPA1 were labeled at 20 °C for 1.5 min with Tran35S-label (1.08 μm), followed by a chase for the specified times after the addition of nonradioactive methionine plus cysteine, each at 12 mm. As a control, MC4100 cells harboring no plasmid were also subjected to pulse-chase experiments. The processing of35S-labeled proOmpA to OmpA was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography after immunoprecipitation with an anti-OmpA antibody (13Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). K003 or KN553 harboring pUPA1 or its vector, pUC19, were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (337 TBq/mmol) for 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted with chloroform-methanol (1:1) and then analyzed by thin layer chromatography with Silicagel 60 (Merck) and chloroform, methanol, H2O, 30% NH4OH (120:75:6:2) as the developing solvent. Phospholipids were identified on the chromatogram by autoradiography. The spots of phospholipids were then scraped off to determine radioactivity. IMVs were prepared from E. coli K003, KN553, and PR520 as described (33Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and washed with 4 m urea as reported (34Hanada M. Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture, comprising 4 m urea-treated IMVs (0.2 mg/ml), SecA at a specified concentration, SecB (50 μg/ml), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, an ATP-generating system (5 μg/ml creatine kinase plus 2.5 mm creatine phosphate), and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), was preincubated at 20 °C for 2 min. The reaction was initiated by the successive addition of prewarmed nonradioactive proOmpA (25 μg/ml) and [35S]proOmpA (2.0 × 106 cpm/ml). Aliquots (25 μl) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at various times and mixed with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) to terminate the reaction. After proteinase K digestion on ice, the OmpA materials were recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (final concentration, 10%), successively washed with acetone and ether, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The translocation activity was determined by densitometric quantitation of the OmpA materials and expressed as pmol of OmpA translocated per mg of IMVs. The translocation-coupled ATPase activity of SecA was determined by means of a coupled spectrophotometric assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, as described (35Kawasaki S. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8193-8198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cuvette (2 ml) contained 50 μg/ml of 4 m urea-washed IMVs, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 18.4 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 mm NADH, 5 mm KCN and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The assay was started by the addition of SecA at 10 μg/ml and then proOmpA at the indicated concentrations. The oxidation of NADH was continuously monitored at 340 nm with a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer. ATPase activity, which increased on the addition of proOmpA, was calculated after correction for proOmpA-independent activity by using a value of 6.22 for the millimolar absorption coefficient of NADH. SecA was iodinated with Na125I and iodogen (Pierce) as described (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). SecA insertion was examined as reported (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, IMVs (0.4 mg/ml) washed with 4 m urea were mixed with 125I-labeled SecA (8 nm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (Buffer A). After incubation on ice for 30 min, IMVs loaded with [125I]SecA were overlaid on an equal volume of Buffer A containing 0.2 m sucrose, recovered by centrifugation (170,000 × g for 30 min) at 4 °C, and then suspended in the original volume of Buffer A. The membrane suspension was mixed with an equal volume of a solution comprising 2 mm ATP, 10 mm succinate, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 10 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 0.1 mg/ml SecB in Buffer A. After preincubation for 2 min at 20 °C, proOmpA (25 μg/ml) was added to initiate the translocation reaction. At the indicated times, aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn and treated with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) on ice for 15 min. The proteinase K-resistant 30-kDa band detected on autoradiography after SDS-PAGE was densitometrically quantitated and expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of radiolabeled SecA. Densitometric quantitation was carried out with an ATTO densitograph. The membrane potential (inside positive) and ΔpH (inside acidic) were examined at 20 °C by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of oxonol V (1 μm) and quinacrine (1 μm), respectively, as described (33Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The translocation of proOmpA was examined at 20 °Cin vivo by means of pulse-chase experiments with PR518 (secAcsR11), KN370 (FS1576ΔsecG::kan), KN553 (K003ΔsecG::kan), and PR520 (secEcs501) harboring either pUC19 or pUPA1 (Fig. 1). The secEcs501 mutation is localized upstream ofsecE and causes a decrease in the level of SecE (38Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Processing of proOmpA to mature OmpA in PR520 (Fig. 1,squares) was not affected by pUPA1, whereas that in PR518 (circles), KN370 (upright triangles), and KN553 (inverted triangles) was stimulated when the cells harbored pUPA1 (closed symbols). In contrast to KN370 or KN425 (13Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), KN553 does not exhibit cold-sensitive growth (data not shown). Nevertheless, the stimulation of proOmpA translocation bypgsA overexpression was essentially the same in the threeΔsecG::kan mutants. These results indicate that the pgsA overexpression specifically restores protein translocation in the secAcsR11 andΔsecG::kan mutants at low temperature. However, the restored rate of proOmpA processing was still slower than that in MC4100 cells (Fig. 1, diamonds). We examined the phospholipid compositions of FS1576, MC4100, and K003 and their respective ΔsecG::kan derivatives, KN370, EK414, and KN553. The phospholipid compositions of these strains were essentially the same, suggesting that the strain-specific cold-sensitive growth of the ΔsecG::kan mutant is not caused by a strain-dependent difference in the phospholipid composition. Moreover, PR518 and PR520 had essentially the same phospholipid compositions as these strains. K003 and itsΔsecG::kan derivative, KN553, lack F0F1-ATPase and have been frequently used to prepare IMVs for in vitro examination of protein translocation. We therefore analyzed the phospholipid compositions of these strains harboring pUC19 or pUPA1 (TableI). The pgsA overexpression caused an increase in the acidic phospholipid content (phosphatidylglycerol plus cardiolipin) of about 10% at the expense of phosphatidylethanolamine in both strains. Essentially the same results were obtained when the cells were incubated at 20 °C for 4 h after growth at 37 °C (data not shown).Table IPhospholipid compositionsStrainPlasmidPhospholipid compositionsaThe results are the averages of four experiments.PhosphatidylethanolaminePhosphatidylglycerolCardiolipin%K003pUC1969.7 ± 0.326.7 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.2pUPA159.8 ± 1.334.0 ± 2.06.3 ± 1.2KN553pUC1964.0 ± 0.232.8 ± 0.53.3 ± 0.3pUPA152.1 ± 1.740.9 ± 1.86.0 ± 0.2a The results are the averages of four experiments. Open table in a new tab ThepgsA-dependent stimulation of proOmpA translocation was examined in vitro with IMVs prepared from K003 and KN553 harboring either pUC19 or pUPA1 in the presence of PMF using the purified wild type SecA (wtSecA) or cold-sensitive SecA (csSecA) at 20 °C (Fig. 2). Glu at position 276 was found to be mutated to Ala in csSecA (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This mutation is localized in the 267–340 region of SecA, which has been suggested to participate in precursor binding (39Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When SecG-containing IMVs were used with wtSecA, the translocation activity was not affected by the pgsA overexpression (Fig. 2, compareopen and closed squares). On the other hand, when csSecA was used instead of wtSecA, the pgsA overexpression significantly enhanced the proOmpA translocation into SecG-containing IMVs (Fig. 2, circles). Furthermore, the pgsAoverexpression also increased the translocation into SecG-depleted IMVs, even if wtSecA was used (Fig. 2, upright triangles). The translocation activity in the absence of external SecA was only marginal (Fig. 2, inverted triangles). Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in the acidic phospholipid content due to pgsA overexpression stimulates proOmpA translocation both in vivo and in vitro when SecA carries thesecAcsR11 mutation or when the IMVs lack SecG. ThepgsA overexpression also stimulated proOmpA translocation with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs in the absence of PMF (data not shown). However, the translocation activity under these conditions was lower than that determined with wtSecA and SecG-containing IMVs, indicating that PMF is also required for the recovery of protein translocation to a near normal level at 20 °C. Enhanced generation of PMF could be the reason for the stimulation of proOmpA translocation by pgsA overexpression. We therefore examined the generation of a membrane potential (inside positive) and ΔpH (inside acidic) by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of oxonol V and quinacrine, respectively. All IMVs exhibited essentially the same extent of fluorescence quenching upon the addition of succinate (data not shown), indicating that the pgsAoverexpression had little effect on the generation of Δψ and ΔpH, regardless of the presence or absence of SecG in the membrane. The level of Sec proteins in IMVs was examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). ThepgsA overexpression did not affect the contents of Sec proteins in the membrane, indicating that the stimulation of proOmpA translocation in vitro is not caused by increases in the levels of Sec factors. Moreover, it should be noted that the lack of SecG had little effect on the contents of other Sec proteins in the membrane. The ATPase activity of SecA increases upon the initiation of protein translocation (40Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The increases in the ATPase activity on the addition of various amounts of proOmpA were examined with specified combinations of IMVs and SecAs at 20 °C (Fig. 4). Consistent with proOmpA translocation, when wtSecA was used with SecG-containing IMVs, thepgsA overexpression had no effect on the ATPase activity (Fig. 4, squares). However, when the assay was carried out with csSecA instead of wtSecA, the pgsA overexpression enhanced the ATPase activity over the concentration range of proOmpA examined (Fig. 4, circles). Essentially the same stimulation by the pgsA overexpression was observed when wtSecA was used with SecG-depleted IMVs (Fig. 4, upright triangles). To confirm further that such stimulation is specific to csSecA and ΔSecG, IMVs prepared from PR520 (secEcsE501) were assayed for ATPase activity with wtSecA. The activity remained low irrespective of the pgsA overexpression (Fig. 4, inverted triangles). Apparent K m and Vmvalues were determined under the respective conditions (TableII). Compared with the value obtained with wtSecA and SecG-containing IMVs, a significantly lowerVmvalue was obtained when IMVs prepared from PR520 were used. The affinity for proOmpA slightly decreased with these IMVs. The pgsA overexpression had essentially no effect on theK m and Vmvalues obtained with these IMVs. We previously reported that only the affinity for proOmpA decreases with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs at 37 °C (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, not only the affinity but also the Vmvalue decreased with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs at 20 °C. ThepgsA overexpression specifically restored theVmvalues.Table IIKm and Vm values of the proOmpA-dependent ATPaseSecAIMVsaIMVs were prepared from the specified strains.pgsAoverexpressionKm for proOmpAVmnmμmol/min/mg SecAWild typeK003−8.720.32+6.270.31PR520−21.20.10+13.70.10KN553−67.60.13+70.80.32csSecAK003−58.40.11+46.60.25a IMVs were prepared from the specified strains. Open table in a new tab Both the secAcsR11 and ΔsecG::kanmutants grew normally at 37 °C in the absence of pgsAoverexpression (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether or not the stimulation of ATPase activity by pgsA overexpression is dependent on temperature. ATPase activity, which increased upon the addition of a saturating amount of proOmpA, was measured at various temperatures with various combinations of two kinds of SecA and four kinds of IMVs. The stimulation of ATPase activity by pgsAoverexpression was then estimated at each temperature for the specified combinations of SecA and IMVs (Fig. 5). The stimulation of ATPase activity by the overexpression ofpgsA was specific to a low temperature and was observed only when csSecA (Fig. 5, closed circles) or SecG-depleted IMVs (triangles) were used. In contrast, pgsAoverexpression had no effect on ATPase activity determined with wtSecA and SecG-containing IMVs (Fig. 5, open circles). The effect of pgsA overexpression on the SecA cycle was examined at 20 °C (Fig. 6). Membrane insertion of SecA was monitored as the level of the proteinase K-resistant 30-kDa fragment derived from [125I]SecA, as reported (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The 30-kDa fragment level was determined at various times after SecA insertion was initiated by the addition of proOmpA. The assays were performed in the presence of PMF, which was recently found to decrease the level of membrane-inserted SecA at 37 °C by stimulating deinsertion (22Nishiyama K. Fukuda A. Morita K. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PMF had the same effect at 20 °C, but the decrease in the 30-kDa fragment level upon the generation of PMF was slightly smaller than that at 37 °C (data not shown). When csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs were used, the 30-kDa fragment level was only marginal. The 30-kDa fragment level observed with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs further decreased on the increase in the acidic phospholipid content. When AMP-PNP was added to inhibit SecA deinsertion, the 30-kDa fragment level markedly increased. The level obtained with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs after AMP-PNP was appreciably higher with IMVs prepared frompgsA-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that the increase in the acidic phospholipid content affects the level of SecA insertion not only before but also after the inhibition of deinsertion. We conclude that pgsA overexpression stimulates the rates of both SecA insertion and deinsertion. The importance of negatively charged lipids for protein translocation and, more specifically, the SecA function has been reported (41de Vrije T. de Swart R.L. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 42Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 259-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Moreover, nonbilayer lipids have also been found to be critically important for the translocation (43Rietveld A.G. Koorengevel M.C. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These findings established the general importance of the phospholipid composition for protein translocation. On the other hand, the data shown here revealed that a rather small increase in the acidic phospholipid content very specifically complements the translocation defect caused by thesecAcsR11 or ΔsecG::kan mutation. This specific effect was caused by neither enhancement of PMF generation nor elevation of the levels of Sec components. The increase in the acidic phospholipid content was found to enhance the ATP hydrolysis of SecA specifically when csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs were used. Furthermore, this enhancement was specific to a low temperature. Taken together, these results most likely indicate that the enhancement of ATPase activity underlies the pgsA-dependent suppression of the secAcsR11 and ΔsecGmutations. Membrane insertion and deinsertion of SecA have been shown to be coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of inserted SecA was significantly lower with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs than with the combination of wtSecA and SecG-containing IMVs. The increase in the acidic phospholipid content did not increase, but rather decreased, the steady-state level of inserted SecA. In contrast, the level of inserted SecA dramatically increased when ATP hydrolysis was inhibited by the addition of AMP-PNP, especially with IMVs prepared from pgsA-overproducing cells. Because SecA deinsertion is inhibited in the presence of AMP-PNP, these results indicate that the increase in the acidic phospholipid content enhances the SecA insertion. On the other hand, because the steady-state level of SecA insertion observed in the absence of AMP-PNP was lower with IMVs prepared from pgsA-overproducing cells, it is likely that the increase in the acidic phospholipid content also stimulates the deinsertion step by enhancing the hydrolysis of ATP. We therefore conclude that the stimulation of the SecA cycle underlies thepgsA-dependent suppression of thesecAcsR11 or ΔsecG::kan mutation. Various factors, including temperature, phospholipids, SecYEG, nucleotides, and precursor, cause conformation change of SecA (44Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The increase in the acidic phospholipid content may be required for the correct conformation of csSecA or wtSecA in the absence of SecG. It is noteworthy that not only pgsA overexpression but also PMF was required for the recovery of protein translocation to a near normal level at 20 °C. PMF also accelerates the SecA deinsertion in an ATP hydrolysis-independent manner (22Nishiyama K. Fukuda A. Morita K. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vitro protein translocation examined at 37 °C with csSecA or SecG-depleted IMVs was normal in the presence of PMF, indicating that the retardation of the SecA cycle by the mutations is less serious at 37 °C. On the other hand, because SecA insertion was more severely inhibited at 20 °C, not only PMF but also the increase in the acidic phospholipid content was required to accelerate the SecA cycle to near normal efficiency. It has been reported that the defective SecA insertion caused by theΔsecG::kan mutation is suppressed by a mutation in secA (11Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We previously found that the SecG function is essential in the secAcsR11 mutant (12Suzuki H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the main function of SecG is to keep the SecA cycle efficient, especially at low temperature. This function can be partly substituted for by an increase in acidic phospholipid. In contrast, the cold-sensitive mutations of other sec genes examined in this study were not suppressed by pgsAoverexpression. It seems likely that the efficiency of the SecA cycle is not affected by these mutations. We thank Dr. Mikhail V. Bogdanov for the valuable suggestions regarding lipid analysis. The125I-labeling of SecA was carried out at the Radioisotope Center. We also thank S. Nishikawa for secretarial support."

The heterogeneous spectrum of vertebrate sarcomeric MyHC isoforms and their differential expression pattern underlies the broad classification scheme that histochemically (myofibrillar ATPase) distinguishes four primary adult-stage skeletal muscle fiber-types. Because each MyHC isoform is thought to serve a specific physiological role, variation in the proportion and spatial arrangement of each fiber-type underlies the biochemical and functional specialization of each muscle. This notion is underscored by the classic finding that actin-activated myosin ATPase activity and unloaded shortening velocity (V max) are highly correlated to the amount and type of isomyosin or MyHC comprising a given muscle or muscle fiber (3Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 5: 197-218Crossref Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 4Reiser P. Moss G. Giulian G. Greaser M.L. J. Biol.

More recently, insight into the function of individual MyHC isoforms was gained from studies employing the genetic strategy of homologous recombination to target the inactivation of either the fast type IIb or IId/x MyHC genes. Functional analyses of muscle from either the type IIb or IId/x MyHC knock-out mice revealed altered contractile properties that were unique to each null mutation despite the compensatory activation of the endogenous fast type IId/x and IIa genes, respectively (6Acakpo-Satchivi L.

In contrast to our current knowledge concerning the diversity of adult-stage MyHC isoforms and their distinct functional properties, there exists a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms that govern MyHC fiber-type-specific gene expression and their differential regulation in response to various modes of neuromuscular activity. myosin heavy chain mechanical overload base pair non-weight bearing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase muscle-CAT myocyte enhancer factor 2 control plantaris dimethyl sulfate diethyl pyrocarbonate mechanically overloaded plantaris kilobase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cardiac troponin C B-type natriuretic peptide unprogrammed lysate muscle creatine kinase serum response factor serum response element It has been well documented that the phenotype of adult-stage skeletal muscle can be profoundly altered in response to specific mechanical perturbations, such as mechanical overload (MOV) or non-weight bearing (NWB), which presumably reflect altered neuromuscular activity. To better understand this phenotypic plasticity in molecular terms, we have used the βMyHC gene as a model system since βMyHC expression is primarily restricted to slow-type I fibers in the adult mouse but can be induced in fast-type II fibers following MOV (8Tsika G.L. Wiedenman J.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Sheriff-Carter K. Rivera-Rivera I. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C690-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, βMyHC expression is decreased in slow-type I fibers in response to NWB activity (9McCarthy J.J. Fox A.M. Tsika G.L. Gao L. Tsika R.W. Am. J.

Our investigation into the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the antithetic expression pattern of the βMyHC gene in response to these two diverse stimuli have established that NWB- and MOV-responsive element(s) are distinct and segregated within the proximal promoter of the βMyHC gene (see Fig. 1, Refs.8Tsika G.L.

More specifically, our transgenic studies have delimited a 156-bp βMyHC NWB-responsive promoter region (nucleotides −450 to −294), and within this region we have identified a negative regulatory element (dβNRE-S: −332 to −311) that binds two distinct proteins found only in NWB soleus nuclear extract (10McCarthy J.J.

As concerns MOV, we have identified an 89-bp βMyHC MOV-responsive promoter region (−293 to −205), and shown that mutation of the muscle-CAT (MCAT) and C-rich elements within this region did not abolish transgene induction, suggesting that an MOV element(s) resides within this region (see Fig.1, Refs. 8Tsika G.L.

In support of the hypothesis that a MOV element may reside within the βMyHC 89-bp MOV-responsive region, Hasegawa et al. (17Hasegawa K. Lee J.L. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have reported that this A/T-rich element (referred to as a GATA element by them) within the proximal promoter region of rat βMyHC reporter genes acts as an inducible element following direct injection into pressure-overloaded adult rat hearts. This response was presumably conferred by GATA-4 binding at this element. In light of this finding, and because the A/T-rich element (referred to as βA/T-rich hereafter) contains a GATA/MEF2-like homology, it is noteworthy that McGrew et al. (18McGrew M.J. Bogdanova N. Hasegawa K. Hughes S.H. Kitsis R.N. Rosenthal N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have recently reported the detection of GATA-2 and -3 transcripts in skeletal muscle since GATA factor expression is thought to be absent in this tissue. Furthermore, these investigators also demonstrated that an intact GATA motif is required for full transcriptional activation of the fast alkali myosin light chain-3 (FMLC3) promoter in transient expression assays using primary cultures of neonatal skeletal muscle cells. In contrast to GATA, the involvement of MEF2 proteins in activating muscle gene transcription in response to mechanical perturbations of adult skeletal muscle has not been reported as yet. In addition to GATA and MEF2 proteins, A/T-rich elements have been reported to interact with a diverse group of transcription factors including the ubiquitously expressed POU-domain octamer-binding factor; Oct-1, the homeodomain protein; MHox, the MADS-box (MCM, Agamous, Deficiens, Serum response factor) factor; serum response factor (SRF), and the high-mobility group I and II (HMG-I, HMG-II) architectural proteins (19Fickett J.W.

Given the broad range of transcription factor types that can interact at A/T-rich elements, several important questions arise. First, do known A/T-rich binding transcription factors serve a functional role in directing adult-stage skeletal muscle gene expression in response to altered neuromuscular activity? Second, does the βMyHC A/T-rich (βA/T-rich) element confer MOV-inducible expression to the βMyHC gene in both cardiac and skeletal muscle? Third, given the fast-to-slow fiber-type transition associated with skeletal muscle MOV, does the βA/T-rich element serve a dual role as an inducible and fiber-type element? As an initial attempt to define these important regulatory mechanisms, the current analyses focused on determining whether the βA/T-rich element served as a βMyHC mechanical overload element in MOV skeletal muscle and if GATA, MEF2, SRF, and Oct-1 transcription factor family members bind this element under MOV conditions. This report is the first to implicate a role for the βA/T-rich sequence as a putative MOV element during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo. Additionally, our results provide evidence that GATA4, MEF2C, SRF, and Oct-1 are not components of the highly enriched binding activity identified within mechanically overloaded plantaris (MOV-P) nuclear extract in this study. Furthermore, our data show that two distinct (44 and 48 kDa) proteins, present only in MOV-P nuclear extract, bind the βA/T-rich element under MOV conditions. The latter result implicates these proteins in the MOV-induction of βMyHC transgene expression in fast type II skeletal muscle fibers that normally do not express the βMyHC to any significant degree. Nuclear extract was isolated from adult rat control plantaris (CP) and MOV-P muscle as described previously (10McCarthy J.J. Vyas D.R. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. J. Biol.

All buffers contained 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors. Ten grams of either CP or MOV-P were harvested from adult female Harlan Sprague-Dawley 200-gram rats and minced in phosphate-buffered saline. Minced muscle tissue was incubated in relaxation buffer I, for two 15-min intervals, followed by two 10-min washes in relaxation buffer II. The muscle tissue was then homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged through a 27% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient at 27,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pelleted nuclear layer was consolidated and lysed by the addition of 3 mNH4SO4 (pH 7.9) to a final concentration of 0.4m. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 126,000 ×g for 1 h (4 °C) to pellet nuclear membrane debris. Solid NH4SO4 (0.3 g/ml) was added slowly to the supernatant, and the precipitated nuclear proteins were concentrated by ultra-centrifugation at 126,000 × gfor 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in dialysis buffer and dialyzed for 2 h. The nuclear protein extract was stored in aliquots at −80 °C.

Parallel TnT reactions were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). Efficient translation and expected molecular weights of the protein products were verified by resolving the radiolabeled reaction products on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE).

Two-dimensional UV cross-linking was performed essentially as described previously by us (10McCarthy J.J. Vyas D.R. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14270-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The first dimension of this assay involved EMSA using the bromodeoxyuridine-substituted βA/T-rich probe and MOV-P nuclear extract since only this reaction revealed the formation of a highly enriched DNA-protein complex. EMSA was performed as described above, except that the reaction mixture was scaled up 5-fold. Immediately following electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to UV irradiation (312 nm) for 30 min at 4 °C. The specific band corresponding to the cross-linked DNA-protein complex was excised, transferred to a sample well of a SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at 150 V for 75 min (second dimension PAGE). Following electrophoresis, the gel was placed on Whatman filter paper and dried, and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. DMS and DEPC DNA-footprinting assays were performed as described by Sturm et. al (37Sturm R. Baumruker T. Franza Jr., B.R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).32P-labeled βA/T-rich probe was modified by either 0.7% DMS or 2% DEPC for 15 min at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The probe was used for preparative EMSA as described above, except the reactions were scaled-up 10-fold. Bands corresponding to the DNA-protein complex and free probe were excised from the EMSA gel and recovered by electroelution. Base-specific cleavage of the recovered DNA was carried out in a 100-μl 1 m piperidine incubation for 30 min at 90 °C which was followed by repeated rounds of lyophilization to remove the piperidine. Equivalent amounts (1000 cpm/lane) of free and bound cleaved probe were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing sequencing gel. Gels were autoradiographed for 24 h. Our previous work has identified an 89-bp MyHC MOV-responsive region (−293 to −205) which contains a highly conserved A/T-rich motif that harbors an overlapping GATA/MEF2-like homology (Figs. 1 and2). Since the βA/T-rich element appears to function, in part, as an inducible element of injected rat βMyHC reporter constructs in pressure overloaded adult rat hearts, it was important that we determine whether the human βA/T-rich element functions in vivo as an MOV-inducible element (MOV-E) in adult skeletal muscle. We initiated this investigation by first examining the binding properties of the βA/T-rich element by performing gel EMSAs using CP and MOV-P nuclear extract. The incubation of the double stranded 24-bp 32P-labeled βA/T-rich probe (−275/−252, Table I) with these skeletal muscle nuclear extracts resulted in a binding complex that was substantially enriched only when MOV-P nuclear extract was used (Fig. 3 A and Fig.4, lanes 1 versus7). This enriched binding complex was judged to be specific because the addition of 100-fold molar excess cold wild-type βA/T-rich probe abolished binding complex formation (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and8), whereas 100-fold molar excess cold mutant (βA/T-mut) probe (Fig. 4,lanes 3 versus 9) did not. The nucleotides mutated within the βA/T-mut probe corresponded to DNA-protein contact points elucidated in our DMS and DEPC footprinting experiments (Fig. 3,B and C). These data establish that highly enriched binding activity exists in MOV-P nuclear extract as compared with CP nuclear extract and support the notion that the βA/T-rich element may function as an MOV element that confers induction to βMyHC transgenes in adult skeletal muscle.Figure 4EMSA analysis of sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions at the βA/T-rich element. 5 μg of either CP (lanes 1–6) or MOV-P (lanes 7–12) nuclear extract was incubated in the presence of 8 fmol (20,000 cpm) of the βA/T-rich oligonucleotide. For competition assays, the following non-radioactive competitor oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture at a 100-fold molar excess prior to the addition of the probe: βA/T-rich (lanes 2 and8), βA/T-rich mutant (lanes 3 and9), cTnC GATA (lanes 4 and 10), αMyHC GATA (lanes 5 and 11), and BNP GATA (lanes 6 and 12).

SC, specific complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the exact nucleotides involved in the highly enriched DNA-protein binding complex formed at the βA/T-rich element, we performed DMS and DEPC interference footprinting analyses. DMS footprinting delimited a binding site on the sense strand of the 24-bp βA/T-rich probe that encompassed nucleotides −269 to −266 wherein methylation of guanine residues either partially (positions 7 and 8) or strongly (position 10) interfered with nuclear protein binding (Fig. 3,B and C). In contrast, DMS modification of the antisense strand did not distinguish a DNA-protein interaction. The modification of adenine residues by DEPC treatment resolved a protein binding site demarcated by strong interference at positions 11 and 13 on the sense strand, and 12, 14, 15, and 16 on the antisense strand (Fig. 3, B and C). Overall, our DMS and DEPC interference footprinting experiments revealed that MOV-P nuclear protein(s) interact at a site spanning nucleotides −269 to −260 of the 24-bp βA/T-rich probe. This interaction involves nucleotides comprising the overlapping GATA/MEF2-like homology; however, it also includes two 5′-flanking guanines that may be important determinants specifying bi"

We have recently reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and NF-κB and activated protein 1 (AP-1) play a crucial role in the activation induced by this bacterial compound. To further elucidate the mechanisms by which LAMPf mediate the activation of macrophages, we assessed the effects of inhibiting small G proteins Rac, Cdc42, and Rho. The Rho-specific inhibitor C3 enzyme completely abolished the secretion of tumor necrosis factor α by macrophages stimulated with LAMPf and also inhibited the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase. In addition, we have shown that LAMPf stimulate Cdc42 and that inhibition of Cdc42 or Rac by dominant negative mutants abrogates LAMPf-mediated activation of JNK and transactivation of NF-κB and AP-1 in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. These results indicate that small G proteins Rho, Cdc42, and Rac are involved in the cascade of events leading to the macrophage activation by mycoplasma lipoproteins.

These results indicate that small G proteins Rho, Cdc42, and Rac are involved in the cascade of events leading to the macrophage activation by mycoplasma lipoproteins. A number of microbial cell wall products, including lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan fragments, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoproteins, have been demonstrated to activate macrophages (1Henderson B. Poole S. Wilson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 316-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation results in the synthesis and secretion of a set of proinflammatory cytokines that can participate in the clinical manifestations associated with infectious diseases (2Henderson B. Poole S. Wilson M. Immunopharmacology. 1996; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although mycoplasmas, the smallest self-replicating bacteria, are characterized by the absence of cell walls (3Razin S. Barile M.F. The Mycoplasmas. 4. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar), they have been demonstrated to stimulate macrophages very efficiently (3Razin S. Barile M.F. The Mycoplasmas. 4. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar, 4Razin S. Yogev D. Naot Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1094-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, some species of mycoplasmas, namely Mycoplasma fermentans, have been suspected of playing a role in rheumatoid arthritis (5Taylor-Robinson D. Schaeverbeke T. J. Clin. Pathol. 1996; 49: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A number of studies show that mycoplasma-derived membrane lipoproteins (called LAMP 1The abbreviations used are:LAMPlipid-associated mycoplasma proteinsLAMPfM. fermentans-derived LAMPMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseAP-1activated protein 1TNFαtumor necrosis factor αPTXpertussis toxinSAPKstress-activated protein kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCRIBCdc42/Rac interactive bindingGSTglutathioneS-transferaseC3IaC3 Iota-toxinIbbinding component of the Iota-toxinsMALP-2M. fermentans-derived synthetic lipopeptide for lipid-associated mycoplasma proteins) are the agents involved in the activation of macrophages leading to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (6Rawadi G.

Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms by which LAMP stimulate monocytic cells. We have recently demonstrated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the cytokine secretion induced by M. fermentans-derived LAMP (LAMPf) (8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). Challenging macrophages with LAMPf results in significant activation of MAPK family members p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, the selective inhibition of the different MAPK pathways dramatically affected the induction of cytokine secretion by LAMPf, underscoring the crucial role of these cascades in the LAMPf-mediated effects. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that LAMPf are capable of inducing NF-κB, activated protein 1 (AP-1), and c-fosactivation in macrophages and of stimulating NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation (9Rawadi G.

In this study we have examined whether small GTPases are involved in the activation of macrophages by LAMPf. Using different approaches to specifically inhibit Rac, Cdc42, and Rho in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, we have established their implication in the signaling cascades triggered by M. fermentans lipoproteins. GST-c-Jun (1–79) was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Philadelphia). Anti-JNK1 (C17), anti-ERK (K23), anti-p38 (C20), anti-HA polyclonal antibodies, Ccd42 polyclonal antibody (SC-87), and A/G-Sepharose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The p38/RK/Mpk2 assay kit was available through Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The p42/44MAPK enzyme assay and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were commercially available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was obtained from Genzyme (Boston, MA). Chimeric C3 Iota (C3Ia)-toxin and the binding component of the Iota-toxin (Ib) were produced as described by Marvaud and Popoff (14Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1998; 29 (suppl.): 72-73Google Scholar). Toxin B was produced from Clostridium difficile UPI10463 as described by Just et al.(15Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For stimulation experiments, cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/ml and then cultivated overnight. For TNFα production, cells were stimulated with LAMPf (1 μg/ml) for 18 h. TNFα concentration was measured using a TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection limit was 10 pg/ml. For phosphotransferase assays, cells were stimulated with LAMPf for 30 min as indicated above and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed as described (8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by micro-BCA assay (Pierce). To assess the effect of bacterial toxins on LAMPf-mediated cell activation, cells were pretreated with either pertussis toxin (PTX) or toxin B at the indicated concentrations for 2 and 18 h, respectively, before stimulation with LAMPf. To address the effect of C3 enzyme, cells were preincubated with C3Ia in the presence Ib (molar ration 1:1) at indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to LAMPf challenge. In control experiments, cells were pretreated with Ib alone as described above. For transfection, RAW 264.7 cells were grown up to 80% confluence and then transfected with the indicated plasmids by the electroporation method as described by Stacey et al. (16Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested at 5 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 200 μl (i.e. 107 cells) were used for each electroporation. 10 μg of plasmid DNA were added to cells, which were then electroporated under the following conditions: 200 milliohms and 960 microfarads (time, 52 ms). Electroporated cells were left at room temperature for 10 min and then resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and distributed in 24-well culture plates. Plasmids coding for Cdc42V12, Cdc42N17, RacV12, and Rac42N17 were provided by Dr. A. Atfi (CNRS, Saint Antoine, Paris). The HA-tagged JNK construct was provided by Dr. B. Dérijard (CNRS, Nice, France), and the HA-tagged ERK1 construct was obtained from Dr. J. Pierre (CNRS, Chatenay-Malabry, France). The NF-κB and AP-1 luciferase reporter constructs were kindly provide by Dr. A. Acuto (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Transfected cells were cultured in growth medium overnight and then either left unstimulated or stimulated with LAMPf or for 6 h. Cells were then harvested, protein concentration was determined by micro-BCA assay (Pierce), and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (17Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing and John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 9.6.1-9.6.14Google Scholar). Specific luciferase activity, determined in duplicate samples using an automated luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, EG1G Berthold, Wilbad, Germany), was determined in arbitrary units after normalization to the protein content. Luciferase fold induction was calculated as the ratio of specific luciferase activity in the stimulated cells to the unstimulated ones. ERK, JNK, and p38 were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies as described previously (8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). ERK and p38 activation was determined by measuring radioactively their respective phosphotransferase activities toward peptide substrate using p42/44MAPK or p38/MpK2 detection kits. To measure JNK activation, 2 μg of GST-c-Jun were added to SAPK/JNK immunoprecipitates in the presence 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated by adding SDS sampler buffer to 1× final concentration. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol, embedded in cellophane sheets, and dried. Gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitatively assessed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA for an extended Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain from WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) (amino acids 201–321) (18Rudolph M.G.

Raw 264.7 cells were stimulated for the appropriate times as described above, washed with ice cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer as described by Ren et al. (19Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and 2 mg of protein from total lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with GST-CRIB (50 μg) immobilized on glutathione beads. The beads were washed four times with Tris buffer containing (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by blotting into nitrocellulose membranes. Bound Cdc42 proteins were detected using a polyclonal antibody against Cdc42, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have previously demonstrated the capacity of LAMPf to activate strongly the production of TNFα by monocytes/macrophages (7Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK pathways and NF-κB and AP-1 play a crucial role in the activation of macrophages by LAMPf (8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rawadi G. Garcia J. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2193-2203PubMed Google Scholar), yet the upstream effectors involved in the LAMPf-mediated induction activation still have to be determined. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are able to induce a variety of responses including activation of MAPK cascades (20Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 21Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of PTX, an inhibitor of heterotrimeric G proteins, on the capacity of LAMPf to induce TNFα release by the murine macrophage cell line RAW 267.4 and human monocytic cell line THP-1. PTX treatment at concentration up to 100 ng/ml did not significantly modify TNFα production by either RAW 267.4 or THP-1 cells when challenged with LAMPf (Fig.1), thus suggesting that heterotrimeric G proteins are not involved in LAMPf-triggered signaling cascades leading to cytokine production. The small GTPase proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in the activation of MAPK cascades in different cell models (21Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 23Johnson D.I. Microbiol.

To investigate the involvement of small GTPase proteins in macrophage activation by LAMPf, we decided to study the effects of selective inhibitors described for these proteins. Clostridium botulinum C3 enzyme specifically inhibits the small GTPase, Rho (24Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Marvaud and Popoff (14Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1998; 29 (suppl.): 72-73Google Scholar) have shown that Iota-toxin can internalize efficiently C3 enzyme (C3Ia) into cells. 2J. C. Marvaud and M. Popoff, manuscript in preparation. The internalization is optimal in the presence Ib. We have tested the effect of C3Ia treatment in the presence of Ib on the murine macrophages RAW 264.7 by evaluating its capacity to disrupt actin cytoskeleton. Treatment with C3Ia/Ib (molar ration 1:1) at 10−8m for 1 h induced actin depolymerization in 90% of cells (data not shown). Under these conditions, C3 enzyme completely inhibited TNFα production in response to LAMPf by RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 1), indicating that Rho is involved in the LAMPf-mediated macrophage activation. TNFα inhibition by C3Ia/Ib was dose-dependent in the concentration range of 10−10 to 10−8m (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 1, Ib treatment alone did not modify the levels of TNFα in LAMPf-treated cells. We have also examined the effect of C. difficile enterotoxin toxin B, which displays an inhibitory activity on the small GTPases Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (15Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with toxin B at 100 ng/ml prior to activation only slightly affected TNFα release by LAMPf-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 1). Concentration higher than 100 ng/ml did not exhibit stronger inhibition. In fact, in experiments where cells were treated with toxin B at 100 ng/ml or higher, only a small amount of the treated cells (15–20%) showed disrupted cytoskeleton (data not shown). The low inhibitory activity of toxin B is therefore most likely due to its inefficient penetration into macrophages. We further investigated the effect of C3 enzyme and toxin B on the activation of MAPK pathways in response to LAMPf. As depicted in Fig.2, C3 enzyme completely abolished ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 activation in response to LAMPf. As expected, toxin B exhibited a very weak inhibitory activity in this assay. Our data clearly indicate that in macrophages, Rho GTPase is involved in signaling pathways triggered by LAMPf and leading to cytokine production. above experiments, the involvement of Rac1 and/or Cdc42 could not be clearly established, and we examined whether LAMPf was capable of activating Cdc42 in macrophage cells. We have used the CRIB domain from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein that specifically interacts with GTP-bound Cdc42 (25Symons M Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) to determine the guanine nucleotide status of Cdc42 in macrophages challenged with LAMPf. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LAMPf for different time intervals; the Cdc42 GTP-bound form was precipitated from cell lysates using a GST-CRIB construct and revealed by immunoblotting using anti-Cdc42 antibody. As shown in Fig.3, a significant amount of GTP-bound Cdc42 could be detected in LAMPf-activated cells after 5 min of stimulation and strongly increased after 15 min of stimulation. These data clearly indicate that LAMPf affects the guanine nucleotide status of Cdc42 in RAW 264.7 cells. To investigate the implication of these small GTPases in response to LAMPf, we used corresponding dominant negative forms. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently cotransfected with Rac dominant negative (RacN17) and with a plasmid expressing either HA-tagged JNK1 (HA-JNK) or HA-tagged ERK1 (HA-ERK). A similar set of cotransfection experiments was performed utilizing Cdc42 dominant negative (Cdc42N17). In both cases, cotransfected cells were stimulated with LAMPf for 30 min, and HA-JNK and HA-ERK were immunoprecipitated from corresponding cells using anti-HA antibody, and their activation was assessed. Control points included the use of constitutive active forms of Rac1 or Cdc42 (RacV12 and Cdc42V12, respectively). As depicted in Fig. 4, Rac or Cdc42 dominant negatives dramatically decreased the LAMPf-mediated JNK activation without significantly affecting LAMPf-mediated ERK activation. Interestingly, activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 by expression of the activated mutant forms (RacV12 or Cdc42V12) did not affect the activation of JNK by LAMPf, indicating that Rac1 and Cdc42 activation are necessary but not sufficient for LAMPf-induced JNK activation in macrophages. All of the Cdc42 and Rac constructs used herein were FLAG-tagged, and the expression of these constructs in transfected cells was verified by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). We further investigated the effect of dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 on the activation of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB mediated by LAMPf. We therefore transiently cotransfected murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with either RacN17 or Cdc42N17 and either NF-κB- or AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmids. Our data clearly show that RacN17 and Cdc42N17 were capable of abrogating both NF-κB- and AP-1-LAMPf-mediated activation (Fig. 5). Cotransfection with activated forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 was not sufficient to induce NF-κB or AP-1 transactivation. Together, our data provide strong evidence that Rac1 and Cdc42 play a crucial role in the activation of macrophages displayed by LAMPf. Mycoplasmas have been demonstrated to be potent biological response modifiers by acting on immune cells, notably the monocyte lineage (6Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Castedo M. Dutilleul V. Susin S. Marchetti P. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This property is likely to participate in the pathogeny of Mycoplasma, especially in the autoimmune disorders associated with some species of this genus (4Razin S. Yogev D. Naot Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1094-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taylor-Robinson D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 23: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mycoplasma-derived lipoproteins have been reported to play a crucial role in the activation of macrophages and the induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, but the signal transduction events responsible for this induction are not fully understood. Comprehension of the mechanisms by which mycoplasma-derived lipoproteins activate macrophages improves our understanding of the pathogenesis of these bacteria and helps to elucidate general mechanisms of macrophage activation leading to cytokine secretion. We have recently demonstrated that in both human and murine macrophages PTK (protein tyrosin kinase) and MAPK activation are required to transduce signals leading to cytokine production in response to M. fermentans-derived lipoproteins (8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that LAMPf induce NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB (c-AMP response element-binding protein) nuclear translocation in these cells by measuring their respective DNA binding activities and stimulate NF-κB, AP-1, and c-fos transactivation (9Rawadi G. Garcia J. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2193-2203PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper we present evidence that small G proteins Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho play a crucial role in the signaling elicited by LAMPf and leading to macrophage activation. Cdc42 and Rac1 mediate the activation of JNK by LAMPf, whereas Rho seems to control the three MAPK cascades so far identified in mammals: ERK, JNK, and p38. Few studies have addressed the involvement of the Rho family of small GTPases in the activation of MAPK pathways. In human kidney cells it has been reported that Cdc42 and Rho, but not Rac, can induce activation of JNK (13Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These results do not exclude, however, the participation of Rac in the activation of JNK mediated by a biological stimulus. Interestingly, dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 have been demonstrated to inhibit the ability of interleukin-1 to increase JNK or p38 activity in HeLa and COS cells (10Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 12Bagrodia S. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Rho has been demonstrated to be involved in integrin-mediated activation of ERK2 in human fibroblasts (27Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To our understanding, this is the first report showing the involvement of the Rho family of small GTPases in the activation of MAPK by a bacterial compound and more generally in the macrophage activation signaling leading to the secretion of cytokines. C3 enzyme, which inactivates Rho, introduced into macrophages by means of ι-toxin, totally inhibited TNFα production and MAPK activation induced by LAMPf. The partial effect of toxin B, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, was associated with a poor internalization of this toxin in macrophages. As shown in the present study, LAMPf were able to directly affect the guanine nucleotide status of Cdc42. The role of Cdc42 and Rac in LAMPf-mediated macrophage activation was further pointed out by the fact that transfection with dominant negative forms of Rac and Cdc42 abolished the activation by LAMPf. Although Rac and Cdc42 have been demonstrated to be sufficient to stimulate MAPKs in COS cells (10Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 11Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), the activated forms of Rac and Cdc42 failed to stimulate either MAPK or NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation in RAW 264.7 cells. This finding suggests that in macrophages Rac and Cdc42 may operate at some distance from the pathways being investigated, and the assistance of other signaling cascades could be necessary for a complete macrophage activation. Although some cellular processes in macrophages that are controlled by small G proteins have been demonstrated to involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (28Weber K.S. Klickstein L.B. Weber P.C. Weber C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Hmama Z. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Nandan D. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1050-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin did not modify the capacity of LAMPf to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (data not shown). Despite the growing improvement of the picture of the M. fermentans signaling pathway, from this study and from our previous reports, the characterization of a putative receptors for mycoplasma lipoproteins remains elusive (7Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rawadi G. Garcia J. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2193-2203PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have provided strong evidence in the past that the activation of macrophages by mycoplasma lipoproteins is independent of CD14 (i.e.lipopolysaccharide receptor) (7Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently we reported that aM. fermentans-derived synthetic lipopeptide (sMALP-2, for synthetic macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2) activates macrophages in a manner fully comparable with that of the membrane lipoprotein fraction (30Garcia J. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. Rawadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34391-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, sMALP-2 constitutes a valuable surrogate for identifying the macrophage membrane constituents responsible for the response elicited by LAMPf. This important issue is currently under investigation by our group."
https://openalex.org/W2073462419,"A fraction of the signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA from human, rat, Xenopus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells contains a single post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue on its 3′-end; in the case of human SRP RNA, over 60% of the SRP RNA molecules contain a nontemplated adenylic acid residue on their 3′-ends (Sinha, K.

A U1A protein peptide conjugated to albumin completely inhibited the polyadenylation of a SV40 mRNA by HeLa cell nuclear extract in vitro; however, the 3′-end adenylation of human SRP RNA or Alu RNA, which corresponds to 5′ and 3′-ends of SRP RNA, was not affected by this U1A peptide conjugate.

In addition, binding of SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer was required for adenylation of Alu RNA in vitro. These lines of evidence, along with other data, show that post-transcriptional adenylation of SRP and Alu RNAs is carried out by a novel enzyme that is distinct from the mRNA poly(A) polymerase, CCA-adding enzyme, and nonspecific terminal transferase.

Following transcription, eukaryotic precursor RNA molecules undergo various modifications and processing reactions. These modifications include 5′ capping, 3′ polyadenylation, splicing of pre-mRNAs, editing, and modifications on the base, sugar, and phosphate residues. We studied the formation of the 3′-end of several small RNAs, and results showed that a significant fraction of some human small RNAs including SRP (7SL) RNA, nuclear 7SK RNA, spliceosomal U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) 1The abbreviations used are:snRNAsmall nuclear RNAPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRSRPsignal recognition particleRNPribonucleoprotein1The abbreviations used are:snRNAsmall nuclear RNAPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRSRPsignal recognition particleRNPribonucleoprotein and ribosomal 5 S RNA contain a single post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue on their 3′-ends (1Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This 3′-end adenylation is conserved through evolution, since SRP and U2 snRNAs fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Xenopus, rat, and human cells contain this nontemplated post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue. We also developed an in vitro system in which SRP RNA is accurately processed by the HeLa cell nuclear extract, where three transcriptionally encoded uridylic acid residues are removed on the 3′-end and a single adenylic acid residue is added on the 3′-end (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies also showed that the Aluportion of the SRP RNA or an 87-nucleotide-long RNA containing 5′ and 3′ portions of the SRP/Alu RNA is necessary and sufficient to direct accurate 3′-end processing and adenylation (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, not every small RNA contains this post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue on its 3′-end. For example, there was no detectable adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end of abundant nuclear RNAs like U1 or U4 snRNAs. These data show that nontemplated adenylic acid residues are specifically added to some cellular RNAs (1Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). small nuclear RNA polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-PCR signal recognition particle ribonucleoprotein small nuclear RNA polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-PCR signal recognition particle ribonucleoprotein While the exact function of this 3′ adenylation in SRP RNA or in other small RNAs is not known, several facts point toward the importance of this adenylation. The phenomenon of adenylation is conserved through evolution from yeast to humans. The extent of 3′ adenylation increases through evolution, indicating that this modification confers an advantage. For example, in the case of S. cerevisiae cells only 2–3% of the SRP RNA and U2 snRNA are adenylated, whereas in the case of human cells over 60% of the SRP RNA and U2 snRNA contain this post-transcriptional adenylation. The adenylation occurs very early in the biogenesis of the SRP RNA and is maintained by constant turnover (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Xu and Cohen (3Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) provided evidence for RNA degradation mediated by the addition of a short poly(A) tail by poly(A) polymerase. However, in this case, only one adenylic acid residue is added, and over 60% of human SRP RNA molecules contain this adenylation. Therefore, the function of this 3′-end adenylation is unlikely to be related to the turnover/degradation of SRP RNA. There are several well studied enzymes that add adenylic acid residues to the 3′-end of RNAs. The most characterized among these enzymes are the CCA-adding enzyme to the 3′-end of transfer RNAs and the mRNA poly(A) polymerase responsible for poly(A) formation in mRNAs (4Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,5Manley J.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to polyadenylation of mRNAs, poly(A) polymerase is known to be responsible for the addition of one adenylic acid residue, few adenylate residues, or poly(A) to the 3′-end of many other RNAs including human telomerase RNA (6Chapon C. Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 1337-1351PubMed Google Scholar) and some stable small RNAs (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12158-12162Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The CCA addition is carried out by a tRNA-specific nucleotidyltransferase, and the same enzyme adds both C and A residues to the 3′-end of tRNAs (9Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In fact, Weiner and co-workers (10Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have shown that the CCA-adding enzyme contains a single active site that contacts the same tRNA structure while adding both the C and A residues. The tRNA nucleotidyltransferase covalently linked to the tRNA substrate was capable of adding both C and A residues (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since the SRP-adenylating enzyme adds only an A residue but not a C residue (1Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 3′-end adenylation of SRP RNA is not mediated by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The mRNA poly(A) polymerase specifically adds a poly(A) tail to the mRNAs in the presence of specificity factors. In the absence of specificity factors, poly(A) polymerase is capable of adding multiple adenylic acid residues to any RNA containing 3′ OH groups. While theS. cerevisiae contains a single poly(A) polymerase (12Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the human cells contain several isoforms of poly(A) polymerase (13Ryner L.C. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4229-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Thuresson A.C. Astrom J. Astrom A. Gronvik K.O. Virtanen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, all these isoforms of human poly(A) polymerase are closely related, and specific polyadenylation is dependent on AAUAAA signal and specificity factors (13Ryner L.C. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4229-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Stable RNAs with 1–7 adenylic acid residues on their 3′-ends accumulate in 3′ exonuclease-deficientEscherichia coli and in yeast strains (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12158-12162Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Elela S.A. Ares M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). InE. coli strain lacking tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, poly(A) polymerase participates in the incorporation of A residue into the defective tRNA-C-C in order to maintain functional tRNA (16Reuven N.B. Zhou Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33255-33259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tyrosine tRNA in chicken mitochondria contains a short poly(A) tail out of which a single adenylic acid is retained before CCA is added to obtain a functional tyrosine tRNA. This short poly(A) tail in this tRNA is added by poly(A) polymerase (17Yokobori S. Paabo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs are also known to contain a poly(A) tail (18Attardi G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 93-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Baserga S. Linnenbach A.J. Malcolm S. Ghosh P. Malcolm A. Takshita K. Forget B.G. Benz E.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 35: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The enzyme involved in the addition of these 3′ adenylic acid residues to the stable RNAs is the poly(A) polymerase (7Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12158-12162Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Attardi G. Int. Rev.

In addition, there are several other instances, including bacteriophage oop RNA (21Szalewska-Palasz A. Wrobel B. Wegrzyn G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), where 3′ adenylate residues are added by poly(A) polymerase. Further, poly(A) polymerase surprisingly adds only a single adenylic acid residuein vitro under conditions of limiting ATP concentrations (22Zwierzynski T.A. Widmer G. Buck G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4647-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared likely that the enzyme responsible for the addition of adenylic acid residue to the 3′-end of SRP RNA may be mRNA poly(A) polymerase. Several lines of evidence obtained in this study show that mRNA poly(A) polymerase is not involved in the 3′ adenylation of SRP RNA; therefore, a novel adenylating enzyme is responsible for the addition of a single adenylic acid residue to the 3′-end of SRP RNA. [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]UTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. TaqDNA Polymerase was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. T7 RNA polymerase and all other restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. The TA-Cloning Kit was from Invitrogen, and the PCR DNA product purification kit was from QIAGEN. The BSA-U1A peptide and free U1A peptide were obtained through Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). Plasmid DNA containing theAlu portion of canine SRP RNA (p7Alu) under the T7 promoter was a gift from Dr. Katharina Strub (23Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This Alu sequence was altered by PCR in order to insert a DraI site on its 3′-end and was cloned into pUC19 vector by insertion intoEcoRI and HindIII sites. The Alu RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA template linearized by DraI, and the transcribed RNA contained three uridylic acids on the 3′-end. DNA template to prepare mutant Alu RNA was constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, cloned into pUC19 vector, and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from the plasmid DNA template linearized by DraI. For the polyadenylation of yeast CYC1 pre-mRNA with yeast extract, the plasmid DNA containing the CYC1 gene (a gift from Dr. Walter Keller) was linearized with NdeI restriction enzyme, and capped CYC1 pre-mRNA was synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase including [α-32P]UTP as the labeled nucleotide. The run-offCYC1 pre-mRNA transcript was 194 nucleotides long, containing a few nucleotides downstream of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. This precleaved RNA was used as a substrate for polyadenylation by yeast extract in vitro, and this method of RNA preparation is identical to that described by Keller's laboratory (24Preker P.J. Lingner J. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the polyadenylation of SV40 late pre-mRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extract, the plasmid DNA containing SV40 late pre-mRNA (kindly provided by Dr. Susan Berget) was linearized withHpaI, and capped precleaved RNA was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase including [α-32P]UTP as a labeled nucleotide. The in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was performed according to standard protocol (New England Biolabs). All RNA products were purified by fractionation on a 10% polyacrylamide/7M urea gel, extracted from the gel, and purified by precipitation with ethanol. The concentration of the RNAs, whenever necessary, was determined by optical density measurements at 260 nm. The wild-type yeast cells were grown with shaking in YEPD medium at 30 °C to an A 600 of between 2 and 6. The temperature-sensitive mutants for poly(A) polymerasepap1–2, pap1–5, and pap1–7 (kindly provided by Dr. Walter Keller; see Ref. 25Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were grown in YEPD medium to a concentration of 1–3 × 106 cells/ml at 23 °C, and then the cultures were divided into two halves, and one half was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 6 h. The other half of the cultures was left to grow at 23 °C for 6 h. The yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min and then used either for preparation of whole cell extracts or isolation of total RNA according to published procedures (26Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Chen J. Moore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The polyadenylation reaction was done according to Minvielle-Sebastiaet al. (25Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 25-μl reaction volume contained 40% (v/v) extract, 1.6 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.016 mm EDTA, 4 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.6% glycerol, 2% polyethylene glycol, 75 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, creatine kinase (0.2 mg/ml), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and precleaved CYC1 RNA (∼50,000 cpm). The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 23 °C for extracts from mutant cells and at 30 °C for extracts from wild-type cells grown at 30 °C or mutant cells grown at 37 °C. RNA was extracted with a phenol/chloroform mixture, precipitated with ethanol, and run on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film. Extracts were prepared from HeLa cells grown in suspension culture by the procedure of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration of the extract was 5 mg/ml. The nuclear extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate as described by Englard and Seifter (29Englard S. Seifter S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For in vitro labeling of RNAs, 5 μl of 10× in vitro labeling buffer (6 mmconcentration each of GTP, UTP, and CTP, 250 μm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm KCl, 60 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 40 μl of nuclear extract or equal amounts of protein from ammonium sulfate fractions, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP were mixed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. The amount of in vitro synthesizedAlu RNA or mutant Alu RNA used as substrate for adenylation assay was ∼1 μg (20 pmol). Labeled RNAs were extracted using the phenol/chloroform procedure, purified, and fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. A standard polyadenylation reaction for precleaved SV40 late pre-mRNA was followed according to Sheets et al. (30Sheets M.D. Stephenson P. Wickens M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1518-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 25-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 0.5% PEG, 0.15 mm dithiothreitol, 40% (v/v) HeLa cell nuclear extract, and labeled substrate RNA (∼50,000 cpm). The reaction mixture was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Inhibition of poly(A) polymerase activity in HeLa cell nuclear extract by bovine serum albumin-conjugated U1 peptide was carried out according to Gunderson et al. (31Gunderson S.I. Vagner S. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Extraction, purification, and analysis of RNA was carried out as described above. An oligonucleotide, Oligo 1 (5′-pgatctgatagtgtcacctaaatgaattca*-3′), with 3′ cordycepin (a*) was ligated to RNAs purified from the yeast cells. A yeast SRP RNA-specific oligonucleotide (SRP RNA-(354–373), 5′-pgcgtcagaaggtgacccgtg-3′) and an oligonucleotide (Oligo 2) complementary to Oligo 1 were used for RT-PCR amplification. If the 3′-end nucleotide of the RNA is an adenylic acid, a BglII restriction site would be created in the RT-PCR product. Internally labeled RT-PCR products were subjected to BglII digestion and fractionated on a nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel; the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis. Further quantification was done using the Molecular Dynamics system with the ImageQuant software. In our attempts to characterize and purify the SRP adenylating activity, the HeLa cell nuclear extracts were subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Four fractions comprising the 0–30%, 31–50%, and 51–70% ammonium sulfate precipitates and the 70% ammonium sulfate supernatant were obtained. These fractions were dialyzed, and equal amounts of protein from each fraction were used to assay SRP RNA adenylating activity. Since there is endogenous SRP RNA in the nuclear extract that may get adenylated (see Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 4), we used Alu RNA as the substrate. Alu RNA corresponds to the 5′- and 3′-end sequences of SRP RNA and is faithfully adenylated in vitro(2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, lane 1, shows the pattern of adenylation obtained using HeLa cell nuclear extracts, which were used as the starting material for fractionation. In addition to the adenylation of Alu RNA, tRNAs and SRP RNA also get adenylated (Fig. 1, lane 1). While 0–30% fraction, 31–50% fraction, and 70% supernatant contained some activity that adenylates Alu RNA (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 3, and 5, respectively), most of the SRP RNA adenylating activity was in the 51–70% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fig. 1, lane 4). The 51–70% fraction contained 25% of the total protein and 80% of the SRP adenylating activity. It is known from the published literature that human mRNA poly(A) polymerase fractionates in the 0–40% ammonium sulfate fraction (32Takagaki Y. Ryner L.C. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data suggested that SRP/Alu RNA adenylating activity may be distinct from mRNA poly(A) polymerase, since these two activities were fractionating in two different ammonium sulfate fractions. To obtain more definitive evidence that SRP adenylating activity is different from mRNA poly(A) polymerase, we studied the effect of U1A peptide on the mRNA polyadenylation and SRP RNA adenylation. Mattaj and colleagues (31Gunderson S.I. Vagner S. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed that a portion of the U1 snRNP protein, the U1A peptide corresponding to 103–119 amino acids conjugated to albumin, interacts with the catalytic site of human poly(A) polymerase, resulting in complete inhibition of mRNA poly(A) polymerase activity. We reasoned that if poly(A) polymerase is involved in SRP RNA adenylation, then U1A peptide-albumin conjugate should also inhibit adenylation of SRP RNA. Therefore, we tested this possibility using ourin vitro system for the 3′-end adenylation of SRP/Alu RNA. Fig.2 A shows the effect of U1A peptide-albumin conjugate on the adenylation of SV40 late mRNA. When compared with the starting material (Fig. 2 A), there was significant poly(A) formation on the 3′-end of the SV40 mRNA when incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extract (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). U1A peptide conjugated to albumin completely inhibited the polyadenylation of this mRNA (Fig.2 A, lanes 3–5). Albumin alone, U1A peptide alone, or an unrelated peptide conjugated to albumin did not inhibit the polyadenylation of this SV40 mRNA (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6, 7, and 8, respectively). These data are as expected and are completely consistent with the data published by Mattaj and associates (31Gunderson S.I. Vagner S. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Adenylation of human SRP RNA and Alu RNA was studied under the same conditions. The adenylation of SRP RNA and Alu RNA in the presence of U1A peptide-conjugate (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4) was the same in the control (Fig. 2 B,lane 1) or when incubated in the presence of albumin alone, U1A peptide alone, or an unrelated peptide conjugated to albumin (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5,6, and 7, respectively). These data show that under conditions where mRNA poly(A) polymerase is completely inhibited, the 3′ adenylation of SRP and Alu RNA is unaffected. These data are consistent with the suggestion that the addition of adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end of human SRP RNA is carried out by an enzyme distinct from mRNA poly(A) polymerase. While over 60% of the human SRP RNA molecules contain nontemplate encoded adenylic acid residue on their 3′-ends (1Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), approximately 2–3% of the S. cerevisiae SRP RNA molecules contain this post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid. 2K. Perumal, J. Gu, and R. Reddy, unpublished data. Keller's laboratory (25Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) has characterized the S. cerevisiae poly(A) polymerase mutants, and we wanted to see whether adenylation of SRP RNA in these temperature-sensitive mutants is affected when the poly(A) polymerase is inactivated by a shift from permissive to nonpermissive temperature. Fig. 3 shows the data obtained with the yeast mutants. The yeast cell extracts prepared from wild-type cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and all three yeastpap mutant cell lines grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2,4, and 6, respectively) were capable of adenylating a yeast CYC1 RNA. However, all three yeast mutants when grown at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C were totally inactive for poly(A) polymerase, and no polyadenylated mRNA was detectable in an in vitro assay for polymerase activity (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3, 5, and7, respectively). These data are consistent with published reports by Keller and colleagues (25Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from these mutant yeast cells grown either at permissive or restrictive temperature, and the presence of the adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end of yeast SRP RNA was tested by a newly developed oligonucleotide ligation/RT-PCR/BglII digestion method (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this method, DNA derived from RT-PCR of RNAs containing a 3′ adenylic acid residue would be cleaved by BglII restriction enzyme and yield two smaller fragments. In the case of wild type S. cerevisiae cells, 2–3% of the SRP RNA was digested by the BglII restriction enzyme (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). In the case of yeast mutantpap1–5 grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C (lane 6), or grown at nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C (lane 8), 2–3% of the DNA was cleaved by BglII restriction enzyme. Identical results were obtained with two other pap mutants, namely pap1–2 and pap1–7 (Fig. 3 C). These data show that under conditions of restrictive temperature, where yeast mRNA poly(A) polymerase is inactivated, the SRP RNA is adenylated to the same extent as in the wild-type cells or cells grown at permissive temperature (Table I). Thus, these results obtained with the yeast system are consistent with the results obtained with HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2) and support the conclusion that an enzyme distinct from the mRNA ploy(A) polymerase is involved in the 3′ adenylation of SRP RNA.Table IQuantitation of 3′-end-adenylated SRP RNA from S. cerevisiae pap mutantsSource of RNAPercentage of adenylated SRP RNA%Wild-type strain2.5Mutant Strains pap1-2grown at 23 °C2.8 pap1-2grown at 37 °C2.2 pap1-5grown at 23 °C1.7 pap1-5grown at 37 °C1.9 pap1-7grown at 23 °C3.3 pap1-7grown at 37 °C3.5RNA isolated from wild-type and different temperature-sensitivepapmutants was subjected to a RT-PCR/BglII digestion assay as described under “Materials amd Methods.” All values are expressed as the percentage of digested products over the total RT-PCR products. These percentages are an average of two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab RNA isolated from wild-type and different temperature-sensitivepapmutants was subjected to a RT-PCR/BglII digestion assay as described under “Materials amd Methods.” All values are expressed as the percentage of digested products over the total RT-PCR products. These percentages are an average of two independent experiments. It is known that purified poly(A) polymerase and terminal transferases add nucleotides to any RNA containing 3′-OH groups. We wanted to see the specificity of this 3′ adenylation on the SRP/Alu RNA. The substitution of SRP/Alu RNA24GUA26 → AGG in the mutant AluRNA is shown in Fig. 4 A. It is known that substitution of these three nucleotides in the loop near the 5′-end of SRP/Alu RNA abolishes the binding of SRP 9/14-kDa proteins (23Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33He X. Bataille N. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 903-912PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-end sequences of the Alu RNA and mutant Alu RNA are identical, and if the adenylation occurs by poly(A) polymerase or by a nonspecific terminal transferase, one would expect both of these RNAs to be adenylated. Fig. 4 Bshows the results obtained with this mutant Alu RNA. In the case of nuclear extract used as a control, the SRP RNA can be visualized as the adenylated RNA (Fig. 4 B, Lane 1). WhileAlu RNA was adenylated in lane 2, there was no detectable adenylation when the reaction mixture was supplemented with mutant Alu RNA (lane 3). These data show that RNA alone is not a suitable substrate for 3′ adenylation, and binding of 9/14-kDa protein to form a ribonucleoprotein complex is necessary before 3′ adenylation of SRP/Alu RNA can take place. These data are consistent with our earlier results, which showed that adenylated Alu and SRP RNAs were immunoprecipitable with anti-9/14-kDa protein antibodies (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and provide evidence for the specificity of adenylation reaction and provide additional line of evidence for the involvement of a novel adenylation enzyme distinct from mRNA poly(A) polymerase or a nonspecific terminal transferase. This study was initiated to see whether poly(A) polymerase is involved in the adenylation of a nontemplate-encoded adenylic acid residue found in several stable small RNAs. This possibility was very likely, since poly(A) polymerase is known to be involved in the addition of short oligo(A) stretches found on the 3′-end of stable RNAs in S. cerevisiae and E. coli strains deficient in 3′-exonuclease. We used adenylation of SRP/Alu RNA to test this possibility, since an accurate in vitro adenylation system for SRP/Alu RNA is available (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Data obtained in this study provide convincing evidence that poly(A) polymerase or a nonspecific terminal transferase is not involved in the adenylation of SRP RNA. The following four lines of evidence are presented to show that an enzyme distinct from mRNA poly(A) polymerase is involved in the SRP adenylation: 1) the SRP adenylating activity and poly(A) polymerase fractionate in different ammonium sulfate fractions; 2) under conditions where poly(A) polymerase in HeLa cell nuclear extract was completely inhibited by U1A peptide conjugated to albumin, there was no effect on the adenylation of SRP RNA; 3) under conditions where yeast poly(A) polymerase was inactive in three different temperature-sensitive strains, there was no effect on the adenylation of SRP RNA; and 4) the adenylation of SRP RNA was dependent on an intact SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer binding site. As detailed in the Introduction, our previous results showed that CCA-adding enzyme is not involved in the adenylation of SRP RNA. These lines of evidence provide definitive evidence that an enzyme distinct from the mRNA poly(A) polymerase is involved in the adenylation of SRP RNA. S. cerevisiae genome is known to contain a single copy of the poly(A) polymerase (12Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the yeast pap mutant strains that we used in this study, it is clear that poly(A) polymerase was inactive when maintained at restrictive temperatures (Fig.3 A). The SRP RNA belongs to the class of stable RNAs with low turnover (34Zieve G.W. Sauterer R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, one has to consider whether the adenylation found in SRP RNA from cells grown at restrictive temperatures could be due to RNA synthesized under permissive conditions and remain intact due to low RNA turnover. This is unlikely because the cells were maintained at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 6 h, which is more than two generation times, and the 3′ adenylic acid residue in SRP RNA is known to turn over independent of the SRP RNA turnover (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, there was no reduction in the extent of adenylation between control and mutant cells (Fig. 3,B and C). Therefore, these data are supportive of the conclusion that yeast poly(A) polymerase is not involved in the adenylation of SRP RNA. The poly(A) polymerases, CCA-adding enzymes, and polynucleotide phosphorylases belong to a superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases (35Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar), and all members of this superfamily possess a conserved sequence motif corresponding to the active site (36Holm L. Sanders C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Since SRP-adenylating enzyme catalyzes the transfer of nucleotide to the 3′-end of SRP RNA, its properties are consistent with being a member of the superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases. This study shows that this SRP-adenylating enzyme is different from CCA-adding enzyme and poly(A) polymerase. The SRP-adenylating enzyme is not sensitive to micrococcal nuclease treatment, indicating that it is a protein enzyme and not a ribonucleoprotein (2Chen Y. Sinha K.M. Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35023-35031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Does each RNA have an adenylating enzyme of its own? In addition to SRP RNA, other small RNAs, including 7SK, U2, and 5 S RNAs contain a nontemplated adenylic acid on their 3′-ends. Since our data show that SRP/Alu RNA specific 9/14-kDa proteins are required for SRP RNA adenylation, it is logical to ask which enzyme(s) are involved in the adenylation of these RNAs. The SRP 9/14-kDa protein associates with the SRP and Alu RNAs and is an integral part of SRPs (23Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); however, this protein heterodimer is not part of ribosomal 5 S, U2, or 7SK RNPs. One possibility is that these RNAs have a common adenylating enzyme that recognizes diverse RNPs that may have some common structural motif(s). Development of in vitro systems capable of accurately adenylating other small RNAs and purification of the enzyme responsible for adenylating SRP RNA is necessary to answer these questions. We thank Dr. Walter Keller for providing theS. cerevisiae pap mutants and the CYC1 plasmid, Dr. Susan Berget for providing SV40 late mRNA plasmid and advice in carrying out polyadenylation assays, Minyone Finley for HeLa cells, and Rachana Dalia for superb technical assistance."
