https://openalex.org/W2164829352,"Voltage-dependent potassium ion (K + ) channels (Kv channels) conduct K + ions across the cell membrane in response to changes in the membrane voltage, thereby regulating neuronal excitability by modulating the shape and frequency of action potentials. Here we report the crystal structure, at a resolution of 2.9 angstroms, of a mammalian Kv channel, Kv1.2, which is a member of the Shaker K + channel family. This structure is in complex with an oxido-reductase β subunit of the kind that can regulate mammalian Kv channels in their native cell environment. The activation gate of the pore is open. Large side portals communicate between the pore and the cytoplasm. Electrostatic properties of the side portals and positions of the T1 domain and β subunit are consistent with electrophysiological studies of inactivation gating and with the possibility of K + channel regulation by the β subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2164194853,"A wide variety of experimental results and theoretical investigations in recent years have convincingly demonstrated that several transition metal oxides and other materials have dominant states that are not spatially homogeneous. This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions-spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital-are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2122171697,"Structural materials in nature exhibit remarkable designs with building blocks, often hierarchically arranged from the nanometer to the macroscopic length scales. We report on the structural properties of biosilica observed in the hexactinellid sponge Euplectella sp. Consolidated, nanometer-scaled silica spheres are arranged in well-defined microscopic concentric rings glued together by organic matrix to form laminated spicules. The assembly of these spicules into bundles, effected by the laminated silica-based cement, results in the formation of a macroscopic cylindrical square-lattice cagelike structure reinforced by diagonal ridges. The ensuing design overcomes the brittleness of its constituent material, glass, and shows outstanding mechanical rigidity and stability. The mechanical benefits of each of seven identified hierarchical levels and their comparison with common mechanical engineering strategies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983519301,"Voltage-dependent ion channels contain voltage sensors that allow them to switch between nonconductive and conductive states over the narrow range of a few hundredths of a volt. We investigated the mechanism by which these channels sense cell membrane voltage by determining the x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian Shaker family potassium ion (K + ) channel. The voltage-dependent K + channel Kv1.2 grew three-dimensional crystals, with an internal arrangement that left the voltage sensors in an apparently native conformation, allowing us to reach three important conclusions. First, the voltage sensors are essentially independent domains inside the membrane. Second, they perform mechanical work on the pore through the S4-S5 linker helices, which are positioned to constrict or dilate the S6 inner helices of the pore. Third, in the open conformation, two of the four conserved Arg residues on S4 are on a lipid-facing surface and two are buried in the voltage sensor. The structure offers a simple picture of how membrane voltage influences the open probability of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1967008937,"The temporal control of CONSTANS (CO) expression and activity is a key mechanism in photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) protein regulates CO transcription, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. We demonstrate here that FKF1 controls the stability of a Dof transcription factor, CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1). FKF1 physically interacts with CDF1, and CDF1 protein is more stable in fkf1 mutants. Plants with elevated levels of CDF1 flower late and have reduced expression of CO. CDF1 and CO are expressed in the same tissues, and CDF1 binds to the CO promoter. Thus, FKF1 controls daily CO expression in part by degrading CDF1, a repressor of CO transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2134614924,Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have great potential as therapeutic agents. We report a method for inducing skeletal muscle lineage cells from human and rat general adherent MSCs with an efficiency of 89%. Induced cells differentiated into muscle fibers upon transplantation into degenerated muscles of rats and mdx-nude mice. The induced population contained Pax7-positive cells that contributed to subsequent regeneration of muscle upon repetitive damage without additional transplantation of cells. These MSCs represent a more ready supply of myogenic cells than do the rare myogenic stem cells normally found in muscle and bone marrow.
https://openalex.org/W2131119017,"Many patterns in biological systems depend on the exchange of chemical signals between cells. We report a spatiotemporal pattern mediated by hydrodynamic interactions. At planar surfaces, spermatozoa self-organized into dynamic vortices resembling quantized rotating waves. These vortices formed an array with local hexagonal order. Introducing an order parameter that quantifies cooperativity, we found that the array appeared only above a critical sperm density. Using a model, we estimated the hydrodynamic interaction force between spermatozoa to be ∼0.03 piconewtons. Thus, large-scale coordination of cells can be regulated hydrodynamically, and chemical signals are not required."
https://openalex.org/W1979450477,"Coordinated spacing and patterning of stomata allow efficient gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Here we report that three ERECTA (ER)–family leucine-rich repeat–receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) together control stomatal patterning, with specific family members regulating the specification of stomatal stem cell fate and the differentiation of guard cells. Loss-of-function mutations in all three ER -family genes cause stomatal clustering. Genetic interactions with a known stomatal patterning mutant too many mouths ( tmm ) revealed stoichiometric epistasis and combination-specific neomorphism. Our findings suggest that the negative regulation of ER-family RLKs by TMM, which is an LRR receptor–like protein, is critical for proper stomatal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2133402024,"Nanoscale superconductor/semiconductor hybrid devices are assembled from indium arsenide semiconductor nanowires individually contacted by aluminum-based superconductor electrodes. Below 1 kelvin, the high transparency of the contacts gives rise to proximity-induced superconductivity. The nanowires form superconducting weak links operating as mesoscopic Josephson junctions with electrically tunable coupling. The supercurrent can be switched on/off by a gate voltage acting on the electron density in the nanowire. A variation in gate voltage induces universal fluctuations in the normal-state conductance, which are clearly correlated to critical current fluctuations. The alternating-current Josephson effect gives rise to Shapiro steps in the voltage-current characteristic under microwave irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2127781424,"Most of Australia's largest mammals became extinct 50,000 to 45,000 years ago, shortly after humans colonized the continent. Without exceptional climate change at that time, a human cause is inferred, but a mechanism remains elusive. A 140,000-year record of dietary δ 13 C documents a permanent reduction in food sources available to the Australian emu, beginning about the time of human colonization; a change replicated at three widely separated sites and in the marsupial wombat. We speculate that human firing of landscapes rapidly converted a drought-adapted mosaic of trees, shrubs, and nutritious grasslands to the modern fire-adapted desert scrub. Animals that could adapt survived; those that could not, became extinct."

https://openalex.org/W2051091550,"Macromolecular structures calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance data are not fully determined by experimental data but depend on subjective choices in data treatment and parameter settings. This makes it difficult to objectively judge the precision of the structures. We used Bayesian inference to derive a probability distribution that represents the unknown structure and its precision. This probability distribution also determines additional unknowns, such as theory parameters, that previously had to be chosen empirically. We implemented this approach by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our method provides an objective figure of merit and improves structural quality."

https://openalex.org/W2130478293,"X-ray binaries are composed of a normal star in orbit around a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole. Radio and x-ray observations have led to the presumption that some x-ray binaries called microquasars behave as scaled-down active galactic nuclei. Microquasars have resolved radio emission that is thought to arise from a relativistic outflow akin to active galactic nuclei jets, in which particles can be accelerated to large energies. Very high energy γ-rays produced by the interactions of these particles have been observed from several active galactic nuclei. Using the High Energy Stereoscopic System, we find evidence for gamma-ray emission of &gt;100 gigaelectron volts from a candidate microquasar, LS 5039, showing that particles are also accelerated to very high energies in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W2032572765,"An organic material composed of neutral free radicals based on the spirobiphenalenyl system exhibits a room temperature conductivity of 0.3 siemens per centimeter and a high-symmetry crystal structure. It displays the temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism characteristic of a metal with a magnetic susceptibility that implies a density of states at the Fermi level of 15.5 states per electron volt per mole. Extended Hückel calculations indicate that the solid is a three-dimensional organic metal with a band width of ∼0.5 electron volts. However, the compound shows activated conductivity (activation energy, 0.054 electron volts) and an optical energy gap of 0.34 electron volts. We argue that these apparently contradictory properties are best resolved in terms of the resonating valence-bond ground state originally suggested by Pauling, but with the modifications introduced by Anderson."
https://openalex.org/W2005470247,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential for many angiogenic processes both in normal conditions and in pathological conditions. However, the signaling pathways involved in VEGF-induced angiogenesis are not well defined. Protein kinase D (PKD), a newly described serine/threonine protein kinase, has been implicated in many signal transduction pathways and in cell proliferation. We hypothesized that PKD would mediate VEGF signaling and function in endothelial cells. Here we found that VEGF rapidly and strongly stimulated PKD phosphorylation and activation in endothelial cells via VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The pharmacological inhibitors for phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and protein kinase C (PKC) significantly inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation, suggesting the involvement of the PLCγ/PKC pathway. In particular, PKCα was critical for VEGF-induced PKD activation since both overexpression of adenovirus PKCα dominant negative mutant and reduction of PKCα expression by small interfering RNA markedly inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation. Importantly, we found that small interfering RNA knockdown of PKD and PKCα expression significantly attenuated ERK activation and DNA synthesis in endothelial cells by VEGF. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that VEGF activates PKD via the VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKCα pathway and revealed a critical role of PKD in VEGF-induced ERK signaling and endothelial cell proliferation.

VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt1) and VEGFR2 (mouse Flk1 or human KDR), are restricted in their tissue distribution primarily to endothelial cells (8Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S.

The binding of VEGF to its cognate receptors induces dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of the receptors leading to the activation of several intracellular signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), protein kinase C (PKC), nitric oxide synthase, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and focal adhesion kinases (9Takahashi T.

The importance of VEGF-induced signaling is demonstrated in that the genetic inactivation of either receptor leads to a complete lack of development of blood vessels in the embryo, and inactivation of VEGFR2 function dramatically impairs the growth of cancer cells in vivo (4Fong G.H.

The most distinct characteristics of PKD are the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology domain within the regulatory region, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (17Lint J.V.

However, the regulation of PKD activation and its function in endothelial cells are very poorly studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether and how VEGF activates PKD in endothelial cells and to examine the potential role of PKD in VEGF-mediated signal transduction. The results presented here demonstrated that VEGF rapidly induces activation of PKD via the VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKC pathway and that PKD is involved in VEGF-induced ERK signaling in endothelial cells.

For the inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min in serum-depleted medium. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) and Its Transfection—To determine the contribution of VEGFR2, PKCα, and PKD in VEGF-stimulated signaling, we treated HUVEC with human VEGFR2, PKCα, or PKD siRNA duplex obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). The scrambled siRNA control is a non-targeting siRNA pool from Dharmacon, Inc. For transfection of siRNA, HUVEC were seeded into 60-mm dishes for 24 h about 80% confluence, and then transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (30Jin Z.G.

The protein samples from total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. After incubating with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology, Nebraska). Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed with Odyssey software (LI-COR Biotechnology). Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of control sample to 1.0. DNA Synthesis—VEGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in endothelial cells was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (34Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G. Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A. Lambeth J.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the results was assessed by a paired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. VEGF Stimulates PKD Activation in Endothelial Cells—To examine whether VEGF induces PKD activation in endothelial cells, we studied PKD phosphorylation in BAEC in response to VEGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of PKD was determined by using two commercially available phospho-PKD-specific antibodies. One of them recognizes the endogenous levels of PKD only when dually phosphorylated at Ser-744 and Ser-748, and the other recognizes PKD only when phosphorylated at Ser-916. By using these antibodies, we observed for the first time that VEGF (25 ng/ml) rapidly induced PKD phosphorylation within 2 min, and the activation reached a maximum between 15 and 45 min and returned to basal line after 90 min (Fig. 1, A and B). PKD expression levels were detected by Western blots using anti-PKD antibody. During the course of VEGF stimulation, the levels of PKD expression in cells did not change (Fig. 1A). We also observed that VEGF induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). VEGF induced PKD activation at a concentration as low as 1 ng/ml and achieved maximal activation at 30-100 ng/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition to BAEC, VEGF stimulated phosphorylation of PKD in HUVEC (see below Fig. 3B) and bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2VEGF dose-dependently stimulates PKD activation. A, BAEC were exposed to VEGF for 15 min with the different concentrations as indicated. PKD activation in cell lysates was determined by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific PKD antibodies as described in the legend for Fig. 1. PKD expression levels were determined by Western blot using a PKD antibody.

VEGFR2 expression levels in cell lysates were also analyzed by Western blots with anti-VEGFR2 antibody to confirm the knockdown effect of VEGFR2 siRNA. β-actin was detected by reprobing the same blots with anti-β-actin antibodies to show the specificity of VEGFR2 siRNA. Representative immunoblots from three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) VEGFR2 Mediates VEGF-induced PKD Activation—VEGF functions are mediated, for the most part, by VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and VEGFR2, but not VEGFR1, is responsible for VEGF-stimulated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (10Karkkainen M.J. Petrova T.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 11Zachary I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Claesson-Welsh L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which subtype of VEGF receptors mediates VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells, we examined the effect of specific neutralization antibodies against VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 on PKD activation. These neutralizing antibodies blocked the receptor-ligand interaction. HUVEC were pretreated for 30 min with either neutralizing antibody (2 μg/ml) against human VEGFR1 or neutralizing antibody (2 μg/ml) against human VEGFR2 and then stimulated with VEGF (25 ng/ml) for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 3A, the neutralizing antibody against human VEGFR2 completely blocked PKD phosphorylation induced by VEGF, whereas the VEGFR1-specific neutralizing antibody had no effect on VEGF activation of PKD in HUVEC. These results suggested that VEGFR2 mediates VEGF-induced PKD activation. To further determine the specific role of VEGFR2, we knocked down endogenous VEGFR2 expression in HUVEC with VEGFR2-specific siRNA. Transfection of HUVEC with human VEGFR2 siRNA, but not control siRNA, significantly reduced endogenous VEGFR2 expression (Fig. 3B, panel 4). VEGFR2 siRNA is specific for targeting VEGFR2 since expression of β-actin and PKD in cells was not changed (Fig. 3B, panels 3 and 5). Knockdown VEGFR2 expression in HUVEC blocked VEGF-induced PKD activation (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 2). These data revealed that VEGF-induced PKD activation is specifically mediated by VEGFR2, but not by VEGFR1, in endothelial cells. VEGFR2 Kinase Activity Is Essential for VEGF-induced PKD Activation—To determine the role of VEGFR2 kinase activation by VEGF in PKD activation, we first studied the effects of VTI and SU1498, two structurally different VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. Pretreatment with VTI (10 μm) for 30 min almost completely abolished VEGF-mediated PKD activation (Fig. 4A). SU1498 (10 μm) also significantly inhibited activation of PKD by VEGF (Fig. 4B). To substantially determine the specific involvement of VEGFR2 kinase activity, we infected BAEC with adenovirus of VEGFR2 kinase-inactive mutant (VEGFR2-K868M) that has a dominant negative effect on VEGFR2 activation by VEGF (9Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VEGFR2-K868M blocked VEGF-induced PKD phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrated that VEGFR2 activation is required for VEGF-induced activation of PKD in endothelial cells. VEGF Stimulates PKD Activation through PLCγ-dependent Pathways—To determine whether PLCγ is involved in VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells, we examined the effect of a PLCγ-specific inhibitor, U73122, on PKD activation stimulated by VEGF. BAEC were first treated with U73122 (3 μm) for 30 min before exposure to VEGF. As shown in Fig. 5A, U73122 completely blocked PKD phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). In addition, we also examined whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin affect the activation of PKD. LY294002 and wortmannin did not inhibit VEGF-induced PKD activation (Fig. 5B). These data suggested that PLCγ, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, are required for VEGF-stimulated PKD activation in endothelial cells. PKCs Are Involved in VEGF-induced PKD Activation—PLCγ activation by VEGF triggers PKC activation (35Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that PKD activation in intact cells is mediated through PKCs (18Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC activation is involved in VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells, we examined the effect of PKC inhibitors on PKD activation by VEGF. BAEC were treated with PKC inhibitors GF109203X or Ro-31-8220 for 30 min before exposure to VEGF. GF109203X at a concentration as low as 0.1 μm almost completely blocked PKD activation (Fig. 6A). VEGF-induced PKD activation was also blocked by Ro-31-8220 in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 6B). These data suggested that PKCs are involved in the VEGF-stimulated PKD activation in endothelial cells. PKCα Plays an Important Role in Mediating PKD Activation by VEGF in Endothelial Cells—To assess the role of PKC isoforms in VEGF-induced PKD activation, endothelial cells were exposed to phorbol-12-myrisstate-13-acetate (PMA, 500 nm) for 24 h to deplete the classical and novel PKC isoforms, leaving only atypical isoforms active. Depletion of PKC by PMA, including PKCα and PKCδ, but not PKCζ (Fig. 7A), inhibited PKD activation induced by VEGF or PMA (500 nm, 10 min) (Fig. 7A). We next tested the effects of inhibitors of PKC isoforms with the aim of resolving which PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms are involved in PKD activation. We found that pretreatment of BAEC with Go6976 (a potent inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms) inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation (Fig. 7C), whereas LY379196 (a selective PKCβ inhibitor) and Rottlerin (a PKCδ inhibitor) had no effect (Fig. 7, B and D). Inconsistently with several reports (36Rosales O.R. Isales C. Nathanson M. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we did not detect PKCγ, a classical PKC isoform, in BAEC and HUVEC. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that PKCα was the principal PKC isoform necessary for VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells. To determine the involvement of PKCα in the VEGF signaling to PKD activation in endothelial cells, we examined the effect of the dominant negative form of PKC (PKC-DN) on VEGF-induced PKD activation using adenovirus expression system. The dominant negative nature of the ATP-binding site mutant PKC has been previously characterized (32Carpenter L. Cordery D. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5368-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Infection of BAEC with adenovirus constructs containing cDNAs for PKCα-DN and PKCδ-DN resulted in robust expression of these PKC isoforms (Fig. 8, A and B). At an m.o.i. of 100, PKCα-DN almost completely blocked VEGF-induced PKD activation as determined by measuring PKD phosphorylation at Ser-744/Ser-748 and Ser-916, whereas PKCδ-DN at the same m.o.i. had no significant effect on VEGF-induced PKD activation when compared with the effect of LacZ controls (Fig. 8A). We also found that the PKCα-DN inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, infection of BAEC with recombinant adenovirus construct expressing the wild-type PKCα (PKCα-WT, 100 m.o.i.) enhanced PKD activation by VEGF when compared with the effect of LacZ controls (Fig. 8C). These data indicated that PKCα mediates VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells. Knockdown of PKD by siRNA Inhibited VEGF-induced Activation of ERK in Endothelial Cells—VEGF-dependent activation of the PLCγ/PKC pathway contributes to ERK1/2 activation via Raf-MEK1 (MAPK kinase 1) and DNA synthesis in vascular endothelial cells (9Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 14Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To gain insight into the functional significance of PKD activation in VEGF-mediated signaling events, we determined whether knockdown of endogenous PKD in endothelial cells using siRNA affects VEGF-mediated ERK1/2 activation. HUVEC were transfected with human PKD siRNA for 48 h and then stimulated with VEGF for the time indicated. Treatment of HUVEC with PKD siRNA significantly reduced endogenous PKD expression, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 9, A and C). PKD siRNA is specific for targeting PKD since expression of β-actin and ERK1/2 was not changed (Fig. 9). Decreasing PKD expression by its siRNA significantly inhibited VEGF-induced ERK1/2 in HUVEC (Fig. 9, A and B). Statistical data showed that 50% reduction of PKD activation due to its siRNA treatment is correlated to about 50% decrease of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, the experiments for the time course of VEGF treatment also showed that PKD siRNA inhibited the magnitude and duration of ERK activation by VEGF in endothelial cells (Fig. 9C). Knockdown of PKCα by siRNA Inhibited VEGF-induced Activation of PKD and ERK in Endothelial Cells—To further confirm the critical role of PKCα in VEGF-induced PKD activation as well as its downstream signaling, we determined whether siRNA knockdown of endogenous PKCα in endothelial cells affects VEGF-mediated activation of PKD and ERK1/2. HUVEC were transfected with human PKCα siRNA or PKCδ siRNA for 48 h and then stimulated with VEGF for 15 min. Treatment of HUVEC with PKCα siRNA and PKCδ significantly reduced endogenous PKCα and PKCδ expression, respectively, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 10). Decreasing PKCα expression by siRNA significantly inhibited VEGF-induced activation of PKD and ERK1/2 in HUVEC (Fig. 10, A and B). In contrast, decreasing PKCδ expression by siRNA had no significant effect on both PKD activation and ERK1/2 activation by VEGF in HUVEC (Fig. 10). PKCα/PKD Pathway Is Involved in VEGF-induced DNA Synthesis in Endothelial Cells—VEGF-dependent activation of the ERK pathway contributes to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in vascular endothelial cells (9Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 14Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether PKD plays an important role in VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, we examined the effect of PKD and PKCα siRNA on VEGF-induced DNA synthesis in HUVEC using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (34Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G. Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A. Lambeth J.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 11, both PKD and PKCα siRNA significantly inhibited DNA synthesis in endothelial cells by VEGF (Fig. 11). The major findings of the present study were that VEGF stimulates activation of PKD via the VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKCα pathway and that PKD is involved in VEGF-induced ERK signaling and endothelial cell proliferation. We found that PKD is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser-744/Ser-748 and Ser-916 in endothelial cells in response to VEGF. Both VEGFR2-specific neutralization antibodies and VEGFR2 siRNA treatment abolished VEGF-stimulated PKD activation. VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors and overexpression of adenovirus VEGFR2 kinase-inactive mutant blocked VEGF-induced PKD activation. Furthermore, inhibition of the activation of PLCγ and PKC by their pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced PKD activation by VEGF. In particular, PKCα was critical for mediating PKD activation by VEGF since both overexpression of PKCα-DN and reduction of PKCα expression by siRNA markedly inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation. Finally, knockdown of PKD by siRNA attenuated VEGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. This is the first report to show the rapid activation of PKD in endothelial cells by VEGF and reveal a critical role of PKD in the VEGF-mediated ERK1/2 pathway and endothelial cell proliferation. PKD not only is a direct diacylglycerol target but also lies downstream of PKCs in a novel signal transduction pathway implicated in the regulation of multiple fundamental biological processes (18Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition to the biologically active phorbol esters, a variety of regulatory peptides, including G-protein-coupled receptor ligands (e.g. bombesin, vasopressin, and thrombin) or growth factors (e.g. epithelial growth factor), induced PKD activation in fibroblast and vascular smooth muscle cells (17Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, so far, few studies have reported on the regulation of PKD in endothelial cells. In this study, we showed that PKD is well expressed in all types of endothelial cells we tested, including BAEC and HUVEC. Stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF leads to a rapid and transient activation of PKD, occurring within minutes of VEGF stimulation of cells. We also observed that VEGF induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggested that PKD activation is one of the early signaling events in endothelial cells in response to VEGF stimulation. On endothelial cells, VEGF binds to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGFR1 is poorly autophosphorylated in response to VEGF in endothelial cells (41Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, ligand-induced homodimerization of VEGFR2 leads to a strong autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 on tyrosine residues, which triggers activation of major signaling pathways that include PLCγ and PKCs (9Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 13Lawson N.D. Mugford J.W. Diamond B.A. Weinstein B.M.

In the present study, we examined which subtype of VEGF receptors mediates VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells using multiple strategies. We observed that neutralizing antibodies of VEGFR2, but not VEGFR1, blocked VEGF-induced PKD activation. Down-regulation of VEGFR2 by its siRNA inhibited PKD activation. Moreover, selective VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors VTI and SU1498 as well as VEGFR2 dominant negative mutant (kinase-dead form) abolished VEGF-induced PKD activation. These data indicated that VEGF-induced PKD activation is specifically mediated by VEGFR2, but not VEGFR1, in endothelial cells. PKD can be activated via PKC-dependent and -independent pathways (18Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18476-18481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the PLCγ/PKC pathway is involved in VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells. PLCγ-specific inhibitor U73122 completely blocked PKD activation by VEGF, and the PKC inhibitors GF 109203X and Ro 31-8220 also markedly inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Six PKC isoforms (α,β1,β2, δ, ϵ, and ζ) are expressed in BAEC and HUVEC. Among them, PKCα and PKCβ2 are strongly activated by VEGF in endothelial cells (38Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In addition, we also found that VEGF stimulated PKCδ activation in BAEC and HUVEC (data not shown). Many PKC isoforms, such as PKCδ, PKCϵ, PKCη, and PKCθ, can activate PKD (18Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The PKC isoforms that mediate PKD activation may vary in response to the specific cellular stimuli in different cell types (40Tan M. Xu X. Ohba M. Ogawa W. Cui M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results revealed a novel signaling pathway in which PKCα mediates VEGF-induced PKD activation. To date, the role of PKCα in PKD activation is totally unknown, and although VEGF has been shown to activate PKCα in endothelial cells (38Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), the downstream target of PKCα is still unclear. Our data established for the first time that VEGF-induced PKD activation is mediated by PKCα in endothelial cells. We applied multiple approaches to address the specificity of the PKCα function in mediating VEGF-induced PKD activation. First, the prolonged treatment with PMA blocked VEGF-induced PKD activation (Fig. 7A), suggesting that classical or novel PKC isoforms are involved in VEGF-induced PKD activation. Next, the fact that the PKCδ inhibitor Rottlerin and the PKCβ inhibitor LY379196 did not affect VEGF-induced PKD activation excludes the involvement of PKCδ and PKCβ2 in VEGF-induced PKD activation. To determine the role of PKCα, we employed the dominant negative approach by using the adenovirus expression system to express the wild-type and dominant negative forms of PKCα in endothelial cells. Our results showed that overexpression of PKCα-DN almost completely blocks VEGF-induced PKD activation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, PKCδ-DN did not affect VEGF-induced PKD activation (Fig. 8). In addition, overexpression of PKCα-WT enhanced VEGF-induced PKD activation. Finally, siRNA knockdown of PKCα, but not PKCδ, expression in HUVEC significantly inhibited VEGF-induced PKD activation. Collectively, these data demonstrated a novel role of PKCα in mediating VEGF-induced PKD activation in endothelial cells. The signal transduction pathways mediate VEGF biological function, such as stimulating cell proliferation and migration and increasing vascular permeability and angiogenesis. In particular, it has been suggested that the VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKC pathway leads to activation of Raf-MEK1-ERK1/2 and endothelial cell proliferation as well as angiogenesis (9Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 13Lawson N.D. Mugford J.W. Diamond B.A. Weinstein B.M.

Since we found that VEGF induced PKD activation via the VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKCα pathway, we asked whether PKD and PKCα are involved in VEGF-mediated ERK1/2 signaling and cell proliferation. Using the loss-of-function approach with siRNA targeting, we found that siRNA knockdown of PKD and PKCα expression significantly attenuated ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis by VEGF in endothelial cells. Our results indicated a critical role of PKD in VEGF-induced ERK1/2 signaling and endothelial cell proliferation. Consistent with our results, it has been reported that constitutively activated PKD mutant selectively activates the Raf-MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway (44Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of wild-type PKD potentiates ERK1/2 signaling and DNA synthesis induced by G-protein-coupled receptors (28Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Hsieh N. Jiang X. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16883-16893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In summary, our study demonstrated for the first time that VEGF activated PKD in endothelial cells. Our results also revealed a VEGFR2/PLCγ/PKCα pathway in VEGF-induced PKD activation. Furthermore, our experiments provided evidence of a critical role of PKD in VEGF-induced ERK1/2 signaling and endothelial cell proliferation. Thus, the present findings identified PKD as a new component in the VEGF-induced intracellular signaling pathway in endothelial cells, and this discovery may implicate PKD in mediating angiogenesis by VEGF and may suggest PKD as a potential therapeutic target for angiogenesis in various diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2077302626,"Lonafarnib (SCH66336) is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that inhibits the post-translational lipid modification of H-Ras and other farnesylated proteins. K- and N-Ras are also substrates of farnesyl transferase; however, upon treatment with FTIs, they are alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferase-1. Despite the failure to abrogate prenylation of K- and N-Ras, growth of many tumors in preclinical models is inhibited by FTIs. This suggests that the anti-proliferative action of FTIs is dependent on blocking the farnesylation of other proteins. Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain) is a farnesylated small GTPase that positively regulates mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. We found that Rheb and Rheb2 mRNA were elevated in various tumor cell lines relative to normal cells. Peptides derived from the carboxyl termini of human Rheb and Rheb2 are in vitro substrates for farnesyl transferase but not geranylgeranyl transferase-1. Rheb prenylation in cell culture was completely inhibited by SCH66336, indicating a lack of alternative prenylation. SCH66336 treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, a downstream target of Rheb and mTOR signaling. SCH66336 did not inhibit S6 phosphorylation in cells expressing Rheb-CSVL, a mutant construct of Rheb designed to be geranylgeranylated. Importantly, expression of Rheb-CSVL also abrogated SCH66336 enhancement of tamoxifen- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells, respectively. Further, inhibition of Rheb signaling by rapamycin treatment, small interfering RNA, or dominant negative Rheb enhanced tamoxifen- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis, similar to FTI treatment. These studies demonstrated that Rheb is modified by farnesylation, is not a substrate for alternative prenylation, and plays a role in SCH66336 enhancement of the anti-tumor response to other chemotherapeutics."

The compounds were characterized by mass spectrometry and fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the data support a heptagonal ring in the framework. The resulting strain, which has hindered past attempts to prepare these smaller quasi-fullerenes, is mitigated here by hybridization change of some of the carbons in the pentagons from sp2 to sp3 because of fluorine addition. The loss of carbon from C60 is believed to occur via sequential fluorine addition to a CC single bond and an adjacent CC bond, followed by loss of a:CF2 carbene."

TREK-1 is a two-pore domain background K+ channel (KCNK2, K2P2.1) that is sensitive to a variety of physicochemical and humoral factors. In this work, we used a recombinant expression system to show that activation of Gαq-coupled receptors leads to inhibition of TREK-1 channels via protein kinase C (PKC), and we identified a critical phosphorylation site in a key regulatory domain that mediates inhibition of the channel. In HEK 293 cells co-expressing TREK-1 and either the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR1) or the Orexin receptor (Orx1R), agonist stimulation induced robust channel inhibition that was suppressed by a bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor but not by a protein kinase A blocker ((Rp)-cAMP-S). Channel inhibition by agonists or by direct activators of PKC (phorbol dibutyrate) and PKA (forskolin) was disrupted not only by alanine or aspartate mutations at an identified PKA site (Ser-333) in the C terminus, but also at a more proximal regulatory site in the cytoplasmic C terminus (Ser-300); S333A and S300A mutations enhanced basal TREK-1 current, whereas S333D and S300D substitutions mimicked phosphorylation and strongly diminished currents. When studied in combination, TREK-1 current density was enhanced in S300A/S333D but reduced in S300D/S333A mutant channels. Channel mutants were expressed and appropriately targeted to cell membranes. Together, these data support a sequential phosphorylation model in which receptor-induced kinase activation drives modification at Ser-333 that enables subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-300 to inhibit TREK-1 channel activity.

The negative membrane potential that is essential for electrical signaling in neurons is provided in large part by voltage- and time-independent “leak” or background potassium (K+) channels (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar).

When studied in heterologous expression systems, recombinant KCNK channels have proven remarkable as targets for dynamic regulation by diverse modulatory mechanisms. Even among this well modulated family of two-pore domain background K+ channels, TREK-1 (KCNK2, K2P2.1) is exceptional in its sensitivity to an impressive array of physicochemical factors, neuromodulators, and clinically useful drugs. TREK-1 channel activity is enhanced by intracellular acidification, temperature, osmolarity, and membrane stretch (6Honore E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J.

TREK-1 channels are also activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, lysophospholipids (11Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol.

TREK-1 channels are also up- and down-regulated by neurotransmitters and/or their receptor-associated metabotropic signaling mechanisms. For example, nitric oxide enhances TREK-1 activity by stimulating a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) 1The abbreviations used are: PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BIS, bisindoylmaleimide; DAG, diacylglycerol; FSK, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; Orx1R, Orexin receptor; OrxA, Orexin-A; PA, phosphatidic acid; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; TRHR1, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone. mechanism that requires a consensus PKG site, Ser-351, in the distal C terminus of TREK-1 (14Koh S.D.

Conversely, activation of Gαs-coupled receptors causes inhibition of TREK-1 channels via a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent process involving Ser-333, located near the identified PKG site in the cytoplasmic C terminus of TREK-1 (14Koh S.D.

It is also clear that TREK-1 is inhibited by Gαq-coupled receptors (2Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chemin J. Girard C. Duprat F. Lesage F. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism underlying channel inhibition is less certain in this case. As expected for Gαq-coupled receptors, it appears that phospholipase C (PLC) contributes to receptor-mediated inhibition of TREK-1 channels (16Chemin J. Girard C. Duprat F. Lesage F. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, studies investigating signaling mechanisms beyond PLC have produced conflicting data and alternative hypotheses. One idea holds that diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidic acid, downstream products of PLC, may directly inhibit TREK-1 channels (Refs. 16Chemin J. Girard C. Duprat F. Lesage F. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 17Chemin J. Patel A.J. Duprat F. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. Honore E.

Physiol. 2005; 564: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Another proposes that PLC-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid activator of the channels, could cause TREK-1 inhibition (Ref. 18Lopes C.M. Rohacs T. Czirjak G. Balla T. Enyedi P. Logothetis D.E. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; but see Ref. 16Chemin J. Girard C. Duprat F. Lesage F. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Finally, a role for PLC-mediated activation of PKC, a mechanism commonly associated with Gαq-coupled receptors, is supported by the observation that PKC activating phorbol esters can inhibit TREK-1 currents (18Lopes C.M. Rohacs T. Czirjak G. Balla T. Enyedi P. Logothetis D.E. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the present study, we revisited the possibility that inhibition of TREK-1 by Gαq-coupled receptors involves a PKC-dependent pathway. We find that phorbol esters robustly inhibit TREK-1 and, by using pharmacological intervention and mutagenesis of potential PKC phosphorylation sites, we show that PKC activity is critical for receptor-mediated channel inhibition. Our molecular analysis indicates a necessary, although not sufficient, role for Ser-333 in channel modulation, but also identifies a phosphorylation site at Ser-300 that is both required and sufficient for channel regulation by receptor stimulation, PKC and PKA. The data suggest a sequential phosphorylation model whereby Ser-333 modification enables phosphorylation at Ser-300, which then inhibits channel activity. The novel phosphorylation site at Ser-300 is contained within a proximal C-terminal regulatory domain important for modulation of channel activity by stretch, pH, and phospholipids (6Honore E. Maingret F. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), providing a mechanism for receptor-mediated inhibition of channel gating by diverse modulators. Cloning and Mutagenesis of Mouse TREK-1—The coding region of mTREK-1 was obtained by PCR from mouse brain cDNA using forward and reverse primers from the initiating methionine and the stop codon (based on the original published sequence of mTREK-1 (19Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ U73488.1). The original published sequence and our initial clone were truncated after Leu-370. We generated a fragment of the remaining 3′ region of the coding sequence by PCR and ligated it to our initial clone to produce a full-length mTREK-1 construct in pRK5 (mTREK-pRK5). Three differences (at A63T, K84A, and E101K) are noted between our clone and the updated sequence deposited in GenBank (U73488.2); these may represent true polymorphisms because we obtained an identical sequence from clones derived from a separate PCR using a different reverse primer (located in the M2 region) and a different cDNA preparation. This mTREK-pRK5 cDNA is the basis for all work presented here. A C-terminal truncation of mTREK-1 was created by introducing a stop codon after Glu-327 (T328STOP). Presumptive PKC phosphorylation sites were identified in mTREK-1 at Thr-195, Ser-202, Ser-300, Thr-303, Thr-328, Ser-333, and Ser-345 and mutated to alanine or aspartate, either alone or in combination. All mutations were introduced by QuikChange using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the coding region of each construct was fully sequenced to confirm planned substitutions and absence of unintended mutations. Cell Culture and Transfection—For most experiments, we used an HEK293 cell that stably expresses the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR1), the so-called E2 cells (from Graeme Milligan (20Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); for some studies, we generated an HEK293 cell that stably expresses the Orexin receptor (Orx1R) using a cDNA kindly provided by Masashi Yanagisawa (UT Southwestern). Cells were transfected transiently with mTREK-1 channel constructs along with the green fluorescent protein (pGreenLantern; Invitrogen) by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). One day following transfection, cells were plated onto glass coverslips and individual green fluorescent cells were chosen for electrophysiological recording. Western Blot of Membrane-targeted TREK-1 Channel Constructs—E2 cells were transfected with TREK-1 channel constructs in 6-cm2 tissue culture dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. After ∼16 h, the cells were washed with PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 9.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce)). Free biotin was quenched in PBSCM with 100 mm glycine for 15 min at 4 °C, and the cells were washed with PBSCM before lysis in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of proteases inhibitors (leupeptin (2 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml)). The lysate was centrifuged (5 min at 14,000 × g in a Microfuge) and the supernatant was collected for protein assay (BCA, Pierce). To precipitate biotinylated TREK-1 channels, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μl; Pierce); the beads were spun down (14,000 rpm, 2 min), and washed twice with lysis buffer, twice in high-salt wash buffer (lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice in no-salt wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× sample loading buffer (50% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, and 0.0625 m Tris/H3PO4). The beads were spun down at 14,000 × g for 4 min and the supernatant, along with crude lysate (20 μg of total protein), was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and TREK-1 was detected using commercially available antisera (Alomone Labs; 1:200) by enhanced chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Recording and Data Analysis—Coverslips containing transfected cells were placed in a chamber on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300) and visualized using DIC optics and fluorescence. Cells were maintained at room temperature (24 °C) in a bath solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 2 mm Hepes, and 10 glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.3. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Warner Instruments) to a direct current resistance of ∼2–4 MΩ, coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning Co.), and filled with a solution of (in mm): 120 KCH3SO3, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 EGTA, 3 ATP, 0.3 GTP-Tris, pH 7.2. Drugs were applied by perfusion during the recording of TREK current in the following concentration: 200 nm TRH and 20 nm Orexin-A (from American Peptide & Peptide International); 1 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; Sigma); 1 μm 4α-PDBu (Alexis Biochemicals); and 1 nm or 1 μm 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (FSK; Alexis). Where indicated, cells were preincubated and recorded in solutions containing the PKC inhibitor bisindoylmaleimide (BIS, 1 μm; Calbiochem) or in a mixture containing 1 μm BIS and a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor, H7 (5 μm; Sigma). To block PKA activity, (Rp)-cAMP-S (1 mm; Sigma) was added to the pipette solution. To inhibit phosphatase activity, cells were incubated with 20 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem). Recordings were obtained under whole cell voltage clamp using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and a Digidata 1322A analog digital converter (Axon Instruments) with pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments). Series resistance was compensated by ∼70% and a liquid junction potential (10 mV) was corrected offline. Depolarizing ramps from –130 to +20 mV (0.2 V/s) were applied every 5 s to generate current-voltage (I-V) curves. For analysis, holding current was determined at –60 mV and slope conductance was calculated from linear fits to ramp currents obtained between –30 and +5 mV; cell capacitance was taken from the compensation circuit of the amplifier and used to normalize currents to cell size (current density). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was by t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with differences considered significant if p < 0.05. We expressed TREK-1 in HEK293 cells, together with either of two Gαq-coupled receptors, TRHR1 and Orx1R, to determine mechanisms of modulation by this class of receptor. The general characteristics of TREK-1 currents and their modulation are presented in Fig. 1. A robust outwardly rectifying current was apparent immediately upon gaining whole cell access; TREK-1 channel activity was quantified as the slope conductance between –30 and 5 mV, which typically increased over the first ∼2–5 min of recording at which point it reached a new plateau (Fig. 1, insets). Following this “run-up” of channel current, activation of the respective receptors by bath application of TRH (200 nm) or Orexin-A (20 nm) caused strong inhibition of TREK-1; averaged data reveal that TRH inhibited 63 ± 4% (n = 11) and OrxA inhibited 55 ± 6% (n = 11) of the peak current (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2TRHR1- and Orx1R-mediated inhibition involves PKC, but not PKA. A, effect of pharmacological activation and inhibition of PKC on TREK-1 currents and their modulation by TRH and OrxA. Left → right, the PKC activator, phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu; 1 μm), inhibited TREK-1 currents. TREK-1 inhibition by PDBu was abrogated by pretreatment with 1 μm bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor (PDBu + BIS). Pretreatment with 1 μm BIS also diminished TREK-1 inhibition by TRH (TRH + BIS) and Orexin-A (OrxA + BIS). B, effect of pharmacological activation and inhibition of PKA on TREK-1 currents and their modulation by TRH. Left → right, the PKA activator, forskolin (FSK; 1 nm), inhibited TREK-1 currents. TREK-1 inhibition by FSK was reduced by including 1 mm (Rp)-cAMP-S, a PKA inhibitor, in the pipette (FSK + Rp-cAMP-S). Internal (Rp)-cAMP-S did not decrease TREK-1 inhibition by TRH (TRH + Rp-cAMP-S). C, averaged data (± S.E.) illustrating the effect of PDBu, TRH, OrxA, and FSK on TREK-1 conductance (% inhibition, relative to control). The PKC inhibitor BIS was equally effective at blocking TREK-1 inhibition by PDBu, TRH, and OrxA; by contrast, although (Rp)-cAMP-S interfered with FSK-mediated TREK-1 inhibition, it did not block TRH-mediated channel inhibition. TREK-1 inhibition by FSK was not blocked by BIS. *, p < 0.01 by ANOVA, n ≥ 7 per group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKC Mediates Receptor-activated TREK-1 Inhibition— TRHR1 and Orx1R couple to activation of PLC and subsequent PKC activation (21Sakurai T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that receptor-mediated inhibition of TREK-1 involves PKC. Cells expressing TREK-1 channels were exposed to the PKC-activating PDBu (1 μm). As depicted in Fig. 2, PDBu inhibited TREK-1 conductance (55 ± 3% inhibition, n = 10) to approximately the same degree as either TRH or OrxA (∼55–60% inhibition). The inactive analogue, 4α-PDBu (1 μm), was without effect on TREK conductance (data not shown), and the effect of PDBu was significantly attenuated when cells were incubated with BIS (1 μm), an inhibitor of PKC (Fig. 2, A and C). These results indicate that direct PKC activation by PDBu can lead to TREK-1 channel inhibition. Importantly, receptor-mediated TREK-1 inhibition also appears to involve PKC because TRH and OrxA caused only ∼30% inhibition of TREK-1 in cells incubated with BIS (1 μm). Indeed, BIS was approximately equally effective at interfering with inhibition of TREK-1 by Gαq-coupled receptors and PDBu (Fig. 2, A and C). It is known that activation of PKA can inhibit TREK-1 currents (14Koh S.D. Monaghan K. Sergeant G.P. Ro S. Walker R.L. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. J. Biol.

As expected, activation of PKA with FSK (1 nm) caused a strong inhibition of TREK-1 (70 ± 4% inhibition, n = 8), an action that was unaffected by BIS (Fig. 2C) but significantly reduced when a PKA inhibitor, (Rp)-cAMP-S (1 mm), was included in the pipette solution. Importantly, inhibition of TREK-1 by TRH was not decreased by (Rp)-cAMPS (59 ± 4% inhibition, n = 9; Fig. 2, B and C). Together, these data indicate that receptor-mediated inhibition of TREK channels by TRH and OrxA involves PKC, but is largely independent of PKA. Two C-terminal Phosphorylation Sites Are Required for TRH and Kinase-mediated Inhibition of TREK-1—The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of TREK-1 is important for regulation of TREK-1 by multiple factors, including stretch, temperature, protons, lysophospholipids, and neurotransmitters (6Honore E.

To determine the contribution of the C terminus to channel inhibition by TRH and OrxA, we generated a TREK-1 channel construct with the C-terminal truncated after Glu-327 (see schematic in Fig. 3A). This truncation removed previously identified phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKG at Ser-333 and Ser-351 (14Koh S.D. Monaghan K. Sergeant G.P. Ro S. Walker R.L. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. J. Biol.

Likewise, PDBu did not inhibit the C-terminal-truncated channels (Fig. 3B, inset). Note, also, that current amplitude was strongly diminished in cells expressing TREK-1ΔC channels (see also Fig. 4, B and C). These data indicate that cytoplasmic C-terminal domains beyond Glu-327 are important for basal TREK-1 channel activity and also for regulation of TREK-1 by Gαq-coupled receptors and activators of PKC.Fig. 4Activity of doubly mutated TREK-1 channels supports a model of sequential phosphorylation for channel inhibition by transmitters and protein kinases. A, time series illustrating basal conductance and run-up in representative E2 cells transfected with TREK-1 phosphorylation site mutants. Conductance was relatively high in cells expressing S333A or the S300A channels and much reduced in cells transfected with S333D or the S300D channels. In cells expressing doubly mutated channels, TREK-1 conductance was enhanced when S300A was paired with S333D, but remained diminished when S300D was paired with S333A. Note that TRH was without effect and run-up was absent in cells expressing these mutant channels.

As shown in Fig. 3A, five sites were identified in the C terminus of TREK-1, two of them located immediately after TM4, the final transmembrane segment (Ser-300 and Thr-303), and three further into the C terminus, beyond the truncation point of the C-terminal deleted channel (Thr-328, Ser-333, and Ser-345). A PKG site identified at Ser-351 is also indicated (14Koh S.D. Monaghan K. Sergeant G.P. Ro S. Walker R.L. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44338-44346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Two additional putative PKC sites were identified in the M2–M3 cytoplasmic loop separating the two P-domains (Thr-195 and Ser-202). To determine whether these sites are required for receptor and PKC inhibition of TREK-1, we substituted these serine and threonine residues with alanine and tested effects of PDBu and TRH on the mutated channels. Mutating potential phosphorylation sites in the M2–M3 cytoplasmic loop (T195A/S202A) had no effect on either PDBu- or TRH-mediated inhibition of TREK-1; likewise, channel inhibition by PDBu and TRH was preserved in channels bearing an alanine substitution at either Thr-328 or Ser-345 (data not shown). By contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, C and D, mutation of the previously identified PKA site at Ser-333 (15Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

https://openalex.org/W1973673595,"Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular adaptive response that functions to reduce stress caused by malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UPR can be induced under physiological or pathological conditions and is responsible for the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus causing chronic diseases. Its genome encodes two envelope proteins E1 and E2, which mature in the ER to form a noncovalently bound, native complex and disulfide aggregates and have previously been shown to induce expression of the molecular chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein. In this study, we show that HCV envelope protein expression regulates another stress indicator CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). The ER-stress element and the activating transcription factor 4 element in the CHOP promoter were activated to a similar extent by HCV envelope protein expression. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in the ER stress kinase RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER-resident kinase (PERK), we showed that PERK was necessary and sufficient for activating the CHOP promoter. Expression of HCV E1 and/or E2 also induced splicing of X-box binding protein 1 and transactivation of the unfolded protein response element, leading to the speculation that HCV E1 and E2 not only regulate the UPR but also ER-associated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2015088220,"We used a hybrid vertical-lateral double-dot device, consisting of laterally coupled vertical quantum dots, to measure the interdot tunnel coupling. By using nonlinear transport measurements of “Coulomb diamonds,” we showed that an inherent asymmetry in the capacitances of the component dots influences the diamond slopes, thereby allowing for the determination of the dot through which the electron has passed. We used this technique to prepare a delocalized one-electron state and Heitler-London (HL) two-electron state, and we showed that the interdot tunnel coupling, which determines whether HL is the ground state, is tunable. This implies that our device may be useful for implementing two-electron spin entanglement."

FMRP is highly expressed in neurons, where it is involved in mRNP transport and translation, two processes required for synaptic plasticity (1Steward O. Schuman E.M.

Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The specific mechanism(s) through which FMRP regulates translation still remains to be understood; in particular, it is not clear whether the regulation occurs at the level of translation initiation (3Laggerbauer B. Ostareck D. Keidel E.M. Ostareck-Lederer A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), during the translation elongation phase (according to a “stalling polysomes” hypothesis) (8Lu R. Wang H. Liang Z. Ku L.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7272-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), or both, depending on the different stages of development. With respect to mRNP transport, FMRP has both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) and is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Tamanini F. Bontekoe C. Bakker C.E. van Unen L. Anar B. Willemsen R. Yoshida M. Galjaard H. Oostra B.A. Hoogeveen A.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); it therefore seems likely that FMRP accompanies specific mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, granules containing FMRP are transported to locations throughout the dendrite, where translation is regulated by synaptic activation (11Antar L.N. Afroz R. Dictenberg J.B. Carroll R.C. Bassell G.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2648-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the granules in which mRNPs are thought to be transported. Indeed, mass spectrometric analysis of RNase-sensitive mRNP transport granules also identified, among several proteins involved in transport along the cytoskeleton, FMRP (12Kanai Y. Dohmae N. Hirokawa N. Neuron. 2004; 43: 513-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). As a protein involved in mRNP transport and regulation of translation, FMRP is expected to bind selectively to a subset of the mRNAs. Quite a variety of mRNAs have been identified in vitro and in vivo as potential targets of the entire FMRP (13Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y.

Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and it is still not clear how the mRNAs are recognized. There are at least three RNA elements that can direct FMRP binding (for a recent review, see Ref. 17Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 5: 376-387Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The first is a G-rich RNA structure called the G quartet (14Darnell J.C. Jensen K.B. Jin P. Brown V. Warren S.T. Darnell R.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 18Schaeffer C. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Moine H.

Y.). 2003; 9: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the second consists of U-rich stretches (16Chen L. Yun S.W. Seto J. Liu W. Toth M. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thirdly, we have demonstrated that FMRP binds specifically to the non-coding RNA BC1, which in turn exhibits significant complementarity to and anneals with some mRNAs regulated by FMRP (7Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). BC1 is a non-translatable RNA, specific of rodents, that acts as an adapter molecule determining the selectivity of FMRP for some of its target mRNAs. Consistent with a role of the BC1-FMRP complex(es) in translational inhibition, BC1 has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex and to bind two key proteins involved in regulation of translation, the poly(A)-binding protein and the translational initiation factor eIF4A (20Wang H.

Finally, recent findings suggest that FMRP may associate with microRNAs and with components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (22Caudy A.A. Myers M. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 23Ishizuka A. Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 24Jin P.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). microRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules (22–24 nt long) that base pair with mRNAs and either direct their degradation or direct their translational regulation (25Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In this way, microRNAs may attract FMRP to specific mRNAs, similar to BC1. FMRP contains three sequence motifs that are characteristic of RNA-binding domains, namely two copies of the KH motif and an RGG box (26Khandjian E.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal 217 amino acids can also bind to RNA homopolymers (27Adinolfi S. Bagni C. Musco G. Gibson T. Mazzarella L. Pastore A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Adinolfi S. Ramos A. Martin S.R. Dal Piaz F. Pucci P. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10437-10444Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Of these four domains, only the RGG box has been demonstrated to bind RNA with sequence or structure specificity; it recognizes the above mentioned G quartet (14Darnell J.C. Jensen K.B. Jin P. Brown V. Warren S.T. Darnell R.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 18Schaeffer C. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Moine H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple RNA-binding domains on the FMRP protein leaves open the interesting possibility that the competing models on the recognition of RNA by FMRP, i.e. via G quartets, via U-rich elements, or via RNA adapters such as BC1, are actually compatible with each other. To investigate this possibility, we set out to map the FMRP domain that is responsible for binding to the BC1 RNA. We showed here that the N-terminal domain of FMRP binds BC1 RNA in a specific manner and that the BC1 region responsible for FMRP binding is found within the stem loop responsible for mRNA target recognition (7Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that the BC1 analog in primates, called BC200 (29Martignetti J.A. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11563-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), binds directly and specifically to FMRP via the same N-terminal domain, strengthening the idea that the two BC RNAs have the same functional significance in neuronal cells. These results demonstrated that the N terminus, which contains two Tudor motifs of unknown function, is capable of sequence-specific RNA binding. We discuss the possibility that the Tudor motif actually indicates the presence of a nucleic acid-binding domain. Furthermore, the N terminus is well separated, in sequence and space, from the RGG box that recognizes the mRNAs via the G quartet, lending support to the idea that FMRP might recognize its target mRNAs in different ways, which either may be linked to the different functions of the protein or may occur simultaneously and cooperatively to strengthen the binding. FMRP Recombinant Proteins—The FMRP constructs used for this study are: FMRP N terminus (amino acids 1–217), NDF (amino acids 1–134), NDF/NLS (amino acids 1–180), FMRP-KH1 (amino acids 205–280), FMRP-KH2 (amino acids 281–422), and FMRP C terminus (amino acids 516–632); they were produced as described previously (27Adinolfi S. Bagni C. Musco G. Gibson T. Mazzarella L. Pastore A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE after each step of purification and by mass spectrometry of the final product. To probe the secondary and tertiary structure of the constructs, circular dichroism spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were performed as described previously (28Adinolfi S. Ramos A. Martin S.R. Dal Piaz F. Pucci P. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10437-10444Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human FMRP was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells using a His-TAT-tagged full-length FMR1 clone. The recombinant protein was purified as described previously (30Reis S.A. Willemsen R. van Unen L. Hoogeveen A.T. Oostra B.A. J. Mol. Histol. 2004; 35: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Preparation of BC1 and BC200 DNA Template and RNA Transcripts—DraI linearized plasmids pBCX607 containing the BC1 sequence (31Cheng J.G. Tiedge H. Brosius J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (a gift from H. Tiedge) and pPBC200 containing the BC200 sequence (32Bovia F. Wolff N. Ryser S. Strub K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (a gift from J. Brosius) were used as a template for the T7 RNA polymerase to produce 32P-labeled RNAs (BC1 or BC200) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences; 3000 Ci/mmol) or non-radioactive RNAs (BC1, BC200 or BC1 fragments) using an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Templates for the containing portions of BC1 RNA (Δ1–Δ5) were generated as described below. The entire 5′ stem loop (Δ1 deletion mutant; nt 1–76) was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG TTG GGG ATT TAG CTC-3′ and 5′-CCA GAG CTG AGG ACC GAA-3′ and the plasmid pBCX607 as template. The partial BC1 RNAs corresponding to 3′ stem loop (Δ2 deletion mutant; nt 127–152) was amplified by PCR using the primers T7 and 5′-AAA GGT TGT GTG TGC-3′, and as template, the oligonucleotide 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG AAC AAG GTA ACT GGC ACA CAC AAC CTT T-3′. The construct containing the A stretch (Δ3 deletion mutant; nt 61–138) was amplified using the primers 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAC GGT CCT CAG CTC TGG-3′ and 5′-CCA GTT ACC TTG TTT-3′ and the plasmid pBCX607 as template. BC1 5′ end lacking the distal one-third of the stem loop (nt 26–49) (Δ4 construct; nt 1–25/50–76) was generated by PCR using the same primers used for the Δ1 construct, and as template, the oligonucleotide 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG TTG GGG ATT TAG CTC AGT GGT TTC GGC CCT GGG TTC GGT CCT CAG CTC TGG-3′. The fragment of BC1 5′ end lacking the two-thirds distal (nt 15–60) of the stem loop (Δ5 construct; nt 1–14/61–76) was generated by PCR using the primers T7 and 5′-CCA GAG CTG AGG ACC GAA-3′, and as template, the oligonucleotide 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG TTG GGG ATT TCG GTC CTC AGC TCT GG-3′. Amplification was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and the generated PCR fragments were sequenced before usage. The PCR products were in vitro-transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase as described above. Band Shift Experiments—RNA band-shift experiments were performed under variable conditions of stringency and presence of different competitors. As a standard BC-FMRP interaction assay, 32P-labeled BC1 or BC200 RNA (1 × 105 cpm, 0.02 pmol), prepared by transcription in vitro, was incubated with 400 ng of purified FMRP constructs in the following binding buffer: 150 or 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, and 500 ng of total yeast tRNA or 20 μg of heparin. Interaction was performed at room temperature (25 °C) or on ice for 20 min. The free RNAs and RNA protein complexes were subsequently separated by electrophoresis on 5 and/or 7% native acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C and then analyzed by autoradiography. In competition experiments, unlabeled RNAs (tRNA, full-length BC1, or BC1 fragments) in 10-, 50-, or 100-fold excess (0.2, 1, or 2 pmol) were added 20 min before the binding reaction. To map the minimal BC1 region responsible for the binding, BC1 deletion mutants (corresponding to 3′ stem loop (nt 127–152) and the A stretch (nt 61–143) amplified by PCR) were added in 50- or 100-fold excess before the binding reaction. Determination of Dissociation Constant (Kd) by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For determination of the apparent binding constant, the same amount of BC1 (or BC200) RNA (1 × 105 cpm, 0.02 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of protein. Following electrophoresis, the radioactive gel was dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify the amount of free RNA and RNA-protein complex for each protein concentration considered. In the assays described here, a great excess of protein over RNA was employed, and the concentration of free protein does not appreciably change upon complex formation ([FMRP]free ≈ [FMRP]tot). The equation Kdapp = ([BC]free·[FMRP]free)/[FMRP-BC] can therefore be simplified to Kdapp = ([BC]free/[BC]bound)· [FMRP]tot. Under this condition, the Kdapp is the concentration of FMRP at which half-of the RNA is bound ([BC]free = [BC]bound). UV Cross-linking of in Vitro Reconstituted BC1 RNA-FMRP Complex— 150 fmol of [32P]pCp-labeled neuronal BC1 RNA (0.01 mCi/pmol), prepared by transcription in vitro, was incubated on ice for 10 min with 1.5, 3.0, 7.5, 15, 30 or 75 pmol of recombinant fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP N terminus (aa 1–217) in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). For competition experiments, 150 fmol of the same RNA was incubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of 75 pmol of FMRP and 1.5, 3.0, 7.5, 15, or 30 pmol of non-labeled neuronal BC1 RNA or in vitro-transcribed human U1 snRNA. UV cross-linking of the BC1 RNA-FMRP complex prepared by reconstitution in vitro was performed exactly according to a previously described method (33Urlaub H. Hartmuth K. Luhrmann R. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 170-181Google Scholar). 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to each sample. The samples were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently visualized by autoradiography. BC1 RNA Binds FMRP Specifically—The small dendritic brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BC1) is part of the FMRP complex in neurons of rodents and binds directly and specifically to FMRP in vitro (7Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). To better understand the specificity of the FMRP-BC1 interaction, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using in vitro-transcribed, 32P-labeled BC1 RNA and recombinant human FMRP protein (Fig. 1A). Incubation of FMRP with BC1 leads to the formation of a slower migrating complex (lane 2), which can be competed by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled BC1 RNA (BC1c competitor) but not by a nonspecific competitor like total yeast tRNA tested at the same molar excess (tRNAc competitor) (Fig. 1A, compare lane 3 with lane 4). Moreover, we have previously shown that this complex can also be super shifted by antibodies specific for FMRP (7Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). A similar experiment was performed with bovine serum albumin and two different RNA-binding proteins, the microbial transcription and translation modulator NusG (34Steiner T. Kaiser J.T. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Wahl M.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4641-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the spliceosomal 15.5KD/hSnu13p protein (35Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), respectively. Neither of these proteins formed a complex with BC1 (lanes 5–7), showing that BC1 RNA does not bind to any RNA-binding protein and pointing out the specificity of the FMRP-BC1 interaction. Titration of FMRP indicates a half-saturation point for BC1 binding of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1, B and C). An apparent Kd of 200 nm would be in the range of Kd values observed for other specific RNA-protein interactions. The true Kd is probably lower, and the FMRP-BC1 binding is even stronger; the recombinant full-length FMRP protein tends to aggregate, which is evidenced by the signal seen in the wells of the EMSA gels. Therefore, the available concentration of FMRP in each lane was certainly lower than indicated. The Entire and Structured N-terminal Domain of FMRP Binds Specifically to BC1 and BC200 RNAs—To map the minimal BC1-binding domain, we tested a series of FMRP deletion constructs for BC1 binding activity. We produced a number of FMRP constructs on the basis of the structural properties of the protein (Fig. 2A); the domain boundaries were designed according to our previous work in which the fold of each construct had been checked by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (27Adinolfi S. Bagni C. Musco G. Gibson T. Mazzarella L. Pastore A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We prepared six constructs spanning the sequences of the isolated FMRP N terminus (NT, aa 1–217), of the two KH motifs (KH1, aa 205–280; KH2, aa 281–422), and of the C terminus (CT, aa 516–632; Fig. 2A). NT is known to comprise three motifs: the well folded N terminal domain of FMRP, NDF, (aa 1–134), the putative nuclear localization signal, NLS, (aa 135–180), and a putative helix-turn-helix motif (aa 181–217), ref28Adinolfi S. Ramos A. Martin S.R. Dal Piaz F. Pucci P. Bardoni B. Mandel J.L. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10437-10444Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. Of the two KH domains, the first is known to be properly folded, whereas KH2, possibly due to the absence of interactions with regions not directly flanking the motif, is unstructured. CT contains long low complexity stretches and is not folded in a stable three-dimensional structure in the absence of RNA (Fig. 2A). To map which of these FMRP domains is responsible for binding to BC1 RNA, we performed EMSA experiments, incubating each domain with BC1 RNA (Fig. 2B). Only NT and CT were able to bind to BC1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 8). Binding of NT to BC1 RNA is specific and stoichiometric since complex formation can be competed by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled BC1 RNA but not by nonspecific competitors (tRNAs) at the same molar excess (Fig. 2C, compare lane 3 with lane 4). Moreover, the addition of lithium, a chaotropic agent that destabilizes nonspecific binding, to the EMSA binding buffer, does not modify the strength of BC1-NT interaction (Fig. 2C, compare lane 2 with 5). In contrast, binding of CT is nonspecific; the complex appears as a smear rather than a defined band on the EMSA gel, and both the tRNA competitor and lithium are able to dissociate BC1 from the FMRP CT (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 6 to 8 and 9). This nonspecific binding could be due to electrostatic interactions with the RGG region, a cluster rich in arginines. The Kdapp of the BC1-N terminus complex is ∼260 nm (Fig. 2D). This value was, within experimental error, in excellent agreement with that obtained for the full-length protein, indicating that the NT gives the major contribution to the FMRP-BC1 interaction, whereas other regions of FMRP could give additional contributions to stabilize this binding. Two shorter versions of NT, named NDF-(1–134) and NDF/NLS-(1–180) in Fig. 2A, are not able to bind to BC1 RNA. Therefore, the fragment including the amino acids 180–217 and containing the putative helix-turn-helix motif was essential for binding. Attempts to produce this isolated region were, however, impaired by its tendency to aggregate and to go into inclusion bodies. This suggested that the region of FMRP comprising residues 180–217 is unable to fold independently of the flanking regions. The potential BC1 analog in primates is called BC200 RNA (29Martignetti J.A. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11563-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Distribution of the human BC200 RNA reveals neuron-specific expression and dendritic localization comparable with BC1 (36Tiedge H. Chen W. Brosius J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2382-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that BC200 RNA is able to form a complex with FMRP in human neuroblastoma and glioma cell lines (7Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two BC RNAs have the same functional role in FMRP-dependent regulation of translation. Moreover, BC200 RNA has also been shown to bind the entire FMRP in vitro (Ref. 37Gabus C. Mazroui R. Tremblay S. Khandjian E.W. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and data not shown). To see whether BC200 is recognized in a manner similar to BC1, we also checked the same FMRP domains for BC200 binding (Fig. 3). As for BC1 RNA, only the entire NT of FMRP is able to bind to BC200 RNA (Fig. 3, lane 2), and the apparent Kd is similar (300 nm), within experimental error, to the one observed for the BC1-NT complex (data not shown). Thus, despite the considerable divergence of the two BC RNAs, FMRP bound both through the same domain and with similar affinity. The N-terminal Domain of FMRP Can Be Cross-linked Specifically to BC1 RNA—Specific UV cross-linking at 254 nm between protein and RNA in native or reconstituted protein-RNA complexes reflected efficient binding between these two components, as it indicates that the protein is in very close vicinity to certain bases of the RNA. We thus investigated whether the NT of FMRP (aa 1–217) can be specifically cross-linked to BC1 RNA. Increasing amounts of FMRP NT were incubated with radioactively labeled BC1 RNA prepared by transcription in vitro, and the mixture was UV-irradiated at 254 nm. Subsequent analysis of the complexes on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel revealed three labeled bands that appear upon UV irradiation (Fig. 4A). Two of these bands (marked with an asterisk) also appear with weaker intensity in UV-irradiated naked BC1 RNA samples and are thus not considered to be protein-dependent. The lowest, strongest band (XL), with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, is obtained only from samples that contain both BC1 RNA and FMRP protein. This particular band is also sensitive toward RNase and proteinase K treatment (data not shown). We therefore concluded that this band represents a cross-link between FMRP and BC1 RNA. The specificity of the UV cross-link was verified by competition experiments. For this purpose, FMRP NT-BC1 complexes were reconstituted and subsequently cross-linked in the presence of non-labeled competitor RNAs, i.e. BC1 RNA and human U1 snRNA (Fig. 4B). Although non-labeled BC1 RNA was able to compete with the binding between NT and labeled BC1 RNA already at the lowest concentrations tested, human U1 snRNA did not show any effect on the binding of FMRP NT to BC1 RNA. These results demonstrated unambiguously the highly specific nature of the protein-RNA interaction between the N terminus of the FMRP protein and the BC1 RNA. FMRP Recognizes the 5′ Stem Loop of BC1 RNA—To determine which domain of BC1 RNA was responsible for FMRP N terminus binding, an excess of unlabeled RNA constructs representing parts of the BC1 RNA (Fig. 5A; Δ1–Δ3) was used to compete for the interaction with labeled BC1 RNA (Fig. 5B). These BC1 RNA constructs are most likely structured in vitro, as suggested by the highly negative ΔG value of putative secondary structures (data not shown). Complex formation (Fig. 5B, arrow) was completely inhibited by competition with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled full-length BC1 RNA (Fig. 5B, lane 3) and by competition with a 50–100-fold excess of Δ1 construct corresponding to the 5′ stem loop (lanes 5 and 6), whereas only weak reduction was observed by competition with a 100-fold excess of the Δ3 construct (lane 12). No competition occurred with the Δ2 construct corresponding to 3′ stem loop. These data indicated that FMRP contacts principally the 5′ end of BC1. The Δ3 construct encompassing the A-rich stretch and a few nucleotides of the 3′ stem loop gave only a minor contribution, and the 3′ hairpin (construct Δ2) does not bind. The same experiment was repeated with the full-length FMRP, and also, in this case, only the Δ1 construct was able to compete with BC1 full-length (data not shown), strengthening the idea that the 5′ stem loop of"

In Drosophila reinforcement learning, we found that conditioning with concurrent visual and olfactory cues reduced the threshold for unimodal memory retrieval. Furthermore, bimodal preconditioning followed by unimodal conditioning with either a visual or olfactory cue led to crossmodal memory transfer.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic defects in AD are largely unknown. We report here that β-amyloid (Aβ), the main component of senile plaques, induced a significant decrease in dynamin 1, a protein that is essential for synaptic vesicle recycling and, hence, for memory formation and information processing. The Aβ-induced dynamin 1 decrease occurred in the absence of overt synaptic loss and was also observed in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. In addition, our results provided evidence that the Aβ-induced decrease in dynamin 1 was likely the result of a calpain-mediated cleavage of dynamin 1 protein and possibly the down-regulation of dynamin 1 gene expression.

Numerous genetic, biochemical, and animal model studies have implicated the gradual buildup of Aβ, the main component of senile plaques, as the catalyst for AD. However, the mechanistic link between Aβ accumulation and the progressive cognitive impairment associated with this disease has not been elucidated. Synapse loss seems to be the best morphological correlate of the functional deficits observed in the mid-to-late stages of AD (3Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 4DeKosky S.T. Scheff S.W. Ann.

Hansen L.A. Alford M. Masliah E. Thal L.J. Corey-Bloom J. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that a stage of synaptic dysfunction might precede frank synapse loss, plaque accumulation, and tangle formation in AD (6Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar, 7Yao P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 24-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying such synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. It is tempting to speculate that proteins involved in synaptic vesicle biogenesis and/or recycling might play a critical role in AD. Data obtained recently seem to support this view. Thus, changes in the levels of a number of presynaptic proteins, including SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptotagmin, have been reported in AD (8Honer W.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1047-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More recently, dynamin 1, a protein highly enriched in presynaptic terminals, has been shown to be significantly reduced in AD brains (9Yao P.J. Zhu M. Pyun E.I. Brooks A.I. Therianos S. Meyers V.E. Coleman P.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 12: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Dynamin 1, a well studied neuron-specific mechanochemical GTPase, pinches off synaptic vesicles, freeing them from the membrane and allowing them to re-enter the synaptic vesicle pool to be refilled for future release (10Clark S.G. Shurland D.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Bargmann C.I. van der Bliek A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10438-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The essential role for dynamin 1 in vesicle scission and synaptic function has been best supported by studies of the Drosophila model shibire, a temperature-sensitive mutant of a dynamin ortholog (12Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). At restrictive temperatures these flies displayed a paralysis phenotype. This functional deficit was accompanied by the depletion of synaptic vesicles and the accumulation of invaginated pits at pre-synaptic membranes adjacent to the synaptic clefts. Collectively, these data suggested that the stressors that induce dynamin 1 loss-of-function could result in the diminution of available synaptic vesicles leading to synaptic dysfunction. In the present study we analyzed whether Aβ was one of such stressors using hippocampal neurons that develop in culture and in an AD animal model system. Our results showed that Aβ induced a significant reduction in dynamin 1 levels that preceded synapse loss in both model systems. In cultured neurons, our data suggested that the Aβ-induced decrease in dynamin 1 was likely the result of a bimodal mechanism that involved calpain-mediated proteolysis and the down-regulation of dynamin 1 gene expression. On the other hand, in the AD mouse model Tg2576 the decrease in dynamin 1 was mainly the result of calpain activation. These mechanisms identify novel therapeutic targets to address the synaptic dysfunction preceding synapse loss and neurodegeneration in the context of AD. Preparation of Hippocampal Cultures—Embryonic day 18 rat embryos were used to prepare primary hippocampal cultures as described previously (14Ferreira A. Li L. Chin L.S. Greengard P. Kosik K.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 286-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Dawson H.N. Ferreira A. Eyster M.V. Ghoshal N. Binder L.I. Vitek M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1179-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected and freed of meninges. The cells were dissociated by trypsinization followed by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. For biochemical experiments, hippocampal neurons were plated at high density (500,000 cells per 60-mm dish) in MEM with 10% horse serum (MEM10). After 2 h, the medium was changed to glia-conditioned MEM containing N2 supplements plus ovalbumin (0.1%) and sodium pyruvate (0.1 mm) (16Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry studies the neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in MEM10. After 2 h, the coverslips were transferred to dishes containing an astroglial monolayer and maintained in MEM containing N2 supplements plus ovalbumin (0.1%) and sodium pyruvate (0.1 mm). These cultures contain ∼95% pyramidal neurons and 5% glial cells. Aβ Treatment—Synthetic Aβ-(1-40) or Aβ-(1-42) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in N2 medium at 0.1 mg/ml and incubated for 4 days at 37 °C to preaggregate the peptide (17Ferreira A. Lu Q. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This preaggregated Aβ was added to the culture medium at final concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 20 μm. For some experiments, the aggregated Aβ was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the oligomeric (supernatant) from the fibrillar (pellet) forms of the peptide. The oligomeric fraction was obtained by removing the supernatant. The fibrillar fraction was obtained by resuspending the pellet in a volume of N2 medium equal to the supernatant. These fractions were added directly to the neurons at final Aβ concentrations calculated using the initial concentration of the monomeric form of the peptide. Monomeric Aβ preparations were prepared by dissolving the peptide in N2 medium immediately before use. Hippocampal neurons were grown in the presence of the peptide for up to 36 h. Protease Inhibitors and in Vitro Cleavage—A series of cell-permeable inhibitors, including the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (5-50 μm; Promega, Madison, WI) and the calpain inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucine-CHO (5-50 μm; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), calpeptin (0.1-10 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and MDL-28170 (0.1-10 μm; Calbiochem), were added to the medium of hippocampal neurons (which had been kept in culture 3 weeks) 1 h prior to and for the duration of the Aβ treatment. For experiments using purified caspase-3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and calpain (Calbiochem), whole cell lysates prepared from cultured hippocampal neurons or tissue from the hippocampal region were incubated with caspase-3 or calpain for 1 h at 37 °C. Both proteases were used at final concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 200 units. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared from hippocampal neurons that developed either in culture or in vivo. To prepare these fractions, hippocampal neurons kept in culture for 3 weeks were rinsed in PBS, scraped into Laemmli buffer, and homogenized in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Hippocampi were also dissected from SwAPP695 transgenic (Tg2576) mice and strain-matched, wild-type (WT) mice. The mice used for these experiments were 2-month-old WT (n = 3), 2-month-old Tg2576 (n = 3), 5-month-old WT (n = 4), 5-month-old Tg2576 (n = 6), 8-month-old WT (n = 3), and 8-month-old Tg2576 (n = 5) mice. Hippocampi were mechanically homogenized in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunodetection was performed using the following antibodies: anti-α-tubulin (1:200,000; clone DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich); anti-dynamin 1 raised against an immunogen corresponding to amino acids 633-647 (1:5,000; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO); anti-dynamin 1 (1:1,000; gift from Dr. Mark McNiven, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN); anti-dynamin 2 (1:1,000; Affinity BioReagents); anti-dynamin 3 (1:1,000; Affinity BioReagents); anti-synaptophysin (1:100,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-class III β-tubulin (1:500; clone TUJ1) (18Ferreira A. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 516-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and anti-spectrin (1:1,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for the detection of proteins. Immunoreactive bands were detected and imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad). Densitometry of the images was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Densitometric values were normalized using tubulin as an internal control. Immunocytochemistry—Hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 weeks were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 0.12 m sucrose. They were then permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and rinsed twice in PBS. The cells were preincubated in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and exposed to the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The neurons were then rinsed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. The primary antibodies used for neuronal staining were polyclonal anti-dynamin 1 (1:1,000; Affinity BioReagents) and monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies used were the anti-mouse IgG fluorescein-conjugated antibody and anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine-conjugated antibody (1:1,000; Chemicon). To quantify immunoreactive spots, untreated and Aβ-treated cultured hippocampal neurons were stained using dynamin 1 and synaptophysin antibodies as described above. Five random fields were selected for the quantification of dynamin 1 and synaptophysin immunoreactive spots, which was done at a set intensity using MetaMorph Image analysis software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Fryer Company Inc., Huntley, IL). For the staining of the Aβ peptide, the aggregated, fibrillar, and oligomeric fractions were dried on a slide, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and rinsed twice in PBS. The fractions were preincubated in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and exposed to anti-Aβ (1:500; clone 6e10; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. The fractions were then rinsed in PBS and incubated with anti-mouse IgG fluorescein-conjugated antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. RT-PCR—To obtain total mRNA, cultured hippocampal neurons and hippocampi obtained from WT and Tg2576 mice were homogenized in TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform according to the TRIzol® Reagent manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed in 20-μl reactions containing 1 μg of sample RNA, 2.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 1 unit of RNase inhibitor, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 1 mm dGTP, 5 mm MgCl2 solution, and 2 μl of l0× buffer II (PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit, catalog number N808-0143). Tubes were incubated at 42 °C for 15 min at 99 °C for 5 min and then at 5 °C for 5 min. Real time RT-PCR was performed using 18 S ribosomal subunit primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as endogenous controls and dynamin 1-specific primers (Applied Biosystems) as the target genes. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed in 20-μl reactions using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 135 ng of cDNA, and TaqMan® primers, which included probes conjugated with fluorescein as the reporter dyes. All real time RT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and analyzed as relative quantifications of dynamin 1 in Aβ-treated cultured hippocampal neurons versus untreated cultured hippocampal neurons and Tg2576 hippocampi versus WT hippocampi using the ABI 7900HT Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Aβ Induced a Dynamin 1 Reduction in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—To test whether the deposition of Aβ could cause a depletion of dynamin 1, we analyzed dynamin 1 protein levels in cultured hippocampal neurons treated with Aβ. We have chosen this model system because the hippocampus is one of the brain regions most affected in AD. In addition, synaptic integrity in the hippocampus is crucial to memory formation. Furthermore, we and others have shown previously that, when kept in culture for >3 weeks, hippocampal neurons reproduce the molecular composition and functional characteristics of mature neurons in vivo (17Ferreira A. Lu Q. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Bartlett W.P. Banker G.A. J.

The addition of Aβ-(1-40) (20 μm) to the culture medium of these mature hippocampal neurons induced a significant decrease in dynamin 1 (100 kDa) as determined by Western blot analysis. Dynamin 2, a ubiquitous dynamin isoform, as well as synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic protein, were also decreased in Aβ-treated neurons (Fig. 1A). However, the loss of dynamin 1 and 2 was more extensive than that of synaptophysin. Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle protein with four transmembrane domains that anchor it to synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic compartment of nerve terminals (21Wiedenmann B. Franke W.W. Cell. 1985; 41: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Synaptophysin levels correlate closely with synapse numbers and are commonly used to assay for loss of synapses (5Tiraboschi P. Hansen L.A. Alford M. Masliah E. Thal L.J. Corey-Bloom J. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Sabbagh M.N. Corey-Bloom J. Tiraboschi P. Thomas R. Masliah E. Thal L.J. Arch. Neurol. 1999; 56: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no changes in the levels of dynamin 3, a dynamin isoform also expressed in the nervous system, were detected in Aβ-treated neurons when compared with untreated controls. Interestingly, in addition to the changes in dynamin 1 levels described above, a second smaller dynamin 1 immunoreactive band (∼90 kDa) was detected in the Aβ-treated neurons (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with preaggregated Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 1B). All experiments described below were performed with Aβ-(1-40). To determine whether Aβ induced the decrease of dynamin levels in a dose-dependent manner, mature hippocampal neurons were incubated with Aβ at final concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 20 μm for 36 h. The content of dynamin 1, 2, and 3, as well as synaptophysin in whole cell lysates was determined by means of Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, C and D). Our results showed a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of dynamin 1 and 2, but not of dynamin 3, in Aβ-treated neurons as compared with untreated controls. However, synaptophysin levels were unchanged when cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with Aβ at concentrations below 20 μm. These results suggested that synapse numbers were not affected at these lower concentrations. On the other hand, the appearance of the ∼90-kDa dynamin 1 immunoreactive band was evident in cell extracts prepared from hippocampal neurons cultured in the presence of Aβ at all of the concentrations analyzed (Fig. 1C). Next, we determined whether Aβ affects dynamin levels in a time-dependent manner. For these experiments, hippocampal neurons kept in culture for 3 weeks were incubated with Aβ (2 μm) for up to 36 h (Fig. 1, E and F). The effect of Aβ on dynamin 1 and 2 levels was evident as early as 8 h after the addition of the peptide. In contrast, no changes in dynamin 3 and synaptophysin levels were detected throughout the time period analyzed (Fig. 1, C and E). Because the aggregation state of Aβ has been proposed to play a critical role in its neurotoxic effects, we next determined which form of the Aβ peptide was causing these effects on dynamin 1. The preaggregated Aβ preparation likely contained both large insoluble fibrillar forms and smaller soluble oligomeric forms of the peptide. Therefore, we separated these two forms of Aβ by centrifugation. To determine whether we had successfully separated the fibrillar Aβ from the oligomeric Aβ, we immunostained each fraction with an Aβ antibody. The aggregated, pre-centrifuged preparation, termed “mixed,” showed large globular immunoreactive aggregates along with smaller species (Fig. 2A). Following centrifugation, the oligomeric fraction showed numerous small spherical immunoreactive species, while the fibrillar fraction showed mainly large globular aggregates (Fig. 2A). To test whether these separate forms of Aβ had different effects on dynamin 1, we incubated cultured hippocampal neurons with the monomeric, mixed, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of Aβ (2 μm each) for 24 h. Western blot analysis showed a decrease in dynamin 1 levels only in whole cell extracts obtained from hippocampal neurons incubated with the mixed and oligomeric forms of Aβ (Fig. 2, B and C). We also observed the appearance of the ∼90-kDa band in the mixed and oligomeric preparations only (Fig. 2B). Treatment with Aβ also altered the distribution of dynamin 1 in mature hippocampal neurons. In untreated neurons, dynamin 1 was highly enriched in the cell bodies. In addition, robust dynamin 1 punctate immunostaining was detected along the processes extended by these pyramidal neurons (Fig. 3A). Synaptophysin staining appeared in a typical punctuate pattern distributed along the processes (Fig. 3B). Most dynamin 1 immunoreactive spots co-localized with synaptophysin at synaptic sites (Fig. 3, C and D). However, dynamin 1 immunoreactivity was also detected in extrasynaptic areas. The incubation of hippocampal neurons with Aβ (2 μm) for 24 h affected neither the morphology nor the distribution of synaptophysin staining (Fig. 3F). In contrast, dynamin 1 immunoreactivity was greatly decreased throughout the neuritic network and was mainly restricted to the cell body and adjacent regions of the processes extended by Aβ-treated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3E). As a consequence, synaptophysin immunoreactivity did not co-localize with that of dynamin 1 in distal neurites (Fig. 3, G and H). Quantitative analysis of the dynamin 1 and synaptophysin immunoreactive puncta showed a similar number of spots detected by each antibody in untreated controls (726 ± 127 dynamin 1 and 651 ± 52 synaptophysin). On the other hand, a significant decrease in the number of dynamin 1 (204 ± 146) puncta, but not synaptophysin (706 ± 165) puncta, was detected in Aβ-treated neurons. These data suggested that Aβ severely depleted levels of dynamin 1 in the synapses present along the distal portion of the neurites extended by hippocampal neurons. Aβ Induced Dynamin 1 Reduction by a Bimodal Mechanism—We then determined to what extent post-translational degradation and/or down-regulation of the expression of dynamin 1 contributed to the Aβ-induced decrease in its protein levels observed in cultured hippocampal neurons. The results described previously showing the appearance of a second lower molecular mass immunoreactive band in Aβ-treated neurons strongly suggested that a post-translational proteolytic event was involved in the decrease of dynamin 1 levels. Two proteases proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD are caspase-3 and calpain (23Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 24Tsuji T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Shimizu K. Neurosci.

Therefore, we first tested the ability of these proteases to cleave dynamin 1 in vitro (Fig. 4A). Whole cell lysates prepared from untreated cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant caspase-3 or calpain. Caspase-3 failed to cleave dynamin 1 at any of the concentrations used in our in vitro assays. On the other hand, Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent decrease of full-length dynamin 1 when incubated with calpain. In addition, recombinant calpain cleavage generated a second dynamin 1 band similar to the one detected when hippocampal neurons were incubated with Aβ (Fig. 4A). To further determine whether Aβ could induce the proteolysis of dynamin 1 in hippocampal neurons, we treated the neurons with several cell-permeable inhibitors of caspase-3 or calpain prior to Aβ incubation (Fig. 4B). The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone did not prevent the dynamin 1 decrease induced by Aβ. Conversely, three different calpain inhibitors, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucine-CHO, calpeptin, and MDL-28170 did block the cleavage of dynamin 1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Next, we investigated the effect of Aβ treatment on dynamin 1 expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. Neurons were incubated with Aβ (2 μm) for 8 and 24 h, and their RNA was harvested for RT-PCR. Conventional RT-PCR bands showed a qualitative decrease in dynamin 1 mRNA from cultured hippocampal neurons that were incubated with Aβ for 8 and 24 h (Fig. 4C). Real time RT-PCR showed a significant decrease of dynamin 1 mRNA from hippocampal neurons incubated in the presence of Aβ for 8 and 24 h as compared with untreated controls (∼50 and ∼48% decrease, respectively) (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggested that Aβ induced the decrease of dynamin 1 in cultured hippocampal neurons by a bimodal process involving both calpain-mediated proteolysis and a decrease in dynamin 1 expression. Decreased Dynamin 1 Levels Were Also Detected in the Hippocampus of Tg2576 Mice—Finally, we studied whether endogenous Aβ had similar affects on dynamin 1 in the AD animal model Tg2576. Tg2576 transgenic mice harbor a double mutation in the amyloid precursor protein that enhances production of the Aβ peptide (28Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). These mice recapitulate many characteristics of AD pathology, including Aβ plaque formation, beginning at 10-12 months of age (28Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cognitive deficits were detected as early as 4 months after birth in Tg2576 mice (29Ohno M. Sametsky E.A. Younkin L.H. Oakley H. Younkin S.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Disterhoft J.F. Neuron. 2004; 41: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, changes in the number of synapses were not detected even in 1-year-old Tg2576 mice (30King D.L. Arendash G.W. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Savage M.J. Lin Y.G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cognitive impairments observed in these mice in the absence of pathology suggested a discrete mechanism affecting neuronal function. Dynamin 1 might play a key role in such a mechanism. To examine this possibility, we compared dynamin 1 and synaptophysin protein levels in whole cell extracts prepared from the hippocampi of 2-, 5-, and 8-month-old Tg2576 mice with those of strain- and age-matched WT mice (Fig. 5). Dynamin 1 and synaptophysin levels were normalized using neuron-specific β-tubulin as an internal control. No differences in dynamin 1 protein levels were detected in the Tg2576 mice as compared with WT mice 2 months after birth (Fig. 5, A and C). On the other hand, beginning at 5 months of age, Tg2576 mice showed a significant decline (∼22%) in dynamin 1 levels. This declining trend in dynamin 1 levels continued at 8 months of age when Tg2576 mice show an even greater (∼36%) decrease in dynamin 1 levels when compared with WT mice. Importantly, no changes in synaptophysin protein levels were detected in the Tg2576 mice when compared with WT mice throughout the whole period analyzed (Fig. 5, B and D). These data indicated that a decrease in dynamin 1 protein occurred independently from synapse loss both in neurons that developed in culture and in situ. Decrease of Dynamin 1 in Tg2576 Mice Was Likely Due to Calpain Activation—Aβ-induced calpain activation resulted in the cleavage of dynamin 1 and the appearance of a fragment of ∼90 kDa in cultured hippocampal neurons. If calpain was abnormally activated in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice, we would expect to see a dynamin 1 fragment band at approximately the same molecular mass (∼90 kDa). No dynamin 1 cleaved bands were detected in the WT or 2-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 6A). By contrast, cleaved products were detected directly below full-length dynamin 1 in 5- and 8-month-old Tg2576 mice. To test whether calpain was responsible for generating this faster migrating dynamin 1 band, we incubated hippocampal lysates obtained from 2-month-old Tg2576 mice with calpain for 1 h. Western blot analysis showed the presence of a faster migrating dynamin 1 band in 2-month-old lysates incubated with calpain and untreated lysates from 8-month-old Tg2576 mice. On the other hand, no such cleaved fragment was detected in untreated lysates obtained from 2-month-old mice (Fig. 6B). To further assess calpain activation in the hippocampus of these mice, we analyzed the degradation of spectrin, a common calpain substrate (32Siman R. Baudry M. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3572-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Activation of calpain results in the"

Altered membrane properties are the consequence of the interaction of a group of exported malaria proteins with host cell membrane proteins. KAHRP (the knob-associated histidine-rich protein), a member of this group, has been shown to interact with erythrocyte membrane skeletal protein spectrin. However, the molecular basis for this interaction has yet to be defined. In the present study, we defined the binding motifs in both KAHRP and spectrin and identified a functional role for this interaction. We showed that spectrin bound to a 72-amino-acid KAHRP fragment (residues 370-441). Among nine-spectrin fragments, which encompass the entire α and β spectrin molecules (four α spectrin and five β spectrin fragments), KAHRP bound only to one, the α N-5 fragment. The KAHRP-binding site within the α N-5 fragment was localized uniquely to repeat 4. The interaction of full-length spectrin dimer to KAHRP was inhibited by repeat 4 of α spectrin. Importantly, resealing of this repeat peptide into erythrocytes mislocalized KAHRP in the parasitized cells. We concluded that the interaction of KAHRP with spectrin is critical for appropriate membrane localization of KAHRP in parasitized erythrocytes. As the presence of KAHRP at the erythrocyte membrane is necessary for cytoadherence in vivo, our findings have implications for the development of new therapies for mitigating the severity of malaria infection.

Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious parasitic disease of humans. Clinical symptoms occur during the asexual stage of the life cycle of the parasites, at which time it multiplies within the human erythrocyte. During intraerythrocytic growth, the parasite extensively modifies the host erythrocyte resulting in alterations of morphology, mechanical properties, and adhesive properties. It is generally believed that almost all the altered properties of parasitized erythrocytes are because of the action of a group of parasite proteins that become associated with erythrocyte membrane proteins (see Refs. 1Cooke B.M.

It interacts with erythrocyte skeletal proteins such as spectrin, actin, and ankyrin (7Oh S.S Voigt S. Fisher D. Yi S.J. LeRoy P.J. Derick L.H. Liu S. Chishti A.H. Mol. Biochem.

Warrell D.A. Am J Pathol. 1985; 119: 385-401PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of the KAHRP protein at the erythrocyte membrane leads to a weakening of the interaction between PfEMP1 and the vascular endothelium at physiologic shear stresses (6Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M.

This decreased avidity of the interaction in the absence of KAHRP can mitigate the severity of vascular obstruction and hence complications of cerebral malaria. In contrast, little is known regarding the functional implication of KAHRP-skeletal protein interactions. Spectrin is a major component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton and plays a key role in maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity and mechanical stability (12Mohandas N. Evans E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 787-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It is composed of two subunits, an α spectrin (280 kDa) chain and a β spectrin (246 kDa) chain, both being made up of repeating units (the α spectrin chain has 21, and the β spectrin has 16) flanked by non-consensus structures. Each repeat is composed of ∼106 amino acids and folds into a left-handed, antiparallel triplehelical coiled coil structure. The α spectrin and the β spectrin associate side to side in an antiparallel orientation to form heterodimers. Spectrin heterodimers then self-associate head to head to form spectrin tetramer, which exists as an elongated molecule with a contour length of 200 nm (see Refs. 13De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 14Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar for recent reviews). The function of terminal regions of spectrin chains has been well defined.

However, the function of spectrin repeats, which make up the bulk of a spectrin molecule, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified the binding site for spectrin in KAHRP and the reciprocal KAHRP-binding site in spectrin. We showed that spectrin bound to a specific region of KAHRP (residues 370-441) and that this region of KAHRP specifically bound to a single repeat of α spectrin (repeat 4, αR4). Furthermore, resealing of the αR4 polypeptide into erythrocytes prior to infection by malarial parasites prevented the membrane association of KAHRP. These findings enabled us to identify an important functional role for the interaction between KAHRP and spectrin in localizing KAHRP to the membrane of the infected erythrocytes.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated from the tryptophan and tyrosine contents, taking the molar extinction coefficients of these amino acids at 280 nm as 5500 and 1340, respectively (21Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). All the proteins were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 230,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C before use. Pull-down Assays—For GST pull-down assay, GST-tagged recombinant polypeptides were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were pelleted and washed. Binding partner was added to the coupled beads in a final volume of 80 μl. The final concentration of the coupled protein was 1 μm. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, pelleted, washed, and eluted with 10% SDS. The pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The binding of full-length spectrin to KAHRP fragments was detected by Western blot using anti-spectrin antibody, and similarly the binding of His-tagged KAHRP fragments to GST-tagged recombinant spectrin fragments was detected by Western blot using anti-His antibody. GST was used as negative control in all experiments. For His pull down, the procedure was basically the same except that the His-tagged protein was coupled to nickel beads. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—Surface plasmon resonance assay was performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument. His-tagged KAHRP polypeptide (K2 or K2a+b) was covalently coupled to a CM-5 biosensor chip using an amino coupling kit. Binding reactions were done in HBS-EP buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20. The surface was regenerated before each new injection using 50 mm NaOH. The BIAcore instrument was programmed to perform a series of binding assays with increasing concentrations of αN-5 or αR4 polypeptide over the same regenerated surface. Sensograms (plots of changes in response unit on the surface as a function of time) derived were analyzed using the software BIAeval 3.0. Affinity constants were estimated by curve fitting using a 1:1 binding model. Resealing of Erythrocytes—To introduce recombinantly expressed proteins into erythrocytes, the washed erythrocytes were lysed and resealed using the dialysis method (22Dluzewski A.R. Rangachari K. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. Parasitology. 1983; 87: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of packed erythrocytes (in a dialysis tube, in the absence or presence of desired polypeptides) at a 50% hematocrit were dialyzed against 500 ml of cold hypotonic buffer (5 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl) for 80 min at cold. The isotonicity was restored, and erythrocytes were resealed by dialyzing the lysed cells against 500 ml of prewarmed isotonic buffer (5 mm KPO4, 160 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose) for 60 min at 37 °C. Invasion of Erythrocytes by Malaria Parasites—The 3D7 clone parasite was maintained using standard procedures in RPMI 1640 medium (23Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar). Sorbitol synchronization of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes was performed as described before (24Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Marsh K. Eidelman O. Howard R.J. Parasitology. 1986; 92: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The synchronized infected cells were purified by Percoll gradient purification to nearly 100% purity (25Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The fraction containing mature trophozoite-infected erythrocytes was added to resealed erythrocytes at a starting parasitemia of 2%. The cells were cultured using standard procedures in RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. At the end of the culture, the infected erythrocytes were separated by Percoll gradient, and the purified late stage infected cells were examined by confocal microscopy. Confocal Microscopy—Preparation of erythrocytes for immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (26Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, Percoll gradient purified late stage infected erythrocytes were washed twice in PBS containing 5 mm glucose and then fixed for 5 min in 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine (rinsing buffer) plus 0.1% Triton-100 for 5 min followed by three rinses using rinsing buffer. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation for at least 60 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.05 mm glycine, 0.2% fish skin gelatin, and 0.05% sodium azide). Staining of fixed, permeabilized cells was performed using anti-KAHRP antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After labeling, cells were resuspended in PBS and allowed to attach to cover slips coated with polylysine. The cover slips were mounted using Aqua-Mount medium. Samples were imaged with Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope using 63× oil object. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE of samples (15 μl of each) was performed on a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking for 1 h in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk), the blot was probed for 1 h with the desired primary antibody (polyclonal anti-spectrin antibody or monoclonal anti-His antibody). After several washes, the blot was incubated with anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) IgG coupled to HRP. After final washes, the blot was developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit. All steps were performed at room temperature. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—A schematic representation of the various spectrin and KAHRP fragments used in the present study are illustrated in Figs. 1A and 2A, respectively. All spectrin fragments and spectrin single repeats were cloned into pGEX-4T-2 protein expression vector (20An X. Guo X. Sum H. Morrow J. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To detect by Western blotting the binding of KAHRP fragments to GST-tagged spectrin fragments using anti-His antibody, we constructed His-tagged K2 and K2a+b fragments from previously described GST-tagged KAHRP fragments (9Waller K.L. Cooke B.M. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23808-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). At 16 °C, all recombinant proteins are well expressed and soluble. The purity of various GST-spectrin fusion proteins and GST-tagged KAHRP, as well as His-tagged KAHRP fragments, used in the present study are shown in Figs. 1, B and C and 2B, respectively.Fig. 2Schematic representation (A) and SDS-PAGE of recombinant KAHRP fragments (B). The P. falciparum KAHRP gene contains two exons separated by an intron. The first exon encodes a putative signal sequence, and the second exon contains three repeat regions as indicated. Amino acid residue numbers and the lengths of fragments are indicated. GST-tagged KAHRP fragments were run in 10% SDS-PAGE and His-tagged KAHRP fragments were run in 15% SDS-PAGE.

As shown in Fig. 3A, under the binding conditions used in these experiments only the GST-tagged K2 fragment was able to pull down the spectrin dimer. Spectrin dimer did not bind to GST, GST-tagged K1, or K3 fragments. To further define the spectrin binding region in K2 fragment, the binding of spectrin dimer to subfragments of K2, K2A, and K2B, was examined. Interestingly, neither of them had the ability to bind spectrin dimer (Fig. 3B). Based on this finding, we reasoned that the spectrin-binding site in K2 fragment probably requires the C-terminal part of K2A and N-terminal part of K2B. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a fragment designated K2a+b, which is composed of 36 amino acids from the C-terminal of K2A and 36 amino acids from the N-terminal of K2B. As shown in Fig. 3B, in contrast to K2A and K2B, K2a+b did bind spectrin dimer. Thus, we localized a distinct spectrin-binding site in KAHRP to a 72-amino-acid region. This finding is in agreement with a previous report, which localized the spectrin-binding site in KAHRP to a much larger 271-amino-acid region that encompasses the domain we identified (27Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mapping the KAHRP-binding Site in Spectrin—The same experimental approach was used to identify the KAHRP-binding site in the spectrin chains. Nine recombinant GST-tagged spectrin fragments encompassing the entire α and β spectrin chains were purified, and the binding of His-tagged K2 and His-tagged K2a+b to these fragments was examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, the His-tagged K2 fragment bound specifically to only one α spectrin fragment, αN-5 but not to any of the other eight spectrin fragments or to GST. Among the various structural elements that constitute the αN-5 fragment, K2 specifically bound to one single repeat, αR4 (Fig. 4B). The K2a+b fragment exhibited the same behavior as the K2 fragment in that it specifically bound only the αN-5 fragment and the single repeat, αIR4 (data not shown). Thus among the 37 repeats of α and β spectrin, we have localized the KAHRP-binding site on spectrin to one single repeat, αR4. Interactions between KAHRP Fragments and Spectrin Fragments as Assessed by Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—To further confirm and characterize the interactions between KAHPR fragments and spectrin polypeptides, real-time plasmon resonance assays were performed. In these experiments, His-tagged KAHRP fragment (K2 or K2a+b) was immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip, and the binding of GST-tagged spectrin polypeptide (αN-5 or αR4) was assessed. In agreement with the pull-down assay data, GST-αN-5 and GST-αR4 bound to the immobilized K2 fragment, whereas GST itself did not show any detectable binding (Fig. 5A). The dose-dependent binding of αN-5 to K2 is shown in Fig. 5B. Table I summarizes the characteristics of interactions between spectrin polypeptides (αN-5, αR4) and KAHRP fragments (K2, K2a+b). The binding affinities of all of these interactions are in the micromolar range, values comparable with those reported previously for various other protein-protein interactions in normal and infected erythrocytes (2Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 50: 1-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Table IKinetic analysis of interactions between KAHRP fragments and spectrin fragmentsK2K2a+bKonKoffKDKonKoffKDs−1m−1 s−1ms−1m−1 s−1mαN-57611.37 × 10−31.8 × 10−62234.78 × 10−42.1 × 10−6αR44177.12 × 10−41.7 × 10−62651.02 × 10−33.8 × 10−6 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Full-length Spectrin Binding to K2 Fragment by the Single Spectrin Repeat, αR4—To confirm the specificity of the interaction between the single spectrin repeat αR4 and KAHRP, we performed a competitive inhibition assay. In this experiment, the K2 fragment was preincubated with various concentrations of αR4 prior to the addition of the full-length spectrin dimer. As shown in Fig. 6, the binding of spectrin dimer to the K2 fragment was decreased with progressively increasing concentrations of αR4. At a concentration of 1 μm αR4, spectrin binding to KAHRP was inhibited by 50%. Effect of αR4 on KAHRP Distribution and Localization in Infected Erythrocytes—To examine the functional implication of KAHRP-spectrin interaction, we examined the localization of KAHRP in infected erythrocytes that were resealed with excess amount of αR4 polypeptide prior to infection with P. falciparum parasites. It was anticipated that the exogenously added αR4 polypeptide would compete with native membrane-associated spectrin for interaction with KAHRP, which is expressed in the later stages of malaria infection. The location and distribution of KAHRP in the infected erythrocytes was monitored following 48 h of culture. As shown in Fig. 7A, KAHRP localized at the membrane in erythrocytes resealed with no added polypeptide as described previously (28Taylor D.W. Parra M. Chapman G.B. Stearns M.E. Rener J. Aikawa M. Uni S. Aley S.B. Panton L.J. Howard R.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 25: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Magowan C. Coppel R.L. Lau A.O. Moronne M.M. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3196-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A very similar localization of KAHRP was seen in erythrocytes resealed with GST prior to infection (Fig. 7B). Strikingly, in erythrocytes resealed with GST-αR4, KAHRP was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of infected erythrocytes (Fig. 7C). Uninfected erythrocytes did not show any staining with anti-KAHRP antibody (data not shown). In the present study, we performed a detailed molecular characterization of the interaction between the P. falciparum-encoded protein, KAHRP, and erythrocyte membrane skeletal protein, spectrin. A surprising feature of our finding is that only one unique repeat of α spectrin bound KAHRP. Importantly, when this spectrin repeat was resealed into erythrocytes it blocked the membrane assembly of KAHRP in infected erythrocytes. This finding implies that spectrin plays a key role in localizing KAHRP at the membrane of infected erythrocytes. Knob-like, electron-dense protrusions located at the membrane surface of infected erythrocytes are localized at the points of adhesive interaction between infected erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells (30Berendt A.R. Ferguson D.J.P. Gardner J. Turner G. Rowe A. McCormick C. Roberts D. Craig A. Pinches R. Elford B.C. Newbold C.I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S19-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). KAHRP is associated with these knob-like structures. Although PfEMP1, the adhesive receptor expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes is the mediator of adhesive interactions, KAHRP plays an important role in modulating the avidity of these interactions, presumably by clustering the receptors. Strong support for this thesis comes from the finding that in the absence of KAHRP, infected erythrocytes adhere very weakly to endothelial cells under physiological flow conditions (6Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As adherence of infected erythrocytes to vascular endothelium is a major determinant of the pathogenicity of P. falciparum (11MacPherson G.G. Warrell M.J. White N.J. Looareesuwan S. Warrell D.A. Am J Pathol. 1985; 119: 385-401PubMed Google Scholar), reducing or eliminating adhesive interactions by interfering with the interaction of KAHRP with α spectrin is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent serious complications of P. falciparum malaria. Previous studies have identified interactions between a number of parasite proteins including RESA (31Foley M. Tilley L. Sawyer W.H. Anders R.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Da Silva E. Foley M. Dluzewski A.R. Murray L.J. Anders R.F. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem.

Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and erythrocyte membrane proteins. Two recent studies have suggested that over 400 parasite-encoded proteins are exported into erythrocyte cytoplasm (36Hiller N.L Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K. Science. 2004; 306: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 37Marti M. Good R.T. Rug M. Knuepfer E. Cowman A.F. Science. 2004; 306: 1930-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), and a number of these are likely to interact with membrane proteins. Most studies, to date, on the interactions of parasite proteins with erythrocyte membrane proteins have focused on defining the domains in malaria proteins that participate in these interactions. For example, the 4.1R-binding site in MESA has been localized to 19 residues located in the N-terminal region of MESA (35Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15299-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The spectrin-binding domain in RESA has been mapped to a 48-residue region (33Foley M. Corcoran L. Tilley L. Anders R. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the spectrin-binding domain in MSP-1 has been localized to a 30-residue region (34Herrera S. Rudin W. Herrera M. Clavijo P. Mancilla L. de Plata C. Matile H. Certa U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A unique feature of many malaria proteins is the presence of extensive regions of tandemly repeated sequences (38Anders R.F. Barzara N. Shi P.T. Scanlon D.B. Brown L.E. Thomas L.M. Brown G.V. Stahl H.D. Coppel R.L. Kemp D.J. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 42: 333-342Google Scholar). The functional role of these repeats is not clear. It is interesting to note that the binding regions of MESA, RESA and MSP-1 mentioned above are all found in non-repetitive domains (33Foley M. Corcoran L. Tilley L. Anders R. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Herrera S. Rudin W. Herrera M. Clavijo P. Mancilla L. de Plata C. Matile H. Certa U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15299-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previous work that mapped the spectrin-binding domain of KAHRP to a 271-residue region (27Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this region contained the 5′-repeat. However, in the present study we found that K2A, which is composed of the complete 5′-repeat and 21 amino acids downstream of this 5′-repeat sequence did not bind spectrin. This suggests that the repeat sequence in KAHRP is not involved in KAHRP binding to spectrin. The binding site of some sporozoite proteins for hepatocytes has also been mapped to non-repetitive regions (39Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 40Muller H.M. Reckmann I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the repeat sequences of parasite proteins are probably not involved in association of malaria proteins with host proteins. Another common feature of binding motifs in malaria proteins for erythrocyte skeleton proteins is the relatively short length of these sequences. This reliance on short linear sequences may arise from the necessity of the exported malaria protein to interact with a preexisting network of proteins. However, the above considerations may not be relevant for malarial protein-protein interactions, as multiple binding regions in KAHRP have been identified to interact with PfEMP1, and the binding regions do contain repetitive sequence (41Waller K.L. Nunomura W. An X. Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to our detailed understanding of the binding motifs on malaria proteins much less is known regarding the binding motifs on host cell proteins. To date, only the MESA-binding site on 4.1R has been mapped to a 51-residue region encoded by exon 10 of the 4.1R gene (39Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Spectrin is a long, rod-like molecule with a contour length of 200 nm. It has been traditionally thought that the major function of spectrin is to provide the structural basis for the flexibility of erythrocyte membranes because of its unique repetitive triple α-helical structure. The successful localization of the KAHRP binding region to a single repeat (of 37 repeats) of spectrin highlights the specificity of KAHRP-spectrin interaction. In fact, this is the first demonstration that a specific spectrin repeat could serve as a docking site for malaria proteins in infected erythrocytes. This finding further implies that spectrin may serve as a scaffold for assembly of malarial proteins in infected erythrocytes. The most striking outcome of this study is the observation that resealing of αR4 polypeptide into erythrocytes alters the localization of KAHRP in infected cells. This is probably because of the failure of interaction of KAHRP with membrane-associated spectrin in the presence of excess amount of the competitive polypeptide αR4. Thus, binding of KAHRP to spectrin is required for its assembly onto the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. These findings suggest that molecules that are able to block the binding of KAHRP (or other malaria proteins) to spectrin (or other red cell membrane skeleton proteins) could provide a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate the severity of malaria."

Here we show that pol λ null mouse fibroblasts are hypersensitive to oxidative DNA damaging agents, suggesting a role of pol λ in protection of cells against the cytotoxic effects of oxidized DNA. Additionally, pol λ co-immunoprecipitates with an oxidized base DNA glycosylase, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1), and localizes to oxidative DNA lesions in situ. From these data, we conclude that pol λ protects cells against oxidative stress and suggest that it participates in oxidative DNA damage base excision repair.

Mammalian cells express a large number of DNA polymerases that are considered to differ from one another according to specialized roles in DNA replication, repair, and other essential DNA transactions such as somatic hypermutation (1Shcherbakova P.V. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; (Feb. 26;2003(8)): RE3PubMed Google Scholar). Although these enzymes, numbering over two dozen, catalyze a similar chemical reaction, they differ in primary structure and in features of catalytic specificity as measured in vitro (2Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).

For example, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells that are deficient in pol β are hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effects of DNA alkylating agents (6Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and this step is known to be important for alkylating agent-induced cytoxicity in MEFs (9Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase λ is a single polypeptide enzyme consisting of two overall domains, the N-terminal and the C-terminal (10García-Díaz M. Domínguez O. López-Fernández L.A. de Lera L.T. Saníger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M. García-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 32Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A. Faili A. Bertocci B. Storck S. Delbos F. Cocea L. Gupta N. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is similar in size, structure, and enzymatic composition to pol β, including capacity for gap-filling synthesis and deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity on a BER substrate. It has also been shown that pol λ is able to conduct uracil-initiated BER in extracts of MEFs (11Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18469-18475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as well as in assays where BER is reconstituted with purified enzymes (12García-Díaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there appears to be no requirement for pol λ in the MEF cellular response to DNA alkylating agents, since cells deficient in pol λ showed no hypersensitivity to these agents (13Kobayashi Y. Watanabe M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Takai H. Nakanishi M. Kawase Y. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of pol λ in the cellular BER response to DNA damage is still unclear. Another important feature of pol λ is that it has been implicated in double-strand break repair in mammalian cell extracts (14Lee J.W. Blanco L. Zhou T. García-Díaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wang Z. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), whereas pol β has not. Genetic studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol IV first implicated a pol λ like enzyme in double-strand break repair (15Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Leem S.H. Ropp P.A. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet, a similar role in living mammalian cells remains to be confirmed. Finally, the N-terminal domain of pol λ carries no known enzymatic activity; however, this domain contains a BRCT motif that may be involved in targeting the enzyme through protein-protein interactions (10García-Díaz M. Domínguez O. López-Fernández L.A. de Lera L.T. Saníger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M. García-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we further examined the role of pol λ in cellular protection against oxidative DNA damage. DNA lesions such a 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmUra) and 8-oxoguanine are produced by oxidative stress agents (17Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rodriguez H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and are repaired mainly by the BER pathway. We report here that MEFs with a pol λ gene deletion are hypersensitive to the oxidative stress agent H2O2 and are even more hypersensitive to the introduction of hmUra into genomic DNA. DNA polymerase λ was found to localize to sites of oxidative damage by in situ analysis of cells, and the requirements for pol λ localization to damage/repair sites was examined. Cell Lines—Pol β+/+ and pol β-/- MEF cells were cultured as described previously (6Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). XRCC1+/+ and XRCC1-/- MEFs were a generous gift from Dr. Robert Tebbs (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA) and were grown at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium-low glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (18Tebbs R.S. Flannery M.L. Meneses J.J. Hartmann A. Tucker J.D. Thompson L.H. Cleaver J.E. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Transformed pol λ+/+ and pol λ-/- MEFs were generated and cultured as previously described (11Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18469-18475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Bertocci B. De Smet A. Flatter E. Dahan A. Bories J.C. Landreau C. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and primary MEFs were prepared as described (19Robertson E.J. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach (Practical Approach Series). IRL Press Limited, Oxford, Great Britain1987: 71-112Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—The plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN was modified from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by deletion of the original NotI site and introduction of Xho-EcoRV-NotI site between the BglII and AgeI sites at the multiple cloning site. The plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN, containing full-length pol λ (cloned between the XhoI and NotI sites of pEGFP-N1-dN-XN-pol λ), was constructed similarly to the method previously described (20Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The BRCT domain of pol λ, pol λ-BRCT1–174, encoding Met1 to Arg174, was prepared by digesting the plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN-pol λ with XhoI and StuI. The resulting fragment was purified and introduced into the plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN between the XhoI and EcoRV sites. The polymerase domain of pol λ, pol λ-POL242–575 encoding Ala242 to Trp575, was amplified by the PCR from the plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN-pol λ. The PCR primers, 5′-GTCCTCGAGGCACAGCCCTCAAGCCAGAAGGCG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCCAGTCCCGCTCAGCAGGTTCTCG-3′, were designed to incorporate XhoI sites at both termini. The resulting PCR fragment was introduced into the plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN at the XhoI site. Each construct utilized the initiation codon (ATG) in Kozak sequences introduced in the host plasmid pEGFP-N1-dN-XN and was in-frame relative to EGFP at the C terminus of each protein. Single-strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) was cloned between the BglI and SalI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The pol λ siRNA expression vector was constructed as described previously (21Polosina Y.Y. Rosenquist T.A. Grollman A.P. Miller H. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pol λ siRNA expression vector was constructed as previously described (21Polosina Y.Y. Rosenquist T.A. Grollman A.P. Miller H. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Pairs of DNA oligonucleotides encoding hairpin RNAs were designed based on four different pol λ gene-specific targeted sequences (position on the pol λ gene is indicated in parentheses): 5′-ATTGAGCAGACGGTCCGGA-3′ (1259), 5′-GGGTTCCTCACAGATGACT-3′ (1439), 5′-GCTCTGGATAAATGGGTCT-3′ (779), and 5′-GGCAACTAACTACAATCTG-3′ (820). The 19-nucleotide target transcript sequence and its reverse complement were separated by a short spacer, and five thymidine residues were added as a termination signal. The resulting oligonucleotide duplex was cloned between the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pmH1P-pgkneo vector. Cell Sensitivity Assays—Cytotoxicity studies were performed as described previously (7Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The day after plating the cells at a density of 40,000 cells per well in 6-well dishes, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine (hmdUrd) (Sigma) for 24 h or H2O2 (Sigma) for 1 h, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and ultimately allowed to grow for 4–5 days in growth media at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator. Triplicate experiments for each concentration were counted using a cell lysis procedure (22Butler W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as the “percent control growth” ((number of cells after treatment with hmdUrd)/(number of control cells) × 100). siRNA Expression Vector Transfection and Clone Selection—The vectors for stable expression of siRNA against pol λ were transfected into pol β-/- MEFs and selected for antibiotic resistance as described previously (21Polosina Y.Y. Rosenquist T.A. Grollman A.P. Miller H. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells transformed with siRNAs against the target sequence 5′-GGGTTCCTCACAGATGACT-3′ demonstrated the lowest level of pol λ expression as determined by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR. From this pool of cells, three clones were isolated containing approximately a 60% reduction in pol λ expression that was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis. In parallel, pol β-/- MEFs were also transfected with the empty pmH1P-pgkneo vector as a negative control. Cell Extract Preparation—For Western blotting and in vitro BER assays, cell extracts were prepared as described previously (11Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18469-18475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, detached by scraping, pelleted, and resuspended in equal volumes of Buffer I, composed of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, and 1 complete mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science, Mannhein, Germany) per 2.5 ml Buffer I solution, and Buffer II composed of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resulting extracts were clarified by centrifugation. Supernatant fractions were recovered for use in Western blotting and in vitro BER assays after determining the protein concentration. For co-immunoprecipitation using cell extracts, pol λ+/+ and pol λ-/- MEFs were washed and harvested as described above. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mg/ml leupeptin) and processed as described previously (23Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was used for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Western Blotting —Cell extracts (30–50 μg) were suspended in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by 4–12% NuPAGE Novex BisTris PAGE (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Initially the membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with primary antibodies against pol λ. The filters were then washed with TBST and secondary peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was added. After three washes with TBST, enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect the peroxidase conjugate by exposure to x-ray film. In Vitro BER Assay—A 35-mer oligonucleotide containing a site-specific hmUra modification at position 18 of the following sequence was purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR): 5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGCCGXACGGATCCCCGGGTA-3′, where “X” denotes the position of the hmUra. This oligonucleotide was annealed to a complementary strand that contained a G opposite the hmUra lesion. In vitro BER time course reactions were performed by incubating this 35-base pair oligonucleotide duplex (250 nm) with 15 μg of MEF cell extracts at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7, 60 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. At the indicated times, 3-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed for analysis and BER products were measured as described previously (11Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18469-18475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In some cases, cell extracts were preincubated with either preimmune serum or a neutralizing antibody against pol λ for 30 min on ice and an additional 10 min at 25 °C prior to performing in vitro BER reactions. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Co-immunoprecipitation reactions with pol λ+/+ or pol λ-/- cell extracts were performed by mixing 1 mg of total extract protein and 0.7 mg of rabbit non-immune IgG, anti-pol λ polyclonal, or anti-SMUG1 polyclonal antibody. The protein-antibody mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 4 h and immunocomplexes were adsorbed onto TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG IP beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mg/ml leupeptin, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and heated for 5 min, and the soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% NuPAGE Novex BisTris PAGE. After transfer, proteins were detected as previously described using anti-SMUG1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-pol λ antibody (1:5000) as a primary probe and goat anti-rabbit IgG TrueBlot conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution) as a secondary antibody (23Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immobilized horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The nitrocellulose filter was then stripped by incubation in a buffer containing 6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1% (v/v) SDS for 30 min at 50 °C followed by two washes with TBST at room temperature. The presence of pol λ was confirmed by incubating the membrane with rabbit anti-pol λ polyclonal antibody. Similarly, the cell extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-SMUG1 polyclonal antibody to detect pol λ. After stripping the blot, the presence of SMUG1 was confirmed using anti-SMUG1 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of purified pol λ and SMUG1 proteins was performed in the presence of binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mg/ml leupeptin) as described previously (23Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An equimolar mixture of 1.5 μm pol λ or truncated pol λ and SMUG1 was combined with either anti-pol λ or anti-SMUG1 antibody and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 500 μl. Antibody-containing protein complexes were adsorbed onto TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG IP beads by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The beads were then washed with binding buffer containing protease inhibitors, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% NuPAGE Novex BisTris PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST and immunoblotting was performed with the appropriate antibody as described above. Microscopy and Laser-light Irradiation—HeLa, pol λ+/+, pol λ-/-, XRCC1+/+, or XRCC1-/- cells were plated on 60-mm glass-bottom dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish and transiently transfected with variants of the pEGFP-N1-dN-XN mammalian expression vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as a transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins were identified and a line for the path of the laser was drawn that spanned the width of the cell's nucleus. A 365- or 405-nm laser was focused through a 40× objective lens using a FV-500 confocal scanning laser microscopy system (Olympus, Tokyo) to irradiate the cell along this path and produce damage/repair sites. During irradiation, cells were covered with a chamber to prevent evaporation on a 37 °C heating plate. The mean intensity of each focus was obtained after subtraction of the background intensity in the irradiated cell. DNA Polymerase λ-/- Cells Are Hypersensitive to Oxidative DNA Damage-causing Agents—MEFs that are pol λ-deficient by virtue of homozygous gene deletion were examined for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. These pol λ null cells were not significantly more sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate than an isogenic wild-type line developed in parallel (data not shown). This is in contrast to the clear methylmethane sulfonate hypersensitivity observed with pol β null cells (6Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase λ null cells, however, exhibited slightly more hypersensitivity to H2O2 than pol β null cells (Fig. 1A). This observation encouraged us to examine the sensitivity of pol λ null and isogenic wild-type cells to hmdUrd. Use of this nucleoside allows introduction of a common oxidative base lesion into genomic DNA without exposing cells to an oxidative stress agent in the culture medium (24Kaufman E.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar): hmdUrd is taken up, converted into the 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate, and incorporated into genomic DNA during replication. The hmUra lesion appears to be innocuous unless BER is initiated by SMUG1, which recognizes hmUra in genomic DNA and removes it, initiating the BER process (25Boorstein R.J. Cummings Jr., A. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K. Ma Y. Neubert T.A. Brown S.M. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41991-41997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Boorstein R.J. Chiu L.N. Teebor G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that pol λ null cells were strongly hypersensitive to hmdUrd (Fig. 1B), and this effect was somewhat stronger than that observed previously with pol β null cells (7Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hmdUrd hypersensitivity of the pol λ null cells could be complemented by recombinant expression of mouse pol λ to a level similar to that found in the isogenic wild-type cell line (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, stable transfection of pol λ null cells with an expression vector for mouse pol λ and then selection of cells with resistance to hmdUrd allowed us to isolate two cell lines with an expression level of pol λ similar to that of wild-type cells. Analysis of these transfected cells revealed a protection by pol λ against hmdUrd-induced cytotoxicity, whereas cells transfected with an empty vector showed no such complementation (Fig. 1C). Additionally, in a series of experiments not shown, introduction of human pol λ into the pol λ null cells by expression vector transfection failed to produce any complementation of the hmdUrd hypersensitivity. Next, we explored siRNA-mediated down-regulation, an alternate approach toward developing a pol λ deficiency in MEFs. Since both pol β and pol λ appear to participate in repair of hmUra lesions in MEFs, we examined hmdUrd cytotoxicity in cells containing reduced expression of both these polymerases. For these experiments, pol β null MEFs were stably transfected with a pol λ-siRNA-producing vector. Two clonal cell lines were eventually obtained with ∼60% reduction in pol λ level (Fig. 1F), and the effect of this reduction in pol λ on hmdUrd sensitivity was examined. These pol λ knockdown cells were more sensitive to hmdUrd than were cells transformed in parallel with an empty vector and used as a negative control (Fig. 1E). We conclude from these results with MEFs that a deficiency in pol λ is associated with hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and to an oxidized base, hmUra, in genomic DNA. DNA Polymerase λ Mediates Repair of hmUra in Vitro— Earlier, we had shown that pol λ is capable of mediating a back-up role to pol β in MEF extract mediated BER of uracil-DNA (11Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18469-18475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In view of the results on hmdUrd hypersensitivity described above, we wished to verify that pol λ is able to perform extract mediated BER of hmUra-DNA. Results of BER assays with cell extracts and an oligonucleotide DNA substrate carrying the hmUra lesion are shown in Fig. 2. DNA polymerase λ was capable of a role in extract mediated BER as revealed by pol λ null cell extracts when compared with wild-type cell extracts (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, pol λ was able to mediate repair in an extract from pol β null cells, as revealed by antibody inhibition (Fig. 2C). Finally, using a BER system reconstituted with purified human SMUG1, APE, pol λ or pol β, and DNA ligase I, we found robust repair of the hmUra containing substrate in reactions with either polymerase (Fig. 2D). This was reminiscent of earlier work by others (12García-Díaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) showing that purified pol λ is able to mediate BER of uracil-DNA. DNA Polymerase λ Co-immunoprecipitates with SMUG1—In light of the dependence on pol λ for cellular resistance to hmdUrd, we wished to explore the possibility that pol λ and the DNA glycosylase for hmUra-DNA, SMUG1, may cooperate through a protein-protein interaction. Results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified SMUG1 and pol λ are shown in Fig. 3. Initially, we examined an extract from pol λ+/+ MEFs to see if co-immunoprecipitation of pol λ and SMUG1 could be observed. Both enzymes were co-immunoprecipitated with the respective antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine whether pol λ and SMUG1 directly interact with each other, these precipitation reactions were repeated with purified pol λ and SMUG1 protein. SMUG1 was co-precipitated with antibody to pol λ (Fig. 3C) and conversely the antibody to SMUG1 co-precipitated pol λ (Fig. 3D). Negative controls in these experiments failed to reveal any nonspecific precipitation of either protein. Since the BRCT domain of pol λ has been hypothesized to participate in protein-protein interactions, we evaluated whether this domain was responsible for the interaction between SMUG1 and pol λ. As seen in Figs. 3E and F, a truncated version of pol λ lacking the BRCT domain co-precipitated with SMUG1 when an antibody against pol λ was used. The inverse precipitation reaction using SMUG1 antibody also co-precipitated these proteins. We conclude from these experiments that pol λ and SMUG1 directly interact allowing the enzymes to be co-immunoprecipitated, either from wild-type cell extract or a mixture of purified enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2021283626,"P2X1 receptors for ATP are ligand-gated cation channels expressed on a range of smooth muscle preparations and blood platelets. The receptors appear to be clustered close to sympathetic nerve varicosities and mediate the underlying membrane potential changes and constriction following nerve stimulation in a range of arteries and resistance arterioles. In this study we have used discontinuous sucrose density gradients, Western blot analysis, and cholesterol measurements to show that recombinant and smooth muscle (rat tail artery, vas deferens, and bladder) P2X1 receptors are present in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and co-localize with the lipid raft markers flotillin-1 and -2. Lipid rafts are specialized lipid membrane microdomains involved in signaling and trafficking. To determine whether lipid raft association was essential for P2X1 receptor channel function we used the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (10 mm for 1 h). This led to a redistribution of the P2X1 receptor throughout the sucrose gradient and reduced P2X1 receptor-mediated (α,β-methylene ATP, 10 μm) currents in HEK293 cells by >90% and contractions of the rat tail artery by ∼50%. However contractions evoked by potassium chloride (60 mm) were unaffected by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and the inactive analogue α-cyclodextrin had no effect on P2X1 receptor-mediated currents or contractions. P2X1 receptors are subject to ongoing regulation by receptors and kinases, and the present results suggest that lipid rafts are an essential component in the maintenance of these localized signaling domains and play an important role in P2X1 receptor-mediated control of arteries.

However contractions evoked by potassium chloride (60 mm) were unaffected by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and the inactive analogue α-cyclodextrin had no effect on P2X1 receptor-mediated currents or contractions. P2X1 receptors are subject to ongoing regulation by receptors and kinases, and the present results suggest that lipid rafts are an essential component in the maintenance of these localized signaling domains and play an important role in P2X1 receptor-mediated control of arteries. ATP released from nerves following tissue damage or shear stress acts at P2 receptors to regulate cardiovascular function (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). P2 receptors are divided into ligand-gated P2X receptor channels and G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors. P2X receptor-mediated vasoconstriction has been described in a range of arteries in the periphery (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar) and in the brain (2Lewis C.J. Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sympathetic nerves co-store and co-release ATP and noradrenaline, and the relative contribution of purinergic and noradrenergic mechanisms to vasoconstriction is dependent on the size of the vessel and the parameters of stimulation (3Evans R.J. Cunnane T.C. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 345: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Gitterman D.P. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The P2X receptor-mediated component predominates in small diameter arteries (4Gitterman D.P. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Ramme D. Regenold J.T. Starke K. Busse R. Illes P. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1987; 336: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and in submucosal resistance arterioles P2X receptor activation is solely responsible for sympathetic neurogenic vasoconstriction with noradrenaline acting through presynaptic mechanisms to regulate transmitter release (6Evans R.J. Surprenant A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition P2X receptor channels in smooth muscle are permeant to calcium (∼10% of current flowing through the channel under physiological conditions, Refs. 7Benham C.D. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1987; 328: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar and 8Benham C.D. J. Physiol. 1989; 419: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and a substantial component of the calcium required for contraction enters by this route (4Gitterman D.P. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Lamont C. Wier W.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P2X receptors therefore provide a mechanism for sympathetic nerve-mediated regulation of vascular tone that is resistant to α-adrenoreceptor and calcium channel antagonists. Seven P2X receptor subunits have been identified (P2X1–7), and these can assemble as homo- and heterotrimeric receptors with a range of properties (10North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The characteristic features of artery smooth muscle P2X receptors; (i) sensitivity to the ATP analogues: α,β-methylene and l-β,γ-methylene ATP, and (ii) responses that desensitize during agonist application, are consistent with the expression of P2X1 receptor subunits. In arterial smooth muscle the P2X1 receptor is the dominant isoform, and P2X receptor-mediated responses are abolished in arteries from P2X1 receptor-deficient mice (11Vial C. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Inscho E.W. Cook A.K. Imig J.D. Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Studies with these P2X1 receptor-deficient mice have established a role for these receptors in sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction (11Vial C. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and autoregulation of blood flow in the kidney (12Inscho E.W. Cook A.K. Imig J.D. Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Inscho E.W. Cook A.K. Imig J.D. Vial C. Evans R.J. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 2004; 181: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The level of P2X1 receptors can be regulated by congestive heart failure (14Malmsjo M. Bergdahl A. Moller S. Zhao X.-H. Sun X.-Y. Hedner T. Edvinsson L. Erlinge D. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), cardiomyopathy (15Berry D.A. Barden J.A. Balcar V.J. Keogh A. dos Remedios C.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and shear stress (16Wang L. Andersson M. Karlsson L. Watson M.A. Cousens D.J. Jern S. Erlinge D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown recently that P2X receptors are involved in sensitizing responses following heart failure (17Li J. Sinoway A.N. Gao Z. Maile M.D. Pu M. Sinoway L.I. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3049-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). P2X1 receptors are also expressed on blood cells, including platelets and P2X1 receptors contribute to platelet activation (18Vial C. Rolf M.G. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and aggregation (19Toth-Zsamboki E. Oury C. Cornelissen H. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Biol.

Lenain N. Marchese P. Vial C. Heim V. Freund M. Cazenave J.-P. Cattaneo M. Ruggeri Z.M. Evans R.J. Gachet C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus evidence is building that P2X1 receptors can play important roles in the cardiovascular system and regulation of blood flow. In arteries P2X1 receptors do not appear to be randomly distributed throughout the plasma membrane as P2X1 receptor immunoreactivity appears in clusters (23Hansen M.A. Dutton J.L. Balcar V.J. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. J. Auton. Nervous Sys. 1999; 75: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This clustering of receptors is supported by electrophysiological studies on dissociated artery muscle-excised membrane patches; some patches had multiple P2X receptor channels whereas channel activity was absent in others (24Lewis C.J. Davies N.W. Evans R.J. Drug. Dev. Res. 2001; 52: 164-169Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that the P2X1 receptors can be regulated by phosphorylation of interacting proteins (25Vial C. Tobin A.B. Evans R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that the P2X1 receptor exists in an organized signaling domain. One possible explanation for the clustering of P2X1 receptors could be the inclusion in membrane lipid rafts (26Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids that results in liquid-ordered microdomains within the liquid-disordered glycerophospholipid membrane bilayer (27Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 28Xia F. Gao X. Kwan E. Lam P.P. Chan L. Sy K. Sheu L. Wheeler M.B. Gaisano H.Y. Tsushima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24685-24691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that there is heterogeneity in lipid rafts and that a range of different domains can be separated based on differences in detergent solubility (for a review see Ref. 27Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). A wide range of proteins, including many signaling molecules have been shown to be preferentially associated with rafts (29Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) including a range of ion channels (for a review see Ref. 30Martens J.R. O'Connell K. Tamkun M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 16-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that P2X1 receptors are concentrated in lipid rafts and that disruption of rafts reduces P2X1 receptor signaling in arteries. Reagents—α,β-meATP, 1The abbreviations used are: α,β-meATP, adenosine 5′-[α,β-methylene]triphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CD, cyclodextrin. cholesterol, filipin III, KCl, α-cyclodextrin (α-CD), β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Mβ-CD) were obtained from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Native human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and HEK293 cells subcloned after transfection with the human wild-type P2X1 receptor (P2X1cl-1 cells), were maintained in culture as previously described (25Vial C. Tobin A.B. Evans R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For some studies native HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid cDNA encoding either the rat wild-type P2X1 receptor or human wild-type P2X1 receptor tagged with EGFP at its C terminus (P2X1-EGFP cells) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Control and β-CD-treated cells (10 mm for 1 h at 37 °C) were imaged live using a ×60 oil immersion lens mounted on a Fluoview FV300 confocal microscope (excitation wavelength of 488 nm for EGFP and filters set to capture emission at wavelengths greater than 510 nm) (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence was captured using Olympus Fluoviewer 4.2 software. Rat Tissue Collection—Male Wistar rats (250–350 g) were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation. For membrane fractionation, tail artery, vas deferens, and bladder were excised and processed immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use. For contraction experiments, tail arteries were kept at 4 °C in physiological saline solution (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, pH to 7.3 with NaOH) for a maximum of 3 h before use. Membrane Fractionation—Cells and rat tissues were fractionated using a detergent-free method adapted from Refs. 31Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 32Ostrom R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Two 80-cm2 tissue flasks of HEK293 P2X1cl-1 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11 and left on ice for 20 min. Either seven tail arteries, 3 vas deferens, or 3 bladders from rat were crushed in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and a mortar. When reduced to powder, the tissues were then homogenized into 2 ml of 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11 using a tissue grinder and left on ice for 20 min. The lysed cells and rat tissues were then subjected to three 20-s bursts of sonication. Homogenates were brought to 45% sucrose by addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and loaded in an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was layered on top of the sample by placing 4 ml of 35% sucrose prepared in MBS with 250 mm Na2CO3 then 4 ml of 5% sucrose (also in MBS/Na2CO3). The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm on a TH-641 rotor in a Sorvall OTD65B ultracentrifuge (Kendro Laboratory Products Plc, Bishop's Stortford, UK) for 16 h at 4 °C. In some studies HEK293 P2X1c1-1cells were lysed in 2 ml of MBS containing either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 1% Triton X-100 and were homogenized using a tissue grinder and left for 20 min on ice. The homogenates were brought to 45% sucrose by addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose in MBS and loaded in an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient (35 and 5% sucrose in MBS, lacking Triton X-100) was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged as described above for the detergent-free condition. After centrifugation, 11 fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top to the bottom of each tube. Cholesterol measurements were assessed with the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). The cell volume or tissue quantities used for the sample preparations described above where each representative of one individual experiment. Each experimental condition was repeated three times. Western Blots—The protein level of fraction 4 was used as a loading reference. To do so, the same volumes of samples (different fractions) were loaded for each gel after normalization for protein quantity in fraction 4 (0.04 μg for tail artery, vas deferens, or bladder and 0.1 μg for HEK293 P2X1cl-1 cells). After separation of the samples on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transfer onto nitrocellulose, the membrane was processed with the primary antibody (anti-P2X1 receptor antibody (1:2000) (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) or anti-caveolin-1 (1:1000), anti-caveolin-2 (1:250), anti-flotillin-1 (1:250), anti-flotillin-2 (1:5000) (BD Biosciences Europe, Erembodegem, Belgium). Protein bands were visualized using an ECL+plus kit and Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Cell Expression and Immunoprecipitations—Cell surface proteins were biotinylated as previously described (33Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells from two 80-cm2 tissue flasks were processed for membrane fractionation as described above and blotted with Immunopure streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (0.5 μg/ml) (Pierce). Cells contained in a 35-mm Petri dish were processed for immunoprecipitation (33Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The samples were resuspended in 15 μl of gel sample buffer before running on SDS-PAGE gels. In parallel an aliquot of total lysate (0.5 μg of total protein) was blotted with anti-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (1:1000) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each experimental condition was repeated three times. Patch Clamp Recordings—Conventional whole cell and amphotericin-permeabilized patch-clamp experiments were performed at a holding potential of –60 mV at room temperature (21 °C) as described previously (11Vial C. Evans R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The agonist (α,β-meATP, 10 μm) was rapidly applied via a U-tube. When looking at the effect of cyclodextrins on the P2X1 receptor responses to α,β-meATP, the cells were incubated with the drugs at a concentration of 10 mm for 1 h at 37 °C, for cholesterol repletion cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 660 μg/ml cholesterol Mβ-CD. Filipin (10 μm) was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Contraction Studies—Rat tail artery rings were mounted in a Mulvany myograph and perfused with physiological saline solution at 34 °C and vasoconstrictions to applied drugs measured as described previously (35Lewis C.J. Gitterman D.P. Schluter H. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reproducible responses to 10 μm α,β-meATP could be recorded when the agonist was added at 30-min intervals. The superfusate was stopped when the arteries were incubated in the presence of cyclodextrin drugs (10 mm for 1 h at 34 °C). In the control condition, the superfusate was also stopped for 1 h. Before testing subsequent contraction responses to α,β-meATP and KCl (60 mm), the superfusion was reinitiated, and the arteries were washed with physiological saline solution. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. throughout and n = number of cells, number of arteries. Differences between means were determined by Student's t test and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. P2X1 Receptors Are Associated with Lipid Rafts—Membrane proteins can show a variable distribution relating to the lipid composition of the membrane, with a number of proteins being preferentially located in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Stable expression of P2X1 receptors in HEK293 cells provides an ideal model system to investigate the role of lipid rafts in receptor function. Cell lysates were extracted under detergent-free conditions and ultracentrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (31Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). P2X1 receptor protein was predominantly found colocalized with the lipid raft markers flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 in fractions 3 and 4 (36Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a) and was absent from nontransfected cells (Fig. 1d). Fractions 3 and 4 contain more than 75% of the total cellular cholesterol (and only ∼10% of the total protein, Fig. 1b) confirming the presence of the P2X1 receptor protein in the cellular enriched-cholesterol fractions. As the P2X1 receptor is a transmembrane protein one possibility was that the fractionation concentrates the plasma membrane in fractions 3 and 4, and this could account for the predominant localization of the P2X1 receptors in these fractions and not lipid raft association. To test this we used membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to label surface proteins and determine their distribution on the gradient. Biotinylated proteins were distributed throughout the gradient, demonstrating that the fractionation does not just concentrate membrane proteins. Moreover, the biotinylation process was specific for surface proteins as no trace of the cytosolic p44/42 MAP kinases was observed at the cell surface although present in the total lysate (Fig. 1e). Taken together these data demonstrate that P2X1 receptors are localized to enriched cholesterol lipid rafts. P2X1 Receptors Remain in the Lipid Raft Fraction following Activation and Desensitization—Activation of some receptors, for example the β2-adrenoreceptor leads to movement out of the lipid rafts and a reduction in signaling (37Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 38Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). P2X1 receptors desensitize rapidly following agonist stimulation, and require several minutes for recovery, raising the possibility that the recovery process is dependent on movement between lipid rafts and the rest of bulk membrane. Activation of the P2X1 receptor with α,β-meATP (10 μm) for 10 min should fully desensitize the receptor; however it had no effect on the distribution of the receptor in the lipid raft fractions (Fig. 1f) indicating that movement out of the lipid rafts is not associated with desensitization of the P2X1 receptor channel. Lipid Raft Disruption Regulates P2X1 Receptor Properties— Depletion of cellular cholesterol leads to dissociation of lipid rafts. The cholesterol-depleting agent Mβ-CD (10 mm for 1 h) reduced by 51 ± 28% the total cellular cholesterol content and induced a redistribution of the P2X1 receptor along the gradient (Fig. 2a). Following cholesterol depletion, the P2X1 receptor was now detected readily in fractions 5–11. Mβ-CD is membrane impermeable and does not deplete cholesterol from intracellular membranes, this may in part account for the P2X1 receptor detected in fractions 3 and 4 that could correspond to receptors on intracellular membranes being trafficked. In patch-clamp studies, the ATP analogue α,β-meATP (10 μm a maximal concentration) evokes transient inward currents through P2X1 receptors from HEK293 P2X1cl-1 cells (Fig. 2b). Depletion of cellular cholesterol with either Mβ-CD or β-CD (10 mm for 1 h) reduced the amplitude of agonist-evoked responses by >90% with no effect on either the rise time or rate of decay of the response (Fig. 2b). The reduced amplitude of response is unlikely to result from a decrease in agonist potency at the receptor, as suggested for the effects of cholesterol depletion on cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (39Brady J.D. Rich T.C. Le X. Stafford K. Fowler C.J. Lynch L. Karpen J.W. Brown R.L. Martens J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as there was no effect on the time course of the response and a supramaximal concentration of ATP (1 mm, 1,000-fold greater than the EC50 concentration) was also reduced by >90% (data not shown). Mβ-CD or β-CD treatment also has no effect on the recovery of P2X1 receptors from the desensitized state as reproducible responses to α,β-meATP were evoked at 5-min intervals using the amphotericin-permeabilized patch technique (as shown previously, Ref. 34Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) from control cells and following Mβ-CD or β-CD treatment (data not shown). The inactive cyclodextrin stereoisomer α-CD (10 mm for 1 h) (40Grassme H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) had no effect on agonist-evoked responses (Fig. 2b). Following Mβ-CD treatment responses to α,β-meATP (10 μm) were partially restored (∼4-fold increase in amplitude compared with Mβ-CD, p < 0.05) by cholesterol repletion (660 μg/ml for l h)(–3222 ± 549, –212 ± 130, and –818 ± 240 pA for control, Mβ-CD and cholesterol repletion, respectively, n = >8). The reduction in current amplitude in response to Mβ-CD is unlikely to result from a decrease in the number of P2X1 receptor channels at the cell surface as the localization of EGFP-tagged P2X1 receptors at the cell membrane (peak currents through these receptors are also reduced by ∼85% by Mβ-CD treatment; –5224 ± 1063 and –887 ± 200 pA for control and Mβ-CD respectively, n>6) was unaffected by β-CD treatment (observation of 17 and 14 cells, respectively, for control and β-CD treatment) (Fig. 2d). Lipid rafts may also be disrupted by filipin, which acts to form multimeric globular complexes with membrane cholesterol (41Reungpatthanaphong P. Marbeuf-Gueye C. Le Moyec L. Salerno M. Garnier-Suillerot A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Bang B. Gniadecki R. Gajkowska B. Exp. Dermatol. 2005; 14: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Filipin (10 μm for 30 min) reduced by >90% peak currents following P2X1 receptor activation with no effect on the time course of the response (–5809 ± 790 and 119 ± 70 pA for control and filipin treatment, respectively, n + 12.5). Taken together our results show that lipid raft disruption in HEK293 cells significantly depressed P2X1 channel function. With What Type of Lipid Rafts Are P2X1 Receptors Associated?— Lipid rafts are thought to be heterogeneous with a range of different types of domain dependent on the protein and lipid content of the rafts (27Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The only subtype of rafts that can be identified morphologically are caveolae. These are small plasma membrane invaginations associated with the expression of the caveolins (27Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In this study caveolin-1 and -2 were below the limit of detection in HEK293 cell lines (data not shown; however caveolins were detected in arterial smooth muscle cells, see below) suggesting that P2X1 receptors are not associated with caveolae in lipid rafts. The composition of lipid rafts appears to be dependent on the method of isolation and different types of lipid raft domain have been postulated based on differences in detergent solubility of individual raft proteins. Lipid rafts prepared by non-detergent methods are enriched in glycerophospholipids whereas, in contrast, detergent extraction with Triton X-100 leads to a depletion of these glycerophospholipids and in addition non-detergent methods lead to a greater retention of inner leaflet membrane lipids (for review, see Ref. 27Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Thus comparing results from different isolation procedures may give an insight into which subpopulation of lipid rafts the P2X1 receptor associates with. We therefore compared rafts isolated by non-detergent methods with extraction with 0.1 and 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3). At 0.1% Triton X-100 P2X1 receptors were associated with the buoyant fraction, however in addition the P2X1 receptor was also significantly detected in bottom fractions. When 1% Triton X-100 was used the P2X1 receptor was detectable at low levels in the buoyant fractions and predominantly in the bottom fractions, this is consistent with a previous report on Triton X-100 (1%) extracted P2X1 receptors (43Vacca F. Amadio S. Sancesario G. Bernardi G. Volonte C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 76: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Triton X-100 concentration-dependent localization of the P2X1 receptor was mirrored by the fractions in which the lipid raft marker flotillin-2 was found. This suggests that the association of P2X1 receptors in lipid rafts, like for other proteins, for example the T cell receptor in Jurkat cells (Ref. 44Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J.

This raises the possibility that the association of P2X1 receptors with lipid rafts may be regulated by glycerophospholipids or inner leaflet membrane lipids as thes"
https://openalex.org/W2103644147,"We have studied the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal domains of linker histone H1 subtypes H10 (C-H10) and H1t (C-H1t), free in solution and bound to DNA, by IR spectroscopy. The carboxyl-terminal domain has little structure in aqueous solution but becomes extensively folded upon interaction with DNA. The secondary structure elements present in the bound carboxyl-terminal domain include the α-helix, β-structure, turns, and open loops. The structure of the bound domain shows a significant dependence on salt concentration. In low salt (10 mm NaCl), there is a residual amount of random coil, 7% in C-H10 and 12% in C-H1t. In physiological salt concentrations (140 mm NaCl), the carboxyl termini become fully structured. Under these conditions, C-H10 contained 24% α-helix, 25% β-structure, 17% open loops, and 33% turns. The latter component could include a substantial proportion of the 310 helix. Despite their low sequence identity (∼30%), the representation of the different structural motifs in C-H1t was similar to that in C-H10. Examination of the changes in the amide I components in the 20–80 °C temperature interval showed that the secondary structure of the DNA-bound C-H1t is for the most part extremely stable. The H1 carboxyl-terminal domain appears to belong to the so-called disordered proteins, undergoing coupled binding and folding.

The H1 carboxyl-terminal domain appears to belong to the so-called disordered proteins, undergoing coupled binding and folding. H1 linker histones are thought to be primarily responsible for the condensation of the thick chromatin fiber. It is currently accepted that histone H1 could have a regulatory role in transcription through the modulation of chromatin higher order structure. H1 has been described as a general transcriptional repressor because it contributes to chromatin condensation, which limits the access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. However, H1 may regulate transcription at a more specific level, participating in complexes that either activate or repress specific genes (1Zlatanova J. Van Holde K. J.

Binding to scaffold-associated regions and participation in nucleosome positioning are other mechanisms by which H1 could contribute to transcriptional regulation (9Izaurralde E. Käs E.

In mammals, six somatic subtypes (designated H1a–H1e and H10), a male germ line-specific subtype (H1t), and an oocyte-specific subtype (H1oo) have been identified (11Panyim S. Chalkley R. Biochem.

Linker histones contain three distinct domains: a short amino-terminal domain (20–35 amino acids), a central globular domain (∼80 amino acids, consisting of a helix bundle and a β-hairpin), and a long carboxyl-terminal domain (∼100 amino acids) (24Hartman P.G. Chapman G.E. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains are highly basic. The distribution of charge in the carboxyl-terminal domain is extremely uniform despite the variation in sequence in the different subtypes (25Subirana J.A. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain is the primary determinant of histone H1 binding to chromatin in vivo (19Th'ng J.P.H. Sung R. Ye M. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27809-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P.H. J. Biol.

Several studies indicate that the ability of linker histones to stabilize chromatin folding resides in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein (27Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Avilés F.X.

Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The preferential binding of histone H1 to scaffold-associated regions appears to be determined by the carboxyl-terminal domain (30Roque A. Orrego M. Ponte I. Suau P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6111-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain is also responsible for the activation of apoptotic nuclease (31Widlak P. Kalinowska M. Parseghian M.H. Lu X. Hansen J.C. Garrard W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of H1 once bound to DNA is thus important to our understanding of H1 function. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains have little defined structure in solution, although they may contain a considerable amount of turn-like conformations in rapid equilibrium with unfolded states. Molecular modeling (32Bharath M.M. Chandra N.R. Rao M.R. Proteins. 2002; 49: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and induction of α-helix in the presence of secondary structure stabilizers (33Clark D.J. Hill C.S. Martin S.R. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) 2The abbreviations used are: TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; C-H10, carboxyl-terminal domain of histone H10; C-H1t, carboxyl-terminal domain of histone H1t. and HClO4, suggest that the carboxyl termini would acquire a folded conformation on binding to DNA. We have shown previously that interaction with DNA induces stable helix and turn structures in a 23-residue peptide from the H10 carboxyl terminus (CH-1, residues 99–121, a peptide studied previously (34Vila R. Ponte I. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 35Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). This region, adjacent to the globular domain, is shown to behave as a specific subdomain in the stabilization of folded chromatin structures by histone H1 (27Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inducible helical elements have also been characterized in the amino-terminal domains of H10 and H1e (36Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2001; 11: 214-220Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used infrared spectroscopy to study the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal domains of H10 and H1t in aqueous solution and in the complexes with DNA. The carboxyl-terminal domains have little structure in solution but become fully structured upon interaction with DNA in physiological salt (140 mm NaCl). The secondary structure elements present in the complexes include α-helix, β-structure, turns, and open loops. The study of the entire carboxyl-terminal domain has provided new information, not readily accessible to studies with peptides, on the variety of structural motifs present in the DNA-bound domain, the salt dependence and thermal stability of the folded structure, and the conservation of the protein structure among divergent subtypes. It has also shown that the property of coupled binding and folding, already demonstrated for the previously studied CH-1 peptide (35Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is shared by the entire domain. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Carboxyl-terminal Domains of Histone H1 Subtypes—The sequences encoding the carboxyl-terminal domains of histones H10 and H1t were cloned and expressed. All gene fragments were amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR. The primers were 5′-CCACCATGGATGAGCCTAAAAGGT-3′ and 5′-GGAGATCTTTACTTCTTCTTGCTGGCCCTCT-3′ for the carboxyl-terminal domain of H10 and 5′-GTACCATGGCGGCTTCAGGGAACGAC-3′ and 5′-ACGGATCCTTACTTCCTCCCTGCTGCCTTCCT-3′ for the carboxyl-terminal domain of H1t. The amplification products were cloned in the pQE60 vector (Qiagen) using the NcoI and BglII restriction sites to yield the expression vectors pCTH10 and pCTH1t. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli M15 (Qiagen). Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and then induced with 1mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, allowing the expression to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 10 mm potassium phosphate plus 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride for 15 min at room temperature. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatants were loaded on a CHT-II cartridge filled with ceramic hydroxyapatite type II (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The bound fraction, corresponding to the recombinant proteins, was eluted with 200 mm potassium phosphate, 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7.0. Finally, the proteins were desalted by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Samples for CD spectroscopy were 2 × 10–5 m carboxyl-terminal domain in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples in aqueous solution and in 60% TFE (v/v) were prepared. Spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer in 1 mm of cells at 20 °C. The results were analyzed with Standard Analysis software (JASCO) and expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity [θ]. The helical content was estimated from the ellipticity value at 222 nm (θ222), according to the empirical equation of Chen et al. (38Chen Y.J. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar): % helical content = 100 [θ222/–39,500 × ((1–2.57)/n)], where n is the number of peptide bonds. Infrared Spectroscopy Measurements—The carboxyl-terminal domains of histone H1 were measured at 5 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES plus 10 or 140 mm NaCl. DNA-protein complexes contained 7.0 mg/ml mouse DNA and the appropriate amount of protein. Measurements were performed on a Nicolet Magna II 550 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector, using a demountable liquid cell with calcium fluorine windows and 50-μm spacers for D2O medium and 6-μm spacers for H2O medium measurements. Typically, 1000 scans for each background and sample were collected, and the spectra were obtained with a nominal resolution of 2 cm–1 at 22 °C. Data treatment and band decomposition have been described previously (39Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The DNA contribution to the spectra of the complexes with the carboxyl-terminal domain was subtracted using a DNA sample of the same concentration; the DNA spectrum was weighted so as to cancel the symmetric component of the phosphate vibration at 1087 cm–1 in the difference spectra as described in Vila et al. (35Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, spectra of complexes of different ratios of protein to DNA recorded (0.4 and 0.7 (w/w)). The resulting protein spectra were independent of the protein/DNA ratio inside the statistical error, indicating that the amide I region was not significantly affected by DNA spectral changes induced by interaction with the protein. For the analysis of the thermal stability of the DNA-C-H1t complexes, a tungsten-copper thermocouple was placed directly onto the window, and the cell was placed on a thermostatted cell mount. Thermal analyses were performed by heating from 20 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. Spectra were recorded using a Rapid Scan software running under OMNIC (Nicolet). For each degree of temperature interval, 305 interferograms were averaged, Fourier-transformed, and ratioed against background, obtaining the spectra with a nominal resolution better than 2 cm–1 (40Arrondo J.L.R. Echabe I. Iloro I. Hernando M.A. de la Cruz F. Goñi F.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4226-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The solvent contribution was subtracted as described earlier (41Arrondo J.L.R. Castresana J. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11650-11655Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thermal analyses were performed only in D2O. The DNA contribution to the spectra at each temperature was subtracted using a DNA sample at the same temperature and concentration. The subtraction was weighted using the phosphate symmetric vibration at 1087 cm–1 as described above. In the amide I′ regions, the spectra of native and denatured mixed-sequence calf thymus DNA were similar enough not to affect the protein difference spectrum. CD and IR Spectroscopy Analysis of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of Histone H1 in Aqueous Solution and in TFE—We have used IR spectroscopy to examine the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the histone H1 subtypes H10 (C-H10) and H1t (C-H1t) (Fig. 1) in aqueous (D2O) and in TFE solutions (Fig. 2).

The other main component at 1661–1662 cm–1, with 35% of the total area in C-H10 and 29% in C-H1t, was assigned to turns. In previous studies with H1 peptides, the component at 1661 cm–1 was related to the nascent helix, turns in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state that in the presence of secondary structure stabilizers are transformed into helical structure (35Vila R.

In 60% TFE, C-H10 and C-H1t were extensively folded. Turns (40–38%), α-helix (23–22%), and β-structure (21–25%) were identified, together with a component of random coil/open loops (16%) that are not resolved in D2O. The fraction of turns at 1659–1660 cm–1 represented 13% in C-H10 and 21% in C-H1t. In addition to turns, this component could contain a variable proportion of the 310 helix (43Kennedy D.F. Crisma M. Toniolo C. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6541-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 44Miick S.M. Martínez G.V. Fiori W.R. Todd A.P. Millhauser G.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which case, the proportion of helical structure would increase considerably. The values of α-helix estimated by CD from the ellipticity value at 222 nm (38Chen Y.J. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) were similar to those estimated by IR spectroscopy for both C-H10 and C-H1t (TABLE ONE, Fig. 3). IR Spectroscopy of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of Histone H1 Bound to DNA—We have examined the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of histone H1 bound to DNA. The spectra of the complexes were recorded both in H2O and D2O to facilitate the assignment of the amide I components. Deuteration has a large effect on the position of some components of the amide I, whereas others are shifted slightly or not at all (39Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The vibrations of loops and the α-helix are only slightly affected by isotopic substitution and are thus found at similar positions in H2O and D2O, the α-helix at about 1652 cm–1 and loops at about 1643 cm–1. In contrast, deuteration has a large effect on the position of the random coil so that in H2O it overlaps with the α-helix, whereas in D2O it overlaps with loops. Therefore, the α-helix could be estimated directly in D2O, whereas loops could be estimated directly in H2O. When both α-helix and loops are present in the protein structure, the percentage of random coil can be obtained either from the difference of the components around 1652 cm–1 in H2O and D2O or from the difference of the components around 1643 cm–1 in D2O and H2O, as indicated by the expression in Equation 1, cbα-helix+RC(∼1652cm-1)H2O-cbα-helix(∼1652cm-1)D2O=cbloops+RC(∼1643cm-1)D2O-cbloops(∼1643cm-1)H2O=cbRC(Eq. 1) where cb is the percentage of the assigned amide I component band in either H2OorD2O and cbRC is the percentage of random coil. Because the percentages of the different secondary structure elements in H2O and D2O should be comparable, the similarity of the percentages of random coil estimated from the differences of the components either around 1643 cm–1 in D2O and H2O or around 1652 cm–1 in H2O and D2O warrants the proper assignment of the amide I components containing contributions of α-helix, loops, and random coil. β-structure components appear approximately at the same frequency in D2O and H2O, whereas turn components in D2O are slightly shifted to lower frequencies. The complexes of the carboxyl-terminal domain with DNA were examined in 10 and 140 mm NaCl. In 10 mm NaCl, the analysis of the complexes of C-H10 with DNA in D2O and H2O yielded 27% turns, 19% α-helix, 25% open loops, 22% β-structure, and 7% random coil. The amount of random coil was calculated from the difference of the components around 1654 cm–1 in H2O and D2O and from the difference of the components around 1643 cm–1 in D2O and H2O. The values obtained were equal within 1% (Figs. 4 and 5, TABLE TWO). The representation of the different types of secondary structure in C-H1t bound to DNA was similar to that of C-H10, although some small differences were observed, namely, a higher amount of random coil (12%), a lower amount of α-helix (15%) and open loops (14%), and a higher amount of β-structure (25–27%) and turns (32–34%) (Figs. 4 and 5, TABLE TWO).FIGURE 5Amide I decomposition of the spectra of the C-H1t bound to DNA.

Open table in a new tab When the salt concentration was increased up to 140 mm NaCl, the DNA-bound carboxyl-terminal domains of both H10 and H1t underwent significant structural changes. In the first place, the protein became fully structured, as judged by the total absence of a random coil component. In C-H10, the disappearance of the random coil was correlated with an increase of α-helix, β-structure, and turns, which reached values of 24, 24–25, and 33–34%, respectively. A decrease in the percentage of open loops from 25% in 10 mm to 18% in 140 mm was also observed. The increase of turns was most apparent for C-H1t, reaching 40–42%; the α-helix also increased up to 21%; the contributions of the remaining structural motifs did not change significantly (Figs. 4 and 5, TABLE TWO). As in TFE solution, the component at ∼1660 cm–1 could contain a variable proportion of the 310 helix. Melting Experiments—We monitored the changes in the amide I′ components of the DNA-bound C-H1t upon heating in the 20–80 °C interval. The DNA contribution to the spectra at each temperature was subtracted using a DNA sample at the same temperature and concentration; the subtraction was adjusted using the phosphate symmetric vibration at 1087 cm–1 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Although free DNA melted before complexed DNA, the spectra of native and denatured DNA were similar enough not to affect the amide I′ region of the difference spectra. Melting experiments were performed in either 10 or 140 mm NaCl at a protein/DNA ratio (w/w) of 0.4. In 10 mm NaCl, the α-helix and β-sheet components remained essentially unaltered up to 78 °C. Between 78 °C and 80 °C, they decreased sharply down to a residual 2–3%, which may disappear at higher temperatures. Concomitantly with the decrease of the α-helix and the β-sheet, the random coil component increased from 25 to 45%. The low frequency β-sheet (∼1620 cm–1) melted along a wide temperature interval with a transition midpoint of ∼60 °C; an equivalent increase in turns was observed coinciding with the melting of the low frequency β-sheet (Fig. 6, A and C). In 140 mm NaCl, the structure of the DNA-bound protein was even more stable, the proportions of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil remaining essentially constant up to 80 °C. A small decrease of the low frequency β-sheet and a concomitant increase of the turn component was observed (Fig. 6, B and D). We have examined the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of linker histone subtypes H10 and H1t free in solution and bound to DNA. The use of the entire carboxyl-terminal domain is important in the study of properties that are not localized to any specific subdomain (27Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) but rather are determined by the whole domain, such as differential affinity (19Th'ng J.P.H. Sung R. Ye M. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27809-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or apoptotic nuclease stimulation (31Widlak P. Kalinowska M. Parseghian M.H. Lu X. Hansen J.C. Garrard W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The IR spectra of the carboxyl-terminal domain in aqueous solution were dominated by the random coil (1643–1644 cm–1) with 50% of the total amide I intensity. However, even in this most highly unfolded state, an intense band (35% in C-H10 and 29% in C-H1t) at 1662 cm–1 was observed, suggesting the presence of short-lived turn-like conformations in rapid equilibrium with extended forms (35Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46429-46435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Small amounts of local structure consisting of turns at 1670 cm–1 (6–10%) and β-structure (8–9%) were also present in the free protein. Upon interaction with DNA, the carboxyl-terminal domain acquired an extensively folded conformation. The structure of the bound domain showed a significant dependence on salt concentration. In 10 mm NaCl the DNA-bound C-H10 contained α-helix (19%), β-structure (22%), turns (27%), and open loops (25%), together with a residual 7% random coil. In physiological salt (140 mm), the carboxyl terminus became fully structured, as indicated by the complete absence of random coil. Under these conditions, C-H10 contained 24% α-helix, 25% β-structure, 18% open loops, and 33–34% turns. The component at ∼1660 cm–1 in TFE and in the complexes with DNA could arise totally or in part from the 310 helix. This position has been assigned to the 310 helix in several studies (43Kennedy D.F. Crisma M. Toniolo C. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6541-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 45Reisdorf Jr., W.C. Krimm S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The presence of the 310 helix was demonstrated in a peptide from the H10 carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 99–121) (34Vila R. Ponte I. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 35Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amount of α-helix should thus be considered as a lower limit of the amount of helical structure. All of the structural motifs found in the carboxyl-terminal domain have the potential to interact with the major or minor groove DNA phosphates (46Churchill M.E. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The dependence of the secondary structure of the DNA-bound carboxyl-terminal domain on salt concentration, although moderate, is an indication of conformational versatility, which could have a role in chromatin structure and dynamics. Despite the large sequence divergence between C-H10 and C-H1t (30% sequence identity) (Fig. 1), the two appear to have common secondary structure components, in both 10 mm and 140 mm NaCl. This suggests that selective constraints may act to preserve the secondary structure of the DNA-bound domain in different subtypes. The induced secondary structure of the DNA-bound domain appears to be extremely stable. In 10 mm NaCl, the α-helix and the β-sheet (1630 cm–1) begin to melt at 78 °C; only the low frequency β-sheet (1620 cm–1) melts earlier with a transition midpoint of ∼65 °C. In 140 mm, the α-helix and the β-sheet are even more stable, and no changes are observed in their proportions up to the experimental temperature limit of 80 °C. The low frequency β-sheet melts in a temperature interval similar to that observed at low salt, with a concomitant increase in the proportion of turns. The high thermal stability of the DNA-bound form may result from increased hydrophobicity following extensive compensation of the positive charge of the protein by the DNA phosphates. Considering the high proportion of Lys residues in the carboxyl terminus (∼40%), charge neutralization should have a large effect on the mean complex hydrophobicity. Evidence for extensive reciprocal charge compensation in C-H1-DNA complexes is given by the +/– ratio of ∼1.0 in saturated complexes (30Roque A. Orrego M. Ponte I. Suau P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6111-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Rodríguez A.T. Pérez L. Morán F. Montero F. Suau P. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 39: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, C-H1-DNA complexes form the kind of toroidal complexes predicted by counterion condensation theory when the DNA charge is fully neutralized (>90% charge compensation) (47Rodríguez A.T. Pérez L. Morán F. Montero F. Suau P. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 39: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Manning G.S. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 2929-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 49Wilson R.W. Bloomfield V.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Folding could contribute to hydrophobicity in a more specific way. In the C-H1 peptide, helical folding (from Glu-99 to Ala-117) creates a hydrophobic patch because of the marked amphipathic character of the helix with all of the positively charged residues on one face of the helix and all of the hydrophobic residues on the other face (34Vila R. Ponte I. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain appears to belong to the group of “disordered proteins,” also known as natively unfolded or intrinsically unstructured (50Bracken C. Iakoucheva L.M. Romero P.R. Dunker A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 51Fink A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 52Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). In free solution, these proteins lack specific secondary or tertiary structure and are composed of an ensemble of conformations. Many disordered proteins fold into stable secondary or tertiary structures upon binding to their targets, such as other proteins, nucleic acids, or membranes. Intrinsic disorder is characterized by a low sequence complexity, a low content of hydrophobic amino acids, and a high content of polar and charged amino acids. All of these features are present in the carboxyl-terminal domains and also in the amino-terminal domains of H1 (53Ponte I. Vila R. Suau P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, disordered regions are often present in proteins regulated by phosphorylation, which is also the case with H1 (54Iakoucheva L.M. Radivojac P. Brown C.J. O'Connor T.R. Sikes J.G. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). The H1 globular domain is believed to be involved in specific binding site recognition in chromatin. A stably folded carboxyl-terminal domain with its high charge density could interfere with binding site recognition. Given that the folding of the carboxyl terminus is associated with charge neutralization, binding to unspecific sites, such as nucleosomal DNA, that is already involved in interactions with core histones may lead to partial folding and lower affinity of the carboxyl terminus. One of the possible advantages of intrinsic disorder would thus be to kinetically favor the recognition of specific H1 binding sites in chromatin."

Here we report a deep-sea siphonophore that twitches glowing lures to attract fish. This is rare evidence of bioluminescence used for prey attraction among nonvisual marine organisms. The lures also contain red fluorescent material that shifts the wavelength of emitted light. The existence of a red-luminescent invertebrate suggests that long-wavelength light plays a greater role in marine interactions than previously suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2026086014,"Regulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system, fundamental to the physiological response to stress and exercise, requires coordinated phosphorylation of multiple downstream molecular targets, including the IKs (slowly activating potassium current) channel. Sympathetic nervous system stimulation increases intracellular cAMP for which targeted regulation is directed in large part by distinct scaffold or anchoring proteins. Yotiao is an A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) that recruits the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) and protein phosphatase 1 to the carboxyl terminus of the IKs channel to form a molecular complex and control its phosphorylation state, crucial to the cardiac cellular response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation.

The replacement of Ser-43 by Ala ablates the PKA phosphorylation of N-T Yotiao and markedly diminishes the functional response of the wild type and pseudo-phosphorylated IKs channel to cAMP but neither prevents the PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 nor its binding to Yotiao.

The second messenger cAMP transduces extracellular receptor-activated signals into a multitude of intracellular events, many of which are mediated by phosphorylation via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; AKAP, A-kinase-anchoring protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; OA, okadaic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; N-T, amino terminus/terminal; WT, wild type; NS, not significant; pF; picofarad; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). (1Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Intracellular specificity and the distribution of cAMP-dependent regulation are now recognized to be mediated largely by A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which together with specific substrates create macromolecular signaling complexes to control the PKA phosphorylation state of targeted proteins (2Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Reinitz C.A. Bianco R.A. Shabb J.B. Arch. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 298: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). AKAPs are a subset of functionally, rather than structurally, related scaffolding proteins. AKAPs form compartmentalized cellular environments by tethering distinct signaling molecules, such as the regulatory subunits PKA and protein phosphatases, and presenting them to select downstream targets (5Bauman A.L. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

All AKAPs bind the type II PKA regulatory subunit with high affinity, but all AKAPs do not necessarily complex with protein phosphatases. Unique targeting domains on AKAPs mediate specific protein-protein interaction and ensure target specificity (8Jin J. Smith F.D. Stark C. Wells C.D. Fawcett J.P. Kulkarni S. Metalnikov P.

Thus a key function of AKAPs is to fine-tune spatial and temporal regulation of the phosphorylation state of target proteins, particularly when rapid changes in response to physiologically mediated signals is needed (9Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The activity of the cardiac IKs (slowly activating potassium current) channel, critically important to the regulation of the cardiac action potential duration, particularly in the face of sympathetic nervous system stimulation (10Kass R.S. Wiegers S.E. J. Physiol. 1982; 322: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Walsh K.B. Kass R.S. Science. 1988; 242: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), is regulated by an AKAP-mediated alteration of its PKA phosphorylation state (12Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The IKs channel forms a macromolecular complex consisting of an α subunit (KCNQ1), a regulatory subunit (KCNE1), and the AKAP Yotiao bound to the channel carboxyl-terminal domain (12Marx S.O.

PKA phosphorylation of Ser-27 in the KCNQ1 amino terminus (N-T) accounts for most of the functional modulation of IKs by the sympathetic nervous system (13Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and mutation of KCNQ1 residue Ser-27 to Asp (S27D) reconstitutes most, but not all, of the effects of PKA on expressed channel function (17Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Rao J. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16374-16378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the assembly of this complex is necessary to reconstitute the functional regulation of the IKs channel by PKA, it is not clear whether phosphorylation of IKs alone, and not Yotiao as well, is sufficient to account for all of the important PKA-mediated functional changes in IKs channel activity. We recently reported that interactions between the phosphorylated KCNQ1 amino terminus and Yotiao bound to the KCNQ1 carboxyl terminus are required to alter IKs channel activity (17Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Rao J. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16374-16378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we explore the possibility that Yotiao itself is a substrate for PKA phosphorylation and that phosphorylation of this adaptor protein participates in the overall functional response of the IKs channel complex to PKA. Precedence for this possibility has been established by recent studies that have shown that phosphorylation of the AKAP-Lbc precedes release of protein kinase D and that phosphorylation of the AKAP Gravin may contribute to β-adrenergic receptor resensitization (18Carnegie G.K.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results in fact provide evidence for a role of PKA phosphorylation of Yotiao in the functional response of the IKs channel complex to PKA-mediated phosphorylation and thus provide further evidence that Yotiao serves, at least in part, as an effector in regulating the activity of this important cardiac ion channel. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F12 culture media with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. CHO cells were transfected with channel subunits, Yotiao and CD8, using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) when cells reached 20–30% confluence as described previously (12Marx S.O.

Transfected cells were identified by Dynabeads M-450 anti-CD8 beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Molecular Biology—Yotiao fusion protein fragments were generated by PCR and were subcloned into pGEX-4T1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutations were introduced into the constructs using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were sequenced. GST fusion proteins of Yotiao fragments were then grown in DE3 cells as described previously (21Motoike H.K. Liu H. Glaaser I.W. Yang A.S. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies—A phospho-specific Yotiao antibody (PYT2K) was raised against a phospho-peptide that encompasses the PKA consensus site at Yotiao N termini (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The sequence of the peptide is RKTpSSSKHD. A non-phospho-specific Yotiao antibody was raised against a recombinant Yotiao fragment (residues 110–448) (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, Northern Ireland). A phospho-S27 KCNQ1 antibody was raised as described previously (13Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A commercial KCNQ1 antibody (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect total KCNQ1. Western blot was done following a routine protocol. Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Protein G beads were used to immobilize the immunocomplex. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in sample buffer and were then size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation Assays—Yotiao fragment-GST fusion proteins were immobilized on GST beads. Full-length His-tagged Yotiao was immunoprecipitated with an anti-His antibody. Protein-bound GST beads or immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphorylation buffer (8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris/PIPES, pH 6.8) and then incubated with PKA catalytic subunits (5 units). Phosphorylation was initiated at room temperature with 33 μm Mg-ATP containing 10% [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and terminated after 5 min. Phosphorylation signals were assayed by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of Yotiao or KCNQ1 in intact CHO cells was induced by incubating the cells at 37 °C with 300 μm 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min or 1 μm isoproterenol for 10 min (for cells co-transfected with β1- or β2-adrenergic receptors). 1 μm okadaic acid was always used to preserve phosphorylation. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) at 4 °C. Cell lysates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by phospho-specific antibodies. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell recordings using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) were performed 2 days after transfection, as described previously (13Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pipette resistance was 2–4 megohms. To study the maximal effects of PKA phosphorylation, 200 μm cAMP plus 0.2 μm okadaic acid (OA) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was included in recording pipettes and dialyzed for 13 min before measurements were made. IKs (2-s isochronal) activation was determined by an analysis of deactivating tail currents recorded at –40 mV after a series of voltage steps (2-s, 20-mV increments). Tail currents were normalized to the tail current after the +80 mV testing pulse. Activation curves from individual experiments were then generated by plotting the normalized tail currents against test voltages. We fit the 2-s isochronal activation curves with Boltzmann functions to estimate the voltage at which half of the channels are available (V ½) providing a means for comparing the effects of Yotiao mutation on the voltage dependence of activation. The activation curves shown in Figs. 3A and 5 were generated with the mean Boltzmann parameters obtained from the individual experiments. Channel deactivation, recorded as current tails at –40 mV (2-s) following +60-mV activating voltage pulses (2-s), was fitted with a single exponential function to extract the deactivation time constant (τ). Activation kinetics were characterized by the time (t ½) to reach the half-maximal current during 2-s activating pulses (+60 mV). Data were acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). Recordings were made at room temperature. Data were shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical tests were carried out using EXCEL (Microsoft). Differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be significant (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 3, B and C).Fig. 5Yotiao phosphorylation alters the function of pseudo-phosphorylated IKs channels. Phosphorylation of KCNQ1 was simulated (pseudo-phosphorylated channels) by replacing KCNQ1 Ser-27 by Asp (S27D), and IKs was measured in CHO cells expressing S27D KCNQ1, KCNE1, and WT (left) or S43A (right) Yotiao. PKA regulation of IKs was tested by dialysis with cAMP (200 μm) and OA (0.2 μm) (see “Materials and Methods”). Isochronal IKs activation curves (see “Materials and Methods”) were measured in the absence (open circles) and presence (filled squares) of cAMP/OA and plotted as mean ± S.E. For cells expressing WT Yotiao, V ½ was 24.5 ± 1.8 mV (–cAMP/OA, n = 24) and 16.2 ± 2.1 mV (+cAMP/OA, n = 13) (p < 0.01). For cells expressing S43A Yotiao, V ½ was 26 ± 3.7mV (–cAMP/OA, n = 6) and 28.6 ± 5.1mV (+cAMP/OA, n = 4) (NS). The smooth curves are the Boltzmann relationships computed from these mean data (see “Materials and Methods”). Shown in insets are representative current traces recorded at 0 mV under the indicated experimental conditions.

Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The robust increase in IKs channel activity by sympathetic nervous system stimulation can be accounted for largely by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of KCNQ1 N-T Ser-27, but previous studies have not considered the possibility that Yotiao also may be a substrate for PKA phosphorylation. To determine whether Yotiao can be PKA-phosphorylated, His-tagged full-length Yotiao was expressed in CHO cells and immunoprecipitated using an anti-His antibody. The immunoprecipitated protein was then incubated with PKA and [32P]ATP. Fig. 1B shows that phosphorylated Yotiao can indeed be detected on autoradiography (lane 1). Negative control experiments (Fig. 1B) with mock immunoprecipitation (no Yotiao lysate (lane 2) or no immunoprecipitate antibody (lane 3)) confirmed the specificity of the autoradiograph and the conclusion that Yotiao can be PKA-phosphorylated. Sequence analysis of Yotiao revealed a PKA substrate consensus site in the Yotiao N-T domain between residues 37 and 48 (KKKRKTSSSKHDV) (Fig. 1C). This region contains two potential PKA phosphorylation substrates: Thr-42 and Ser-43 (Fig. 1C). We repeated the 32P phosphorylation assay with GST fusion proteins of wild type and mutated Yotiao amino-terminal constructs in which both candidate residues were systematically replaced with alanine residues to identify candidate PKA substrates. Fig. 1 confirms that wild type Yotiao amino terminus, containing the intact PKA consensus site, can be PKA-phosphorylated (Fig. 1D, lane 1) but also shows that Ala substitution of both Thr-42 and Ser-43 ablates this response (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Similarly, the single substitution S43A but not T42A ablates PKA phosphorylation of the fusion protein (Fig. 1D, lane 3). These data suggest that Ser-43 is the key substrate for PKA phosphorylation of amino-terminal Yotiao. We were next interested in determining whether or not Yotiao could be PKA-phosphorylated in intact CHO cells that could then be used to investigate possible functional consequences of Yotiao phosphorylation. To accomplish this, we raised an antibody (PYT2K) against a 9-mer peptide that includes the entire N-T PKA consensus sequence with a phosphorylated Ser-43 to probe motif-specific Yotiao phosphorylation. Fig. 2A illustrates the utility and the specificity of the phospho-Yotiao antibody (PYT2K) as well as evidence that full-length Yotiao was indeed phosphorylated in response to cAMP in CHO cells. In the experiments illustrated in Fig. 2A, CHO cells expressing Yotiao were incubated with membrane-permeable 8-bromo-cAMP (300 μm) and OA (1 μm) before obtaining cell lysates. Phosphorylated Yotiao can be detected by the phospho-Yotiao antibody. A Yotiao N-T peptide containing a phosphorylated Ser-43 successfully neutralized the phospho-Yotiao antibody, whereas a similar peptide containing a nonphosphorylated Ser-43 did not. This verified the phospho-specificity of the antibody. Fig. 2B shows that Yotiao is coupled to, and can be phosphorylated by, stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors. In these experiments, CHO cells were co-transfected with cDNA coding for Yotiao plus either β1 or β2 receptors, the predominant β-adrenergic receptor subtypes in heart and then treated with the nonselective β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (1 μm) plus the phosphatase inhibitor OA (1 μm) to maximize possible β-adrenergic receptor-mediated Yotiao phosphorylation. As is the case for exposure to membrane-permeable cAMP, stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors results in Yotiao phosphorylation. Does PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Yotiao have functional consequences on the regulation of the IKs channel? To test for this possibility, CHO cells expressing KCNQ1/KCNE1 along with WT- or S43A-mutated Yotiao were dialyzed with pipette solutions containing 200 μm cAMP and 0.2 μm OA. The effects of cAMP/OA on IKs channel activity were compared for cells expressing WT versus S43A Yotiao. Here we focused on the voltage dependence of IKs activation and the time course of channel activation and deactivation because PKA regulation of IKs has been demonstrated to affect these parameters (12Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 16Terrenoire C. Clancy C.E. Cormier J.W. Sampson K.J. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: e25-e34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that the S43A Yotiao mutation, which removes the N-T Yotiao PKA substrate, markedly reduces the effects of cAMP/OA on these IKs gating parameters. In this set of experiments, the half-maximal IKs activation voltage (V½) for CHO cells expressing KCNQ1, KCNE1, and wild type Yotiao was 28.3 ± 2.1 mV (n = 11) (control, –cAMP/OA) and 15.8 ± 2.2 mV (n = 15) (+cAMP/OA) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A), consistent with previously reported effects of cAMP on IKs activation (12Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). However, when we replaced WT by S43A Yotiao, the cAMP-dependent shift in IKs activation was markedly reduced (V½ = 22.9 ± 2.4 mV, n = 12, –cAMP/OA; V½ = 19.5 ± 2.1 mV, n = 10, +cAMP/OA; NS). Substitution of S43A for WT Yotiao similarly greatly reduced the kinetic response of the IKs channels to cAMP. As in previous studies (16Terrenoire C. Clancy C.E. Cormier J.W. Sampson K.J. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: e25-e34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cAMP slowed IKs deactivation assayed by extracting the time constant (τ) of exponential current decay at –40 mV after a +60-mV conditioning pulse to activate channels (see “Materials and Methods”) (τ = 606 ± 25 ms, –cAMP/OA, n = 11; τ = 782 ± 62 ms, +cAMP/OA, n = 15, p < 0.05). When WT Yotiao was replaced by S43A Yotiao, the effect of cAMP on IKs was no longer significant (τ = 732 ± 64 ms, –cAMP/OA, n = 12; τ = 760 ± 52 ms, +cAMP/OA, n = 10, NS). Similarly, replacement of WT by S43A Yotiao reduced the effect of cAMP/OA on IKs activation kinetics assayed by measuring the time to half-maximal current (t½) during 2-s voltage steps to +60 mV (see “Materials and Methods”). In CHO cells expressing WT Yotiao, cAMP significantly sped IKs activation as reported previously (16Terrenoire C. Clancy C.E. Cormier J.W. Sampson K.J. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: e25-e34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (t½ = 719 ± 38 ms, –cAMP/OA, n = 11; t½ = 528 ± 35 ms, +cAMP/OA, n = 15, p < 0.01) but not in CHO cells expressing S43A Yotiao (t½ = 644 ± 31 ms, –cAMP/OA, n = 12; t½ = 592 ± 30 ms, +cAMP/OA, n = 10, NS). Thus, the Yotiao mutation S43A, which ablates amino-terminal PKA phosphorylation of Yotiao, greatly reduces the functional kinetic response of the IKs channel to cAMP. Ablation of Yotiao phosphorylation might alter the kinetic and voltage-dependent response of IKs channels to PKA by (i) disruption of amino-terminal KCNQ1 phosphorylation; (ii) disruption of the binding of Yotiao to the KCNQ1 carboxyl terminus; or (iii) changing the allosteric interactions with the phosphorylated KCNQ1 channel. Fig. 4 provides experimental evidence against possibilities (i) and (ii). Fig. 4A shows that phosphorylation of KCNQ1 Ser-27 can be detected in CHO cells expressing KCNQ1 plus WT Yotiao when exposed to membrane-permeable cAMP as reported previously by us (13Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Replacement of WT Yotiao by Yotiao harboring the S43A mutation, which ablates N-T Yotiao phosphorylation, does not prevent KCNQ1 phosphorylation. Fig. 4B demonstrates that both WT Yotiao and S43A Yotiao can be co-immunoprecipitated with KCNQ1, suggesting that the KCNQ1 binding capacity of S43A Yotiao remains intact. These experiments rule out possibilities (i) and (ii), and taken together both experiments indicate that the role of Yotiao as an anchoring protein for the IKs channel is not compromised by S43A mutation. To test for possibility (iii) we turned to a pseudo-phosphorylated KCNQ1 channel in which Ser-27 was replaced by a negatively charged residue (S27D). When co-expressed with WT Yotiao and KCNE1, pseudo-phosphorylated KCNQ1 reconstitutes many of the functional consequences of PKA phosphorylation of the IKs channel (13Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Rao J. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16374-16378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 provides evidence that PKA phosphorylation of Yotiao modifies the activity of pseudo-phosphorylated IKs channels. Shown in Fig. 5 are currents and activation curves measured in the absence and presence of intracellular cAMP/OA for cells expressing S27D KCNQ1, KCNE1 with WT (left), or S43A (right) Yotiao. Replacement of Ser-27 by Asp eliminates Ser-27 as a PKA substrate in these experiments, but nevertheless cAMP/OA still affects IKs channel activity in cells expressing WT Yotiao (V½ = 24.5 ± 1.8 mV, n = 24, –cAMP/OA; V½ = 16.1 ± 2.1 mV, n = 13, +cAMP/OA; p < 0.01). These effects of cAMP/OA on IKs channels are no longer significant when WT Yotiao is replaced by S43A Yotiao in similar experiments (V½ = 26 ± 3.7 mV, n = 6, –cAMP/OA; V½ = 28.6 ± 5.1 mV, n = 4, +cAMP/OA, NS). Thus the cAMP-dependent changes in the pseudo-phosphorylated IKs channels are mediated by phosphorylation of the Yotiao amino-terminal residue Ser-43. AKAPs play a central role in mediating cellular signal transduction by creating micro-signaling environments that present regulatory enzymatic molecules directly to the downstream targets (5Bauman A.L. Goehring A.S. Scott J.D. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 22Kapiloff M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The versatile nature of these proteins underlies the precise spatio-temporal control of cellular events. Often ignored, however, is the possibility that, when extracellular or intracellular stimuli reach the subcellular compartment and activate signaling components, AKAPs themselves may be the targets of kinases or phosphatases. Here we provide evidence that the AKAP Yotiao itself is a PKA substrate. We show that Yotiao amino-terminal Ser-43 can be PKA-phosphorylated, and that PKA phosphorylation of this residue contributes to the functional response of the IKs channel to cAMP. This suggests that Yotiao may play a more active role in the regulation of the activity of the heart IKs channel than merely acting as a scaffold-coordinating protein assembly. AKAPs are known to participate in the regulation of many ion channels. AKAP15 associates with L-type calcium channels via a leucine zipper motif (23Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J.

Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). AKAP150 forms a macromolecular complex with M-type potassium channels and PKC and mediates the muscarinic receptor regulation of the channel (25Hoshi N. Zhang J.S. Omaki M. Takeuchi T. Yokoyama S. Wanaverbecq N. Langeberg L.K. Yoneda Y. Scott J.D. Brown D.A. Higashida H. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) forms a macromolecular complex in which multiple adaptor proteins coordinate the assembly of a number of regulatory enzymes (26Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). The common feature of such regulation is the dependence on AKAPs to provide a structural entity that coordinates the close association of regulatory enzymes with the target proteins. Our data have shown an unprecedented example in which PKA-dependent functional regulation of the IKs channel depends not only on the co-assembly of the channel with Yotiao and the subsequent phosphorylation of the channel protein but also on the phosphorylation of the AKAP Yotiao itself. Upon application of cAMP, the amplitudes of IKs currents increase, voltage-dependent activation shifts, channel activation hastens, and channel deactivation slows. These phenomena are maximal only in the presence of WT Yotiao with an intact PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-43). When Yotiao Ser-43 is replaced by alanine and is insensitive to PKA-dependent phosphorylation, each of these changes in IKs is diminished, suggesting that PKA regulation of IKs is, in part, dependent on phosphorylation of the Yotiao residue Ser-43. Additionally, we observe that the S43A mutation does not compromise the role of Yotiao as an adaptor protein. This is supported by two lines of evidence as shown in Fig. 4: (i) KCNQ1 can be PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of S43A Yotiao; and (ii) S43A Yotiao retains the ability to interact with KCNQ1. Our data indicate that Yotiao fulfills its role as an AKAP in presenting both PKA and protein phosphatase 1 to the channel to form a local environment that allows for fine-tuned spatial temporal control of the phosphorylation state of the target KCNQ1 protein. Our data also show that, in addition to its classic scaffolding role, Yotiao itself is a PKA substrate and suggest that the functional consequences of PKA phosphorylation of Yotiao Ser-43 and KCNQ1 Ser-27 are synergistic and likely to result from postphosphorylation alteration in protein-protein interactions. Evidence for this point comes from the present study in which phosphorylation of Yotiao Ser-43 modulates the pseudo-phosphorylated IKs channel (Fig. 5). In combination with our previous finding that basal Yotiao contributes directly to functional regulation of IKs downstream of PKA phosphorylation of the IKs channel (17Kurokawa J. Motoike H.K. Rao J. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16374-16378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), our data provide evidence that, in addition to assembling a signaling complex, Yotiao plays a role similar to that of other ion channel β subunits in that it interacts with the phosphorylated KCNQ1 channel to alter channel biophysical properties. Our present data indicate that this interaction and resulting IKs channel activity are modulated by PKA phosphorylation of Yotiao Ser-43. How does a phosphorylated serine residue on Yotiao change the IKs current properties? One possibility is that phosphorylation of Yotiao Ser-43 alters but does not ablate the interface between KCNQ1 and Yotiao and, in turn, affects conformation of the assembled channel complex. Other possibilities may involve allosteric intermolecular interactions between phosphorylated Yotiao and other intracellular segments of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. These possibilities remain to be addressed in future studies. In summary, our work shows that in the case of the IKs channel complex, phosphorylation of an ion channel subunit (KCNQ1) together with the adaptor protein (Yotiao) that also coordinates the local signaling environment contributes to the postphosphorylation physiological functional regulation of the channel complex. The participation of the adaptor protein itself in the signaling response to external stimuli is not limited to the IKs macromolecular complex because precedence exists for phosphorylation of other AKAPs such as AKAP-Lbc and AKAP 250 (Gravin) (18Carnegie G.K.

Hence, these osteoclasts were hypomotile and less resorptive (9Biswas R.S. Baker D.A. Hruska K.A. Chellaiah M.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Actin ring formation is critical for osteoclast bone resorption but is not required for motility. Transduction of PBD of gelsolin not only blocked the interaction of PIP2 with endogenous gelsolin but also with WASP and ezrin proteins (9Biswas R.S. Baker D.A. Hruska K.A. Chellaiah M.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). WASP has been identified as a phosphoinositide-binding protein that regulates actin ring organization in podosomes and lamellipodia (10Cory G.O.C. Cramer R. Blanchoin L. Ridley A.J. Mol.

WASP and N-WASP are both activated by the combination of PIP2 and Cdc42. However, they have different responses when treated with either alone. Although there are differences in the response, PIP2 has a regulatory role in the activation of both WASP and N-WASP (13Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F117-F120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies have shown that coordinated binding of PIP2 and Cdc42-GTP causes the activation of WASP (14Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J.

It has a role in protrusion as well as cortical actin remodeling (19Machesky L.M. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Podosome assembly at the leading edge of polarized cells is critically dependent upon WASP, because macrophages from patients with Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome fail to assemble podosomes (20Jones G.E. Zicha D. Dunn G.A. Blundell M. Thrasher A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Macrophages from patients with Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome exhibited defects in actin structure formation because of the inability of cells to localize the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex (11Linder S. Higgs H. Hufner K. Schwarz K. Pannicke U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). N-WASP plays a role in actin ring formation in fission yeast (21Pelham R.J. Chang F. Nature. 2002; 419: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Demeter J. Sazer S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently, it was identified that osteoclasts from WASP-null mice are markedly depleted of podosomes and failed to exhibit actin rings at sealing zones. Complementation of WASP-null osteoclasts with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-WASP fusion protein restores normal cytoarchitecture (23Calle Y. Jones G.E. Jagger C. Fuller K. Blundell M.P. Chow J. Chambers T. Thrasher A.J. Blood. 2004; 103: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts transduced with PBD of gelsolin failed to demonstrate WASP in the newly formed podosomes or in the actin ring area (9Biswas R.S. Baker D.A. Hruska K.A. Chellaiah M.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although podosomes are absent in gelsolin null (Gsn-/-) osteoclasts, the actin ring was observed. WASP distribution was observed in the actin ring of Gsn-/-osteoclasts (24Biswas R.S. Yuen D. Hruska K. Chellaiah M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 279Google Scholar). Hence, these osteoclasts were able to resorb bone, but the resorption pits were simple due to the deficiency of podosomes and the resultant hypomotile nature of osteoclasts (5Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although distinct pathways and signaling molecules have been described to play roles in the organization of actin ring (25Duong L.T. Nakamura I. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Bett A.J. Rodan G.A. J.

Hence, in the present study, our objective is to determine the intracellular pathways and the mechanisms by which the WASP-mediated actin ring organization is induced in response to OPN/αvβ3 signaling in osteoclasts. An aminoglycoside antibiotic, neomycin, which binds to phosphoinositides, was shown to affect the activation of proteins such as phospholipase D, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin proteins (ERM), and sodium (Na) hydrogen exchanger as well as binding of PIP2 to gelsolin (30Huang Y.

We have used neomycin to determine the role of PIP2- and TAT-mediated delivery of Rho GTPases, such as Rho and Cdc42 in the activation of WASP, as well as cortical actin remodeling in the formation of the actin ring in osteoclasts. Results presented here show that activation and membrane targeting of WASP requires Rho GTPase-dependent PIP2 interaction with WASP. An increase in PI4P 5-kinase activity was observed in osteoclasts treated with OPN or transduced with TAT-RhoVal14. Actin ring formation is enhanced by interaction of Cdc42 with the Arp2/3 complex. A cooperative interaction between Rho and Cdc42 has been shown to be required in the process of actin ring formation in osteoclasts. Reagents—Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblotting, rainbow molecular weight marker, and [32P]orthophosphate were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. PtdIns P2 antiserum was purchased from Advanced Magnetics (Cambridge, MA) and Echelon Research Laboratories Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). GAPDH antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Neomycin sulfate, rhodamine phalloidin, protein A-Sepharose, monoclonal antibodies to HA, phospholipid standards, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors such as LY294002 [20(4-morphodinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one] and wortmannin and all the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Protein estimation reagent, molecular weight standards for proteins, and polyacrylamide gel reagents were bought from Bio-Rad. Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Antibodies to Cdc42, WASP, Arp2, and Arp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). GST-fused WASP/Cdc42 binding domain (WASP-CBD) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was bought from Cytoskeleton. Inc. (Denver CO). Preparation of Osteoclast Precursors—Osteoclasts were generated in vitro using the mouse bone marrow cells. Cells isolated from five mice were cultured into 100-mm dishes with 20 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (α-10). After culture for 24 h, nonadhered cells were layered on histopaque -1077 (Sigma) and centrifuged at 350 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The cell layer between the histopaque and the medium was removed and washed with α-10 medium at 2000 rpm for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in α-10 medium and cultured with the appropriate concentrations of mCSF-1 (10 ng/ml) and osteoprotegerin ligand (55-75 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, medium was replaced with fresh cytokines. The multinucleated osteoclasts were seen from day 4 onward. Transduction of TAT-fused Proteins, Treatment of Osteoclasts with OPN, and Lysate Preparation—HA-TAT fusion proteins containing Rho GTPases (Rho and Cdc42 in constitutively active and dominant negative form) were purified as described previously (35Chellaiah M.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (42 kDa) and HA-TAT vector (6-8 kDa) proteins were used as a nonspecific and vector controls, respectively. Dose- and time-dependent effects of Rho GTPase were determined. Osteoclasts were kept in serum-free α-MEM for 2 h and treated as follows: TAT-proteins were added to cells to a final concentration of 100 nm in serum-free media for 45 min; OPN (25 μg/ml for 15 min), C3 transferase (250 ng/ml for 2 h), wortmannin (WM; 100 nm for 45 min), and LY294002 (10 μm for 45 min) were added to osteoclast cultures as described previously (35Chellaiah M.

Osteoclasts treated with PBS were used as controls. Some cultures transduced with Rho GTPases or treated with C3 transferase, WM, or LY29004 (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol.

Following treatments as described above, osteoclasts were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm Na4P2O7,50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 5 mm ZnCl2, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were rocked on ice for 15 min and scraped off with a cell scraper. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as a Triton-soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is the Triton-insoluble fraction. Protein contents were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Small Interfering RNA for WASP—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for WASP (sc-36830) as well as control siRNA (sc-36869; sc37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect osteoclasts. Because the silencing was 30-40%, we have used permeabilization with streptomycin O to deliver the siRNAs into osteoclasts as described previously (4Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were washed twice with permeabilization buffer (120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MgCl2). Freshly prepared DTT (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), and 0.5 units/ml of streptolysin O and siRNA (0.5 and 1 μm) were added to the buffer at the time of permeabilization. Cells were incubated with the above-mentioned solution for 2-3 min, and resealing was achieved by the addition of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Incubation was continued for 48 h. Additionally, control cells were permeabilized as above in the absence of siRNA. After 48 h, lysates were made and subjected to immunoblotting with an antibody to WASP. WASP distribution was determined by immunostaining analysis as described below. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Equal amounts of lysate proteins were precleared with protein A-Sepharose, presoaked in lysis buffer containing BSA, and with nonimmune IgG coupled to Sepharose. The precleared supernatants were incubated with antibodies of interest, and the immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted and washed three times for 5 min each with ice-cold PBS. The immune complexes were then eluted in electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western analyses. Blots were blocked with 10% milk in PBS containing 0.5%Tween (PBS-T) for 2-3 h and then incubated with 1:100 dilution of primary antibody of interest for 2-3 h. After three washes for 10 min each with PBS-T, the blot was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated species-specific respective secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes for 10 min each with PBS-T, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Pierce) (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol.

The cells were then labeled with [32P]PO4 for 2 h in the above-mentioned medium at 37 °C as described previously (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After labeling, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and subjected to various treatments as shown in Figs. 2 and 4. Triton-insoluble lysate fraction was made as described above and previously (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to WASP or nonimmune serum. Lipids were extracted from the immunoprecipitates and dried in the speed vacuum concentrator. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and spotted on silica gel TLC plates pretreated with 1.2% potassium oxalate in methanol and water (2:3). The plates were developed as described (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and lipid spots were visualized by autoradiography. Nonradioactive phosphoinositide standards (Sigma) were used to identify the 32P-labeled phosphoinositide(s) associated with WASP.FIGURE 4The effects of Rho transduction on PI4P 5-kinase activity and PtdIns P2 association with WASP.A, in vitro kinase assay analysis. Triton-insoluble fraction of lysates made from osteoclasts (OCs) subjected to various treatments as indicated below each lane was used for in vitro phospholipid kinase assay. Lysates were either untreated (lanes 10-15) or treated with PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as, wortmannin (WM; lanes 1-7) and LY290042 (LY; lanes 8 and 9) prior to in vitro kinase assay. Assay was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as well as PI4P and phosphatidylserine as substrates. After the kinase reactions, 32P-labeled lipids were extracted and subjected to thin layer chromatography.

Some lysates were pretreated with PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as WM (100 nm) or LY294002 (10 μm) prior to in vitro kinase assay for 45 min on ice. In vitro kinase assay was performed with minor modifications as described (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Substrates such as PI4P and phosphatidylserine were used. About 0.16 μmol of total phospholipid (80 nmol each) was used for the assay. Phospholipid was dried from a stock solution in chloroform and then sonicated in kinase assay buffer containing 1% cholate. Phospholipid micelles were added to lysates and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 5 min. Ten microliters of solution containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2,5 μm ATP,1 mm DTT, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was then added. The mixture was vortexed gently, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (5:10:2, v/v). Lipids were then extracted and analyzed by TLC as described above and previously (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Treatment of Osteoclasts with Neomycin—After 4 days in culture, osteoclasts were kept in serum-free (PO4-) medium for 2 h. The cells were labeled with [32P]PO4 for 2 h in PO4- and serum-free media for 2 h at 37 °C as described previously (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After labeling, the cells were washed twice with the same serum-free medium and subsequently with the cell permeabilization buffer (120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2). Freshly prepared 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 0.5 unit/ml streptolysin O (Sigma) were added to the buffer at the time of permeabilization. Buffer containing 0.5 units of streptolysin O and 1 mm neomycin was added to osteoclasts and incubated for 3-5 min. Resealing was achieved by the addition of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 10 min. Cells were washed extensively (3 to 4 times) with α-MEM containing 1% serum and 2% BSA and incubated for different time periods as shown in Fig. 2 to determine the PIP2 association with WASP. First, the time- and dose-dependent effects of neomycin on OPN-induced PIP2 interaction with WASP were performed (data not shown). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cell viability was not affected with 1 mm neomycin for 2-3 days. Therefore, 1 mm neomycin was used for the experiments shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6. Subsequent to neomycin treatment, osteoclasts were either treated with OPN or transduced with TAT-proteins. Additionally, control cells in the absence of neomycin were also permeabilized with streptolysin O and treated with PBS or OPN (25 μg/ml) as described above. After various treatments, Triton-insoluble lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with WASP. The associated phospholipids were extracted and subjected to TLC analysis (Fig. 2) as described previously (3Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and above. Unlabeled osteoclasts subjected to various treatments and neomycin as described above were also used for in vitro actin polymerization assay, immunostaining, GST-pull down assay, and Western analyses (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9).FIGURE 6a, the effects of various treatments on the interaction of Cdc42 with WASP.

https://openalex.org/W2090203936,"Mammalian neurofilaments (NFs) are modified by post-translational modifications that are thought to regulate NF assembly and organization. Whereas phosphorylation has been intensely studied, the role of another common modification, the attachment of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to individual serine and threonine residues, is hardly understood. We generated a novel monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes an O-glycosylated epitope in the tail domain of NF-M and allows determination of the glycosylation state at this residue. The antibody displays strong species preference for human NF-M, shows some reactivity with rat but not with mouse or bovine NF-M. By immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of biopsy-derived human temporal lobe tissue we show that immunoreactivity is highly enriched in axons parallel to hyperphosphorylated NFs. Treatment of cultured neurons with the GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc causes a 40% increase in immunoreactivity within 1 h, which is completely reversible and parallels the total increase in cellular O-GlcNAc modification. Treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD-98059 leads to a similar increase in immunoreactivity. In spinal cord tissue of a transgenic rat model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, immunoreactivity is strongly decreased compared with wild-type animals while phosphorylation is increased. The data suggest that hyperphosphorylation and tail domain O-glycosylation of NFs are synchronously regulated in axons of human neurons in situ and that O-glycosylation of NF-M is highly dynamic and closely interweaved with phosphorylation cascades and may have a pathophysiological role.

The data suggest that hyperphosphorylation and tail domain O-glycosylation of NFs are synchronously regulated in axons of human neurons in situ and that O-glycosylation of NF-M is highly dynamic and closely interweaved with phosphorylation cascades and may have a pathophysiological role. Neurofilaments (NFs) 1The abbreviations used are: NF, neurofilament; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; MEM, minimal essential medium; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are the most abundant structural components in large-diameter myelinated axons. Mammalian NFs consist of three major subunits of ∼200, 160, and 70 kDa, termed NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, respectively (1Lee M.K. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Structurally, the NFs contain a N-terminal head and a helical rod domain that are required for filament assembly (2Chin S.S. Macoice P. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 335-350PubMed Google Scholar), and a C-terminal tail domain. NFs are the intrinsic determinant of radial growth of axons, which is most probably mediated by the tail domains of NF-M and NF-H. Whereas genetic deletion of NF-H or its tail domain has relative little effect on radial growth (3Rao M.V. Garcia M.L. Miyazaki Y. Gotow T. Yuan A. Mattina S. Ward C.M. Calcutt N.S. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the tail of NF-M has an important role in the formation of cross-links between NFs and modulation of axonal caliber (4Rao M.V. Campbell J. Yuan A. Kumar A. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Misaccumulation of NFs is a frequent hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy, and Alzheimer disease (5Rao M.V. Nixon R.A. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NFs are among the most highly phosphorylated neuronal proteins. Second messenger-dependent protein kinases such as protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase appear to be the principal kinases targeting the head domain. The tail domain is a preferred substrate for second messenger-independent kinases (6Nixon R.A. Sihag R.K. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), e.g. casein kinase I and II (7Hollander B.A. Bennett G.S. Shaw G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cdk5 (8Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14245-14251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) (9Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the head domain appears to regulate the assembly of NFs (10Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18861-18867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas tail domain phosphorylation may affect their ability to control the axon caliber (12de Waegh S.M. Lee V.M. Brady S.T. Cell. 1992; 68: 451-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Normally, tail domain phosphorylation appears to be restricted to the axon, but in ALS hyperphosphorylation of this domain occurs also in perikarya (13Julien J.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 243-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Attachment of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to individual serine and threonine residues is a common post-translational modification of many nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins (14Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 15Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Vosseller K. Sakabe K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzing O-GlcNAc modification (O-GlcNAc transferase) is essential for cell viability in mammals (17Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D.H. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). O-Glycosylation by GlcNAc appears to be as dynamic as protein phosphorylation and is often reciprocal to phosphorylation at the same or adjacent sites (18Slawson C. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Also NFs are modified by O-linked GlcNAc with several identified sites being located in the head region of NF-L and NF-M (19Dong D.L. Xu Z.S. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Cleveland D.W. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how O-glycosylation of NFs is regulated, how it relates to the phosphorylation of NFs, and where O-glycosylated NFs are distributed. Here we describe a novel monoclonal antibody (NL6) that specifically recognizes an O-glycosylated epitope in the projection domain of NF-M. The antibody displayed a strong species preference for human NF-M. NL6-positive NF-M was enriched in the axons of human neurons in situ. Pharmacological manipulations demonstrated that O-glycosylation as detected with the NL6 antibody is highly dynamic, reversible, and inversely regulated to the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). In a rat model for ALS, NL6 immunoreactivity was strongly decreased compared with wild-type animals. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, cell culture media and supplements from Life Technologies, culture flasks and dishes from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) unless otherwise stated. Collagen was prepared from rat tails by acetic acid extraction (20Piontek J. Chen C.C. Kempf M. Brandt R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) was purchased from Carbogen (Aarau, Switzerland), the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal M20 antibody against a phosphorylation-independent site on NF-M (21Riederer B.M. Porchet R. Marugg R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 364: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. B. M. Riederer (Lausanne, Switzerland). Antibody SMI31 against phosphorylated NF-M and NF-H was purchased from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. (Baltimore, MD), mouse monoclonal antibody against O-glycosylated GlcNAc (CTD110.6), which detects GlcNAc independent from the protein backbone (35Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Covance (Cumberland, VA), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands), mouse monoclonal antibody against the rod domain of NF-M (RMO44) from Stress-Gene (Victoria, BC, Canada), mouse monoclonal antibody against MAP2 from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), mouse monoclonal 2F11 reacting with the phosphorylated form of NF-L from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-p44/42 and total p44/42 MAP kinase from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and mouse monoclonal antibody against actin from Oncogene (San Diego, CA). Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibody were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa 543-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2A from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Preparation of the NL6 Antibody—Mice were immunized with a fraction enriched for components of the human neuronal cytoskeleton. The fraction was prepared from NT2-N neurons and SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells as described previously (22Piontek J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38970-38979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The immunization was performed with the PBS-insoluble material that was solubilized with 8 m urea and diluted to a final concentration of 0.85 m urea in PBS. BALB/c mice were injected 4 times intraperitonally with 50 μg of the protein fraction at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks. Four days after the final injection, spleens were removed and the spleenocytes were fused with the myeloma line X63Ag8.653 as described previously (23Faissner A. Kruse J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 627-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The resulting hybridoma clones were screened for immunoreaction against cytoskeletal proteins. Positive clones were recloned twice to obtain stable antibody producing hybridoma lines and cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 292 μg/ml glutamine. Antibodies were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation of the hybridoma supernatant, resuspended in PBS, dialyzed against PBS, and stored in the presence of 50% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C. For isotype determination, the “isostrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit” from Roche Diagnostics was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. NL6 is a IgG2a antibody with a κ-chain. Because most of the commercially available mouse antibodies belong to the subtype G1, double fluorescence analysis using isotype-specific secondary antibodies becomes possible. Characterization of the antibody by immunocytochemistry revealed that it was sensitive to glutaraldehyde fixation and that the signal was completely lost after fixation for 10 min with 0.3%(v/v) glutaraldehyde. Construction of Expression Vectors—Eukaryotic expression plasmids for hNF-M, mNF-M, and deletion constructs of hNF-M with the C-terminal fused GFP epitope were constructed using the CT-GFP fusion TOPO®TA expression kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). To construct mutated hNF-M, respective codons were changed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). HNF-M(Δ385–472) was prepared by deleting the respective fragment with the restriction enzyme Eco0109I. Constructs with N-terminal-fused GFP were prepared in EGFP C3 Vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). HNF-M(Δ891) was produced using BCUI385, hNF-M(Δ552), with BamHI. To prepare hNF-M(Δ603), an Eco32I restriction site was inserted by changing GT at positions 1813/1814 to AT followed by the respective digest. For hNF-M(Δ789), a Eco32I restriction site was inserted by changing AA at positions 2369/2370 to TG. HNF-M(T747A) was prepared by changing A at position 2248 against G. Mutated constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing using T7 Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—NT2 cells were grown in serum-DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 5% horse serum (HS), 292 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and differentiated essentially as described previously (24Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NT2-N neurons were obtained after 5 weeks differentiation with retinoic acid and 2 weeks treatment with mitotic inhibitors as described previously (20Piontek J. Chen C.C. Kempf M. Brandt R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), plated at 4000 cells/cm2 onto collagen-coated coverslips and cultured for 3 days in serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After this time, almost all neurons had established polarity as judged from axon-specific tau staining. SK-N-BE(2) cells (25Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in serum/Opti-MEM (Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% iron enriched FCS, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and differentiated with 10 μm retinoic acid for 2 weeks. 3T3 cells (26Todaro G.J. Habel K. Green H. Virology. 1965; 27: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were cultured in serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 584 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, HeLa cells (27Scherer W.F. Syverton J.T. Gey G.O. J. Exp. Med. 1953; 97: 695-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) in serum/minimal essential Earle's medium (MEM Earle's Medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and Neuro2A cells (28Olmsted J.B. Carlson K. Klebe R. Ruddle F. Rosenbaum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) in serum/MEM (minimal essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% FCS, 292 μg/ml glutamine and nonessential amino acids for MEM). In some experiments cells were treated with PUGNAc or the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 for 1 h or the times indicated prior to analysis. One day before transfections, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/coverslip on collagen-coated coverslips and transfected with Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 4 μl of FuGENE per coverslip. Cells were processed for immunocytochemistry 48 h after transfection. Preparation of Cellular and Tissue Lysates and Cell Fractionation— For preparation of lysates, cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped off into ice-cold PBS, and collected for 5 min at 300 × g. Tissue was shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, cut with a cryostat in sections to allow a better penetration of the lysis buffer, and collected in a test tube. Pellet and tissue slices were resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant (lysate) collected. For detergent extraction, SK-N-BE(2) cells from one 15-cm TC dish were washed twice with PBS, scraped off into extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA), and collected for 5 min at 300 × g with all steps at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 1%(v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors and incubated for 10 min. 250 μl of the solution were transferred on a 0.85 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged for 30 min at 72,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer. For reassembly of NFs, spinal cords from several adult rats were prepared and frozen in liquid nitrogen. An equal amount (w/v) of disassembly buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) was added, the mixture was homogenized on ice using an electrical blade homogenizer and centrifuged for 30 min at 72,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, cleared by centrifugation, and an equal volume of assembly buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 8 m glycerol) was added. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 45 min at 75,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of assembly buffer. Tissue extracts from different species (human, bovine, rat, and mouse) were prepared as previously described (29Rao M.V. Houseweart M.K. Williamson T.L. Crawford T.O. Folmer J. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized on ice in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm of the protease inhibitors PMSF, aprotinin, and chymostatin. An equal volume of extraction buffer was added (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2% SDS), the homogenates were sonicated for 20 s, boiled for 10 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants saved. Immunohistochemistry, Immunocytochemistry, and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Human temporal lobe tissue was obtained neurosurgically from five patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Material was kept on ice, and gray and white matter were dissected apart. Tissue samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C. For immunohistochemistry, samples were immediately fixed in 4% formalin for 24 h after surgical removal and routinely paraffin-embedded. Deparaffinized 4-μm thick sections were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Delay of formalin fixation for a few hours, or incubation for 1 h at room temperature resulted in substantial loss of staining intensity in 14 samples of surgically resected hippocampi (data not shown). Biotin-labeled secondary antibodies were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin with diaminobenzidine as the substrate. All solutions for the visualization of the antigens were contained in a commercially available detection kit (DAKO ChemMate™, DakoCytomation GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Staining procedures were performed on an autostainer according to routine protocols provided by the manufacturer (DAKO TechMate 500™). As negative controls, primary antibodies were omitted. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was received from all tissue donors. Cultured cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl) containing 4% (w/v) sucrose at room temperature, washed with PBS, incubated for 20 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. Staining was performed as described earlier (30Kempf M. Clement A. Faissner A. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin using appropriate antibody combinations. 5 μg/ml 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was included in the mixture of the secondary antibodies to detect the nuclei. Cells were analyzed using a Leica DMIRB fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS SP2 True confocal scanner (Leica, Solms, Germany). For immunoelectron microscopy, reassembled rat NFs were transferred on pioloform-coated and glow-discharged copper grids (400 mesh), fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 4% (w/v) sucrose, incubated for 20 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and labeled with primary antibodies. After five washes with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, grids were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), washed five times with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with protein A coupled to 15 nm gold. Grids were washed with PBS, postfixed for 30 min with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed 3 × 10 min with water, and contrasted with uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed on a Zeiss 10CR electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA microplate assay (Pierce). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride were performed as described previously (31Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the benchmark protein molecular weight marker (Life Technologies). For dot-blot analysis, samples were diluted with 2 volumes of dot-blot buffer (30% methanol, 0.5% deoxycholate, 9 g/liter NaCl, 1.21 g/liter Tris, pH 7.4) and immobilized on Immobilon NC pure (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a dot-blot hybridization chamber (Loxo, Dossenheim, Germany). In some cases, blots were stained for total protein using Ponceau S or Coomassie Brilliant Blue according to standard procedures (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunodetection used enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) and was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Image acquisition employed a chemo CAM-System (Intas Science Imaging Instruments, Göttingen, Germany) or Fuji LAS3000-System (Raytest, Straubenhart, Germany). Quantification of the blots was carried out with NIH Image 1.61/ppc (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/index.html). Phosphatase treatment was performed by incubating the membrane for 24 h at 37 °C with 20 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (from calf intestinal mucosa) in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF. Phosphatase-treated blots were subjected for immunodetection in parallel with control blots that have been washed with buffer only. For chemical cleavage of β-O-glycosidic linkages, blots were washed for 3 × 10 min with water, incubated for 16 h with 55 mm NaOH at 40 °C, and washed again for 3 × 10 min with water. Blots were subjected for immunodetection in parallel with control blots that have been incubated with water only. Enzymatic digestion of β-glycosidic linkages was performed with Triton-extracted fractions of BE2 cells. 20 μg of protein were incubated with 0.5 unit of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (from bovine kidney) in a total volume of 50 μl in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.0, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 12.5 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Control samples were treated identical, but in the absence of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. 50% of the samples were subjected for immunodetection and processed in parallel for NL6 and M20 staining. Partial chymotryptic digest of intact NFs was performed with Triton-extracted fractions of BE2 cells. 10 μg of protein were incubated with 50 ng of chymotrypsin in a total volume of 18 μl in digestion buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin). The reaction was stopped after different times by addition of PMSF to 4 mm. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C and 12,800 × g and equal amounts of pellet and supernatant were analyzed by immunoblot. Comparison between experimental groups was based on paired Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). NL6, A Novel Monoclonal Antibody against a Human Neuronal Cytoskeleton Fraction, Recognizes an O-Glycosylated Epitope of Human NF-M—In an immunological approach to obtain novel antibodies against components of the human neuronal cytoskeleton, a PBS-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction of human model neurons was prepared and solubilized with urea (see “Experimental Procedures”). The material was used to immunize mice and produce hybridoma lines. One of the antibodies (NL6) detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼160 kDa. The antigen was highly enriched in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of homogenates from differentiated human neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE(2)) cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that NL6 recognizes an intermediate filament protein. The NL6 antigen was up-regulated during differentiation of human neuroblastoma cell lines parallel to NF-M (SK-N-BE(2), SH-SY5Y cells; Fig. 1B, left panel). To determine whether the antigen of NL6 is also expressed in neuronal precursor cells and when it is produced during differentiation, the NT2/NT2-N system was employed. NT2 cells are a human teratocarcinoma cell line with characteristics of central nervous system neuronal progenitor cells that can be differentiated in vitro to yield terminally differentiated, polar, and postmitotic neurons (24Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NL6 antigen was present in lysates of NT2-N cells. In contrast, no signal was observed in NT2 cell lysates (Fig. 1B, right panel), indicating that the NL6 antigen is expressed only in differentiated neurons. The expression pattern was similar albeit not identical to total NF-M as detected using a previously described antibody recognizing NF-M independent of post-translational modifications (M20 (21Riederer B.M. Porchet R. Marugg R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 364: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Riederer B.M. Porchet R. Marugg R.A. Binder L.I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Taken together the data strongly suggest that NL6 detects a subpopulation of NF-M. It is known that in neurons NF-M is highly post-translationally modified (for a review, see Ref. 1Lee M.K. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To test whether NL6 detects a phosphorylated epitope, cellular homogenates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride, and treated with alkaline phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment resulted in a strong reduction of the immunoreactivity with an antibody that detects phosphorylated epitopes in NF-H and NF-M (SMI31) but caused no reduction in M20 or NL6 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C, arrowheads) indicating that binding of NL6 does not depend on phosphorylation of the epitope. To test whether NL6 detects an O-glycosylated epitope, blots from cellular lysates were treated with 55 mm NaOH, which is known to remove β-glycosidically linked Glc-NAc from serine or threonine residues by a reaction called β-elimination (34Duk M. Ugorski M. Lisowska E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The treatment resulted in a complete loss of immunoreactivity with an antibody that recognizes O-linked GlcNAc independent of protein determinants (CTD110.6 (35Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); Fig. 1D, top left panel). Blots from fractions enriched for NFs were treated similarly and probed with NL6 and M20 antibody. Treatment with NaOH resulted in an almost complete loss of NL6 immunoreactivity, whereas M20 staining remained unchanged (Fig. 1D, top right panel). To check whether GlcNAc at the NL6 epitope can also be removed enzymatically, a fraction enriched for neurofilaments was incubated with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from bovine kidney. The treatment resulted in a strong reduction in NL6 immunoreactivity compared with a control sample, whereas M20 staining remained unchanged (Fig. 1D, bottom left panel).

Within recent years, the three-dimensional structures of human galactokinase and two bacterial forms of the enzyme have been determined. Originally, the gene encoding galactokinase in humans was mapped to chromosome 17. An additional gene, encoding a protein with sequence similarity to galactokinase, was subsequently mapped to chromosome 15. Recent reports have shown that this second gene (GALK2) encodes an enzyme with greater activity against GalNAc than galactose. This enzyme, GalNAc kinase, has been implicated in a salvage pathway for the reutilization of free GalNAc derived from the degradation of complex carbohydrates. Here we report the first structural analysis of a GalNAc kinase. The structure of the human enzyme was solved in the presence of MnAMPPNP and GalNAc or MgATP and GalNAc (which resulted in bound products in the active site). The enzyme displays a distinctly bilobal appearance with its active site wedged between the two domains. The N-terminal region is dominated by a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet, whereas the C-terminal motif contains two layers of anti-parallel β-sheet. The overall topology displayed by GalNAc kinase places it into the GHMP superfamily of enzymes, which generally function as small molecule kinases. From this investigation, the geometry of the GalNAc kinase active site before and after catalysis has been revealed, and the determinants of substrate specificity have been defined on a molecular level.

From this investigation, the geometry of the GalNAc kinase active site before and after catalysis has been revealed, and the determinants of substrate specificity have been defined on a molecular level. β-d-Galactose is converted to the more metabolically useful glucose 1-phosphate through the actions of four enzymes that constitute the Leloir pathway (1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In the second step of this pathway, α-d-galactose is phosphorylated at the C-1 position by galactokinase, a MgATP-dependent small molecule kinase (Scheme 1). Defects in the GK1 gene encoding human galactokinase have been shown to give rise to type II galactosemia, clinical symptoms of which include the formation of cataracts at an early age (2Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2471-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structures of the galactokinases from Lactococcus lactis (3Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33305-33311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Pyrococcus furiosus (4Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E.

Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9662-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have been determined. These investigations have demonstrated that the galactokinases share similar molecular architectures with members of the GHMP (galactose kinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) superfamily. The galactokinases fold into two distinct N- and C-terminal domains with their active sites wedged between these motifs. On the basis of the observed MgAMPPNP 2The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and α-d-galactose binding modes to human galactokinase, it has been postulated that two strictly conserved residues, Arg37 and Asp186, may play critical roles in catalysis (5Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9662-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly apparent that the three-dimensional motif exhibited by the galactokinases also serves as a molecular scaffold in transcriptional regulation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of the Leloir pathway are tightly controlled through the action of three key proteins: Gal4p, Gal80p, and Gal3p (6Reece R.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Gal4p functions as a transcriptional activator but is rendered inactive in the presence of Gal80p (7Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For transcription to occur, Gal80p must interact with Gal3p in a manner that is still not entirely understood. What is known, however, is that Gal3p requires both galactose and ATP to interact with Gal80p and that it functions as a ligand sensor. Gal3p shows ∼70 and ∼50% amino acid sequence similarities to yeast and human galactokinases, respectively (8Zenke F.T. Engles R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D.

A. 2000; 97: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The GK1 gene coding for human galactokinase was originally mapped to chromosome 17 (10Elsevier S.M. Kucherlapati R.S. Nichols E.A. Creagan R.P. Giles R.E. Ruddle F.H. Willecke K. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1974; 251: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Stambolian D. Ai Y. Sidjanin D. Nesburn K. Sathe G. Rosenberg M. Bergsma D.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A second gene encoding a putative galactokinase, with ∼35% amino acid sequence identity, was subsequently reported that mapped to chromosome 15, suggesting, perhaps, that humans contain two galactokinases (12Lee R.T. Peterson C.L. Calman A.F. Herskowitz I. O'Donnell J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10887-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These apparently contradicting reports for the chromosomal location of human galactokinase have been reconciled through the recent studies of Pastuszak et al. (13Pastuszak I. O'Donnell J. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23653-23656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20776-20782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the gene located on chromosome 15 does not, in fact, encode a bona fide galactokinase but rather a GalNAc kinase ((Scheme 1). Given the ubiquitous role of GalNAc in complex carbohydrates, it is not surprising that this enzyme has been postulated to function in a salvage pathway for recycling free GalNAc. A detailed analysis of the porcine protein has demonstrated that the enzyme is very specific for GalNAc, in striking contrast to galactokinase, which has no activity against this sugar. Additionally, ATP has been shown to be the best phosphate donor (14Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20776-20782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the observed substrate specificity of the enzyme, we initiated a structural analysis of human GalNAc kinase. Here we report the high resolution three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in the presence of either GalNAc and MnAMPPNP or its reaction products, GalNAc 1-phosphate and MgADP. From this x-ray analysis, the overall molecular architecture of the enzyme has been revealed, and the observed substrate specificity of the enzyme has been defined on a molecular level. Cloning of the Human GK2 Gene—The human GK2 gene was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 3504930 (The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium) purchased from ATCC such that the forward and reverse primers added NdeI and XhoI cloning sites, respectively. The gene was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), followed by A-tailing and ligation into pGEM-T vector (Promega). This vector was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The GK2 gene was subsequently sequenced in the pGEM-T vector construct with the ABI Prism™ Big Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosciences, Inc.) to confirm the integrity of the PCR product. The pGEM-T vector construct was then digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the gene was separated from digestion by-products on a 1.0% agarose gel. The gene was excised from the gel, purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and ligated into the expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) that was previously digested with NdeI and XhoI. The pET28 plasmid had also been previously altered such that its thrombin cleavage site had been replaced with the recognition sequence for TEV protease, resulting in a construct that contains an additional 20 amino acid residues at the N terminus with the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSENLYFQGH. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and grown on LB/agar plates for selection with kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and cultured overnight. The plasmid DNA was subsequently extracted with QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were tested for insertion of the GK2 gene by digestion with NdeI and XhoI. Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression, the pET28-GK2 plasmid was used to transform E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells (Novagen). A starter culture from a single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin. Subsequently, 10 ml were transferred to 1000 ml of supplemented TB media (50 mg/liter kanamycin) in a 2-liter shaker flask and grown at 37 °C until an optical density of ∼0.8 was achieved at 600 nm. The cultures were then transferred to a shaker at room temperature (∼20 °C) and allowed to grow until an optical density of greater than 1.8 was obtained, at which point isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mm. Cell growth was allowed to continue at room temperature for an additional 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells (125 g) were thawed in 500 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The thawed cells were placed in an ice bath and disrupted by five rounds of sonication (1-min duration each) separated by 5 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 12-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with lysis buffer until the absorbance reading at 280 nm reached background level. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris and 25 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The dialyzed protein was further purified by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a 6-ml Resource-Q column. The protein was eluted at pH 8.0 (25 mm Tris) with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mm NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were again pooled based on purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris and 200 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and then concentrated to 14.5 mg/ml based on the extinction coefficient of 1.35 cm/(mg·ml) as calculated with the program Protean (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). A typical yield was ∼200 mg of protein/125 g of cells. Note that the His tag was not removed prior to crystallization trials. Crystallization of GalNAc Kinase—A search for crystallization conditions was conducted at both room temperature and at 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion utilizing an “in-house” designed sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions. The best crystals were observed growing at pH 6 from polyethylene glycol 3400 solutions in the presence of either MgAMPPNP or MnAMPPNP and GalNAc at room temperature. These conditions were optimized with crystals being routinely grown in 7–14 days from 10 mm MnAMPPNP, 100 mm GalNAc, 16–20% polyethylene glycol 3400, 200 mm LiCl, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). They achieved maximum dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.5 × 0.2 mm and belong to the space group P65 with unit cell dimensions of approximately a = b = 118 Å and c = 65 Å. The asymmetric unit contained one monomer. Crystals were also obtained in the presence of GalNAc and MgATP (which turned over to product in the active site). Whereas these belonged to the same space group, P65, the unit cell dimensions were slightly different at a = b = 124 Å, and c = 60 Å. Preparation of Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—Cultures of E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid encoding the human GK2 gene were grown overnight in M9 minimal media at 37 °C. Subsequently, 15 ml of the overnight culture were used to inoculate each of 12 × 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of M9 minimal media supplemented with 5 mg/liter thiamine. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of ∼0.9 at 600 nm and then cooled for 10 min in an ice water bath. They were then transferred to an incubator at 16 °C, and each flask was supplemented with 50 mg each of lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine and 25 mg each of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and selenomethionine. Following 20 min of additional growth, the cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for an additional 18 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified to homogeneity according to the procedure described above. Crystallization of Selenomethionine-labeled GalNAc Kinase—Crystals of the selenomethionine-labeled protein were grown under the same conditions as the wild-type protein, except that MgATPγS was employed as the nucleotide analog, since it yielded better crystals than using MgAMPPNP or MnAMPPNP. The observed unit cell dimensions were similar to those obtained for the wild-type enzyme complexed with MnAMPPNP. X-ray Data Collection—Crystals were stabilized for x-ray data collection by first harvesting them into a synthetic mother liquor containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3400, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm LiCl, 10 mm MnAMPPNP, 100 mm GalNAc, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). The crystals were frozen by rapid transfer into a cryoprotectant solution composed of 35% polyethylene glycol 3400, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm LiCl, 10 mm MnAMPPNP, 100 mm GalNAc, 12% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). X-ray data were collected from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein and from crystals of the enzyme complexed with MgATP and GalNAc on a CCD detector at SBC Beamline 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). For the complex with MnAMPPNP and GalNAc, the x-ray data were collected at 100 K with a Bruker AXS Platinum 135 CCD detector controlled with the Proteum software suite (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI). The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator equipped with montel optics and operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with SAINT (version V7.06A; Bruker AXS) and internally scaled with SADABS (version 2005/1; Bruker AXS).

Open table in a new tab X-ray Structural Analyses—The structure of human GalNAc kinase was solved via MAD phasing with crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein. The software package SOLVE was utilized to determine the positions of 11 out of the 13 selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit and to generate initial protein phases (figure of merit = 0.70) (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening with RESOLVE (figure of merit = 0.85) resulted in an interpretable electron density map calculated to 2.3 Å resolution (17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The map allowed for a complete tracing of the polypeptide chain (458 amino acids) with the exception of the residues between Ala430 and Lys440. The structure obtained from the MAD phasing was then employed as a search model to solve the structure of the enzyme complexed with MgATP and GalNAc via molecular replacement with the program AMORE (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 645-653Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Alternate cycles of manual model building and least squares refinement with the software package TNT reduced the R-factor to 16.8% for all measured x-ray data from 30.0 to 1.65 Å resolution (19Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Relevant refinement statistics are presented in TABLE TWO.

Ramachandran plots for both complexes are given in the supplemental materials. There are no significant outliers in either model. Overall Structure of the Enzyme with Bound Products—Human GalNAc kinase contains 458 amino acid residues and packs in the P65 unit cell with one polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit. On the basis of the symmetry elements contained within this space group, which include only 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold screw axes, it can be concluded that the enzyme exists as a monomer. GalNAc kinase from porcine kidney has also been reported to function as a monomer (14Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20776-20782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A ribbon representation of the molecule, with overall dimensions of ∼69 × 54 × 64 Å, is presented in Fig. 1a. The N-terminal domain is dominated by a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet with the two parallel strands formed by Ala7 to Val11 and Leu453 to Ala458. The C-terminal domain contains two distinct regions of anti-parallel β-sheet, with each layer containing four stands. A total of 14 major α-helices surround the β-sheets of the N- and C-terminal domains. Pro209, which is located in a random coil region connecting β-strands 9 and 10 in the C-terminal domain, adopts the cis-conformation. Ser146–Leu162 form an α-helix that is situated with its positive helix dipole moment projecting toward the β-phosphoryl group of the ADP (Fig. 1a). In this complex, the polypeptide chain extends from Ala2 to Ala458 with two breaks between Asn97 and Ile100 and Ala430 to Lys440 (Fig. 1a). The electron density map for the protein crystallized in the presence of its substrates, GalNAc and MgATP, clearly reveals the presence of products in the active site as can be seen in Fig. 1b. The ligands are well ordered with average B-factors of 16.7 and 16.8 Å2 for the sugar and nucleotide, respectively. The Mg2+ ion has a B value of 9.4 Å2. The ribose of the ADP adopts the C3′-endo pucker, and the adenine ring is the anti-conformation. Both Tyr88 in and Trp107 form stacking interactions with the adenine ring of the nucleotide (Fig. 1b). Trp107 is strictly conserved among galactokinase sequences deposited in the Swiss-Prot data bank thus far. A stereo view of the active site, within 3.2 Å of the ligands, is presented in Fig. 1c. The Mg2+ ion is surrounded in an octahedral coordination sphere with metal-ligand bond distances ranging between 2.2 and 2.4 Å. Oγ of Ser147 and a phosphoryl oxygen of GalNAc 1-phosphate provide the axial ligands, whereas two well ordered water molecules (B values of 14.1 and 14.6 Å2) and an α- and a β-phosphoryl oxygen of the ADP serve as the equatorial ligands. Most of the interactions between the protein and the adenine and ribose groups of ADP are mediated via water molecules. There is one direct hydrogen bond between the adenine ring and the side chain of Asn83. The pyrophosphate group of ADP is anchored protein via the backbone amide groups of Ser141, Gly143, Ser146, Ser147, and Lys234. Additionally, Oγ of Ser146, Nδ2 of Asn, Nζ of Lys, and two water molecules lie within 3.2 Å of the pyrophosphate moiety. Lys234 is very well ordered, with an average B-factor of 18.1 Å2. Key amino acid residues involved in positioning GalNAc 1-phosphate within the active site include Arg43, Glu49, His50, Asp52, Ser145, Gly187, Asp190, and Ala402. There are four water molecules that also interact with the sugar moiety. The 1-phosphorus of the sugar product is situated at 4.8 Å from the β-phosphorus of the ADP. Structure of the Enzyme in the Presence of MnAMPPNP and GalNAc—GalNAc kinase belongs to the GHMP superfamily, which also includes homoserine kinase (20Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4510-4515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the case of mevalonate kinase, it has been postulated that a conserved aspartate serves as an active site base to abstract the proton from the C-5 hydroxyl group of mevalonate that is ultimately phosphorylated (21Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Yang D. Shipman L.W. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9462-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is an apparent absence of a catalytic base in homoserine kinase, however (24Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rather, it has been suggested that the catalytic mechanism of homoserine kinase proceeds through a mechanism whereby the close positioning of the substrate and the γ-phosphate of the ATP results in direct transfer of the proton from the δ-OH group of homoserine to the γ-phosphate of ATP and attack of the δ-oxygen on the γ-phosphorus. In both of these proposals, there is the tacit assumption that phosphoryl transfer occurs through an associative transition state. This is in striking contrast to studies demonstrating that reactions of ATP in solution proceed via a dissociative, metaphosphate-like transition state (26Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Both human galactokinase and GalNAc kinase contain a similarly positioned aspartate residue as that observed in mevalonate kinase. Yet kinetic analyses of both yeast and human galactokinases suggest that proton transfer does not play a key role in the rate-determining step of catalysis (27Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In an attempt to mimic the Michaelis complex for GalNAc kinase, the protein was crystallized in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog AMPPNP (29Nakamaye K.L. Wells J.A. Bridenbaugh R.L. Okamoto Y. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5226-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and GalNAc. Overall, the polypeptide chains for this complex and that with bound products are virtually identical and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å. A close-up view of the environment around the GalNAc ligand is displayed in Fig. 2a. Again, the metal ion, in this case manganese, is octahedrally coordinated by three phosphoryl oxygens donated by the nucleotide: two water molecules and Oγ of Ser147. Both Arg43 and Lys234 are located near the γ-phosphoryl group, possibly enhancing its electrophilic character. In this complex, however, Lys234 is not well ordered (B-factor of 43.8 Å2), and difference electron density maps indicate a second conformation for this residue that swings out away from the active site. Asp190, which is absolutely conserved among the galactokinases, lies within 3.1 Å of the 1-hydroxyl group of sugar. Importantly, however, Oδ1 and Oδ2 of Asp190 also lie within 2.8 and 3.1 Å, respectively, of Nη2 of Arg43. Given the surrounding environment, it is difficult to envision how Asp190 could function as an active site base to remove the proton from the 1-hydroxyl group of GalNAc. Note that the 1-hydroxyl group of GalNAc is positioned at 3.1 and 2.5 Å from two of the γ-phosphoryl oxygens and 3.1 Å of the γ-phosphorus of the AMPPNP. Shown in Fig. 2b is a superposition of the active sites before and after catalysis. As can be seen, the active site is ideally suited for positioning the 1-hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate in the correct orientation for direct attack at the γ-phosphorus. The reaction may not, in fact, require a catalytic base but rather proceed via approximation and perhaps through a metaphosphate-like transition state. In this situation, the bond between the γ-phosphorus and the bridging oxygen is largely broken, which results in a build-up of negative charge on the bridging oxygen and positive charge on the phosphorus as discussed in Ref. 26Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar. Movement of the γ-phosphorus toward the 1-hydroxyl group of GalNAc could effectively lower its pKa, resulting in proton transfer to Asp190. Similar mechanisms have been proposed previously for GTP hydrolysis by transducin α (30Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and p21ras (31Schweins T. Langen R. Warshel A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and ATP hydrolysis by myosin subfragment-1 (33Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 34Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). That different members of the GHMP superfamily have been suggested to proceed via contrasting reaction mechanisms is, indeed, intriguing. It is possible that, in fact, they actually function by similar mechanisms that are not completely understood at this time. Comparison of Human GalNAc Kinase and Human Galactokinase—GalNAc kinase is substantially larger, with 458 versus 392 amino acid residues for human galactokinase. Highlighted in Fig. 3a are the three regions where these two enzymes differ significantly. Excluding these areas, however, the two proteins superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å for 332 structurally equivalent α-carbon atoms. The first region where these two proteins differ is at the N terminus, labeled A in Fig. 3a. While both polypeptides initiate with an extended chain, in human galactokinase, this region abuts the C-terminal domain. In GalNAc kinase, however, residues Ala7 to Val11 actually form the seventh strand of the mixedβ-sheet in the N-terminal domain. The second significant difference between these two proteins occurs at Gly251 in galactokinase and Ala255 in GalNAc kinase. There is a 19-residue insertion in GalNAc kinase that folds into two additional helices. The largest insertion in GalNAc kinase, relative to galactokinase, occurs at Leu290. Here a 31-residue insertion folds into two α-helices defined by Pro297–Leu304 and Leu308–Gln314. The substrate specificity for human GalNAc was addressed in a study published several years ago (13Pastuszak I. O'Donnell J. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23653-23656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). While the most favored substrate for the enzyme is GalNAc, it can also turn over galactose, albeit when the sugar is present in millimolar concentrations. Substrate specificity studies of human galactokinase have also been recently conducted and have revealed that the enzyme cannot turn over GalNAc (35Timson D.J. Reece R.J. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The two enzymes share an approximate 35% amino acid sequence identity. A superposition near the sugar binding pockets of human galactokinase and GalNAc kinase is presented in Fig. 3b. The first noticeable difference in the binding pockets is the interaction in galactokinase between the 4-hydroxyl group of galactose and Oη of Tyr236. In GalNAc kinase, this tyrosine is replaced with a phenylalanine. The more important difference, however, is near the N-acetyl group of GalNAc. In human galactokinase, the positions of both Met180 and Cys182 preclude the possibility of the enzyme accepting GalNAc as a substrate. The more bulky GalNAc ligand is accommodated in GalNAc kinase by the substitution of Met180 with a threonine and Cys182 with a glycine. Conclusions—Sugars often play major roles in the biological effectiveness of such clinically relevant compounds as erythromycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, and digitoxin (36Thorson J.S. Vogt T. Wong C.-W. Glycosylated Natural Products. Carbohydrate-Based Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2002Google Scholar). As such, there is an increasing effort among various laboratories to alter the glycosylation patterns of these drugs to produce novel therapeutics. One approach that has been championed of late is the so-called “in vitro glycorandomization” method whereby chemically synthesized sugars are activated and subsequently attached to natural products via promiscuous nucleotidyl-transferases and glycosyltransferases (37Thorson J.S. Barton W.A. Hoffmeister D. Albermann C. Nikolov D.B. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Galactokinase, as a biological catalyst, has sparked renewed interest for its use in the preparation of modified sugar phosphates. Thus far, a variant of the E. coli galactokinase (Y371H) has demonstrated a marked increase in substrate flexibility with respect to modifications at C-2, C-3, and C-5 but not at C-4 (38Hoffmeister D. Yang J. Liu L. Thorson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13184-13189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Quite strikingly, the same mutation in the L. lactis enzyme (Y385H) resulted in a protein displaying kinase activity toward several C-4-substituted sugars (39Yang J. Liu L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These contrasting results from the E. coli and L. lactis enzymes emphasize the advantages of optimizing additional enzymes for synthetic purposes. The structure of human GalNAc kinase presented here represents yet another protein platform for the eventual production of novel sugar phosphates.

GnRH gene expression is highly dynamic. Its transcriptional activity is regulated in a complex spatiotemporal manner during embryonic development and postnatal life. Although a variety of transcription factors have been identified as regulators of GnRH transcription, most are promiscuous in their DNA-binding requirements, and none are solely expressed in GnRH neurons. Their specific activity is probably determined by interactions with distinct cofactors. Here we find that the Groucho-related gene (GRG) family of co-repressors is expressed in a model cell line for the GnRH neuron and co-expresses with GnRH during prenatal development. GRG proteins associate in vivo with the GnRH promoter. Furthermore, GRG proteins interact with two regulators of GnRH transcription, the homeodomain proteins MSX1 and OCT1. Co-transfection experiments indicate that GRG proteins regulate GnRH promoter activity. The long GRG forms enhance MSX1 repression and counteract OCT1 activation of the GnRH gene. In contrast, the short form, GRG5, has a dominant-negative effect on MSX1-dependent repression. Taken together, these data suggest that the dynamic switch between activation and repression of GnRH transcription is mediated by recruitment of the GRG co-regulators.

The formation of unique transcription factor complexes determines the intricate spatial and temporal expression of genes during development as well as in terminal differentiation (1Wolberger C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An example of combinatorial regulation by multiple factors can be seen in cell-specific transcription of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; AES, amino-terminal enhancer of split subgroup; DIG, digoxigenin; eh1, engrailed homology domain; GRG, Groucho-related gene; HSD, honestly significant difference; NLS, nuclear localization signal; Q, glutamine-rich domain; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; TLE, transducin-like enhancer of split; GST, glutathione S-transferase. gene. GnRH, a central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of the reproductive system, is expressed in a discrete population of neuronal cells (2Vale W. Rivier C. Brown M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1977; 39: 473-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These neurons, scattered throughout the basal hypothalamus in the adult (3Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), release GnRH in a pulsatile manner. Due to the difficulties in studying the small and dispersed population of GnRH neurons, cultured cell models for GnRH neurons, the GT1-7 and NLT/Gn11 cell lines, were developed by targeted oncogenesis (4Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 5Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nicols D.K. Nakayama Y.

These model cell lines provided the first insight into the transcriptional regulation of GnRH expression. Using these models, evolutionarily conserved enhancer and promoter elements conferring neuron-specific activation in culture were identified (-1863 to -1571 and -173 to +1, respectively, in the rat sequence) (6Eraly S.A.

Furthermore, these regulatory sequences were sufficient for targeting a substantial population of GnRH neurons in transgenic mice (10Pape J.R. Skynner M.J. Allen N.D. Herbison A.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lawson M.A. MacConell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20018-20023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GnRH promoter activity appears to change during development in accordance with the location of the GnRH neurons. Whereas a low level of expression is detected in the nasal region, promoter activity dramatically increases as the neurons enter the anterior forebrain (15Simonian S.X. Herbison A.E. Neuroendocrinology. 2001; 73: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, GnRH gene expression increases gradually, shortly after birth, preceding the increase in GnRH secretion that drives puberty (16Ebling F.J. Cronin A.S. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: R23-R33Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data emphasize the need for highly flexible transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Thus far, the identification of transcriptional activators has contributed valuable information regarding the up-regulation of GnRH gene expression (9Givens M.L. Kurotani R. N. R.-H. Miller N.L.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Kelley C.G. Lavorgna G. Clark M.E. Boncinelli E. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The majority of these activators are homeodomain proteins, which typically have promiscuous DNA-binding properties. Their specific activity may therefore be determined by interactions with particular cofactors (22Biggin M.D. McGinnis W. Development. 1997; 124: 4425-4433PubMed Google Scholar). Such cofactors can enhance or, alternatively, inhibit the interactions between the homeodomain proteins and the transcriptional machinery as well as the chromatin template and consequently alter the function of the transcription factors themselves (23Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this concept, the POU domain protein OCT1, an essential activator of GnRH transcription in the GT1-7 cells (20Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Eraly S.A. Nelson S.B. Huang K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was also shown to function as a downstream regulator in hormone-induced repression of the GnRH gene (25Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Zheng Z. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20412-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Chandran U.R. DeFranco D.B.

Furthermore, DLX2, an activator, and MSX1, a transcriptional repressor, were shown to functionally antagonize each other by competing for the ATTA elements within the GnRH regulatory region (28Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19156-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The dynamic exchange between activation and repression, observed with OCT1 and DLX2/MSX1 is probably facilitated by specific co-regulators. Intriguingly, none of the transcription factors shown yet to regulate the GnRH gene is exclusively expressed in the GnRH neuron (31He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 32Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Transcriptional cofactors in this rare cell type might therefore be involved in promoting tissue-specific expression. In the current study, we searched for OCT1 cofactors in the GT1-7 cells. This approach led to the isolation of GRG5, a member of the Groucho-related gene (GRG) family of co-regulators. We show that GRG family members physically and functionally interact with the homeodomain proteins MSX1 and OCT1 to regulate GnRH gene expression. Furthermore, the Grg family is co-expressed with GnRH during prenatal stages in the mouse and may contribute to early regulation of GnRH gene expression in vivo. Two-hybrid Interaction Screen in Yeast—To isolate cDNAs encoding GT1-7 proteins that associate with OCT1, we first created a randomly primed GT1-7 cDNA library (using poly(A)+ mRNA) fused C-terminally to the transactivation domain of the VP16 protein. The yeast strains and expression vectors (generous gift of Dr. Michel Strubin) have been previously described (19Rave-Harel N. Givens M.L. Nelson S.B. Duong H.A. Coss D. Clark M.E. Hall S.B.

Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The GT1-7 cDNA library was introduced into the reporter strain using the method of Schiestl and Gietz (34Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), except that the lithium acetate solution contained 1 m sorbitol, and that sheared herring testis DNA (10 mg/ml) (Clontech) was used as carrier DNA. After induction of the library proteins, cells were plated on galactose synthetic medium lacking histidine, containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole, and assayed for OCT1-mediated stimulation of the selectable His gene transcription as previously described (19Rave-Harel N. Givens M.L. Nelson S.B. Duong H.A. Coss D. Clark M.E. Hall S.B. Kamps M.P. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30287-30297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmids were recovered from the yeast using the method of Robzyk and Kassir (35Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The sequences of the GT1-7 cDNA clones were determined by the chain termination method. Antibody Production and Immunocytochemistry—GRG5 full-length cDNA was cloned into a pET28 vector containing the Staphylococcus aureus protein A zz domain fused to a His6 tag (zz-pET28) to produce a zz-tagged fragment. Recombinant protein was expressed in bacteria, isolated on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and used to immunize a rabbit (Covance). Antibody was affinity-purified against the same GRG5 protein coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 150,000 cells/well. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (36Jacobs S.B.R. Coss D. McGillivray S.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1470-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with minor differences. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum, stained with GRG5 antibody (1 h, 1:500 dilution), and detected with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (30 min, 1:100 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Following washes, coverslips were mounted in Vectashield solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining (Vector) and visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were carried out as detailed by Rave-Harel et al. (19Rave-Harel N. Givens M.L. Nelson S.B. Duong H.A. Coss D. Clark M.E. Hall S.B. Kamps M.P. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30287-30297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with certain modifications. Mouse embryos were removed at 13.5 days postcoitum, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7–10-μm thickness. Slides containing embryo sections were deparaffinized with xylene washes, hydrated in ethanol/water solutions, and digested with proteinase K for 7 min at 37 °C, followed by postfixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 2× SSC for 5 min and then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled (DIG) sense and antisense probes for Grg1 or Grg5. The hybridized DIG-labeled probe was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a dilution of 1:2000 and visualized with the chromogen combination 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. Antisense and sense probes were created by incubating 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA with 10× DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) as well as 5× transcription buffer (Promega) and the RNA polymerase T7, T3, or Sp6 for 2 h at 37 °C. The antisense Grg1 probe corresponds to the sequence encoded from the 3′ end of the cDNA until the endogenous BglII site, and the antisense Grg5 sequence corresponds to the entire cDNA, +1120 to +1 of the murine gene. After the in situ hybridization, slides were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. These slides were soaked in buffer to stabilize and retrieve the antigen (1 mm citric acid, 8 mm sodium citrate) for 20 min at 65 °C. Immunohistochemistry was then performed as previously described (11Lawson M.A. MacConell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The GnRH peptide was recognized with the LR1 antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 (gift of R. Benoit) and visualized using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ABC kit (Vector). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (37Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Chromatin of GT1-7 cells was cross-linked for 10 min using formaldehyde. The resulting chromatin solution was precipitated with polyclonal GRG1 and GRG4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or acetyl-specific histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The following day, chromatin-antibody complexes were isolated from the solution by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry, preblocked with 100 μg/ml sonicated Escherichia coli DNA and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) while being rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were harvested and washed as described previously (37Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was reversed by the addition of NaCl to final concentration of 300 mm and incubation overnight at 65 °C. Chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted from the Sepharose beads by the addition of 10% SDS and proteinase K and subsequent incubation at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the GnRH promoter sequence by PCR using primers for the evolutionarily conserved murine sequence, -253 to -19. Protein Production and GST Retention Assay—Expression vectors used for protein production included the full-length human Oct1 and the POU domain of Oct1 in the PCR2.1 vector, the mouse Grg4 in pGEM vector, the mouse Grg5 and Grg5ΔQ in the cytomegalovirus vector (38Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and the mouse Msx1 in the Bluescript vector (39Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation were performed with the Promega TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, employing Sp6, T7, or T3 polymerase. [35S]Methionine was used for labeling the protein products. Translation mix containing no vector was used as a control for unprogrammed translation in the reticulocyte lysate. GST fusion OCT1 and GRG5 were created by cloning the human Oct1 and the mouse Grg5 cDNAs into the pGEX-4T1 vector. GST-GRG4 and GST-GRG4Q (40Eberhard D. Jimenez G. Heavey B. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2292-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) as well as GST-MSX1 and GST-MSX1ΔHD (39Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were previously described. GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (19Rave-Harel N. Givens M.L. Nelson S.B. Duong H.A. Coss D.

The interaction assay was performed in accordance with the method described by Zappavigna et al. (41Zappavigna V. Sartori D. Mavilio F. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Samples were separated using a 10% SDS-gel, after which the gel was fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-BioMax film at -80 °C. Co-Immunoprecipitation—GT1-7 cells were transfected with a FLAG-MSX1 expression vector and used for preparation of nuclear extracts, as previously described (42Schreiber E. Merchant R.E. Wiestler O.D. Fontana A. Neurosurgery. 1994; 34: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein G-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow beads were incubated with either mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C while rotating. After washing away unbound antibody, the protein G-Sepharose-antibody conjugates were incubated overnight with GT1-7 nuclear extract expressing FLAG-MSX1 at 4 °C while rotating in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). After washing in buffer containing normal and higher salt concentration (250 mm NaCl), SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were incubated at 90 °C for 5 min. Samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T and probed with anti-GRG1 (anti-TLE1, M101; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was then applied, and the signal was visualized using the SuperSignal™ West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transfections—GT1-7 cells were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 4.5 mg/ml glucose in an atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with Fugene (Roche Applied Science) in 24-well multidishes. The expression plasmids used for co-transfections included the mouse Grg5 in the FLAG-cytomegalovirus vector (43Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), the mouse Grg4 in the pCi vector, the human Oct1 in the pcDNA1.1 vector, the mouse Msx1 in the pCB6+- vector (39Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and empty vectors as negative controls. The reporter plasmids contained the GnRH enhancer (-1863 to -1571) fused to the RSV promoter (GnRHe/RSVp), the RSV enhancer fused to the GnRH promoter (-173 to +112) (RSVe/GnRHp), the RSV enhancer fused to the RSV promoter (RSVe/RSVp), and four copies of the region from -1802 to -1762 of the GnRH enhancer fused to the RSV promoter, each in a pGL3 vector driving luciferase expression. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of expression plasmids, 400 ng of reporter plasmid, and 200 ng of the internal control, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase -109 promoter on β-galactosidase. Cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection, lysed, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression as previously described (18Lawson M.A. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3596-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Groucho-related Gene Family Is Expressed in GT1-7 Cells—OCT1 and the other transcription factors, characterized thus far as regulators of GnRH gene transcription, have promiscuous DNA-binding specificities and are not exclusively expressed in GnRH neurons. Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify OCT1 cofactors that might facilitate restricted expression of GnRH (19Rave-Harel N. Givens M.L. Nelson S.B. Duong H.A. Coss D. Clark M.E. Hall S.B. Kamps M.P. Mellon P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30287-30297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using the method of Strubin et al. (33Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) with a GT1-7 cDNA library, we isolated a member of the Groucho-related gene family of cofactors, GRG5. Groucho-related proteins (GRG in rodents and transducin-like enhancer of split, TLE, in humans) are the vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila Groucho (44Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene. 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 45Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These proteins interact directly with sequence-specific transcription factors in addition to histones (46Palaparti A. Baratz A. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the basal transcription machinery (47Yu X. Li P. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell.

Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The GRG family includes several characterized members, GRG1–GRG6. GRG5, a truncated version of these co-regulators, belongs to the amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES) subgroup (53Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Having identified GRG5 in our yeast two-hybrid screen, we looked for the presence of GRG family members in the GT1-7 cells. By Western blot analyses, GRG1–GRG5 were expressed in the nuclear extract of GT1-7 cells as well as protein extract from embryonic mouse aged 9.5 days postcoitum, which was used as a positive control (53Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In addition, using immunocytochemistry, GRG5 was localized in the nucleus of GT1-7 cells (Fig. 1B). We also detected the presence of the GRG family members in another cell model for the GnRH neuron, NLT, by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Therefore, several members of the GRG family are expressed in our model GnRH neuronal cell lines and may be available for complex formation with OCT1 in those cells. Grg1 and Grg5 Co-localize with the GnRH Neurons during Embryonic Development—As components of the Notch signaling cascade, the Groucho-related genes are expressed during embryonic segmentation, neurogenesis, and epithelial differentiation (54Paroush Z.

Transcripts of Grg family members are present early in embryonic development starting on day 6.5 postcoitum in the mouse. At later embryonic stages (12–16 days postcoitum), Grg transcripts are present in the olfactory epithelium, olfactory lobe, the ventricular zone of the brain and spinal cord, the outer layers of the cerebral cortex, the lung and kidney epithelia, and salivary gland (53Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 57Leon C. Lobe C.G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whereas specific patterns of expression are seen during development, Grg transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in the adult mouse (53Mallo M. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 55Dehni G. Liu Y. Husain J. Stifani S. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 57Leon C. Lobe C.G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the aim of defining Grg expression in relation to the expression of GnRH, we performed double in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on parasagittal sections of mouse embryos 13.5 days postcoitum. On this day of prenatal development, the entire population of GnRH neurons has been established, and the cells are migratory, leaving the vomeronasal organ, crossing the cribriform plate to enter the rostroventral forebrain (3Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). GnRH promoter activity is highly dynamic at this stage (15Simonian S.X. Herbison A.E. Neuroendocrinology. 2001; 73: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to confirm that GRG family members, as candidate cofactors for regulating dynamic promoter activity, co-localize with GnRH neurons at this time poin"
https://openalex.org/W2031086409,"Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cells grow longitudinally in a manner dependent on a polarized distribution of their interphase microtubules. We found that this distribution required sliding of microtubules toward the cell center along preexisting microtubules. This sliding was mediated by the minus end-directed kinesin motor Klp2, which helped microtubules to become properly organized with plus ends predominantly oriented toward the cell ends and minus ends toward the cell center. Thus, interphase microtubules in the fission yeast require motor activities for their proper organization."
https://openalex.org/W1995114985,"The adhesion of the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis to host cell surface proteoglycan, mediated by the integral outer membrane proteins OpcA and Opa, plays an important part in the processes of colonization and invasion by the bacterium. The precise specificities of the OpcA and Opa proteins are, however, unknown. Here we use a fluorescence-based binding assay to show that both proteins bind to mono- and disaccharides with high affinity. Binding of saccharides caused a quench in the intrinsic fluorescence emission of both proteins, and mutation of selected Tyr residues within the external loop regions caused a substantial decrease in fluorescence. We suggest that the intrinsic fluorescence arises from resonance energy transfer from Tyr to Trp residues in the β-barrel portion of the structure. OpcA bound sialic acid with a Kd of 0.31 μm and was shown to be specific for pyranose saccharides. The binding specificities of two different Opa proteins were compared; unlike OpcA, neither protein bound to monosaccharides, but both bound to maltose, lactose, and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides, with Kd values in the micromolar range. OpaB had a 10-fold higher affinity for sialic acid-containing ligands than OpaD as a result of the mutation Y165V, which was shown to restore this specificity to OpaD. Finally, the OpcA- and Opa-dependent adhesion of meningococci to epithelial cells was shown to be partially inhibited by exogenously added sialic acid and maltose. The results show that OpcA and the Opa proteins can be thought of as outer membrane lectins and that simple saccharides can modulate their recognition of complex proteoglycan receptors.

Heyde A. David G. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A gonococcal Opa protein, MS11-Opa30, can be bound and eluted from heparin-agarose in a similar fashion to OpcA (23van Putten J.P.M. Paul S.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2144-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The second class of Opa ligands is the human CEACAM family of cell surface molecules, which are also specific for certain Opa variants (7Virji M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 260-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); this is a protein-protein interaction that is not dependent on the glycosylation state of the CEACAM molecules (33Bos M.P. Kuroki M. Krop-Watorek A. Hogan D. Belland R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9584-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, distinct from glycosaminoglycan binding.Although the binding of OpcA and Opa proteins to glycan ligands has been well described at the cellular level, there is little information currently available concerning the specificities of individual proteins for particular saccharide ligands. The crystal structure of OpcA has shown that the protein adopts a 10-stranded β-barrel structure, with extensive loop regions that protrude above the surface of the outer membrane (34Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The five external loop regions pack together to form a deep crevice ∼8 Å wide, 22 Å long, and 11 Å deep, which could form a binding site for saccharide ligands. There is currently no crystal structure of an Opa protein available, but the structure of a homologue, NspA, has been determined (35Vandeputte-Rutten L. Bos M.P. Tommassen J. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24825-24830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Opa proteins are predicted to form an 8-stranded β-barrel structure, with the hypervariable sequence regions corresponding to the surface-exposed loops. At present it is unclear how Opa proteins recognize oligosaccharide ligands or what effect the sequence polymorphism of the opa gene family might have on binding specificity. To address these questions we have developed a binding assay for OpcA and Opa proteins that makes use of the intrinsic fluorescence of each protein and have used this method to compare binding specificities for different saccharide ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Saccharides were obtained from Sigma. LDAO (N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide) was from Fluka. n-Octylpentaoxyethylene (C8E5) was from Fluka. n-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (BOG) was from Molecular Dimensions Ltd.Bacteria—The meningococcal derivatives used in adhesion experiments were from serogroup A strain C751 (Z2491) and included OpaB+OpcA–, OpcA+Opa–, and OpcA–Opa– (13Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J.P. Achtman M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).Epithelial Cells—Chang conjunctiva epithelial cells were cultured as described previously (36Virji M. Kayhty H.

Everson J.S. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 965-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Virji et al. (36Virji M. Kayhty H. Ferguson D.J.P. Alexandrescu C. Heckels J.E. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), with the exception that, to determine the effects of saccharides on the association of the meningococci with the Chang conjunctiva epithelial cells, the bacteria were incubated for 5 min with the relevant concentration of saccharide in Dulbecco's complete phosphate-buffered saline before inoculating the cell monolayers and incubated for 1 h.Expression of OpcA, OpaD, and OpaB—Selection of the N terminus of recombinant OpcA was guided by the crystal structure of the native protein (34Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); clear electron density was visible for the sequence starting at the sequence QTAN. Consequently, an oligonucleotide was designed to incorporate an initiator Met plus an NdeI restriction site, 5′-GAGATCCGCATATGCAAACCGCTAATGAGTTT-3′. The second PCR primer incorporated a BamHI site, 5′-GCGGATCTGGATCCTCTAGATGATGATTTCAAATCA-3′. The coding sequence for N. meningitidis OpcA was amplified from the original expression vector (38Prince S.M. Feron C. Janssens D. Lobet Y. Achtman M. Kusecek B. Bullough P.A. Derrick J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites in pET22b. Coding sequences for OpcA from N. gonorrhoeae and N. polysaccharea were amplified from a template kindly provided by Dr. P. Zhu (18Zhu P.X. Klutch M.J. Derrick J.P. Prince S.M. Tsang R.S.W.

The OpaD coding sequence was amplified by PCR from MC58 genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCCGCAGCGCAGGCGGCAAGTG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTCGAGCAGACGGCATCGGTGTCGGGG-3′, which incorporate NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The primers were designed to remove the signal sequence and CTCTT polymeric tract at the 5′ end of the gene. The PCR product was then digested with NdeI/XhoI and ligated into pET22b (Novagen). The same procedure was used for OpaB, except that the starting template DNA was a PCR product containing the OpaB coding sequence and amplified from genomic DNA from strain Z2491 using the method described by Hobbs et al. (39Hobbs M.M. Malorny B. Prasad P. Morelli G. Kusecek B. Heckels J.E. Cannon J.G. Achtman M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. M. Callaghan). “OpaD” in the manuscript therefore refers to the OpaD protein from strain MC58, and “OpaB” refers to the OpaB protein from strain Z2491. The sequences of OpcA, OpaB, and OpaD were verified by DNA sequencing. For expression, the pET vectors containing the appropriate insertions were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21*(DE3) (Invitrogen).Purification of OpcA, OpaD, and OpaB—OpcA was refolded and purified as described by Prince et al. (38Prince S.M. Feron C. Janssens D. Lobet Y. Achtman M. Kusecek B. Bullough P.A. Derrick J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Both OpaD and OpaB proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21* (DE3) (Invitrogen) in DYT medium. DYT medium consists of 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract (both from Duchefa Biochemie), and 5 g of NaCl per liter. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2700 × gav, and the pellet resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 5% (v/v) LDAO. The suspension was sonicated (15 cycles of 15 s bursts) and then stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. Inclusion bodies were isolated by sedimentation at 18,000 × gav for 15 min, and the pellet was washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The pellet, containing insoluble OpaD or OpaB, was taken up in 6 m guanidine HCl, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × gav for 30 min. Both OpaD and OpaB were refolded by rapid dilution of the clarified supernatant into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 5% (v/v) LDAO and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 0.1% (v/v) LDAO. The dialyzed solution was applied directly to a HiPrep 16/10 Heparin FF (Amersham Biosciences) fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in 50 mm Bis Tris propane (pH 7.0) with 0.1% (v/v) LDAO; the Opa proteins were eluted by a salt step using 50 mm Bis Tris propane (pH 7.0), 0.1% (v/v) LDAO, and 1 m NaCl. OpaD or OpaB protein was precipitated by the addition of ethanol to 80% (v/v) to pooled fractions from the heparin column and stored at –20 °C for at least 4 h. The precipitate was then sedimented by centrifugation at 18,000 × gav for 15 min. The protein pellet was dried in a vacuum desiccator for 1 h before being resolubilized in 50 mm Bis Tris propane (pH 7.0), 5% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-14 (Calbiochem). A final purification step involved binding and elution from a HR 5/5 Mono S fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Bis Tris propane (pH 7.0), 0.1% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-14, and Opa proteins were eluted by application of a salt gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in equilibration buffer. Fractions containing the Opa proteins were pooled and concentrated in a YM-50 Centricon (Millipore), and the protein was precipitated by the addition of ethanol to 80% (v/v). OpaD was shown to be folded by circular dichroism (not shown). The identities of purified OpaD and OpaB were confirmed by protease digestion and fragment analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy. Protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry assay against bovine serum albumin standards (40Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's instructions.Fluorimetric Titration Assay—The intrinsic fluorescence of OpcA, OpaD, and OpaB was utilized to develop a direct and sensitive fluorescence-based assay to measure the binding of different saccharides. Fluorescence spectra were produced using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Protein (OpcA, OpaD, or OpaB) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in 50 mm Bis Tris propane (pH 7.0) and 0.1% (w/v) octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in a total volume of 3 ml (except where stated otherwise). The samples were excited at 280 nm, with the fluorescence emission monitored at 330 nm with an excitation slit width of 5 nm and emission slit width of 2.5 nm. In all cases saccharide binding was observed as saturable quenching of the emission fluorescence intensity. None of the ligands studied had a significant absorbance at 280 nm within the concentration ranges used, and hence, the inner filter effect was negligible. A 5-min delay was included after each addition of ligand to allow uniform mixing of the solutions. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a Cary single cell Peltier accessory with continuous stirring.Analysis of Fluorescence Quench Data—Data obtained from the assay were processed and fitted assuming the single site equilibrium, L + R ⇔ LR, where L, R, and LR are ligand, protein (Opa/OpcA), and the ligand-protein complex, respectively. The model assumed that only a fraction of the observed fluorescence was accessible to quench by added ligand. The values of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the fluorescence value at infinite ligand concentration (Finf) were fitted to experimental values of fluorescence and ligand concentration by a nonlinear least squares regression method, as implemented in the program DYNAFIT (41Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quench data can be analyzed using the Stern-Volmer expression, Fo/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant, and [Q] is the concentration of quenching agent (ligand, in this case). In cases where a proportion of the observed fluorescence is not susceptible to quenching, a modified Stern-Volmer expression can be used, Fo/(Fo – F) = 1/([Q]faKSV) + 1/fa, where fa corresponds to the fraction of fluorescence that is susceptible to quench.RESULTSChanges in the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins have been widely used to measure the binding of small ligands. To examine whether this method was applicable to this group of outer membrane proteins, we set up an experiment to record the emission spectra of purified OpcA and OpaD from N. meningitidis. With an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, the emission spectrum has peaks at around 340 nm for both OpcA and OpaD from N. meningitidis strain MC58 (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with the OpaB protein from N. meningitidis strain Z2491 (not shown). The experiment was highly sensitive, with microgram quantities of protein providing a readily detectable signal for each of the outer membrane proteins examined. The spectra were sensitive to the addition of small saccharide ligands, with a partial quench detectable with titration of the ligand for each protein (Fig. 1). A variety of conditions were examined to identify conditions for optimal response to the binding of small ligands. The experiment was more sensitive when using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm rather than 295 nm, which would favor Trp fluorescence. Titration of OpcA with sialic acid produced a reduction in total fluorescence emission, which could be fitted to a single, saturable equilibrium binding site model (Fig. 2A). Similar behavior was observed for the OpaD protein on titration with maltose (Fig. 3A). Both calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values were below 1 μm, indicating high affinity binding. The stoichiometry of binding was investigated by replotting the data as log((Fo – F)/(F – Finf)) versus log[ligand] after the method of Chipman et al. (42Chipman D.M. Grisaro V. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fo, Finf, and F correspond to the fluorescence values at zero, infinite, and all other ligand concentrations, respectively). Replotting the data in this way produced a straight line, which was fitted by linear regression to give gradients of 0.96 and 1.1 for the OpcA and OpaD titrations in Figs. 2A and 3A, confirming a 1:1 stoichiometry in each case (not shown). Stern-Volmer plots of Fo/F versus concentrations of ligand were non-linear for both the OpcA/sialic acid and OpaD/maltose data (Figs. 2B and 3B). Non-linearity arises because a proportion of the fluorescence is not susceptible to quenching under these conditions. Use of a modified Stern-Volmer expression showed that graphs of Fo/(Fo – F) versus 1/[Q] were linear for both the OpcA and OpaD titration data (Figs. 2C and 3C), and the values of fa were deduced to be 0.44 and 0.43 for OpcA and OpaD, respectively.Fig. 2Example of fluorescence titration of OpcA with sialic acid.

C, modified Stern-Volmer plot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A possible problem with the use of BOG as detergent in these assays could arise from competition for binding between the detergent and the saccharide ligands used. The Kd values for sialic acid (for OpcA) and maltose (for OpaD) were, therefore, measured at several different concentrations of BOG. Measurements were also made using the polyoxyethylene detergent, C8E5, instead of BOG. Kd values for sialic acid binding to OpcA did not rise with increasing BOG concentration, as would be expected if BOG were competing with sialic acid for binding. Furthermore, the Kd for sialic acid binding to OpcA in 0.1% C8E5 was 1.2 μm, a value in the same range as that recorded in BOG. Similarly, the Kd for maltose binding to OpaD in 0.1% C8E5 was 1.9 μm. It was, therefore, clear that the low concentration of BOG used did not contribute to any significant competition for binding to the specific saccharide binding sites.In an attempt to identify the origin of the observed fluorescence from OpcA, the crystal structure was examined for Trp and Tyr residues that could plausibly account for a ligand-dependent fluorescence response. Of the four Trp residues in OpcA, three (137, 153, and 189) form part of the aromatic “girdle” of side chains that protrude into the hydrophobic portion of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 4A). The fourth (158) is also part of the β-barrel but points inward toward the water-filled channel within the protein. None of the side chains from these residues would be likely to form a close contact with a ligand binding to the exterior surface of the protein. We, therefore, considered the possibility that one or more Tyr residues could contribute to the ligand-responsive fluorescence signal from the protein. Of the seven Tyr residues in OpcA, five are associated with the β-barrel portion of the structure, in a similar fashion to the Trp residues. The remaining two, Tyr-169 and Tyr-218, constitute more likely sites for interaction with ligands (Fig. 4B). A closer examination of the environment surrounding these two Tyr residues reveals that they form part of a pocket of hydrophobic residues formed by association of Leu-66, Leu-81, Pro-82, Ile-123, Leu-171, and Ile-237 from loops 2–5 (Fig. 4C) (34Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To assign the source of the fluorescence from OpcA, Y169F and Y218F mutations were introduced into OpcA, and the fluorescence spectra of these mutated proteins were compared with wild type (Fig. 5A). Y218F produced a fluorescence emission signal reduced by about 30% c"

The present study investigates whether this Ca2+-dependent modulation of AC activity is further regulated by local pH changes that can arise beneath the plasma membrane as a consequence of cellular activity. Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 expressed in HEK 293 cells and inhibition of endogenous AC6 in C6-2B glioma cells exhibited clear sensitivity to modest pH changes in vitro. Acid pH (pH 7.14) reduced the Ca2+ sensitivity of both ACs, whereas alkaline pH (pH 7.85) enhanced the responsiveness of the enzymes to Ca2+, compared with controls (pH 7.50). Surprisingly, in the intact cell, the response of AC8 and AC6 to CCE was largely unperturbed by similar changes in intracellular pH (pHi), imposed using a weak acid (propionate) or weak base (trimethylamine). A range of hypotheses were tested to identify the mechanism(s) that could underlie this lack of pH effect in the intact cell. The pH sensitivity of CCE in HEK 293 cells is likely to dampen the effects of pHi on Ca2+-regulated ACs and may partly explain the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo data. However, we have found that the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), NHE1, is functionally active in these cells, and like AC8 (and AC6) it resides in lipid rafts or caveolae, which may create cellular microdomains where pHi is tightly regulated.

However, it is now recognized that modest fluctuations in pHi can arise during “physiological” cellular activity (1Kaila K. Voipio J.

Furthermore, recent studies have provided evidence for pHi microdomains just beneath the plasma membrane, which can exhibit transient pH shifts on the order of several tenths of a pH unit, as a consequence of the local activity of plasma membrane transporters (10Schwiening C.J.

Fluctuations of [H+] within these microdomains could potentially exert profound effects on the numerous cellular proteins residing within or near the plasma membrane, including the cAMP-producing adenylyl cyclase (AC). Early in vitro studies of plasma membrane preparations demonstrated that the catalytic activity of AC is steeply pH-dependent, over the range of pH 6.0–8.5, where acidification or alkalinization, respectively, decreases or increase cAMP synthesis (13Birnbaumer L. Yang P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin M.C. Salomon Y. Rendell M. Rodbell M. J. Biol.

In addition to the pH dependence of AC catalytic activity, the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+-regulated ACs is also likely to be highly pH-sensitive. Four of the nine AC isoforms cloned to date are regulated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+. AC1 and AC8 are stimulated by Ca2+ acting via calmodulin, whereas AC5 and AC6 are inhibited, independently of calmodulin (16Cooper D.M.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Since the binding of Ca2+ to both calmodulin and AC5/6 depends on the interaction with specific aspartate residues (17Klee C.B.

In the intact cell, the Ca2+-sensitive ACs are regulated exclusively by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) or Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (19Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J.

The selectivity of the cyclases for discrete modes of Ca2+ entry rather than other sources of cytosolic Ca2+ increase alludes to the co-localization of the ACs with preferred Ca2+ entry sites, a quality that is at least partly dependent on the selective localization of Ca2+-sensitive ACs in cholesterolrich domains of the plasma membrane, known as lipid rafts or caveolae (23Fagan K.A.

It is conceivable then that, during periods of cellular activity, the overall degree of cAMP production might reflect local changes in both [Ca2+] and pHi. In the present study, we first established that the regulation by Ca2+ of an endogenous AC6 and a heterologously expressed AC8 were markedly modulated by modest alterations of pH in in vitro measurements. We then explored whether this clear pH sensitivity would be manifest in the intact cell. To our surprise, although we could mimic the same amplitude of global pHi change as we had brought about in our in vitro experiments, the response of the ACs to CCE was largely unperturbed. Evaluation of a number of possible mechanisms revealed that the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) became active during our imposed acid shifts. Furthermore, it was located in lipid rafts, along with AC8 in HEK 293 cells (and AC6 in C6-2B glioma cells). Inhibition of NHE1 activity allowed the expected effect on AC8 activity of acid shifts to be observed. The presence of NHE1 and Ca2+-sensitive AC8 or of AC6 in the same subcellular domain may generate a privileged microenvironment that insulates the cyclases from fluctuations in cellular pH. Materials—BCECF/AM, Fura-2/AM, Fura-2 free acid, Fura-FF free acid, and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Cariporide was a gift from Dr. Juergen Puenter at Avetis Pharma (Frankfurt, Germany). Polyclonal AC8 antibody was a gift from Dr. J. J. Cali, as previously described (24Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Polyclonal caveolin antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Erembodegem, Belgium), and polyclonal β-adaptin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal NHE1 antibody (clone 4E9) was purchased from Chemicon International (Hofheim, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, UK), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Promega (Madison, WI). All other agents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless stated otherwise. Cell Culture and Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—C6-2B rat glioma cells were grown in F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. This cell line expresses almost exclusively type 6 adenylyl cyclase, with trace amounts of AC3 (25Debernardi M.A. Munshi R. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Brooker G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes at ∼70% confluence 1 day prior to transfection with 2 μg of AC8 cDNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's procedures. Transiently transfected cells were used 2 days post-transfection. The transiently expressed AC8 was responsible for all of the Ca2+-stimulated AC activity in the HEK 293 cells, since nontransfected cells exhibited a weak inhibition of AC activity with increasing calcium concentrations (data not shown). Measurement of Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—Determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro was performed as described previously (26Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The adenylyl cyclase activity of isolated C6-2B glioma and AC8-expressing HEK 293 cell membranes (4 μg of protein) was measured in the presence of the following components: 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.04 mm GTP, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, forskolin (20 and 2 μm respectively), and calmodulin (0 and 1 μm, respectively). Specifically, 25 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 2.2, 7.5, or 8.8, was added to establish the final pH of the reaction mixture at 7.14, 7.50, or 7.85, as indicated. Free Ca2+ concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2 solutions buffered with 200 μm EGTA and confirmed by calibration with Fura-2 and Fura-FF (Molecular Probes). The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated with sodium lauryl sulfate (0.5%); [3H]cAMP (∼6000 cpm) was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantitated as described previously (27Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Data points are presented as mean activities ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Measurement of cAMP Accumulation—cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (28Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (29Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with some modifications. C6-2B glioma cells on 24-well plates were incubated in F-10 medium, and AC8-expressing HEK 293 cells were incubated in minimal essential medium (90 min at 37 °C) with [2-3H]adenine (1.5 μCi/well) to label the ATP pool. The cells were then washed once and incubated with a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m Tris base. The use of Ca2+-free Krebs buffer in experiments denotes the addition of 100 μm EGTA to the nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm), which was preincubated with the cells for 10 min prior to a 1-min assay. Cells were preincubated for 4 min with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, at a final concentration of 100 nm. This has the effect of passively emptying the Ca2+ stores, establishing a low basal [Ca2+]i, and priming the cells for capacitative Ca2+ entry (30Putney Jr., J.W. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 143-160PubMed Google Scholar). 10 mm propionate, vehicle solution, or 20 mm trimethylamine was added 2 min prior to the assay to shift the pH of the cells to ∼7.15, 7.50, and 7.85, respectively. cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period beginning with the addition of 10 μm forskolin along with various concentrations of Ca2+. Assays were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 10% (w/v, final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. Unlabeled cAMP (100 μl, 10 mm), ATP (10 μl, 65 mm), and [α-32P]ATP (∼7000 cpm) were added to monitor recovery of cAMP and ATP. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content of the supernatant were quantified as described previously (27Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Results are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. pHi and [Ca2+]i Measurements—pHi and [Ca2+]i were measured in cell populations using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter. In brief, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (12.1 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm KH2PO4, 130 mm NaCl at pH 7.4) containing 0.01% EDTA and loaded with either 4 μm BCECF/AM (pHi measurements) or 2 μm Fura-2/AM ([Ca2+]i measurements) plus 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice, aliquoted into samples containing ∼1 × 106 cells, and finally resuspended in 3 ml of nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer and placed in a stirred cuvette just prior to the experiment. For Ca2+-free Krebs buffer, 100 μm EGTA was added. Test substances were added from 100-fold concentration stocks. BCECF 490/440 nm ratio fluorescence values were calibrated using the high K+/nigericin method (31Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The resultant pH values were in good agreement with those evaluated from an in vitro calibration of BCECF free acid. Fura-2 340/380 nm fluorescence ratios were converted to [Ca2+]i values as described previously (29Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR Experiments—RNA was isolated with the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). Primers for NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 isoforms were designed and synthesized on the basis of published human and rat cDNA sequences and are shown in Table II. Reverse transcription-PCRs were performed by using total cellular RNA. As a control for genomic DNA contamination of the RNA preparations, parallel samples were not reverse transcribed. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.Table IIPrimers used for NHE isoforms based on human and rat cDNA sequencesPrimerSequenceHuman NHE1 forward5′-GCA GAA GAT CAA CAA CTA CCT GAC G-3′Human NHE1 reverse5′-GGA AGA ACG GTT CTC CCT CC-3′Human NHE2 forward5′-CCA GAA AAG CTA CAA AAG AGG AGG-3′Human NHE2 reverse5′-GGC TTC TCA CTC CCA AAT CG-3′Human NHE3 forward5′-GAC TTG GAA CTT TCA GAC ACC G-3′Human NHE3 reverse5′-CAT GTG TGT GGA CTC GGG G-3′Rat NHE1 forward5′-CAA CGG CTG CGG TCC TAT AAC-3′Rat NHE1 reverse5′-GGT GAA GAC ATC ATC GGT GC-3′Rat NHE2 forward5′-CGC GAG CGC AGG GCT TCT AC-3′Rat NHE2 reverse5′-CCT ATT TCC GGG TTC TGA AG-3′Rat NHE3 forward5′-CTA TGG AGA ATC TGG CAC AC-3′Rat NHE3 reverse5′-CAC ATG TGT GTG GAC TCA G-3′Actin forward5′-TCCTCCCTGGAGAAGAGC-3′Actin reverse5′-CCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC-3′ Open table in a new tab Nondetergent Isolation of Raft and Nonraft Plasma Membranes— Raft and nonraft plasma membranes were separated by a procedure that exploited their different buoyancies as previously described (32Yamamoto M.

Briefly, cells were pelleted (195 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in ice-cold sodium carbonate solution (500 mm Na2CO3, 150 mm NaCl, pH 11.0) before sonication (Sonic Dismembrater, Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C, 30 s at setting 2, 30 s at setting 3, and 30 s at setting 4 with 3 min between each sonication (33Carey K.D.

The suspension was transferred to a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 20 strokes. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 60% sucrose in MES buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm Na2CO3, pH 6.4). The extract was placed below a 5 and 30% discontinuous sucrose gradient prepared in cold MES buffer and centrifuged in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 24,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions (10 × 0.5 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient, and sucrose concentration of an aliquot (40 μl) of each fraction was measured in an Abbe refractometer. The remainder of the isolated fractions were diluted in 5 volumes of MES buffer, centrifuged in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and prepared for electrophoresis. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in 1% SDS and added to a loading buffer, giving a final concentration of 62.5 mm Tris, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min and stored at –80 °C. Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved using 7.5 and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels except for AC8, where 8 m urea was also included (34Crossthwaite A.J. Seebacher T. Masada N. Ciruela A. Dufraux K.

The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS)) containing 5% skimmed milk powder, for 30 min, followed by two 10-min washes in TBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-AC8 antibody (1:5000), anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody (1:5000), anti-NHE1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), or β-adaptin polyclonal antibody (1:1000) in TTBS containing 1% skimmed milk powder (antibody buffer). The membranes were washed (2 × 10 min) in TTBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution of stock) or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) in antibody buffer for 1 h. Finally, the membranes were washed in TTBS (2 × 10 min), rinsed in TBS, and treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Ca2+ Sensitivity of AC8 and AC6 at Different pH— Modest changes in [H+] are known to affect the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclases (13Birnbaumer L. Yang P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin M.C. Salomon Y. Rendell M. Rodbell M. J. Biol.

To investigate a further pH sensitivity of ACs, with respect to their regulation by Ca2+, activities of Ca2+-stimulable AC8 and Ca2+-inhibitable AC6 were assayed in vitro over a range of [Ca2+] at different pH values (Fig. 1). Ca2+ dose-response curves were compared at pH 7.14, 7.50, and 7.85. These values were chosen, because they are within the pH range that ACs may experience under physiological conditions. Transiently expressed AC8 in HEK 293 cell membranes (Fig. 1A) and endogenously expressed AC6 in C6 glioma cell membranes (Fig. 1B) both exhibited clear pH sensitivities with respect to their peak activities and sensitivity to Ca2+. Under alkaline conditions (pH 7.85), stimulation of AC8 activity by Ca2+/calmodulin was increased to ∼980% of basal activity, compared with a 610% increase above basal level in controls (pH 7.50; Fig. 1A). By contrast, acidification (pH 7.14) decreased the stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin to just 330% of basal. The apparent Kd value for Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 was also quite dependent on pH, with EC50 values of 0.06, 0.10, and 0.16 μm Ca2+ for pH 7.85, 7.50, and 7.14 respectively. In C6-2B glioma cell membranes, peak AC6 activity under alkaline conditions (pH 7.85) was 170% of that seen at pH 7.50 and just 65% of control activity at pH 7.14 (Fig. 1B), consistent with previously published effects of pH on AC activity (13Birnbaumer L. Yang P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin M.C. Salomon Y. Rendell M. Rodbell M. J. Biol.

However, in Fig. 1B we also reveal a clear pH dependence of the Ca2+ inhibition of AC6 activity, in terms of both affinity and maximal effect. As with AC8, the Ca2+ regulation of AC6 was enhanced at pH 7.85 and reduced at pH 7.14 compared with controls (pH 7.50). The corresponding IC50 values for Ca2+ were 0.19, 0.33, and 1.10 μm at pH 7.85, 7.50, and 7.14, respectively (Fig. 1B). In Vivo Sensitivity of AC8 and AC6 to CCE at Different pHi— To explore whether Ca2+ regulation of AC8 and AC6 exhibited similar pH sensitivity in the intact cell, a series of in vivo measurements of cAMP accumulation were performed. Previous studies have shown that both cyclases are exclusively regulated by CCE in the intact cell (19Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similar protocols were used here to obtain dose-response curves for cAMP accumulation during varying degrees of CCE. In brief, cells were maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs Ringer, and 100 nm thapsigargin was applied to deplete intracellular endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. After 4 min of thapsigargin treatment, CCE was evoked by the introduction of CaCl2 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mm) to the extracellular Ringer solution. Production of cAMP was assayed for 1 min following the addition of CaCl2. In a series of separate pH experiments, various concentrations of weak acid (propionate (PA)) and weak base (trimethylamine (TMA)) were tested to determine which concentrations would induce an approximate 0.3-pH unit shift in pHi (to mirror the pH values that were employed in the in vitro measurements). This ΔpHi shift is considered to be within the range of localized pHi changes that proteins residing within the plasma membrane might experience during periods of cellular activity. Application of 10 mm PA induced an intracellular acidification of 0.33 ± 0.03 pH units in HEK293 cells and 0.26 ± 0.03 pH units in C6-2B glioma cells. 20 mm TMA induced a pHi shift of similar amplitude in the alkaline direction (see Table I; also see Figs. 2A and 3A). Resting pHi was ∼7.45 in HEK 293 cells and pH 7.40 in C6 glioma cells, according to calibrated BCECF measurements (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). All pH measurements and adenylyl cyclase assays were performed in nominally CO2/HCO3-free Ringer. As a consequence, the global shifts in pHi, established within 1 min of weak acid or weak base application, were relatively sustained. To determine the effects of such pHi shifts on CCE regulation of AC8 and AC6 activity, 10 mm PA or 20 mm TMA was added 2 min prior to the addition of CaCl2 and the initiation of CCE. Comparisons of the Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 at different pHi values are shown in Fig. 2B. 10 mm PA induced a clear decrease in resting pHi of HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A, upper panel) but rather surprisingly did not affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of AC8 (pH 7.14) compared with controls (pH 7.50). The effects of alkalinization by 20 mm TMA (Fig. 2A, lower panel) were more consistent with our in vitro data and demonstrate an enhanced stimulation of AC8 (pH 7.85) during CCE evoked by 2 or 4 mm CaCl2 compared with controls (pH 7.50) (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05).Table IpHi changes induced by weak acid or weak baseCell typeWeak acid/baseResting pHiInduced pHiΔpHiHEK 293 (n = 6)10 mm PA7.42 ± 0.057.10 ± 0.04-0.33 ± 0.03HEK 293 (n = 5)20 mm TMA7.50 ± 0.027.84 ± 0.040.34 ± 0.03C6 glioma (n = 4)10 mm PA7.39 ± 0.067.13 ± 0.05-0.26 ± 0.03C6 glioma (n = 4)20 mm TMA7.40 ± 0.067.78 ± 0.070.38 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3pHi modulation of CCE-inhibited AC6 activity in intact C6-2B glioma cells.

Although a small decrease or increase in AC6 catalytic activity was seen under acid or alkaline conditions, respectively, no pH-dependent changes in Ca2+ inhibition were observed in intact C6 glioma cells. This clear discrepancy between our in vitro and in vivo studies was unexpected. Consequently, a range of hypotheses were tested in an effort to identify the mechanism(s) that could underlie the lack of pH effect in the intact cell. In Vivo Ca2+ Sensitivity of AC8 and AC6 at Different pHo— The first hypothesis to consider was that the clear in vitro pH sensitivity of Ca2+-regulated AC activity was mediated on extracellular sites of the AC molecules, since the in vitro assays do not discriminate between intracellular and extracellular effects of pH. To address this in the intact cell, experiments described for Figs. 2B and 3B were repeated, but instead of applying weak acid or weak base, the extracellular Ringer solution (pH 7.50) was replaced with either fresh solution at pH 7.50 (controls) or solution buffered to pH 7.14 or 7.85. Acute exposure of AC8-expressing HEK 293 cells or C6 glioma cells to different extracellular pH (pHo) showed no evidence of change in the"
https://openalex.org/W2145414997,"We previously reported that the reductive activities of yeast protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family proteins did not completely explain their contribution to the viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kimura, T., Hosoda, Y., Kitamura, Y., Nakamura, H., Horibe, T., and Kikuchi, M. (2004) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 320, 359–365). In this study, we examined oxidative refolding activities and found that Mpd1p, Mpd2, and Eug1p exhibit activities of 13.8, 16.0, and 2.16%, respectively, compared with Pdi1p and that activity for Eps1p is undetectable. In analyses of interactions between yeast PDI proteins and endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperones, we found that Mpd1p alone does not have chaperone activity but that it interacts with and inhibits the chaperone activity of Cne1p, a homologue of mammalian calnexin, and that Cne1p increases the reductive activity of Mpd1p. These results suggest that the interface between Mpd1p and Cne1p is near the peptide-binding site of Cne1p. In addition, Eps1p interacts with Pdi1p, Eug1p, Mpd1p, and Kar2p with dissociation constants (KD) in the range of 10–7 to 10–6. Interestingly, co-chaperone activities were completely suppressed in Eps1p-Pdi1p and Eps1p-Mpd1p complexes, although only Eps1p and Pdi1p have chaperone activity.

Recently, Ero1p and flavin adenine dinucleotide complex was shown to reoxidize the reduced state of the active sites of PDI (4Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Moreover, PDI has been reported to have chaperone and anti-chaperone activities (5Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and may be involved in a quality control system that targets misfolded proteins for degradation (6Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PDI is also known to facilitate the secretion of human lysozyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a reflection of its chaperone activity (7Hayano T. Hirose M. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, many homologues similar in structure to PDI have been identified. These PDI homologues have two or more CXXC motifs (where X is a variable amino acid), each of which is predicted to function as a site for the formation, reduction, or isomerization of a disulfide bond. S. cerevisiae PDI (Pdi1p), encoded by the PDI1 gene, is essential for growth (8Günther R. Brauer C. Janetzky B. Foster H.H. Ehbrecht I.M. Lehle L. Küntzel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The critical function of Pdi1p may be the isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds (8Günther R. Brauer C. Janetzky B. Foster H.H. Ehbrecht I.M. Lehle L. Küntzel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its chaperone activity is thought to depend on this isomerase activity (9Katiyar S. Till E.A. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1548: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, S. cerevisiae contains four nonessential genes with homology to PDI1: MPD1 (10Tachikawa H. Takeuchi Y. Funahashi W. Miura T. Gao X.D. Fujimoto D. Mizunaga T. Onodera K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), MPD2 (11Tachikawa H. Funahashi W. Takeuchi Y. Nakanishi H. Nishihara R. Katoh S. Gao X.D. Mizunaga T. Fujimoto D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), EUG1 (12Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and EPS1 (13Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of strains lacking PDI genes indicated that Mpd1p is the only homologue that can fully compensate for the absence of Pdi1p (14Nørgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsøe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant Eug1p, which contains two mutated CXXC active site motifs, is functionally equivalent to Pdi1p (15Nørgaard P. Winther J.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, the interactions of ERp57 with calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (16Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M.

Kikuchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and ERp57 (19Kimura T. Imaishi K. Hagiwara Y. Horibe T. Hayano T. Takahashi N. Urade R. Kato K. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and of JPDI (J domain-containing protein-disulfide isomerase-like protein) with BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein) (20Hosoda A. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2669-2676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been reported in mammalian cells. However, interactions among yPDI proteins and between yPDI proteins and ER chaperone proteins have not yet been described. Previously, we found that Mpd1p interacts with Mpd2p but that the two proteins do not influence the reductive or chaperone activities of each other (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we report interactions involving yPDI proteins and ER chaperone proteins. Among yPDI proteins, only Mpd1p interacts with Cne1p. The reductive activity of Mpd1p is increased in the presence of Cne1p, and the chaperone activity of Cne1p is quenched by interaction with Mpd1p. Mpd1p may function in yeast as a counterpart to mammalian ERp57 because Cne1p corresponds to mammalian CNX. Moreover, in this study we examined Eps1p and Kar2p (22Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), because Eps1p corresponds to mammalian TMX, a transmembrane thioredoxin-related PDI protein (23Matsuo Y. Akiyama N. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10032-10038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and Kar2p corresponds to mammalian BiP, respectively. Eps1 interactions with Pdi1p, Eug1p, Mpd1p, and Kar2p have different effects on their activities. Strains and Plasmids—Escherichia coli AD494 (DE3) (Δara–, leu7967, ΔlacX74, ΔphoA, PvuII, phoR, ΔmalF3, F'[lac+, (lacIq), pro], trxB::kan(DE3)) and pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used to express yPDI proteins, Cne1p, and Kar2p. Expression plasmids encoding yPDI proteins were constructed by a previously described method (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Yeast genes were amplified by PCR using template DNA prepared from S. cerevisiae YPH250 (MATa ura3 lys2 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2). To construct the Cne1p expression plasmid, two NdeI sites were introduced into the Cne1 gene 55–60 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-terminus and 4–9 nucleotides downstream of the 3′-terminus using 5′-TTGGTGAAACATATGTCATTGCTATCCAAC-3′ and 5′-ACTAACACTCATATGCTATGTAAATACTAC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively (mutated nucleotides are underlined). For the Eps1p expression plasmid, a SalI site was introduced 18–24 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-terminus of the region encoding the putative secretory leader peptide, and a BamHI site was introduced 160–165 nucleotides upstream of the coding region of the putative ER lumenal segment with 5′-ACTATAGCCGTCGACGAACCACCAGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCTTAGTCTAGGAAACTGAGGACATTATGG-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. For the Kar2p expression plasmid, a XhoI site was introduced 1–6 nucleotides upstream of the 5′-terminus of the region encoding the mature protein, and a BamHI site was introduced 4–9 nucleotides downstream of the coding region of the ER retention signal using 5′-TTTACAGAATCTCGAGCACTCCTCCAATGT-3′ and 5′-TTTTAACTAGGATCCCTACAATTCGTCGT-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR products were inserted into pET15b digested with NdeI (for Cne1p) or SalI and BamHI (for Eps1p and Kar1p). Expression and Purification of His-tagged Human and Yeast PDI Proteins—E. coli AD494(DE3) was transformed with derivatives of pET15b that express yPDI proteins and Cne1p. Pdi1p, Mpd1p, Mpd2p, and Eug1p were purified by a previously described method (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For purification of Cne1p and Eps1p, the cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and disrupted by sonication. The pellet was suspended in denaturing buffer (8 m urea, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a Minisart 0.2-μm filter (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) and applied to a Ni2+-chelating resin column (Amersham Biosciences) for purification. The eluted fraction was dialyzed using a dialysis membrane, size 20 (Wako, Japan) in refolding buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 m urea) for 1 h, and dialysis was continued in refolding buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m urea) for 1 h. Finally, the proteins were dialyzed in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.4) overnight and centrifuged. The supernatant was used for the experiment. Assay of PDI Protein Activities—The reductive activities of yPDI proteins were determined by the method of Ibbetson and Freedman (24Ibbetson A.L. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in which the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of insulin disulfide bonds by GSH is coupled to the reduction of GSSG to GSH by NADPH and glutathione reductase. Chaperone activity was measured as the inhibition of denatured rhodanese aggregation using the method described by Martin et al. (25Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartle F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine rhodanese was denatured in buffer A (6 m guanidium-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), and aggregation was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 320 nm. The oxidative activities of yPDI proteins were determined by the method of Puig and Gilbert (26Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25889-25896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate was prepared by adding hen egg white lysozyme (100 mg/ml) to denaturing buffer (8 m urea, 130 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6) and diluting the mixture 35-fold in 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 4.0). The assay was performed by mixing 750 μl of substrate buffer (60 mm potassium acetate, pH 6.2, 0.1% (w/v) NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Sigma), 750 μl of refolding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm GSH, 0.5 mm GSSG containing PDI protein, pH 7.0), and 20 μl of denatured lysozyme (final concentration, 10 μm). The decrease in absorbance at 460 nm was monitored. Detection of Biomolecular Interactions—Binding of Cne1p, Kar2p, and Eps1p to immobilized yPDI proteins was measured in a surface plasmon resonance apparatus (Biacore 3000, Biacore Inc., Neuchatel, Switzerland). Pdi1p, Eug1p, Mpd1p, Mpd2p, and Eps1p were covalently coupled to the matrix of a CM5 sensor chip via amino groups according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cne1p, Kar2p, and PDI proteins were delivered to the protein-coated flow cell to observe binding. In the reverse experiment, Cne1p, Kar2p, and PDI proteins were used as analytes. The data were analyzed with Biacore evaluation software (version 3.1). Oxidative Refolding Activities of Yeast PDI Proteins—We previously reported variations in the reductive activities of yPDI proteins (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mpd1p displays an extremely weak reductive activity, and other yPDI proteins have virtually no activity, except for Pdi1p (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the oxidative refolding activities of these proteins, which are more important than reductive activity for cell viability. We expressed yPDI proteins in E. coli and purified them, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All purified proteins migrated as a single band on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1). Pdi1p exhibited a concentration-dependent oxidative refolding activity (Fig. 2). A similar concentration dependence was observed for other yPDI proteins (data not shown). The oxidative refolding activities of Mpd1p, Mpd2, and Eug1p were 13.8, 16.0, and 2.16% that of Pdi1p, respectively, and Eps1p was inactive (Fig. 3). Interexperiment variation was small (usually 1–3%), and we have therefore presented the average of two representative experiments for these studies. The reductive activities of Mpd1p and Mpd2p are extremely low or absent compared with Pdi1p, and it is difficult to assess their influence in vivo. However, their oxidative refolding activities may be relevant in vivo.Fig. 2The oxidative refolding activity of yPDI. Denatured lysozyme was used as a substrate.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2669-2676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we tested for interactions between yPDI proteins and ER molecular chaperones by using the Biacore system. All of the sensorgrams were indicative of typical protein-protein interactions (data not shown). We found that Mpd1p significantly interacts with Cne1p, with a KD value of 2.27 × 10–7 m (Table I). Mpd1p has no chaperone activity (see Fig. 5), and Mpd2p has 68% of the chaperone activity of Pdi1p (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mpd1p interacts with Mpd2p but does not affect its chaperone activity, and Mpd2p does not affect the reductive activity of Mpd1p (data not shown). Therefore, the interaction of Mpd1p with Cne1p will be described below. As shown in Table I, Kar2p interacted with Pdi1p and Eps1p, and the KD values of these interactions were 5.83 × 10–6 m and 1.03 × 10–6 m, respectively. Eps1p was found to bind Pdi1p, Eug1p, Mpd1p, Kar2p, and Cne1p, with KD values of 7.33 × 10–6, 6.06 × 10–6, 3.88 × 10–6, 1.03 × 10–6, and 1.38 × 10–5 m, respectively (Table I). The Eps1p-Cne1p interaction was not examined further because of its low affinity. These data suggest that the role of Eps1p, which interacts with the four yeast PDI-like proteins, is significant in yeast. In contrast, Pdi1p interacted with all yPDI proteins, but none of these interactions had an effect on the activities of Pdi1p and Pdi1p-binding proteins (data not shown).Table IDissociation constants of Cne1p, Kar2p, and Eps1p to yPDI family proteinsLigandDissociation constantCne1pKar2pEps1pmPdi1pND5.83 × 10-67.33 × 10-6Eug1pNDND6.06 × 10-6Mpd1p2.27 × 10-7ND3.88 × 10-6Mpd2pNDNDNDEps1p1.38 × 10-51.03 × 10-6 Open table in a new tab Effect of the Interaction of Mpd1p and Cne1p on Their Reductive and Chaperone Activities—As described above, Mpd1p, which has a weak reductive activity but no chaperone activity (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), specifically interacts with Cne1p. To understand the roles of Mpd1p and Cne1p, we measured their co-reductase and co-chaperone activities. Co-oxidative refolding activity was not determined because Cne1p was unstable in the refolding buffer for an undetermined reason. Although Cne1p alone lacked reductive activity, the addition of two molar equivalents of Cne1p to a reaction mixture containing Mpd1p appeared to increase the reductive activity of Mpd1p (Fig. 4). In contrast, Mpd1p, which has no chaperone activity, completely inhibited the chaperone activity of a molar equivalent of Cne1p (Fig. 5). This inhibition could be overcome by increasing the Cne1p concentration, with 98% Cne1p chaperone activity observed at a Cne1p to Mpd1p ratio of 7:1. These results suggest that the binding interface between Mpd1p and Cne1p is near the peptide-binding site of Cne1p and that the chaperone function requires the peptide-binding site. Effects of Interactions of Eps1p with Pdi1p, Eug1p, and Mpd1p on Reductive and Chaperone Activities—Eps1p recognizes Pdi1p, Eug1p, and Mpd1p (Table I), and we investigated the effect of these interactions on their co-activities. The coreductive activity of Eps1p-Pdi1p was equal to the sum of their individual activities (data not shown), but the co-reductive activity of Eps1p-Mpd1p decreased relative to the sum of their individual activities (Fig. 6), although the system was not still saturated with Mpd1p alone (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the co-reductive activity of Eps1p-Eug1p was somewhat increased, although Eug1p alone had no reductive activity. In contrast, the cochaperone activities of Eps1p-Pdi1p and Eps1p-Mpd1p were completely suppressed (Fig. 7), although Pdi1p and Eps1p individually have chaperone activity. These results suggest that Pdi1p and Mpd1p bind to the peptide-binding site of Eps1p and that Eps1p binds to the peptide-binding site of Pdi1p. The co-reductive and co-chaperone activities of the Eps1p-Eug1p complex were greater than the activities of either protein alone (Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting that Eug1p enhances the reductive and chaperone activities of Eps1p. Thus, we propose that Eps1p functionally interacts with Pdi1p, Mpd1p, and Eug1p in vivo.Fig. 7The co-chaperone activities of Eps1p-Pdi1p, Eps1p-Eug1p and Eps1p-Mpd1p. The activity of 0.10 μm Eps1p was normalized to 100%. Each value shown is the mean of data from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous study indicated that the reductive activity of Pdi1p is remarkably strong and that other PDI proteins in yeast apparently have no significant activity (21Kimura T. Hosoda Y. Kitamura Y. Nakamura H. Horibe T. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Pdi1p, Mpd1p, Mpd2p, and Eug1p, but not Eps1p, have oxidative refolding activity (Fig. 3). Although overexpression of Mpd1p rescues the growth of cells lacking PDI1, overexpression of Mpd2p does not (14Nørgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsøe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, Mpd1p cannot compensate for the absence of Mpd2p, and ∼33% of the cells lacking Pdi1p are rescued when Eug1p is overexpressed (14Nørgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsøe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results suggest that oxidative refolding activities are important for viability and that Mpd1p and Mpd2p act as oxidases in vivo. With respect to the functions of Mpd1p and Mpd2p, we hypothesize that Pdi1p controls proteins essential for growth and that the functions of Mpd1p and Mpd2p overlap with Pdi1p. Eug1p substitutes for Pdi1p because it alone rescues viability when overexpressed. Eps1p has strong chaperone activity, extremely weak reductive activity, and no oxidative activity and like Pdi1p it interacts with many ER proteins including Kar2p (yeast BiP). Pdi1p and Eps1p interactions with Kar2p result in a decrease in co-chaperone activities but had no effect on co-reductive activities (data not shown). Although Pdi1p interacted with many proteins examined in this study, it exhibited co-chaperone activity only with Kar2p (data not shown). Mammalian PDI and BiP were reported to assist protein folding in a concerted manner (27Veijola J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermeier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that Pdi1p may interact with Kar2p. Several PDI proteins, such as JPDI (19Kimura T. Imaishi K. Hagiwara Y. Horibe T. Hayano T. Takahashi N. Urade R. Kato K. Kikuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and ERp44 (29Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), apparently lack redox activity. These observations collectively suggest that Eps1p may function as a molecular chaperone rather than as a redox enzyme in vivo. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Eps1p acts as a redox enzyme, because its reductive activity increased in the presence of Eug1p. We found that Eps1p affects the reductive and chaperone activities of Eps1p-binding proteins, that Mpd1p specifically interacts with Cne1p, and that the interaction between Mpd1 and Cne1p affects the activities of these two proteins. Cne1 corresponds to mammalian CNX, and ERp57 binds to the P domain (30Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which is not a peptide-binding domain in CNX and calreticulin. The ERp57-CNX complex is involved in folding nascent glycoproteins (31Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that in S. cerevisiae Mpd1p and Cne1p play roles in glycoprotein folding. These observations indicate that yPDI proteins and ER chaperones may form complexes and influence each other's activity in vivo. Recently, PDI and ERp57 were identified in nucleoli isolated from cultured human cells (33Turano C. Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and Pdi1p and Eug1p were found in S. cerevisiae mitochondria (34Ohlmeier S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Bergmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3956-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, determination of the intracellular locations of yPDI proteins such as Mpd1p and Mpd2p may provide insights into their roles in S. cerevisiae. We thank Dr. Yoshiyuki Tsujimoto for providing the rabbit anti-yeast PDI antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1993206451,"DNA damage results in transcriptional induction of p53 target genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Depending on the cellular context, p21Cip1 and PUMA mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. By imposing cell cycle arrest at the expense of apoptosis, p21Cip1 can sharply reduce the effectiveness of DNA-damaging anticancer agents in colorectal cancer cells. We investigated the link between cell cycle progression and the onset of apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells by analyzing the activation of the apoptotic cascade in p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. DNA damage induced a similar level of p53 activation and PUMA induction in p21Cip1-deficient cells compared with wild-type isogenic counterparts. p21Cip1 did not act as a direct blocker of PUMA. However, only p21Cip1-deficient cells showed extensive cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase activation. An increase in caspase activation occurred as these cells reached M-phase and incurred polyploidy. When ectopically expressed in p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells, p21Cip1, its family member p27Kip1, and the structurally unrelated CDK inhibitor p16Ink4a were similarly effective at causing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting DNA damage-induced apoptotic events such as cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and activation of the caspase cascade. These observations suggest that by blocking dysregulated cell cycle progression, CDK inhibitors can influence the sensitivity of the mitochondria to proapoptotic signals in DNA damage-induced cancer cells. DNA damage results in transcriptional induction of p53 target genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Depending on the cellular context, p21Cip1 and PUMA mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. By imposing cell cycle arrest at the expense of apoptosis, p21Cip1 can sharply reduce the effectiveness of DNA-damaging anticancer agents in colorectal cancer cells. We investigated the link between cell cycle progression and the onset of apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells by analyzing the activation of the apoptotic cascade in p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. DNA damage induced a similar level of p53 activation and PUMA induction in p21Cip1-deficient cells compared with wild-type isogenic counterparts. p21Cip1 did not act as a direct blocker of PUMA. However, only p21Cip1-deficient cells showed extensive cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase activation. An increase in caspase activation occurred as these cells reached M-phase and incurred polyploidy. When ectopically expressed in p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells, p21Cip1, its family member p27Kip1, and the structurally unrelated CDK inhibitor p16Ink4a were similarly effective at causing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting DNA damage-induced apoptotic events such as cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and activation of the caspase cascade. These observations suggest that by blocking dysregulated cell cycle progression, CDK inhibitors can influence the sensitivity of the mitochondria to proapoptotic signals in DNA damage-induced cancer cells. Many tumor-specific treatments are based on inducing DNA damage by radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. In response to DNA damage, the tumor suppressor protein p53 accumulates in the nucleus and regulates transcription of target genes, including PUMA 1The abbreviations used are: PUMA, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Rh123, rhodamine 123.1The abbreviations used are: PUMA, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Rh123, rhodamine 123.

Depending on the cellular context, the outcome of a p53 response results in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The heterogeneity of cancer arises from the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations during oncogenic progression. This creates a major challenge in predicting how a specific tumor will respond to therapy, because each tumor has a different genetic signature, cellular context, and pathology. Malignant cells generally show a greater tendency to die in response to elevated levels of p53 than nontransformed cells, in part because of the additional cellular stresses that accompany malignant progression such as uncontrolled proliferation, hypoxia, and growth factor depletion (12Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). However, the ability of some tumor cells to undergo cell cycle arrest and evade apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging drugs is a contributing cause of drug resistance. These observations have drawn attention to the genetic context of a tumor cell as a critical determinant of the apoptotic or cell cycle arrest response to DNA damage. Among the types of cancer that are affected by this problem is colorectal cancer, which is the third most common malignancy worldwide (13Rupnarain C. Dlamini Z. Naicker S. Bhoola K. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A major effort has been made to understand the genetic bases of colorectal cancer progression (14Rajagopalan H. Nowak M.A. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and its response to a variety of anticancer agents such as the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, alkylating agent cisplatin, and topoisomerase II inhibitor adriamycin. Studies done with the HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell line have shed light on how the genetics of the tumor cell is crucial in dictating the response to anticancer agents. For example, the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil is attributed to the wild-type p53 status of HCT116 cells, whereas these same cells are resistant to adriamycin treatment (15Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells that are rendered deficient in p21Cip1 by deletion of the CDKN1A locus become hypersensitive to apoptosis induced by DNA damage (16Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). p21Cip1 can act as an inhibitor of apoptosis in a variety of systems (17Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6164-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), dramatically limiting the effectiveness of anticancer agents (21Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar). Xenograft tumors from p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells (22Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Yu J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Williams J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) are hypersensitive to elimination by γ-irradiation. Signals that abrogate p21Cip1 expression via c-Myc favor the ability of p53 to activate apoptosis in response to radiation and topoisomerase II inhibitors (23Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to further elucidate how p21Cip1 and cell cycle arrest can interfere with the events that trigger cell death in DNA-damaged cancer cells. To discern how cell cycle progression is coupled to the onset of apoptosis in DNA-damaged cancer cells, we utilized the wild-type and p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells. The p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells undergo aberrant cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage leading to cell death. We have shown that reintroducing p21Cip1 or other CDK inhibitors such as p27Kip1 and p16Ink4a can prevent p21Cip1-deficient HCT116 cells from proceeding through S-phase and accumulating a 4N and higher DNA content in the presence of drug-induced DNA damage. In so doing, these CDK inhibitors prevent apoptosis-initiating events including cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase-3 activation. Cell Culture—DLD1 cells conditionally expressing PUMA and HCT116 wild-type and p21-/- cells were a kind gift from Drs. Vogelstein and Kinzler. HCT116 wild-type and p21-/- cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were not used beyond 25-30 passages, and as necessary the HCT116 p21-/- cells were reselected in medium containing 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin and 0.4 mg/ml G418 as previously described (11Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). DLD1 cells were cultured as previously described (2Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Adriamycin (Sigma) and Z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) were resuspended in water and Me2SO, respectively, and used at the indicated concentrations. γ-radiation (20 Gy) was delivered by a 137Cs gamma radiator at 2.4 Gy/min. Adenoviral Infections—Adenoviruses Ad-β-galactosidase, Ad-p21Cip1 (Adp21), Ad-p27Kip1 (Adp27), and Ad-p16Ink4a (Adp16) were gifts from Drs. R. G. Crystal, W. El-Deiry, A. Koff, and F. L. Graham, respectively. Cells were plated at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml and infected with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection to obtain ∼90% infectivity for 2 h. Immunoblotting—The appropriate cells were lysed in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was measured using the BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 20-40 μg of protein lysate was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). The membrane was probed with antibodies specific for PUMA (a kind gift from Drs. Vogelstein, Kinzler, and Yu), p53 (sc-98; Santa Cruz), Bcl-xL (BD Biosciences), or p21Cip1 (ab-11; Neomarkers), developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences), and stripped with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) shaking at 37 °C for 20 min. Immunofluorescence—HCT116 wild-type and p21-/- cells were plated in 4-well chamber slides (Lab-tek), followed by the indicated treatments. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with PS solution (3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose) for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with X-100 solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) for 5 min on ice. Cells were stained with mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (6H2.B4 clone; BD Biosciences) followed by secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) at 1:50 dilution. Mounting solution with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) was applied before the slides were sealed with a coverslip. Images were obtained on the confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2 AOBS). Apoptosis Assays—Annexin V staining was performed using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin V kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specification. To measure DNA content, floating and adherent cells were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 0.6 ml of PBS. 1.5 ml of 100% ethanol was added dropwise to the cell suspension, and the cells were left at -20 °C for a minimum of 30 min. The fixed cells were washed and resuspended in 0.3-0.5 ml of DNA staining buffer (3.8 mm sodium citrate, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.125 μg/ml RNase A). Cells with a DNA content less than 2N were scored as having a sub-G1 DNA content. To stain cells with FITC-VAD-fmk (CaspACE™; Promega) and propidium iodide, cells were cultured for the indicated times with 5 μm FITC-VAD-fmk and 70 ng/ml adriamycin. Both floating and adherent cells were pooled, washed, and fixed with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ (BD Biosciences) solutions according to the manufacturer's specifications. Samples were resuspended in FACS buffer (1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.125 μg/ml RNase A. All samples were analyzed by flow cytometry on the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). Data were formatted using Flowjo software. Intracellular Staining for Flow Cytometry—For intracellular staining of the active form of caspase-3 and MPM-2, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm™ solutions and labeled with FITC-labeled active caspase-3 antibody (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol or fluorescein-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-MPM-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation in the cells was measured using the FITC BrdUrd kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Intracellular staining of cytochrome c in digitonin-permeabilized cells was carried out essentially as described (24Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) Uptake Assay—Floating and adherent cells were pooled and incubated for 30 min with 2 μm Rh123 (Molecular Probes) in PBS at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS, resuspended in FACS buffer, and Rh123 fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. p21Cip1 Prevents Caspase Activation Downstream of PUMA—To determine the effects of p21Cip1 on cells after p53 is induced by DNA damage, we characterized the cell cycle and apoptotic machinery in the HCT116 cell line and its isogenic derivative lacking p21Cip1 (p21-/- cells). 24 h after adriamycin treatment, cell cycle analysis of HCT116 wild-type cells by BrdUrd incorporation and DNA staining with 7-amino-actinomycin D demonstrated that most of the cells were arrested in G1 (2N DNA content) and G2/M (4N DNA content) (16Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) with few cells in S-phase (Fig. 1A). In contrast, HCT116 p21-/- cells contained a higher percentage of cells in S-phase (Fig. 1A) and a considerably lower percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. This observation is an indication that the cells lacking p21Cip1 were unable to maintain tight G1 and G2/M checkpoint controls after DNA damage. Additionally, intracellular staining for the M-phase marker MPM-2 (25Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) revealed that p21-/- cells entered mitosis more readily than the wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). The abundance of cells in S-phase and mitosis after adriamycin treatment shows that the absence of p21Cip1 allows these cells to progress through the cell cycle unimpeded after sustaining DNA damage. Many of the p21-/- cells treated with adriamycin also contained lobulated nuclei or displayed abnormal nuclear morphology (Fig. 1C), which is a morphological indicator of apoptosis associated with an aberrant mitosis (26Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Soc. Biol. 2004; 198: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PUMA induction is essential for p53-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells (6Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). PUMA localizes to the mitochondria and binds to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 to induce the release of cytochrome c, an event that subsequently triggers caspase activation and apoptosis (1Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar, 2Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in the sensitivity of the parental and p21-/- cells to adriamycin treatment, a comparable increase in PUMA protein levels in response to adriamycin was observed between the two populations (Fig. 2A). This confirmed earlier observations that the expression of p21Cip1 and the ensuing block in cell cycle progression do not affect the ability of p53 to activate the expression of PUMA and several other proapoptotic genes (23Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Closer analysis showed that the wild-type cells appear to contain slightly higher levels of PUMA and p53 than the p21-/- cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the loss of p21Cip1 has altered the sensitivity of these cells to p53 and PUMA levels. Thus, in DNA-damaged HCT116 cells, the p53-dependent induction of PUMA is not sufficient to trigger substantial cell death. However, under conditions in which PUMA induction is sufficient for apoptosis, as in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells conditionally expressing ectopic PUMA (DLD1-PUMA) (2Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), overexpression of p21Cip1 (Fig. 2C) did not protect against PUMA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that p21Cip1 does not directly block PUMA itself or the downstream events that trigger apoptosis under conditions in which PUMA expression alone is sufficient for apoptosis. In contrast to apoptosis in DLD1-PUMA cells, apoptosis in DNA-damaged HCT116 p21-/- cells must require other events in addition to PUMA induction and these events must be sensitive to inhibition by p21Cip1. To study the differences in how DNA-damaged HCT116 wild-type and p21-/- cells process similar proapoptotic signals, we sought to identify the step in the apoptosis cascade that is interrupted by the presence of p21Cip1 in these cells. First, we investigated the activation of caspases in DNA-damaged cells. The sensitivity of HCT116 p21-/- cells to p53-induced apoptosis was inhibited when adriamycin-treated cells were concurrently exposed to carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor (Fig. 2D). There was a small percentage of cell death in the p21-/- cell population that was not inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk at 96 h. This observation raises the possibility that a caspase-independent mechanism of cell death is also triggered in DNA-damaged cells, but the majority of cell death was prevented when caspase activity was inhibited. To confirm the presence of activated caspases, intracellular staining of fixed cells with an antibody that specifically recognizes the active form of caspase-3 was carried out, and a higher level of activated caspase-3 was observed in p21-/- cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 2E). Cells that have been concurrently treated with adriamycin and Z-VAD-fmk to inhibit caspase activity did not display strong intracellular staining for the active form of caspase-3, confirming the specificity of the antibody. These results indicate that cell death induced by DNA damage is predominantly executed by caspases and p21Cip1 impedes the progression of the apoptotic pathway at a point prior to caspase activation. p21Cip1 Prevents Amplification of the Cytochrome c Release Process—The intrinsic apoptosis pathway initiates caspase activation through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (27Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar) to induce formation of the apoptosome, consisting of cytochrome c, ATP, and Apaf-1. Procaspase-9 is recruited to the complex and activated (28Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), triggering the subsequent activation of effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). Among the many substrates of effector caspases, ICAD (29Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar) and Acinus (30Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) are responsible for mediating DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation, while cleavage of NDUFS1, the p75 kDa subunit of respiratory complex I, results in mitochondrial dysfunction such as disruption of electron transport and loss in transmembrane potential (31Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We investigated whether wild-type and p21-/- cells display differences in the ability to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to DNA damage. First we verified that adriamycin treatment of HCT116 p21-/- cells induced cytochrome c release, as characterized by a disperse pattern of cytochrome c immunofluorescence staining that accompanied nuclear condensation in these cells (Fig. 3A). Addition of Z-VAD-fmk to block caspase activity inhibited apoptosis, as determined by the absence of nuclear condensation, but it did not prevent cytochrome c release (Fig. 3, A and C). This suggests that the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is likely to be a direct effect of an increase in the expression levels of PUMA and other proapoptotic factors. To quantitatively characterize this process under various conditions, we used flow cytometry to analyze fixed cells that were intracellularly stained for cytochrome c. Prior to fixation, the cell membrane was permeabilized with digitonin, allowing cytosolic cytochrome c released from the mitochondria to diffuse out of the cell (24Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In both wild-type and p21-/- cells, treatment with adriamycin caused an increase in the proportion of cells showing a loss of cytochrome c signal, indicating cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Fig. 3B). However, the proportion of cells showing a loss of cytochrome c signal, as well as the extent of that loss, was more pronounced in p21-/- cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The majority of cells with cytochrome c released from the mitochondria in the wild-type and p21-/- populations was not affected by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3C), but Z-VAD-fmk had a strong effect on inhibition of cell death as determined by a sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 3D) in the same experiment. This is consistent with the immunofluorescence staining data in Fig. 3A showing that cytochrome c can be released from the mitochondria in the absence of caspase activity. In addition, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was more pronounced in the p21-/- cells than in the wild-type HCT116 cells (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these results suggest that the amplification of the mitochondria pathway is inhibited in DNA-damaged cells expressing p21Cip1. p21Cip1 Uncouples the Cell Cycle from Activation Caspases—To search for clues that can explain the competence of p21-/- cells, but not wild-type cells, to trigger cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase activation, we investigated the stage in the cell cycle at which caspase activation occurs upon adriamycin treatment. For this purpose, we measured the accumulation of activated caspases as adriamycin-treated cells progressed through cell cycle over time. We used a fluorescent analog of Z-VAD-fmk in which the FITC group is substituted for the carbobenzoxy (z) N-terminal blocking group. This reagent irreversibly binds to activated caspases, inhibiting their activity to initiate downstream events such as DNA fragmentation while fluorescently marking cells that have achieved activation of caspases (32Jayaraman S. Cytometry A. 2003; 56: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar increases in the percentage of cells with active caspases after adriamycin treatment were observed in both wild-type and p21-/- cells with a 2N DNA content, but there was a clear difference between the wild-type and p21-/- cells with a DNA content of 4N or higher. The wild-type population showed small changes in the percentage of cells with activated caspases after 72 h of adriamycin treatment, whereas the corresponding p21-/- cells displayed a more prominent change in the percentage of cells with activated caspases (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the majority of the gain in caspase activity primarily occurred in p21-/- cells that had progressed beyond G2/M phase. These results suggest that the cell cycle is a contributing factor in enhancing the sensitivity of DNA-damaged p21-/- cells to trigger caspase activation in response to PUMA induction. Cell Cycle Uncoupling from Caspase Activation Is a General Property of CDK Inhibitors—To further investigate whether the sensitivity of HCT116 p21-/- cells to adriamycin is a result of deregulated cell cycle progression, we determined whether other CDK inhibitors can compensate for the absence of p21Cip1. HCT116 p21-/- cells were infected with adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (β-gal), p21Cip1, p27Kip1, or p16Ink4a. Both p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 preferentially target Cdk2, but p27Kip1 is structurally and functionally divergent from p21Cip1 outside the CDK inhibitory domain (33Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 34Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A.

Furthermore, p16Ink4a is structurally unrelated to p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 and directly targets Cdk4/6 but not Cdk2 (36Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, the various CDK inhibitors prevented DNA fragmentation (sub-G1 DNA content), an indication of cell death in p21-/- cells that were exposed to adriamycin (Fig. 5, A and B) or γ-radiation (Fig. 5A). Cells expressing p21Cip1, p27Kip1, orp16Ink4a underwent G1 arrest when left untreated and G1 and G2 arrest when treated with adriamycin (Fig. 5C). Together, these results show that preventing cell cycle progression after DNA damage can hinder the ability of these cells to trigger apoptosis. To characterize the DNA damage response of p21-/- cells expressing the different CDK inhibitors, we analyzed the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 6A), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 6B), and active caspase-3 (Fig. 6C) in these cells. p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p16Ink4a inhibited each of these processes. Thus, p27Kip1 and p16Ink4a are as effective as p21Cip1 in inhibiting the amplification of the mitochondrial-dependent caspase activation pathway and thereby reducing the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1971409831,"We succeeded in isolating a novel organic solute carrier from a human placenta cDNA library. The isolated cDNA consisted of 1137 base pairs that encoded a 379-amino acid protein, hOSCP1. Northern blot and reverse transcription PCR analyses revealed that the hOSCP1 mRNA is expressed in the placenta and testis and weakly expressed in the thymus and small intestine. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, hOSCP1 mediated the high affinity transport of p-aminohippurate (PAH) (Km = 35.0 ± 7.5 μm) and tetraethylammonium (Km = 62.3 ± 12.2 μm) in a sodium-independent manner. However, the hOSCP1-expressing oocyte did not mediate the transport of l-carnitine. The transport of PAH by hOSCP1 was sensitive to pH, but the tetraethylammonium was not transported at the high pH examined. hOSCP1 transported prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, estrone sulfate, glutarate, l-leucine, l-ascorbic acid, and tetracycline. Thus, hOSCP1 also showed broad substrate specificity. A wide range of structurally unrelated organic compounds inhibited the hOSCP1-mediated PAH uptake. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the hOSCP1 protein is localized in the basal membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast in the human placenta. Our results suggest that hOSCP1 is a novel polyspecific organic solute carrier protein responsible for drug clearance from the human placenta.

The plasma membrane of epithelial cells plays a central role in the elimination of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ionic substrates including drugs and environmental toxicants (1Moller J.V.

Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that transporters in the liver and kidney are primarily responsible for drug clearance. Such transporters are divided into five distinct families; the organic anion transporters (OATs 3The abbreviations used are: OAT, organic anion transporter; hOAT, human OAT; OCT, organic cation transporter; hOSCP1, human organic solute carrier protein 1; GTC, guanidinium thiocyanate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; OATP, organic anion transporting polypeptide; OST, organic solute transporter; PAH, p-aminohippurate; RT, reverse transcription; TEA, tetraethylammonium.; SLC22A), the organic cation transporters (OCTs; SLC22A), the ATP-dependent transporters (ABCs), the Na+-coupled bile acid transporters (NTCP; SLC10A1), and the Na+-independent organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs/oatps; SLC21/SLCO) (6Hagenbuch B.

These transporters are mainly expressed in the brain, liver, and kidney and are involved in the elimination of various organic solutes (organic anions and cations) and conjugated substrates from the body. Thus, the transporters' function serves as a drug clearance system for the protection of the body from toxic compounds (1Moller J.V. Sheikh M.I. Pharmacol.

The blood-placenta barrier is well known to exist in the human placenta. The fetus is very sensitive to foreign substrates that enter the fetal circulation, and numerous drugs and chemicals have been known to cause malformations and growth defects. Whitsett (12Whitsett J.A. J. Pediatr. 1980; 96: 600-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has revealed that the transport system of the syncytioblast mediating absorption and excretion is present in the syncytial microvillous membrane and the basal membrane. In addition, Van der Aa et al. (13Van der Aa E.M. Meuwsen I.J. Boersen A.C.M. Wouterse A.C. Copius Peereboom-Stegeman J.H.J. Russel F.G.M. Placenta. 1994; 15: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have reported that PAH is extensively transported by the membrane vesicle isolated from the human placenta in a pH-dependent manner, suggesting that there exists a transport mechanism or mechanisms for the uptake of organic solutes in the placenta (13Van der Aa E.M. Meuwsen I.J. Boersen A.C.M. Wouterse A.C. Copius Peereboom-Stegeman J.H.J. Russel F.G.M. Placenta. 1994; 15: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that organic ion transporters such as hOAT4 and OCT3 are abundantly expressed on the basal membrane (14Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H.

However, there are still limited data concerning the molecular mechanism on the transport of organic solutes in the human placenta. In the present report, therefore, we describe the molecular cloning and functional characterization of human organic solute carrier protein 1 (hOSCP1). Our results indicate that hOSCP1 is a novel gene that mediates various kinds of organic solutes in a pH-dependent and sodium-independent manner on the basal membrane of the placenta. Materials—[14C]PAH (40.6 mCi/mmol) and [3H]valproate (55 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek (Brea, CA). [14C]TEA (55 mCi/mmol), [3H]tetracycline (1 Ci/mmol), [14C]glutarate (55 mCi/mmol), l-[14C]leucine (55 mCi/mmol), and l-[3H]carnitine hydrochloride (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ARC Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [3H]Prostaglandin E2 (193.5 Ci/mmol), [14C]testosterone (53.6 mCi/mmol), [3H]prostaglandin F2α (214.7 Ci/mmol), [3H]estrone sulfate (57.3 Ci/mmol), [14C]androstenedione (53.6 mCi/mmol), [14C]progesterone (55.4 mCi/mmol), [α-14C]ketoglutarate (54.5 mCi/mmol), l-[14C]ascorbic acid (4 mCi/mmol), and [14C]salicylic acid (55.5 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]dCTP (111 TBq/mmol) was obtained from Muromachi Yakuhin Kaisha, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals not listed here were of the highest grade commercially available. Construction of cDNA Library and Isolation of hOSCP1—A nondirectional cDNA library was prepared from human placenta poly(A)+ RNA using the Superscript choice system (Invitrogen) and was ligated into a phage vector λZipLox EcoRI arms (Invitrogen). An expressed sequence tag data base searched for “query hOAT2,” and an expressed sequence tag clone (BX327815) was identified. The EST clone was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (T7Quick Prime kit, Amersham Biosciences) (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), and the library was screened with an expressed sequence tag clone as a probe under low stringency conditions. Replicate filters of a phage library were hybridized overnight in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate, 3× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.3 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm MES, and 0.03% antifoam A, pH 6.5) at 37 °C overnight. The filters were washed in 3× standard saline citrate and 0.5% SDS at 37 °C. cDNA inserts in positive λZipLox phage were recovered in a plasmid pZL1 vector by in vitro excision. DNA Sequence and Hydropathy Analysis—Double-stranded cDNA of isolated clones were sequenced in both directions. Deleted clones, obtained by a KiloSequence deletion kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), and specifically synthesized oligonucleotide primers were used for sequencing hOSCP1, which was sequenced by the dye terminator method using a dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an automated Applied Biosystems 310 DNA sequencer. The sequence, membrane topology, and presence of possible signal peptides were assembled and analyzed using DNASIS-Pro (HITACHI Software Engineering, Yokohama, Japan). Total RNA Isolation, Northern Blotting, and RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC)-phenol-chloroform extraction method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). The tissue was homogenized in GTC solution (4 m GTC containing 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol; 10 ml of GTC solution was used per 100 mg of liver tissue). The RNA was extracted twice into phenol and chloroform (1 volume of phenol, 0.2 volume of chloroform, and 1 volume of GTC solution) and precipitated with isopropanol at room temperature. The pellet was dissolved in 0.3 ml GTC solution and precipitated with isopropanol at -20 °C. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with ice-cold 80% ethanol and dissolved in an appropriate volume of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The RNA yield, purity, and integrity were determined by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260/280 nm (>1.6) and checked with 1% agarose/formamide gel. A commercially available hybridization blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues (human multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blots I and II, Clontech) and human cancer cell line MTN blots (Clontech) were used for the Northern blot analysis. Total RNA from human thymus, liver, small intestine, testis, and placenta were purchased from Clontech. Two μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from various mouse and rat tissues were loaded onto 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. After electrophoresis, the nucleic acids were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). These filters were hybridized at 42 °C overnight in a hybridization solution (50% formamide) with full-length cDNA of hOSCP1, which was randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP as described above. The membrane was washed in 0.1× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. hOSCP1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using the sense primer 5′-GTGCTGCTGGTCACTTTCAA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGATACTCGGATGTGCAGGT-3′ to yield a 192-bp fragment corresponding to the coding region between base pairs 331 and 522. RT-PCR was performed under the conditions of one cycle at 60 °C for 30 min, one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, and annealing at 45 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 3 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). X. Laevis Oocyte Preparation, cRNA Synthesis, and Transport Assays—Isolation of stage V and stage VI defolliculated Xenopus oocytes was performed as described elsewhere (18Kobayashi Y. Ohshiro N. Shibusawa A. Sasaki T. Tokuyama S. Sekine T. Endou H. Yamamoto T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To remove the follicular layer from Xenopus oocytes, collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) was used at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in a oocyte Ringer 2 solution (83 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The isolated clone, hOSCP1, was linearized with BamHI, and capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase (18Kobayashi Y. Ohshiro N. Shibusawa A. Sasaki T. Tokuyama S. Sekine T. Endou H. Yamamoto T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were microinjected with 50 ng of in vitro transcribed cRNA and incubated for 2 days in a modified Barth's solution containing gentamicin (50 μg/ml) at 18 °C. Uptake experiments of radiolabeled substrates, as indicated in each experiment, were performed in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at room temperature. For the Na+-dependent or -independent uptake experiments, we employed uptake buffers consisting of 96 mm NaCl, 96 mm LiCl, 96 mm choline chloride, or 96 mm mannitol. Oocytes were incubated in 450 μl of the same solution containing radiolabeled substrates for 1 h at room temperature. The uptake was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold ND96 solution, and the oocytes were washed with the same solution at least five times. The oocytes were solubilized with 10% SDS, and accumulated radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. The experiments were repeated with oocytes from at least five frogs. Immunohistochemical Analysis—For immunohistochemical analysis, rabbits were immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthesized peptide, EFEITEQPRLSTSK, corresponding to cysteine and the 14 amino acids of the COOH terminus of hOSCP1. A 5-μm wax section of human placenta was obtained from BioChain Institute, Inc. (San Leandro, CA), and light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using the streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex technique (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and incubated with 3% H2O2 for 25 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. After rinsing in 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, sections were treated with 10 μg/ml primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (4 °C overnight). Thereafter, the sections were incubated with the secondary biotinylated goat polyclonal antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako) for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. This step was followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined under light microscopy. For the preabsorption experiment, the hOSCP1 peptide (200 μg/ml) was added to the hOSCP1-specific antibody solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Kinetic Study—Concentration-dependent uptake experiments of [14C]PAH or [14C]TEA in oocytes expressing hOSCP1 were performed with each compound at final concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm and 1, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μm, respectively. The compounds were incubated with expressing hOSCP1 oocytes for 2 h at room temperature, stopped with ice-cold ND96 solution, and washed five times as described above. Individual oocytes were transferred to scintillation vials and dissolved in 0.25 ml of 10% SDS. A scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was counted. Counts in control uninjected oocytes were subtracted from the counts in cRNA-injected oocytes. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., except for kinetic constants for which the error represents the error of the fit. Km indicates the Michaelis-Menten constant (μm). Inhibition Study—For inhibition experiments, oocytes expressing hOSCP1 were incubated for 1 h in ND96 solution containing 10 μm [14C]PAH in the presence or absence of various inhibitors at a final concentration of 1 mm, excluding PAH (2 mm). PAH, ibuprofen, captopril, enalapril, clarithromycin, rifampicin, quinidine, diltiazem, cimetidine, and famotidine were directly dissolved in ND96 solution from the stock solution. These stock solutions of the inhibitor were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted to a final concentration as described above. The final concentration of Me2SO in the assay medium did not exceed 1%. Statistical Analysis—Kinetic data from experiments measuring the uptake of radiolabeled substrates were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least squares regression analysis with the S.E. values derived from these curves. Comparisons of data measuring the initial rates of the uptake of radiolabeled substrates in the presence and absence of inhibitors were performed by the unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. To search for a novel organic solute transport protein, we screened a human placenta cDNA library using BX327815 as a probe. After multiple rounds of screening, we isolated six positive clones. Two clones were identical to the phospholipid transfer protein (GenBank™ accession number AB076694); the remaining four clones had overlapping identical sequences and were identified as human organic solute carrier protein 1. hOSCP1 has 1137 bp with a single open reading frame encoding a 379-amino acid sequence with a calculated molecular mass of 43.3 kDa (GenBank™ accession number AB079075). There are two consensus sequences for O-glycosylation sites (Thr200 and Thr359) (Fig. 1, closed circles). Several membrane transporters have 12 predicted transmembrane domains, suggesting that these transporters may have a common membrane topology and perhaps a common evolutionary origin. However, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis revealed that hOSCP1 is likely to have three transmembrane domains. The phylogenic tree analysis using the neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood methods showed that hOSCP1 is positioned between the multidrug resistance protein 2 and rat liver-methotrexate carrier 1. While this study was being conducted, a sequence from humans was submitted to the GenBank™ (oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein NOR1; accession number AF462348). The nucleotide sequence of hOSCP1 is 98% identical to that of NOR1 except for five bases (G at position 92 to C, T at position 246 to G, G at position 391 to A, G at position 919 to A, and G at position 1099 to A), resulting in an amino acid change (Arg31 to Pro, Thr131 to Ala, Gly306 to Arg, Ile352 to Ala, and Gly366 to Ser). We also identified several proteins of unknown function such as 1810007P19Rik protein (GenBank™ accession number AAH45150; Mus musculus) and an unnamed protein product (GenBank™ accession number BAC05326; Homo sapiens) that exhibited ∼93 and 96% predicted amino acid identity, respectively. To elucidate the tissue distribution of the hOSCP1 gene in humans, Northern blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A (left section), a strong 1.4-kb mRNA band and one weak band corresponding to a shorter transcript (1 kb) were detected predominantly in the human testis. A significant 1.4-kb mRNA was also faintly detected in other tissues of the thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, heart, brain, placenta, lung, kidney, and pancreas. No positive signal was detected in the spleen, colon, peripheral blood leukocytes, liver, and skeletal muscle. To confirm this, we chose some tissues and subsequently performed RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A (right section), RT-PCR identified a signal for hOSCP1 cDNA in the thymus, small intestine, and placenta, but not in the liver. Based on these findings, we next examined the distribution of hOSCP1 mRNA in mouse and rat tissues by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, hOSCP1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the male mouse and rat testes. Hybridization signals could not be detected in mRNA isolated from other tissues such as the brain, eye, lung, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. However, no short transcript (1 kb) was detected in mouse and rat tissues as observed in human tissues. Thus, the expression of hOSCP1 mRNA in rodents was tissue-specific. We could not detect any bands corresponding to hOSCP1 mRNA in all tissues of the guinea pig (data not shown), indicating species-related differential distribution of the hOSCP1 gene. Interestingly, specific bands corresponding to hOSCP1 were detected in several human tumor-derived cell lines such as HL60, HeLa S3, MOLT-4, Raji, SW480, A549, and G361. In particular, hOSC1 mRNA was highly expressed in A549 cells. No positive signal was detected in K562 cells. Based on the structural similarities observed between rat liver-methotrexate carrier 1 and multidrug resistance-related protein 2 (Fig. 1), we assumed that hOSCP1 can transport organic solutes. Therefore, X. laevis oocytes injected with hOSCP1 cRNA were used for the transport characterization. Because the uptake of [14C]PAH by uninjected oocytes was equal to the oocytes injected with 50 nanoliters of water (data not shown), uninjected oocytes were used as the control instead of water-injected oocytes throughout this study. As shown in TABLE ONE, hOSCP1 cRNA-injected oocytes had higher transport of [3H]estrone sulfate, [14C]glutarate, l-[14C]leucine, l-[14C]ascorbic acid, [3H]tetracycline, [3H]prostaglandin E2, [3H]prostaglandin F2α, [14C]PAH, and [14C]TEA. No significant transport activity was observed in the hOSCP1-mediated uptake of [14C]androstenedione, [14C]progesterone, [14C]testosterone, l-[3H]carnitine, [α-14C]ketoglutarate, [14C]salicylate, and [3H]valproate. These findings indicate that hOSCP1 transports structurally dissimilar compounds.TABLE ONEUptake of various 14C- and 3H-labeled compounds by hOSCP1-expressing oocytes After two days of incubation, uptake experiments were performed in a solution containing Na+ for 1 h.

To elucidate further the transport characteristics of hOSCP1 based on their findings, we examined the effect of sodium-, pH-, time-, and concentration-dependent uptake. As shown in Fig. 3A, the uptake of [14C]PAH and [14C]TEA via hOSCP1 were not affected by the replacement of extracellular sodium with choline, lithium, and mannitol. These results indicate that hOSCP1 is sodium-independent. The effect of pH on the transport of PAH and TEA by hOSCP1-expressing oocytes was subsequently examined (Fig. 3B). There was a marked change in PAH transport with pH, namely a much higher transport of PAH at a low pH and lower transport of PAH at a high pH. However, the transport of TEA was not affected by changes in pH between 5.5 and 8.5. Thus, the uptake of anionic compounds mediated by hOSCP1 is sensitive to pH, but cationic substrates are not. Fig. 3C shows the time-dependent uptake of PAH via hOSCP1. The cell-associated count of [14C]PAH increased until 2.5 h of incubation on hOSCP1-expressing oocytes. Likewise, the transport of [14C]TEA via hOSCP1 showed time dependence up to 2.5 h (data not shown). This result indicates that hOSCP1 not only binds but also translocates organic solutes into cytoplasm. The concentration dependence of the uptake of [14C]PAH and [14C]TEA via hOSCP1 is shown in Fig. 4. The hOSCP1-mediated uptake of [14C]PAH and [14C]TEA showed saturable kinetics and could be modeled by the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 4, A and B). Nonlinear regression analyses yielded Km values of 35.0 ± 7.5 μm and 62.3 ± 12.2 μm for PAH and TEA, respectively. These findings lead us to conclude that hOSCP1 mediated the transport of anionic organic solutes in a sodium-independent and pH-dependent manner.FIGURE 4Concentration dependence of hOSCP1-mediated uptake of p-[14C]aminohippuric acid (A) and [14C]tetraethylammonium (B). The uptake rate of p-aminohippuric acid by the control and hOSCP1-expresing oocytes for 1 h were measured at variable concentrations (mean ± S.E.; n = 8-10 oocytes). Other experimental conditions and details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate further the substrate specificity of hOSCP1, the inhibition of hOSCP1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake by various compounds was subsequently investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, cis-inhibitory effects were observed for structurally unrelated organic anions. The inhibition of the hOSCP1-mediated transport of [14C]PAH exhibited a rank order of enalapril > quinidine > captopril = famotidine = ibuprofen = cimetidine. The results indicate that hOSCP1 functions as a carrier with broad substrate specificity. To determine the localization of hOSCP1 in the placenta, we subsequently carried out an immunohistochemical analysis. Light microscopy of 5-μm wax sections demonstrated that there was specific immunostaining of hOSCP1 in the placenta (Fig. 6B). Under high magnification, hOSCP1 was located in the basal membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast (Fig. 6C). By preincubation of the antibody with hOSCP1 peptide, the immunoreactivity was diminished (Fig. 6A). The specificity of the antibody for hOSCP1 was verified by these results. The present study describes the isolation and functional characterization of a novel organic solute carrier protein, hOSCP1. The placenta consists of syncytiotrophoblasts or polarized cells as well as kidney proximal tubules and intestinal epithelial cells that mediate the absorption of essential nutrients and the excretion of waste products, including organic compounds for developing the fetus and protecting it from toxic compounds (12Whitsett J.A.

In addition to regulating the activation of PAK1, Rac1 controls multiple downstream pathways to regulate cell growth and differentiation, as well as cell motility. Signaling by a constitutively activated Rac1 mutant deficient in PAK binding (Rac1Q61L-40C) was examined to determine whether Nischarin impinges on these other Rac1 effector pathways. Nischarin formed immunoprecipitatable complexes with Rac1Q61L and Rac1Q61L-40C when the proteins were co-expressed. In NIH3T3 cells, Rac1Q61L and Rac1Q61L-40C stimulation of a minimal NF-κB response element or the cyclin D1 promoter, a downstream target of NF-κB, was inhibited by co-expression of Nischarin. Additionally, suppression of endogenous Nischarin protein with small interfering RNA in PC12 cells enhanced Rac1Q61L and Rac1Q61L-40C activation of NF-κB. In further support of Nischarin suppressing PAK independent Rac signaling, foci formation in monolayers of NIH3T3 cells by Rac1Q61L-40C in cooperation with c-Raf/CAAX was inhibited by the presence of Nischarin. Nischarin alters the cellular localization of Rac1Q61L and Rac1Q61L-40C to vesicles and this positively correlates with the repression of the Rac1 signal. Thus, Nischarin, in addition to regulating the PAK strand of Rac1 signaling, can also regulate other links in the web of Rac1 signaling pathways.

The Rho GTPases are a family of 20 proteins that act as molecular switches that assist in the transduction of signals through the interior of the cells. Activation of a variety of cell surface receptors shifts the Rho GTPases from the inactive GDP bound state to the active GTP bound state through the activity of numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors. The active GTPase can then interact with a myriad of effectors and modulate their function. GTPase activating proteins suppress signaling by the Rho GTPases by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (1Karnoub A.E. Symons M. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Rac1 is an important and well studied member of the Rho GTPase family of proteins. Rac1 signaling regulates numerous and disparate cellular functions including motility, cell cycle traverse, cytoskeletal remodeling, endocytosis, and cellular transformation (2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

To mediate these effects on cellular phenotype, Rac1 interacts with a variety of effector proteins. For example, Rac1 regulation of cell motility is mediated, in part, by interaction with the family of p21-activated kinases (PAK). 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; ERK1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; IRAS, imidazoline receptor antisera-selected cDNA; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CAAX, a prenylation motif where A is an aliphatic amino acid (italicized letters represent unknowns); IκB, NF-κB inhibitor. Activated PAK stimulates the formation of cortical actin networks, which are important for Rac-induced lamellipodia, by suppressing the actin-depolymerizing activity of cofilin via the activation of LIM kinase. PAK also readies the cell for movement by suppressing stress fiber formation and increasing focal adhesion turnover, in part, by disrupting the actin myosin network through inactivation of myosin light chain kinase (8Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Independently from PAK, Rac1 interacts with the dormant, multiprotein WAVE complex through PIR121 and Nap125, to stimulate the dissociation of WAVE and allowing it to activate the actin polymerizing Arp2/3 complex. Rac has also been found to complex with WAVE through IRSp53 to modulate WAVE function (9Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W.

Similarly, Rac1 can regulate proliferative signals through various means such as activation of PAK and its subsequent phosphorylation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase components or via other mechanisms, such as stimulation of NF-κB through the NF-κB inducing kinase (11Page K.

Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Nischarin was cloned from a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α5 subunit as “bait” (17Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nischarin interacts directly with α5 through membrane proximal residues of the α5 cytoplasmic domain (18Alahari S.K. Nasrallah H. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of intracellular Nischarin impede α5-dependent cell motility in fibroblast and epithelial cells (17Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Nischarin inhibits Rac1-stimulated cell motility and this directly correlates with its ability to inhibit signaling via the Rac1 effector PAK1 (18Alahari S.K. Nasrallah H. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Alahari S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nischarin preferentially binds activated PAK1 and forms a complex with PAK1 via its N terminus and the kinase domain of PAK. The association of Nischarin with PAK1 inhibits PAK1 activation and, thus, PAK1-stimulated migration (20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As described above, in addition to PAK, Rac1 has multiple downstream effectors and can act independently of PAK to regulate processes such as cell proliferation and transformation (2Burridge K.

Using a PAK binding-deficient mutant of Rac, Rac1Q61L-40C, we have found that Nischarin can interact with activated Rac independently of its interaction with PAK. This interaction is functionally important because Nischarin inhibits PAK-independent Rac1 signal transduction and cell transformation. Thus, in addition to regulating the PAK1 arm of Rac signal transduction, Nischarin may regulate Rac1 signaling via other Rac effector pathways. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4,500 mg/liter d-glucose and sodium pyruvate supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO). PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% horse serum (GIBCO®, Invitrogen Cell Culture, Carlsbad, CA) and 5% fetal bovine serum. Vectors—The cDNA for full-length mouse nischarin, the N terminus (aa 1–802), and the C terminus (aa 970–1354) were inserted at the EcoRV/NotI sites in the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1 B+ Myc/His (pcDNA) (Invitrogen). Full-length human PAK1 cDNA (provided by J. Chernoff) and β-galactosidase were expressed from pcDNA3.1 B+ Myc/His. Myc-GFP was expressed from the pCMV/myc/cyto/GFP vector from Invitrogen. HA-tagged Rac1Q61L, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, and c-Raf/CAAX (provided by C. Der) were expressed from the pCGN vector (21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The AU5-Rac1 wild type expression vector was provided by K. Burridge. The NF-κB reporter plasmid (3×NF-κB-LUC) contains three repeats of the NF-κB site from the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat ligated into the pGL2-Promoter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The -963/+134 cyclin D1-luciferase reporter construct (-963-CD1LUC) was provided by R. Pestell (21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—For Nischarin/Rac1 binding, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of Myc-Nischarin plasmid and 0.5 μg of HA-Rac1Q61L or HA-Rac1Q61L-40C plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in Rac lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were pre-cleared with Protein G-Sepharose® (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA) or anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Covance) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose®, and the precipitates were resolved on a 4–20% gradient gel. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with the antibodies used for the various epitope tags with ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences) using standard techniques. For the immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rac1, exponentially growing PC12 cells were lysed in the Rac lysis buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100. A 1:100 dilution of an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate Rac1 as described above (anti-Rac1, clone 23A8, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). Normal mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used at an equivalent concentration in parallel as a control. The immunoprecipitated Rac1 was detected with the same antibody, and the bound Nischarin was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a Nischarin peptide (aa 219–236). Stimulated Rac/Nischarin Interaction—COS-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of Myc-Nischarin plasmid and 1 μg of AU5-Rac1 using FuGENE 6. Twenty-four hours after the beginning of the transfection, the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in serum-free DMEM for 18 h. The cells were treated with 25 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 10 min (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The cells were lysed in Rac lysis buffer plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Myc-Nischarin was immunoprecipitated with a 1:100 dilution of 9E10 monoclonal antibody. The blots were probed with a biotinylated, monoclonal anti-AU5 antibody (Covance) and detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Assays—NIH3T3 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well and grown overnight. The cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of plasmid for Myc-Nischarin, Myc-N terminus, Myc-C terminus, or Myc-β-galactosidase and 1 μg of HA-Rac1Q61L, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, or pCGN plasmid, and 1 μg of 3×NF-κB-LUC or -963-CD1LUC plasmid with SuperFect™ (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were washed with PBS and incubated overnight in DMEM + 0.5% calf serum. After starvation, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 150 μl of 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego CA). For PC12 cells, 12-well plates were coated with 0.5 ml of 20 μg/ml collagen in 30% ethanol and dried overnight. The coated plates were seeded with 4 × 105 cells and grown overnight. The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) with 900 ng of plasmid for Myc-Nischarin or Myc-β-galactosidase and 300 ng of HA-Rac1Q61L, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, or pCGN plasmids and 300 ng of 3×NF-κB-LUC. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were washed with PBS, starved in serum-free DMEM for 12–15 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity. For suppression of endogenous Nischarin protein levels by siRNA, a previously described 21-base pair siRNA oligonucleotide for rat Nischarin, rCrCUrCrGUrGrCrArCrCUUrGrArCrCUrGTT (20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or a nonspecific control duplex siRNA (#D-001206-07-20) were synthesized by Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. The siRNA oligomers at a concentration of 150 nm were co-transfected with 500 ng of HA-Rac1Q61L, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, or pCGN plasmid and 500 ng of 3×NF-κB-LUC into PC12 cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were washed with PBS, starved in serum-free DMEM for 12–15 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity. Nischarin levels were determined with a monoclonal anti-Nischarin antibody (BD Biosciences). α-Tubulin was detected with a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). All of the luciferase assays were performed in triplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized to protein levels. Foci Forming Assays—NIH3T3 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at 4 × 105 cells per plate. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of Rac1Q61L-40C, 100 ng of c-Raf-CAAX, both, or the pCGN vector control and 2 μg of Myc-Nischarin or pcDNA using SuperFect™. The cells were kept at confluence for 21–24 days with media changes every 3–4 days. The colonies were visualized and counted after staining with 0.1% crystal violet. The experiments were performed with triplicate or quadruplicate plates for each treatment. Confocal Microscopy—NIH3T3 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well and grown overnight. The cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of Myc-Nischarin, Myc-N terminus, Myc-C terminus, or pcDNA vectors and 1 μg of HA-Rac1Q61L, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, or pCGN with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized, and half of the cells were replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips (10 μg/ml) in DMEM + 10% calf serum, and grown overnight. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-Myc (9E10) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-HA (HA.11) antibodies (Covance) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and rinsed with H2O. The stained cells were observed on an Olympus Confocal FV300 fluorescent microscope with a 60× oil immersion objective; images were acquired by using Olympus Fluoview software. Nischarin Interacts with Rac1 Independently of PAK—Nischarin directly interacts with activated PAK1 and suppresses PAK1 kinase activity. Additionally, co-expression of activated Rac1 with PAK1 and Nischarin stimulates association of PAK1 with Nischarin without preventing association of Rac1 with PAK1. All three proteins can be found in Nischarin immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing Nischarin, PAK1, and activated Rac1 (20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The presence of Rac1 in the Nischarin-PAK1 intracellular complex may solely depend on the association of Rac1 with PAK1. Alternatively, Rac1 could associate with Nischarin through PAK1-independent interactions. Overexpression of HA-tagged, constitutively activated Rac1 (HA-Rac1Q61L) with Myc-tagged Nischarin (Myc-Nischarin) in the absence of exogenous PAK1 in COS-7 cells allowed co-precipitation of Myc-Nischarin with the immunoprecipitated HA-Rac1Q61L (Fig. 1A). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of Myc-Nischarin also co-precipitates HA-Rac1Q61L (Fig. 1B). Nischarin does not exhibit detectable interaction with the unrelated protein, HA-ERK1, under these experimental conditions nor does HA-Rac1Q61L interact with Myc-GFP. This indicates that the Nischarin/Rac1 interaction is specific. The retention of the Rac1/Nischarin interaction in the absence of exogenously expressed PAK1 suggests that the binding of Rac1 to Nischarin may have a PAK-independent component because the levels of endogenous PAK are unlikely to be sufficient to mediate this interaction. To directly test if the interaction of Nischarin with Rac1 required PAK1, a PAK binding-deficient mutant of Rac1, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C, was used. Several laboratories have used this Rac1 effector domain mutant to investigate PAK-independent functions of Rac1 (16Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Myc-Nischarin and Myc-PAK1 were co-expressed in COS-7 cells with HA-Rac1Q61L or HA-Rac1Q61L-40C. Immunoprecipitation of Nischarin or PAK1 by their Myc epitopes consistently co-precipitated HA-Rac1Q61L. In agreement with previous studies (16Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), HA-Rac1Q61L-40C did not co-precipitate with immunoprecipitated PAK1. However, HA-Rac1Q61L-40C was repeatedly co-immunoprecipitated with Nischarin (Fig. 1C). Thus, the complex formation between Nischarin and active Rac1 does not require the interaction of Rac1 with PAK. Previously described Rac1 effector domain mutants (E31V, F37L, and N43D) were also examined in the co-immunoprecipitation assay and they did not abrogate the Rac1/Nischarin interaction (data not shown) (16Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nischarin and Rac1 can interact at the normal, endogenous levels of the proteins, PC12 cells were used because Nischarin is expressed well in PC12 cells (17Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Lysates were made from exponentially growing cells, and Rac1 was immunoprecipitated with a Rac1-specific monoclonal antibody. The endogenous Nischarin was co-immunoprecipitated in four separate experiments (Fig. 1D). Thus, the interaction between Rac1 and Nischarin occurs at physiological levels of expression. Nischarin interacts with α5 integrin and PAK1 through overlapping domains in the N terminus (aa 1–802) of the protein (20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine which region of Nischarin Rac1 interacts, Myc-tagged forms of the N and C terminus of Nischarin (aa 970–1354) were co-expressed with HA-Rac1Q61L in COS-7 cells. The N terminus of Nischarin consistently co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Rac1Q61L when expressed in COS-7 cells. The C terminus also co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Rac1Q61L, but with reduced efficiency (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of the Nischarin fragments via the Myc epitope produced a similar binding pattern (data not shown). The HA-Rac1Q61L-40C mutant exhibited a similar co-immunoprecipitation pattern with Nischarin and its fragments as HA-Rac1Q61L (Fig. 2B). Thus, the formation of Nischarin intracellular complexes with activated Rac1 by either domain of Nischarin does not require the interaction of Rac1 with PAK and the 40C substitution does not alter the interaction of Rac1 with either domain. Additionally, the interaction of Rac1 with the C terminus of Nischarin supports the PAK-independent nature of this interaction because PAK1 exhibited no interaction with the C terminus of Nischarin (20Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Growth Factor-stimulated Interaction of Rac and Nischarin—Rac switches to its activated state in response to signals from various cell surface receptors (2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar). To test if a natural cell stimulus could stimulate the Rac1/Nischarin interaction, COS-7 cells co-expressing wild type AU5-Rac1 and Nischarin were treated with EGF. The cells were harvested after 10 min of treatment with EGF. Myc-Nischarin was immunoprecipitated and the precipitates were examined for the presence of AU5-Rac1. Rac1 was detected in the Myc-Nischarin immunoprecipitate after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3). This mimicked the stimulated binding of PAK1 to Rac1 in parallel immunoprecipitations. This EGF-stimulated interaction between Rac1 and Nischarin points to an important physiological role for this interaction. Nischarin Regulation of PAK-independent Rac Signaling—The observation of a PAK-independent interaction between Nischarin and Rac1 suggested that Nischarin may be able to regulate Rac1 functions that are not dependent on PAK for their execution. NIH3T3 cells have been used in conjunction with the Rac1Q61L-40C effector domain mutant to identify PAK-independent pathways downstream of Rac1 (16Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). One Rac1 pathway that appears to be independent of PAK in NIH3T3 cells is the NF-κB pathway (12Cammarano M.S. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25876-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Nischarin on Rac1 stimulation of NF-κB using a 3×NF-κB response element linked to a luciferase reporter construct, 3×NF-κB-LUC. Expression of activated Rac1Q61L or Rac1Q61L-40C in NIH3T3 cells stimulated the NF-κB response element 5- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). An activated mutant of PAK1, PAK1-T423E, which mimics the kinase domain activation loop phosphorylation, was unable to stimulate 3×NF-κB-LUC. This underscores the PAK independence of the NF-κB signaling in NIH3T3 cells. Co-expression of Nischarin with Rac1Q61L or Rac1Q61L-40C suppressed the Rac1-stimulated NF-κB response by 59 and 73%, respectively. Expression of the N terminus also significantly suppressed Rac1Q61L activation of NF-κB by 72% and Rac1Q61L-40C stimulation by 80%. However, expression of the C terminus did not suppress the activation of NF-κB by either form of activated Rac (Fig. 4A). Thus, the N terminus of Nischarin inhibits Rac1-mediated stimulation of the NF-κB pathway independently of PAK function. Activated Rac1 stimulates cyclin D1 gene expression. This stimulation can occur independently of PAK activation and is mediated in part by NF-κB activation (21Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 23Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U. Lee R.J. Segall J.E. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Pestell R.G.

Cell. 2001; 8: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of -963-CD1LUC with Rac1Q61L or Rac1Q61L-40C, respectively, stimulated the cyclin D1 promoter by 10- and 7-fold (Fig. 4B). Expression of PAK1-T423E had little effect on the level of cyclin D1 promoter activity. Co-expression of Nischarin with Rac1Q61L suppressed cyclin D1 promoter activation by 46%. Rac1Q61L-40C-stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activation was inhibited 58% by co-transfected Nischarin. The N terminus of Nischarin suppressed Rac1Q61L stimulation of the cyclin D1 promoter by 73% and it inhibited the Rac1Q61L-40C stimulation by 78%. Co-expression of the C terminus of Nischarin with either activated Rac1 did not suppress the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 4B). Thus, the ability of Nischarin to inhibit the Rac1-stimulated cyclin D1 maps to the N terminus and does not require Rac1 to PAK signaling. To determine whether the physiological role of Nischarin in Rac signal transduction is to act as a suppressor of Rac1 signaling, the effect of siRNA suppression of endogenous Nischarin on NF-κB activation by Rac1 was examined in PC12 cells. Similar to the observations in NIH3T3 cells, the overexpression of Nischarin in PC12 cells with Rac1Q61L or Rac1Q61L-40C suppressed Rac1 stimulation of the NF-κB pathway by 50 and 37%, respectively (Fig. 4C). Co-transfection of siRNA for Nischarin with either Rac1Q61L or Rac1Q61L-40C in PC12 cells elevated the level of Rac1 stimulation of the NF-κB pathway by 2.2-fold for Rac1Q61L and 1.6-fold for Rac1Q61L-40C compared with the level of NF-κB activation in cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 4D). This elevation of the Rac-stimulated NF-κB response inversely correlated with the siRNA suppression of endogenous Nischarin (Fig. 4E). This data un"

Senescent fibroblasts show significant changes in the expression of mRNAs encoding extracellular matrix-remodeling proteins; among these mRNAs, the mRNA encoding fibromodulin is highly decreased in these cells. To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we explored the regulatory mechanisms of the human fibromodulin gene. We found that fibromodulin gene promoter contains a cis-element, crucial for its basal expression, that forms a DNA-protein complex when exposed to nuclear extracts from exponentially growing human fibroblasts and not to extracts from cells undergoing senescence by repeated in vitro passages or by mild oxidative stress. The purification of this complex showed that it contains the damage-specific DNA-binding protein DDB-1. The latter is known to be induced by UV irradiation; therefore we checked whether fibromodulin gene promoter is regulated upon the exposure of the cells to UV rays. The results showed that, in exponentially growing fibroblasts, the promoter efficiency is increased by UV irradiation and the DDB-1-containing complex is robustly enriched in cells exposed to UV light. Accordingly, in these experimental conditions the endogenous fibromodulin mRNA accumulates to very high levels. On the contrary, senescent cells did not show any activation of the fibromodulin gene promoter, any induction of the DDB-1-containing complex, or any accumulation of fibromodulin mRNA. These phenomena are accompanied in senescent cells by a decrease of the UV-damaged DNA binding activity."

Mediator complexes have been identified in all eukaryotic organisms examined on the basis of moderate sequence homology of their component subunits to corresponding subunits in the yeast complex (5Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and appear to play a universal role in integrating information for control of gene expression. The limited sequence homology among Mediator subunits of different eukaryotes points to a high degree of evolutionary divergence. However, it has been suggested that sequence conservation could be highest in protein segments involved in inter-subunit interactions, suggesting that the overall organization of Mediator, and perhaps its mechanism, could be conserved (6Guglielmi B. van Berkum N.L.

A significant impediment to studying the biochemical properties and structural organization of yeast Mediator stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining the complex in pure form, free from the other components of the transcription machinery. Although protocols for isolation of free Mediator have been published (4Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D.

The same type of preparation was also used for initial structural characterization of the Mediator-RNAPII interaction (18Davis J.A. Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 409-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation has been used to obtain an enriched Mediator fraction from these holoenzyme preparations and the purity of the resulting material is sufficient to identify individual Mediator subunits bands by SDS-PAGE analysis (14Lee Y.C.

However, more precise structural and biochemical characterizations of Mediator have suffered from the lack of suitable free Mediator preparations. The existence of a free subspecies of Mediator, not associated with RNAPII, has important implications for the gene regulatory properties of the complex and for the possible assembly mechanism of the preinitiation complex (19Asturias F.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A longstanding model of the transcription initiation process based on biochemical studies proposed that initiation would start with sequential assembly of the components of the basal transcription machinery (RNAPII plus at least five general transcription factors: TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIID (TBP), TFIIF, and TFIIH) (20Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 21Buratowski S. Sopta M. Greenblatt J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reports suggesting the existence of a stable Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme have called into question this “ordered recruitment” model. Depending on the details of the purification protocol, the holoenzyme complex was reported to include not only Mediator and RNAPII but also TBP and other TFIID components, various general transcription factors such as TFIIE and TFIIH, and even such large complexes as the SWI-SNI chromatin remodeling complex (23Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 176-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem.

Observation of these large complexes led to the proposition of a “holoenzyme-based” model for transcription initiation in which one large complex containing all required components of the machinery would be recruited to the promoter by an activator. Although the holoenzyme-based model for initiation is largely based on indirect evidence from studies in yeast, it has influenced the interpretation of observations in other systems, with evidence for recruitment of an individual factor interpreted as indication of recruitment of an entire holoenzyme complex (17Gaudreau L.

Several recent observations have questioned the validity of the holoenzyme-based model for transcription initiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of HO and Gal promoters and other SBF-regulated promoters clearly points to independent recruitment of Mediator and RNAPII in vivo (29Cosma M.P. Panizza S.

To address the discrepancies between the holoenzyme and sequential recruitment models, here we have sought to establish a reliable purification protocol for free Mediator by asking whether free Mediator can be identified and purified from the yeast S. cerevisiae. An improved cell lysis procedure and careful reevaluation of the Mediator purification protocol, made possible by detection and tracking of Mediator in crude whole-cell extracts, revealed that free Mediator can be identified and isolated to near homogeneity and also that free Mediator, not holoenzyme, is the predominant form of Mediator. Consistent with the results from the in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and with the isolation of free Mediator in mammalian cells, these data support a model for initiation in which different components of the transcription machinery are sequentially recruited and Mediator functions as a separate entity. In this scenario, the Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme is a transient complex formed only during the initiation process. Construction of Yeast-tagging Vector—The epitope-tagging vector, pYT006, was created by modifying the vector pU6H3HA (36De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene. 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene); the His6 tag was disabled by mutating the first four histidine residues to glycines (yielding the vector pYT005), and the sequence of the PreScission protease site (LEVLFQGP) was introduced upstream of three copies of the influenza HA epitope (yielding the vector pYT006). Construction of Tagged Yeast Strains—The yeast CEN vector carrying wild-type Med17 pCT127, was recovered from the yeast strain Z579 (37Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A His10 tag was introduced into the N terminus of the Med17 open reading frame using a QuikChange kit (Strategene), yielding the plasmid pCT127 (His10-Med17). Three copies of the HA epitope were introduced into the C terminus of the Med8 subunit using the PCR product of pYT006 as a template, with primer sets targeting Med8 genomic locus as described (36De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene. 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PCR product was used to transform the yeast strain Z572 (MATa his3Δ200 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 med17Δ2::HIS3 (CEN, URA3, MED17), Med8::Med8-PreScission-3xHA-Kan) yielding strain YT108. The plasmid, pCT127 (His10-Med17) was then transformed into strain YT108 by plasmid shuffling, yielding strain YT110 (His10-Med17, Med8-PreSci-3xHA). Analysis of Yeast Genomic DNA—Approximately 50 μl of each sample was mixed with 150 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm EDTA and incubated with 120 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of 10% SDS and 8 units of protease K (Sigma-Aldrich) were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 20 μg of glycogen was then added as a carrier and one-fifth of the extracted DNA was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Purification of Free Mediator—2 kg of yeast strain YT110 was grown in 2× YPD medium as described (38Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Cells were washed in ddH2O and frozen at -80 °C. To lyse yeast cells, 220 g of frozen cells, 100 g of dry ice, and ∼300 ml of liquid nitrogen were placed in a 2-liter stainless steel blender jar. This mixture was blended at high speed for 20 min while maintaining the level of liquid nitrogen required to allow the mixture to flow during blending. The whole-cell extract was prepared as described previously (38Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43897-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that 600 mm KOAc was used for extraction. The whole-cell extract (WCE) was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (βME), 0.5× protease inhibitor (PI) mix (100× PI mix contains 0.6 mm leupeptin, 2 mm pepstatin A, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and adjusted to the conductivity of buffer A containing 100 mm KOAc (A100). The sample was applied to a 2.5-liter Bio-Rex70 (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with buffer A100 at 1 column volume/3 h. The resin was then washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A100 followed by 2 column volumes of buffer A400, and the sample was eluted using 2 column volumes of buffer A650. Fractions containing both Med17 and Med8 were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm βME, 0.5× PI mix) and adjusted to the conductivity of buffer B containing 100 mm KOAc (B100). The sample was applied to a 220-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma-Aldrich) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B100 at 1 column volume/h. The column was washed with 1 column volume of buffer B100 and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 550 mm KOAc over 10 column volumes, with the peak Mediator fractions eluting at ∼410 mm KOAc. Fractions containing both Med17 and Med8 but not containing the CTD region of RNAPII were pooled, and CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The sample was applied to a 80-ml hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column pre-equilibrated with buffer H10 (10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 100 mm KOAc, 50 μm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm βME, 0.5× PI mix) at 1 column volume/h. The column was then washed with 1 column volume of buffer H10 and eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 200 mm potassium phosphate over 10 column volumes. Peak Mediator fractions appeared at ∼110 mm potassium phosphate. Mediator-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer Q (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 5 mm βME, 0.5× PI mix) and adjusted to the conductivity of buffer Q containing 100 mm KOAc (Q100). The sample was applied to a UnoQ6 column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer Q100 at 1.5 ml/min, and the column was washed with 1 column volume of buffer Q100 followed by 5 column volumes of buffer Q400 and eluted with a linear gradient from 400 to 1200 mm KOAc over 10 column volumes. Peak Mediator fractions appeared at 550 mm KOAc. Mediator fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer N (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.5), 1000 mm KOAc, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm βME, 0.5× PI mix) containing 10 mm imidazole (N10). Sample was applied to 5 ml of Ni2+ resin (HIS-Select, Sigma-Aldrich) pre-equilibrated with buffer N10, and the resin/sample mixture was continuously agitated at 4 °C for 18 h. The resin was allowed to drain and was then washed with 50 ml of buffer N20 over a period of 30 min and eluted with 10 ml of buffer N300 using 1 ml aliquots over a period of 45 min. Sample was dialyzed against buffer S (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 5 mm βME, 0.5× PI mix) and adjusted to the conductivity of buffer S containing 100 mm KOAc (S100). Sample was applied to a 0.16-ml UNO-S column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer S100 at 0.35 ml/min and eluted using 5 ml of buffer S700. Production of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against the Med17 subunit were generated (Covance, PA) by inoculating rabbits with the peptide DNDKNLKFLKNKDSLV (Med17 amino acids 72-87) conjugated with KLH. Polyclonal antibodies against the HA epitope were generated (at The Scripps Research Institute) by inoculating rabbits with two copies of the HA peptides, CPDYAGYPYDVPDYAGYPYDV, conjugated with KLH. Antibodies were affinity-purified by glutathione S-transferase-HA column as described (39Kellogg D.R. Moazed D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Production of polyclonal antibody against the Med18 subunit is described elsewhere. 3Y. Takagi and R. D. Kornberg, submitted for publication. Western Blot Analysis—5-μl samples were subjected to 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was carried out as described (38Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A.

Small Scale Immunoaffinity Purification of Mediator and Stability of the RNAPII-Mediator Holoenzyme—A small amount of whole-cell extract was prepared as described above but using the following low-salt extraction method. 50 g of yeast cells (from YT110 strain) were lysed using the blender method and extracted with 50 ml of 2× low-salt lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 400 mm KOAc, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm βME, and 2× PI mix). The salt concentration of the lysis buffer was carefully adjusted so that the final conductivity of the WCE was close to that of buffer A300. Half of the WCE obtained was loaded onto a 0.6 ml anti-HA antibody column (Sigma-Aldrich) pre-equilibrated with buffer A300 and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer A300 until no protein could be detected in the washes and then divided into two 0.3-ml columns. One of the 0.3-ml resin fractions was washed again with buffer A300. The other 0.3-ml resin fraction was washed with a total of 5 column volumes of buffer A600, and 5 fractions were collected. The resin was further washed with a total of 5 column volumes of buffer A1000, and 5 more fractions were collected. Finally, the resin fraction subjected to high-salt washes was equilibrated with buffer A300. Elutions from both low- and high-salt washed resin fractions were carried out by incubation with elution buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml 2× HA peptide for 15 min at 30 °C. Fractions from the 600 and 1000 mm washes, as well as peak elution fractions, were analyzed by Western blot using anti-CTD, anti-Med17, and anti-Med18 antibodies. Both sets of elutions were further analyzed by quantitative Western blot to estimate the amount of RNAPII and Mediator, using purified RNAPII and recombinant Med17 and Med18 proteins 3Y. Takagi and R. D. Kornberg, submitted for publication. as standards. From the quantitative Western blot results, the free Mediator to holoenzyme molar ratio was estimated by assuming that the signal from RNAPII represents holoenzyme and that the Mediator signal arises from the combined signal from free Mediator and holoenzyme. Specific Transcription and CTD Phosphorylation Assays—Reconstituted transcription was performed essentially as described (3Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. UnoS fractions containing purified free Mediator were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm KOAc, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm βME for 1 h at 4 °C. All factors (RNAPII, TFIIF, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIE, TFIIH, and for some experiments, Mediator and/or GCN4) and the DNA template were mixed and preincubated for 5 min. Transcription was initiated by the addition of a nucleotide mix containing ATP, CTP, and [γ-32P]UTP. This reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 45 min at 24 °C, and the final concentration of cold UTP was adjusted to 10 μm. Transcripts were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The CTD phosphorylation assay was carried out as described previously (3Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) except that 4-15% SDS-PAGE was used to resolve the phosphorylated Rpb1 subunit. Electron Microscopy Analysis—Samples were diluted to 35 μg/ml with 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), and 3.2-μl samples were applied to carbon-coated 400-mesh copper and rhodium grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) that were glow-discharged in the presence of amyl amine for 1 min. After 1 min of absorption, the samples were blotted dry and washed three times with a 1% solution of uranyl acetate. The sample was then immersed in 1% uranyl acetate, a second layer of carbon was applied to the top (40Tischendorf G.W. Zeichhardt H. Stoffler G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 134: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 41Stoffler G. Stoffler-Meilicke M. Tesche H. Modern Methods in Protein Chemistry. De Gruyter, Berlin1983: 409-455Crossref Google Scholar), and the samples were dried. Samples were imaged using a Phillips CM120 transmission electron microscope outfitted with a LaB6 filament and operated at 100 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film at ×60,000 magnification and digitized using a 7 μm step size on a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Mass Spectroscopy Analysis—5 μg of protein in 25 μl of buffer S700 was precipitated by adding an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 30 min on ice. Samples were pelleted by spinning at 13,000 × g for 10 min and washed three times in ice-cold acetone. The washed pellets were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), denatured with 8 m urea, and reduced and alkylated by incubation with 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 30 min at room temperature followed by incubation with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were divided into three aliquots and subjected to three separate digests. For trypsination, the urea concentration was adjusted to 2 m using 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), trypsin (10 ng/μl) was added in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, and the mixture was agitated overnight at 37 °C. For elastase treatment, the urea concentration was reduced to 2 m as above, elastase was added to a final concentration of 5 ng/μl, and the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. For subtilysin digests, urea concentration was reduced to 4 m, and 10 ng of subtilysin was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were loaded on a 4-cm, 250-micron internal diameter column packed with 5 μm reverse-phase beads coupled to a 3-cm column with a strong cation-exchange resin and a final 10-cm section of reverse-phase media. Peptides were eluted directly to the electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer using a gradient of 100 to 0% acetonitrile followed by stepwise elution using 10, 25, 35, 50, 65, 80, and 100% 500 mm ammonium acetate. Electrospray ionization was done at 2.5 kV, and a Thermo Finnigan LTQ was used to acquire data during the entire elution procedure. The nine largest spectral peaks were searched against the S. cerevisiae genome data base using the SEQUEST program and were sorted and filtered using the DTASelect program for each protein sequence containing at least three identified peptide fragments (42MacCoss M.J.

Using complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches, we provide novel findings regarding mechanisms by which KTI inhibits signaling pathways in ovarian cancer cells leading to invasion. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) directly activates Src kinase, which in turn activates ERK-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, the downstream targets of Src, for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) up-regulation in human ovarian cancer HRA cells. Preincubation of the HRA cells with KTI reduced the ability of TGF-β1 to trigger the uPA expression at the gene level and at the protein level. To further elucidate the mechanism of the KTI-dependent suppressive effect of TGF-β1-induced uPA expression and invasion, we investigated which signaling pathway transduced by KTI is responsible for this inhibitory effect. Here, we show that 1) KTI suppressed TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Src, ERK1/2, and Akt by 40–60%; 2) KTI was insensitive to suppress the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in the constitutively active (CA)-c-Src (Y529F) cells; 3) uPA expression was up-regulated in TGF-β1-stimulated HRA cells and in unstimulated Y529F cells; 4) the addition of KTI reduced the TGF-β1-induced increase of uPA gene and protein expression in the wild-type c-Src-transfected cells (in contrast, KTI could not inhibit uPA expression in the Y529F cells); and 5) CA-c-Src transfection resulted in a 2-fold increase in invasiveness, whereas KTI did not reduce invasion of the Y529F cells. Using additional complementary genetic approaches (CA-MEK1, CA-Akt, or kinase-dead-Akt), we conclude that KTI may suppress uPA expression and promotion of invasion possibly through one or more upstream targets of Src.

Metastasis. 2004; 21: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that neither KTI nor BBI inhibits binding of radiolabeled-bikunin to HRA cells or bikunin does not inhibit KTI binding to the cells, suggesting that their binding molecule(s) in the plasma membranes is(are) different from those of bikunin. These data allow us to hypothesize that the mechanisms of KTI will be different from those of bikunin. These findings lead to many questions about the difference in the mechanisms between KTI and bikunin. We therefore investigated the effects of KTI on the TGF-β-induced uPA up-regulation and invasiveness of wild-type and transfected cells in relation to the status of Src, ERK, and PI3K/Akt in HRA cells, because TGF-β1 can stimulate uPA expression through the Src-dependent, ERK-specific signaling cascade (15Tanaka Y.

The corresponding sense ODN was used as control for each antisense ODN. Furthermore, each inverted antisense (iAS) oligonucleotide (iAS c-Src ODN or iAS PI3K ODN) provided additional controls for the vehicle and transfection. The ODNs were synthesized, purified, and modified with phosphorothioate (17Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell Culture—The ovarian cancer cell line, HRA, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with constant humidity (3Suzuki M.

SKOv-3 ovarian cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For all experiments in which TGF-β1 was added, cells were incubated in the serum-free medium. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was added either alone or in combination in cancer cells preincubated for 30 min to 1 h with inhibitors. The protein concentrations in the supernatants of cell extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Total RNA isolations were done using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Preparation of Cell Lysate—The cell monolayers treated with or without various agents for the indicated times were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 15 min and scraped with a rubber policeman (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 3000 × g to remove cell debris. All samples were stored at –70 °C until use. In parallel, cells treated in the same condition in different dishes were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. Northern Blot Hybridization with cDNA Probes—Northern blot hybridization was carried out as described previously (14Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol.

Samples of total RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1.2% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon or nitrocellulose membranes using standard molecular biological techniques. Hybridization was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming to specific activities of 0.4–0.9 × 109 cpm/μg. uPA cDNA was prepared as described (14Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N.

Filters were reprobed with the cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to correct for the amount of RNA loaded onto the filters (14Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8022-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS-1 film at –70 °C. Filters were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad model 620 video densitometer with a one-dimensional Analyst software package for Macintosh. Western Blot Analysis—Each cell was harvested, and cell pellets were lysed as described above. Centrifuged lysates (50 μg) from each cell were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry transfer. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: monoclonal anti-uPA (antibody 3471 plus 3689), anti-β-actin, anti-phospho-Src, anti-Src, anti-phospho-Akt, ant-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 h. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using the Macintosh Image System (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Extracellular Matrix Invasion Assay—Chemoinvasion assays were carried out in a Boyden chamber as described (22Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The upper surface of chamber was precoated with a layer of artificial basement membrane, Matrigel. The cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which acted as a chemoattractant. To measure invasion, incubation was at 37 °C for 24 h. The invaded cells in the lower side of the filter were stained with hematoxylin. Triplicate filters were used for each cell type and assay condition, and 10 random fields were counted per filter under a microscope (×400). The experiments of inhibition of cell invasiveness were performed as follows. Because wortmannin is unstable at 37 °C in culture medium, it was added every 6 h to the upper chamber of the Matrigel invasion assay. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent triplicate experiments. All statistical analysis was performed using StatView for Macintosh. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. KTI Suppressed TGF-β1-induced Src Phosphorylation—Previously, we have investigated signaling pathways involved in TGF-β1 activation in human ovarian cancer cell lines, HRA and SKOv-3 (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We showed that TGF-β1 induced a marked rise in the level of phosphorylated Src protein in a time-dependent manner (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether a soybean KTI suppressed TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Src in HRA and SKOv-3 cells by Western blot. As compared with nonstimulated HRA cells, a 7-fold increase in phosphorylated Src was observed at 20 min in response to 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig. 1, lane 1 versus lane 3). The anti-Src antibodies immunoblotted similar amounts of Src protein in HRA cells, irrespective of whether cells were stimulated with TGF-β1. Here, we showed that KTI suppressed TGF-β1-stimulated Src phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6). Furthermore, KTI also suppressed TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, 20 min)-induced phosphorylation of Src in SKOv-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 10–12). KTI Suppressed TGF-β1-induced Phosphorylation of Akt through PI3K—In the previous study (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we observed concentration-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in response to TGF-β1 beginning with only 0.4–1 ng/ml TGF-β1. Src activation has been linked to the activation of MAPK and PI3K in HRA cells (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The facts that a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited the TGF-β1-induced Akt activation and that PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, had no effect on the TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 activity suggest a presence of cross-talk between the ERK and Akt cascades and that PI3K is a downstream target of MAPK (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we show the ability of KTI to TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 by Western blot using antibodies to phosphorylated Akt (or phosphorylated ERK1/2) or total Akt (or total ERK1/2), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, the increase in Akt phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 could be reduced when HRA cells were preincubated with KTI (10 μm, 1 h; lane 2 versus lane 3), wortmannin (100 nm, 1 h; lane 4), or LY294002 (10 μm, 30 min; lane 6) by 50%, 80%, or 80%, respectively. Pretreatment of HRA cells with 50 μm PD98059 (lane 8) also markedly abrogated the TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation by 80%. In contrast, TGF-β1-dependent Akt phosphorylation was not suppressed by p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190 (lane 10). The combined treatment of KTI together with pharmacological inhibitors (lanes 4–9) did not provide a further suppression of TGF-β1-induced Akt phosphorylation. The role of PI3K in Akt activation was more specifically demonstrated through inhibition with PI3K antisense ODN. We used antisense ODN targeting of the gene for PI3K (lanes 12 and 13) and corresponding control ODNs (S PI3K ODN (lanes 14 and 15) and inverted antisense (iAS) PI3K ODN (data not shown)). PI3K p85 protein expression was reduced by the antisense strategy (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that antisense PI3K ODN transfection abrogated Akt phosphorylation in HRA cells, irrespective of whether cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Note that TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was not impaired by S PI3K ODN or iAS ODN (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, KTI inhibited the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Akt in the S PI3K ODN cells (lanes 14 and 15). However, KTI did not affect phospho-Akt level in AS PI3K ODN transfected cells (lanes 12 and 13), because TGF-β1 could not induce Akt phosphorylation. To confirm that KTI-dependent suppression of TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation is mediated by ERK, HRA cells expressing CA-MEK1 or control MEK1 were pretreated with KTI, and then stimulated with TGF-β1. We found that overexpression of CA-MEK1, but not control MEK1, increased basal ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, lane 1 versus lane 4). KTI could not significantly suppress the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK in HRA cells transfected with CA-MEK1 (Fig. 2C, lane 5 versus lane 6). On the other hand, KTI inhibited the ERK phosphorylation in the control MEK1 cells (Fig. 2C, lane 8 versus lane 9). In a parallel experiment, phospho-Akt band was strongly detected in cells expressing CA-MEK1 (Fig. 2E, lanes 4–6), but not in cells expressing control MEK1 (Fig. 2E, lanes 7–9), irrespective of whether cells were stimulated with TGF-β1. Furthermore, pretreatment for 1 h with 10 μm KTI could not significantly diminish the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Akt band in the CA-MEK1 cells (Fig. 2E, lane 5 versus lane 6), supporting that KTI may be involved in one or more upstream targets of ERK. As shown in Fig. 2G, the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 could be blocked when HRA cells were preincubated with KTI (10 μm, 1 h, lane 3) or PD98059 (50 μm, lane 8) by 60 and 70%, respectively. In contrast, pretreatment of HRA cells with wortmannin (100 nm, 1 h, lane 4) or LY294002 (10 μm, 30 min, lane 6) did not abrogated the TGF-β1-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, because PI3K/Akt is a downstream target of ERK (15Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8567-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not suppressed by SB202190 (lane 10). KTI failed to strengthen the PD98059-induced suppression of TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (lane 9 versus lane 8). We also showed that antisense PI3K ODN transfection did not abrogate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HRA cells in response to TGF-β1 (lane 12). As expected, KTI inhibited the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the AS PI3K ODN cells (lanes 12 and 13) or S PI3K ODN cells (lanes 14 and 15). KTI Suppressed TGF-β1-stimulated Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or Akt via an Src-dependent Mechanism—The pharmacological Src inhibitor PP2 inhibited the ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A, lane 4) and Akt (Fig. 3C, lane 4) activation by 65–75%. KTI did not enhance the suppression by PP2 of TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A, lane 5) and Akt (Fig. 3C, lane 5). Furthermore, general tyrosine kinase inhibition with genistein (lane 6) or herbimycin A (lane 7) also significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 or Akt phosphorylation. Suppression of TGF-β1-induced activation of Src by KTI supports that the critical position of KTI may not be a downstream target(s) of Src pathway.
