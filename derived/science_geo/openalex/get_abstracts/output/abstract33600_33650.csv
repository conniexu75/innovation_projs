https://openalex.org/W1996437700,Structure-function relationships of the sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes have been investigated by the combined use of site-directed mutagenesis and patch-clamp recording. This study provides evidence that the positive charges in segment S4 are involved in the voltage-sensing mechanism for activation of the channel and that the region between repeats III and IV is important for its inactivation.
https://openalex.org/W2040804173,"A recently developed cloning system based on the propagation of large DNA molecules as linear, artificial chromosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a potential method of cloning the entire human genome in segments of several hundred kilobase pairs. Most application of this system will require the ability to recover specific sequences from libraries of yeast artificial chromosome clones and to propagate these sequences in yeast without alterations. Two single-copy genes have now been cloned from a library of yeast artificial chromosome clones that was prepared from total human DNA. Multiple, independent isolates were obtained of the genes encoding factor IX and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2. The clones, which ranged in size from 60 to 650 kilobases, were stable on prolonged propagation in yeast and appear to contain faithful replicas of human DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1977751950,"A general approach for assaying the in vivo direction of replication for any DNA segment has been developed. This technique allows the scanning of genomic regions to detect bidirectional tail-to-tail replication, indicating the presence of a functional origin. By this criterion we identified the approximate positions of two origin sites downstream of the Chinese hamster DHFR gene. Further mapping revealed areas of head-to-head replication, signifying locations of replication termination and thus defining the landmarks of a complete animal cell replicon. Genetic proof for the existence of the DHFR origin was obtained by showing that this region serves as a bidirectional DNA synthesis initiation point following its integration into other sites in the genome by transfection. To show the general applicability of this methodology, we studied the APRT domain. Replication mapping together with the use of deletion mutants allowed the identification of an origin at a far-upstream locus."
https://openalex.org/W2079720213,"Interactions of CD4 with the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are crucial during thymic ontogeny and subsequently for helper and cytotoxic functions of CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes. CD4 is the receptor for the T-lymphotropic human immunodeficiency virus and binds its envelope glycoprotein, gp120. The residues involved in gp120 binding have been localized to a region within the immunoglobulin-like domain I of CD4, which corresponds to CDR2 of an immunoglobulin variable region, but the CD4 residues important in MHC class II interaction have not been characterized. Here, using a cell-binding assay dependent specifically on the CD4-MHC class II association, we analyse the effects of mutations in CD4 on class II versus gp120 binding. Mutations in CDR2 that destroy gp120 binding affect CD4-MHC class II binding similarly. In addition, binding of soluble gp120 to CD4-transfected cells abrogates their ability to interact with class II-bearing B lymphocytes. In contrast, other mutations within domains I or II that have no effect on gp120 binding eliminate or substantially decrease class II interaction. Thus, the CD4 binding site for class II MHC is more complex than the gp120 binding site, possibly reflecting a broader area of contact with the former ligand and a requirement for appropriate juxtaposition of the two N-terminal domains. The ability of gp120 to inhibit the binding of class II MHC to CD4 could be important in disrupting normal T-cell physiology, acting both to inhibit immune responses and to prevent differentiation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1518877053,"Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase leads to autophosphorylation and to the phosphorylation of various cellular substrates. The three known autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor are located at the carboxyl-terminal tail where they probably act to compete with and thus modulate substrate phosphorylation. Mutational analysis and micro-sequencing techniques have been used to localize and identify new autophosphorylation site(s) of the EGF receptor. We have compared the phosphopeptide maps of human EGF receptor, and two deletion mutants lacking 63 and 126 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tail with the phosphopeptide maps of HER/neu and a chimeric EGF receptor containing the carboxyl-terminal tail of HER2/neu. HER2/neu is highly homologous to the EGF receptor, and it probably functions as a growth factor receptor for as yet unidentified growth factor. On the basis of this analysis, we have concluded that all autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor and HER2/new are located in their carboxyl-terminal tails. Utilizing the EGF receptors with carboxyl-terminal deletions, we were also able to identify tyr1086 as an additional autophosphorylation site of EGF receptor. Direct microsequencing of a phosphorylated tryptic peptide from the human EGF receptor confirmed this assignment."
https://openalex.org/W2051249021,"In a yeast DNA topoisomerase double mutant TG205 (Δtop1 top2–4), over half of the rDNA is present as extrachromosomal rings containing one 9 kb unit of the rDNA gene or tandem repeats of it. Expression of a plasmid-borne TOP1 or TOP2 gene in the strain leads to the integation of the extrachromosomal rDNA rings back into the chromosomal rDNA cluster. When the plasmid-borne topoisomerase gene is expressed from an inducible promoter of the GAL1 gene, repression of the gene by dextrose leads to reappearance of the extrachromosomal rDNA rings. The DNA topoisomerase-dependent excision/integration of rDNA is discussed in terms of the possibility of rDNA supercoiling by transcription and the effects of DNA topology on intra- and interchromosomal recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2082395658,"Fission yeast cdc25+ and wee1+ interact genetically with cdc2+ in the regulation of cell division, respectively as a mitotic activator and inhibitor. cdc25+ is normally essential for mitosis, but this requirement is alleviated in a loss-of-function wee1 mutant background. A plasmid-borne sequence, other than wee1+, that causes a cdc25ts wee1- double mutant to revert to a temperature-sensitive cdc phenotype has been isolated. The gene carried by this plasmid is called bws1+ (for bypass of wee suppression). bws1+ also bypasses the ability of alleles of cdc2 that confer a wee phenotype (cdc2w) to suppress loss-of-function cdc25 mutants. The nucleotide sequence of bws1+ shows that the predicted protein shares 81% amino acid identity with the catalytic subunit of mammalian type 1 protein phosphatase. Thus a genetic screen that might have yielded a protein kinase (wee1+) uncovered a phosphatase that also appears to be involved in the pathway of mitotic control."
https://openalex.org/W1970258574,"The multiprotein-DNA complexes that participate in bacteriophage lambda site-specific recombination were used to study the combined effect of protein-induced bending and protein-mediated looping of DNA. The protein integrase (Int) is a monomer with two autonomous DNA binding domains of different sequence specificity. Stimulation of Int binding and cleavage at the low affinity core-type DNA sites required interactions with the high affinity arm-type sites and depended on simultaneous binding of the sequence-specific DNA bending protein IHF (integration host factor). The bivalent DNA binding protein is positioned at high affinity sites and directed, by a DNA bending protein, to interactions with distant lower affinity sites. Assembly of this complex is independent of protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1598802541,"Subunit VIII of mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) exists in at least two isoforms, because different but related polypeptides have been identified in COX isolated from liver and heart of both beef and pig. We have isolated a full length cDNA specifying subunit VIII of human COX from a human liver cDNA library. Sequences hybridizing to this cDNA are present at only one site, the COX8 locus, on human chromosome 11q12-q13. The deduced human polypeptide is 58% identical with COX VIII isolated from beef liver, but only 38% identical with COX VIII isolated from beef heart. Transcriptional analysis shows that an mRNA identical with the isolated cDNA is present in abundant amounts not only in human and monkey liver tissue, but in heart and skeletal muscle as well, tissues not known previously to contain this isoform. Since the only COX VIII subunit found in human heart agrees 100% with the polypeptide deduced from this coxVIII cDNA, it may well be that, in distinction to other mammals, only one form of COX VIII exists in primates."
https://openalex.org/W1530396682,"Abstract Three Escherichia coli heat shock proteins, DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE, are required for replication of the bacteriophage lambda chromosome in vivo. We show that the GrpE heat shock protein is not required for initiation of lambda DNA replication in vitro when the concentration of DnaK is sufficiently high. GrpE does, however, greatly potentiate the action of DnaK in the initiation process when the DnaK concentration is reduced to a subsaturating level. We demonstrate in the accompanying articles (Alfano, C. and McMacken, R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10699-10708; Dodson, M., McMacken, R., and Echols, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10719-10725) that DnaJ and DnaK bind to prepriming nucleoprotein structures that are assembled at the lambda replication origin (ori lambda). Binding of DnaJ and DnaK completes the ordered assembly of an ori lambda initiation complex that also contains the lambda O and P initiators and the E. coli DnaB helicase. With the addition of ATP, the DnaJ and DnaK heat shock proteins mediate the partial disassembly of the initiation complex, and the P and DnaJ proteins are largely removed from the template. Concomitantly, on supercoiled ori lambda plasmid templates, the intrinsic helicase activity of DnaB is activated and DnaB initiates localized unwinding of the DNA duplex, thereby preparing the template for priming and DNA chain elongation. We infer from our results that DnaK and DnaJ function in normal E. coli metabolism to promote ATP-dependent protein unfolding and disassembly reactions. We also provide evidence that neither the lambda O and P initiators nor the E. coli DnaJ and DnaK heat shock proteins play a direct role in the propagation of lambda replication forks in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2098070567,"Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) are modulators of synaptic plasticity, oscillatory behavior, and rhythmic firing in brain regions such as the hippocampus. The distribution and lateral mobility of VDCCs on CA1 hippocampal neurons have been determined with biologically active fluorescent and biotinylated derivatives of the selective probe omega-conotoxin in conjunction with circular dityndallism, digital fluorescence imaging, and photobleach recovery microscopy. On noninnervated cell bodies, VDCCs were found to be organized in multiple clusters, whereas after innervation the VDCCs were concentrated and immobilized at synaptic contact sites. On dendrites, VDCC distribution was punctate and was interrupted by extensive bare regions or abruptly terminated. More than 85% of the dendritic VDCCs were found to be immobile by fluorescence photobleach recovery. Thus, before synaptic contact, specific mechanisms target, segregate, and immobilize VDCCs to neuronal cell bodies and to specialized dendritic sites. Regulation of this distribution may be critical in determining the firing activity and integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1549141958,"Abstract We have identified a minimum functional domain of human thrombomodulin for anticoagulant activity using deletion analysis. Four mutants were constructed by site-directed deletion mutagenesis to delete one or more epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures from the domain of human thrombomodulin containing six repeated EGF-like structures. These deletion mutants were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and their protein C-activating cofactor activities in the culture medium were examined. One mutant protein, E456, which contains the fourth, fifth, and sixth EGF-like structures expresses apparent cofactor activity. However, neither E456-N24 (24 NH2-terminal-residue deletion) nor E456-C16 (16 COOH-terminal-residue deletion) have cofactor activity. E456 was partially purified and its anticoagulant effects on plasma clotting time and platelet aggregation examined. E456 expressed almost the same anticoagulant activities as D123 which contains six consecutive EGF-like structures of thrombomodulin. It was concluded that E456 is the minimum functional domain for both protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2042949664,"The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1), one of the most common autosomal-dominant disorders of humans, was recently mapped to chromosome 17 by linkage analysis. The identification of two NF1 patients with balanced translocations that involved chromosome 17q11.2 suggests that the disease can arise by gross rearrangement of the NF1 locus, and that the NF1 gene might be identified by cloning the region around these translocation breakpoints. To further define the region of these translocations, a series of chromosome 17 Not I-linking clones has been mapped to proximal 17q and studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. One clone, 17L1 (D17S133), clearly identifies the breakpoint in an NF1 patient with a t(1;17) translocation. A 2.3-megabase pulsed-field map of this region was constructed and indicates that the NF1 breakpoint is only 10 to 240 kilobases away from 17L1. This finding prepares the way for the cloning of NF1."

https://openalex.org/W1493149842,"Abstract CP1 is a yeast protein which binds to the highly conserved DNA element I (CDEI) of yeast centromeres. We have purified CP1 to near homogeneity; it is comprised of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 58,400. When bound to yeast CEN3 DNA, CP1 protects a 12-15-base pair region centered over CDEI. Methylation interference experiments show that methylations of residues located outside of the 8-base pair CDEI sequence have no detectable effect on CP1 binding, suggesting that the DNA sequences important for CP1 recognition are confined to the CDEI octanucleotide. The equilibrium constant for CP1 binding to CEN3 DNA is relatively low, 3 x 10(8) M-1. Using a novel method to determine relative DNA binding constants, we analyzed the effect of CDEI mutations on CP1 binding. A C to T point mutation at position 5 (CO1) reduces the equilibrium constant about 35-fold, while the insertion of an additional T at this position (CAT) reduces the equilibrium constant 1,400-fold. The effect of these mutations on mitotic centromere function in vivo was assessed using a plasmid stability assay. While the CO1 mutation had a slight effect, the CAT mutation significantly impaired function, implying that CP1 binding is required for the optimal mitotic function of yeast centromeres."
https://openalex.org/W1999599493,"A free NH2-terminal group has been previously shown to be an obligatory signal for recognition and subsequent degradation of proteins in a partially fractionated and reconstituted ubiquitin proteolytic system. Naturally occurring proteins with acetylated NH2-termini--most cellular proteins fall in this category--were not degraded by this system. Other studies have suggested that the identity of the NH2-terminal residue is important in determining the metabolic stability of a protein in vivo (N-end rule). Whole reticulocyte lysate and antibodies directed against the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) have now been used to show that such acetylated proteins are degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent mode. Although fractionation of lysate does not affect its proteolytic activity toward substrates with free NH2-termini, it completely abolishes the activity toward the blocked substrates, indicating that an important component of the system was either removed or inactivated during fractionation. An NH2-terminal ""unblocking"" activity that removes the blocking group, thus exposing a free NH2-terminus for recognition according to the N-end rule, does not seem to participate in this pathway. Incubation of whole lysate with labeled histone H2A results in the formation of multiple ubiquitin conjugates. In contrast, the fractionated system is devoid of any significant conjugating activity. These results suggest that a novel conjugating enzyme (possibly a ubiquitin-protein ligase) may be responsible for the degradation of these acetylated proteins by recognizing structural features of the substrate that are downstream and distinct from the NH2-terminal residue."
https://openalex.org/W1529934239,"Abstract The major site of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor after treatment of cells with EGF is threonine 669. Phosphorylation of this site is also associated with the transmodulation of the EGF receptor caused by platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol ester. A distinctive feature of the primary sequence surrounding threonine 669 is the proximity of 2 proline residues (-Pro-Leu-Thr669-Pro-). This site is not a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. To investigate the mechanism of the increased phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at threonine 669, in vitro assays were used to measure protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities present in homogenates prepared from cells treated with and without EGF. No evidence for the regulation of protein phosphatase activity was obtained in experiments using the [32P]phosphate-labeled EGF receptor as a substrate. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 663-681 of the EGF receptor was used as a substrate for protein kinase assays. Incubation of murine 3T3 L1 pre-adipocytes and human WI-38 fibroblasts with EGF caused a rapid increase (3-10-fold) in the level of threonine protein kinase activity detected in cell homogenates. Similar results were obtained after EGF treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type (Thr669) and mutated (Ala669) human EGF receptors. Activation of the threonine protein kinase activity was also observed in cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor, serum, and phorbol ester. Insulin-like growth factor-1 caused no significant change in protein kinase activity. Together these data indicate a role for the regulation of the activity of a threonine protein kinase in the control of the phosphorylation state of the EGF receptor at threonine 669. The significance of the identification of a growth factor-stimulated threonine protein kinase to the mechanism of signal transduction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565452731,"Abstract The Alu156 promoter isolated from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SP82 is dependent on curved DNA upstream of the -35 region for efficient function. Short DNA insertions of 6-29 base pairs were used to simultaneously change the linear placement and rotational orientation of this curved DNA relative to the -35 region. When these mutant promoters were analyzed in vivo using transcriptional fusions with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, changes in the rotational orientation of the curved DNA correlated with changes in promoter function. The most efficient mutant promoters contained insertions of 11 and 21 base pairs, and insertions of 15 and 25 base pairs resulted in the least efficient mutant promoters. The importance of the proper rotational alignment of the curved DNA to promoter activity was also observed in vitro at the level of transcription of RNA polymerase binding. Based on the electrophoretic mobilities of DNA fragments containing the various insertion mutant promoters, there was a second region of curved DNA downstream of the insertion point. The findings are consistent with the idea that the curved DNA deflects the helix back toward the promoter-bound RNA polymerase molecule to allow the enzyme to interact directly with upstream DNA. These interactions are proposed to structure the DNA for the formation of the open promoter complex."

https://openalex.org/W1522211375,"Alternative splicing of fibronectin pre-mRNA at the ED-A region has been shown to be regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. We investigated the splicing pattern at this region in malignant and nonmalignant human liver tissues and found that the relative population of the fibronectin mRNA containing the ED-A sequence is markedly increased in malignant liver tumors. Nontumorous liver tissues including those with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis did not show any significant change in the alternative splicing at the ED-A region. It was also found that the increased expression of the ED-A-containing fibronectin mRNA closely correlates with the occurrence of portal vein tumor thrombus and intrahepatic metastasis, which are two characteristic features of invasive liver tumors. These results indicate that tissue-specific alternative splicing of fibronectin mRNA is modified in human liver cancer and raise a possibility that the putative molecular machinery governing alternative RNA splicing of not only fibronectin but also other cellular proteins is deregulated in malignant human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1540233134,"Abstract The 63-kDa subunit, but not the 60-kDa subunit, of brain calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was phosphorylated in vitro by the autophosphorylated form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. When calmodulin was bound to the phosphodiesterase, 1.33 +/- 0.20 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of the 63-kDa subunit within 5 min with no significant effect on enzyme activity. Phosphorylation in the presence of low concentrations of calmodulin resulted in a phosphorylation stoichiometry of 2.11 +/- 0.21 and increased about 6-fold the concentration of calmodulin necessary for half-maximal activation of the phosphodiesterase. Peptide mapping analyses of complete tryptic digests of the 63-kDa subunit revealed two major (P1, P4) and two minor (P2, P3) 32P-peptides. Calmodulin-binding to the phosphodiesterase almost completely inhibited phosphorylation of P1 and P2 with reduced phosphorylation rates of P3 and P4, suggesting the affinity change of the enzyme for calmodulin may be caused by phosphorylation of P1 and/or P2. When Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was added without prior autophosphorylation, there was no phosphorylation of the 63-kDa phosphodiesterase subunit or of the kinase itself in the presence of a low concentration of calmodulin, and with excess calmodulin the phosphodiesterase subunit was phosphorylated only at P3 and P4. Thus the 63-kDa subunit of phosphodiesterase has a regulatory phosphorylation site(s) that is phosphorylated by the autophosphorylated form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and blocked by Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1494525315,"Abstract Na+ channels in adult rat brain are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of alpha subunits (260 kDa) noncovalently associated with a beta 1 subunit (36 kDa) and disulfide-linked to a beta 2 subunit (33 kDa). The time course of developmental accumulation of the 9-kilobase mRNA encoding sodium channel alpha subunits in the rat forebrain was measured by RNA blotting. These transcripts were present at low levels until birth, increased rapidly in abundance to peak by postnatal day 7, and subsequently declined to 50% of this maximum value in adult animals. Sodium channel gene transcription measured by a nuclear run-on assay was first detectable on embryonic day 16, increased to a maximum on postnatal days 1 through 7, and declined in adulthood. The level of gene transcription was highest during the period of rapid rise of Na+ channel alpha subunit mRNA levels and decreased during the period of Na+ channel mRNA decline. The levels of Na+ channel alpha subunit protein measured by immunoblotting increased from postnatal day 1 to postnatal day 21, with the greatest rate of increase falling between days 7 and 21. The number of high affinity saxitoxin binding sites increased in parallel to the increase in alpha subunit protein. The period of most rapid rise in Na+ channel alpha subunit levels corresponded to the period of greatest Na+ channel mRNA abundance. Na+ channel alpha subunits were resolved into free alpha subunits and alpha subunits disulfide-linked to beta 2 subunits. On postnatal day 1, virtually all Na+ channel alpha subunits were in the free alpha form. The fraction of disulfide-linked alpha subunits increased to 60% by postnatal day 21 and 90% by postnatal day 90. The concentration of free alpha subunits was maximum on postnatal days 7 to 14 and declined to less than 10% in adulthood. We conclude from these data that the formation of mature heterotrimeric sodium channel complexes is regulated by at least two processes in developing rat forebrain. Activation of Na+ channel alpha subunit gene transcription and the subsequent increase in Na+ channel mRNA are responsible for the major increases in alpha subunit protein and functional Na+ channels in the neonatal brain. However, changes in alpha subunit mRNA abundance alone are not sufficient to explain the kinetics of alpha subunit protein accumulation. Kinetic analysis suggests a requirement for a developmentally regulated translational or post-translational step in brain sodium channel expression."

To better localize the end points of these translocation events, and the NF1 gene (NF1) itself, human cosmids were isolated and mapped in the immediate vicinity of NF1. One cosmid probe, c11-1F10, demonstrated that both translocation breakpoints, and presumably NF1, are contained within a 600-kilobase Nru I fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1968792399,"The recombinational frequency between two long terminal repeat elements (LTR-IS) of a mouse retrotransposon was about 13 times higher, compared with that of two control DNA sequences in extracts from mouse testes, but not in extracts from ascites cells. Deletion of a 37 bp region from the LTR-IS element strongly suppresses its recombinational activity. This 37 bp region encompasses an area of potentially single-stranded DNA and interacts with at least two nuclear proteins. One of them binds sequence-specifically to single-stranded DNA and is present in both types of extracts. Another protein(s) binds to dsDNA at the motif TGGAAATCCCC and is absent in extracts from testes. Our results suggest that a cis-acting DNA sequence within the 504 bp LTR-IS element is responsible for its high recombinational activity in vitro, and they further support the previous suggestion that the LTR-IS elements are meiotic recombinational hotspots in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1556429127,"Abstract Respiratory defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae assigned to complementation group G28 display a deficiency, in the respiratory chain complex coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase. The mutants define a new nuclear gene, designated CBP3, required for the assembly of the complex. Mutations in CBP3 are expressed in the absence of spectrally and immunologically detectable cytochrome b, a catalytic subunit of coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase. The mutational block responsible for the cytochrome b deficiency has been ascribed to a post-translational step based on the observation that cbp3 mutants have wild type concentrations of cytochrome b mRNA and are capable of synthesizing the apoprotein. Western analysis has revealed that cbp3 mutants have reduced levels of a subset of subunit polypeptides of the coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase complex that include apocytochrome b, the iron-sulfur protein, core 4 (14-kDa subunit), and core 5 (11-kDa subunit). A similar phenotype has previously been reported in strains that fail to assemble the complex as a result of mutations in the noncatalytic core subunits. The CBP3 gene has been cloned by transformation of a mutant from complementation group G28 with a yeast genomic library. The gene is 1005 nucleotides long and codes for a primary translation product of 39 kDa. A transcript of a size commensurate with the length of the CBP3 reading frame is detected in total and poly(A+)-enriched RNA. The amino-terminal region of the CBP3 product is basic and probably corresponds to a cleavable mitochondrial targeting signal. An antibody obtained against a trpE/CBP3 fusion protein detects a protein of 40 kDa in wild type yeast mitochondria. This protein is absent in a mutant construct containing a partially deleted copy of the gene. The CBP3 protein is a membrane constituent, although attempts to demonstrate its physical association with the other subunits of coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase have been unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W1567852653,"Abstract The M27 and H59 variants of Lewis lung carcinoma differ in their responsiveness to the chemotactic elastin peptide Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG). M27 cells, selected for metastasis to lung, are highly responsive to a positive gradient of VGVAPG. H59 cells, selected for metastasis to liver, do not migrate in response to VGVAPG. Although both cell types bind radiolabeled VGVAPG, Scatchard analysis of 125I-Tyr-VGVAPG binding reveals that M27 cells bind the chemoattractant with a Kd of 2.7 nM, whereas nonresponsive H59 cells bind the peptide with a Kd of 67 nM. These findings indicate that the failure of H59 cells to migrate in response to VGVAPG may be due to the reduced affinity of their VGVAPG receptors. Both receptor affinity and chemotactic responsiveness to VGVAPG can be modulated in each of these two tumor cell lines by the levels of active membrane-associated protein kinase C. Treatment of nonresponsive H59 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate increases the level of membrane-bound protein kinase C activity with a concomitant increase in VGVAPG binding affinity and induction of chemotactic responsiveness to VGVAPG. Treatment of M27 cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, reduces VGVAPG binding affinity and abrogates the chemotactic response. We conclude that chemotactic responsiveness of M27 and H59 tumor cells is dependent upon high VGVAPG receptor affinity, which is strongly correlated to high levels of membrane-bound protein kinase C activity."
https://openalex.org/W2104241336,"Stimulation of secretion in guinea pig parotid gland lobules by either isoproterenol or carbachol is associated with a removal of acyl groups from the acyl-CoA pool and their incorporation into diacylglycerols and triglycerides (Soling, H. D., Machado-De Domenech, E., Kleineke, J., and Fest, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16786-16792). This is associated with an increased incorporation of glycerol into diacylglycerol. These changes occur during the first 20-30 s of stimulation. We can show now that these changes are associated with a significant increase in the activities of lysophosphatidate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol kinase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase which reaches a maximum during the first 60 s after stimulation. In vitro experiments with isolated parotid microsomes, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and with purified protein phosphatases indicate that the activation of enzyme activities in intact parotid gland cells results from protein phosphorylation. The two protein kinases seem to activate the three enzymes by phosphorylating the same site(s). Protein kinase C was almost ineffective. Glycerol kinase, glycerolphosphate acyltransferase, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, and phosphatidylinositol synthase remained unchanged in the intact cell as well as during incubation with protein kinases in vitro. Lysophosphatidate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol kinase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase can be activated by the two protein kinases also in microsomes from guinea pig cerebellum. It seems, therefore, that the regulation leading to rapid changes of enzyme activities during signal transmission in parotid acinar cells could be operative also in other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1534897064,"Abstract Chemical cross-linking of the red blood cell hormone, erythropoietin (Epo), to its receptor on erythroid cells has revealed the presence of two proteins closely associated with Epo, but the relationship between these two proteins is controversial. Using the cross-linking reagents disuccinimidyl suberate and dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate, we show that 125I-Epo can be specifically conjugated in a complex of 224kDa using mouse fetal liver cells, bone marrow cells, and Friend virus-induced splenic erythroblasts as demonstrated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the 224-kDa complex appeared as two Epo conjugates of 136 kDa and 119 kDa, and these bands were also observed to a variable extent in some nonreducing gels. Disulfide linking of the 136-kDa and 119-kDa bands was confirmed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under nonreducing followed by reducing conditions. With increasing time of 125I-Epo binding to Friend virus erythroblasts in the presence of sodium azide to inhibit receptor internalization, the 136-kDa and 119-kDa bands seen under reducing conditions increased markedly in intensity, whereas the 224-kDa band seen under nonreducing conditions declined. These results suggest that the 224-kDa Epo conjugate is inefficiently solubilized under nonreducing conditions following prolonged periods of Epo binding. A single class of saturable, high affinity receptors for Epo on each of the cell types tested is demonstrated. It is concluded that the two disulfide-linked Epo-binding proteins which can be independently cross-linked to Epo form a single ligand binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2075081173,"Respondents in the 1988 General Social Survey (GSS) were asked to scan their acquaintance networks to identify all those who had been a victim of a homicide or had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Estimates of the sex, race, age, and regional breakdowns for homicides in the last year and for people with AIDS were compared with official statistics. The GSS estimates for the distribution of homicide victims replicate the official statistics quite well. The GSS estimates for AIDS cases suggest that the data provided to the Centers for Disease Control may underestimate by a substantial margin the prevalence of AIDS in the white population of higher socioeconomic status, overstate the relative prevalence of the disease in the minority populations, underestimate the prevalence of the disease in the Midwest, and overstate it for the East."
https://openalex.org/W1501248434,"Confluent cultures of Hep G2 cells were found to synthesize chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids continually. Chenodeoxycholic acid was synthesized at the rate of 58 +/- 8.6 micrograms/96 h, a rate more than 7-fold greater than that for cholic acid. Addition of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol but not the -3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol was followed by an increase in cholic acid synthesis, thus indicating a relatively low 12 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Endogenous synthesis of monohydroxy bile acid ester sulfates was found, with maximum rates of 135 and 74 micrograms/96 h for lithocholic and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acids, respectively. Incubation of Hep G2 cells in medium containing 25% D2O permitted a comparison of the precursor/product relationship of cholesterol with 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid. The pattern of incorporation of deuterium was in accordance with that expected, thus allowing the conclusion that this monohydroxy bile acid is derived from cholesterol and should be considered together with chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids as a primary bile acid."
https://openalex.org/W1529884640,"Abstract The endothelial cell surface membrane protein thrombomodulin binds thrombin with high affinity and acts as both a cofactor for protein C activation and an inhibitor of fibrinogen hydrolysis. We have previously shown that bovine thrombomodulin is a competitive inhibitor of fibrinogen binding to thrombin but has no effect on thrombin activity toward tripeptide substrates or antithrombin III. Hence, thrombomodulin and fibrinogen may share macromolecular specificity sites on thrombin which are distinct from the active site. In this investigation, we have studied the interaction of thrombin-thrombomodulin with fibrinogen and various thrombin derivatives. We show that fibrinogen is a competitive inhibitor of thrombomodulin binding to thrombin, with a Kis = 10 microM. Thrombin derivatives (bovine (pyridoxal phosphate)4-thrombin and human thrombin Quick I), which bind fibrinogen with much reduced affinity, are shown to also interact with thrombomodulin with greatly reduced affinity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thrombomodulin and fibrinogen share macromolecular specificity sites on thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W1556267008,"Recently, we reported that pp60c-src kinase activity was present in adult bovine coronary arterial smooth muscle and showed that the activity of the enzyme in in vitro immunoprecipitation assays was stimulated 20-60-fold by ATP (Di Salvo, J., Gifford, D., and Kokkinakis, A. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 388-394). In the present study, ATP-mediated stimulation of activity was also demonstrated in extracts from aortic vascular smooth muscle. In contrast, no stimulation was apparent in extracts from brain. Stimulation of activity in vascular preparations was also induced with beta,gamma-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP.PNP), a nonmetabolizable analog of ATP, and with several other polyphosphates including ADP and sodium pyrophosphate. No stimulation occurred in response to monophosphates such as AMP or KH2PO4. As expected, the specific activity of pp60c-src in brain extracts did not change when the amount of extracted protein included in immunoprecipitation mixtures was increased. Unexpectedly, however, the specific activity of the vascular enzyme decreased markedly as the amount of extracted protein subjected to immunoprecipitation was increased. Following stimulation of pp60c-src in vascular extracts with ATP, the enzyme behaved in a fashion similar to pp60c-src extracted from brain. That is, the enhanced specific activity of the stimulated vascular enzyme did not decrease with increasing amounts of extracted protein. Moreover, mixing experiments in which vascular smooth muscle extracts were added to brain extracts showed that the muscle extracts contained a factor which inhibited pp60c-src kinase activity. This inhibition was blocked when the mixed extracts were immunoprecipitated in the presence of ATP, or when inhibitory extract was treated with trypsin. Taken together, these data suggest that pp60c-src kinase activity in vascular tissue may be subject to a novel regulatory mechanism involving an inhibitory protein factor which can be nullified by polyphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1490292494,"Abstract Several proteins from bovine platelet lysate bound to type I collagen immobilized to the beads of formyl derivatives of cellulose. Among these proteins, a protein of about 100,000 daltons was purified to homogeneity by two additional affinity chromatographies, an organomercurial-agarose and a lentil lectin-agarose. This protein consisted of a single polypeptide chain which contains carbohydrate moiety and many intrapolypeptide disulfide bridges. In addition to platelets, this protein was present in plasma and cultured endothelial cells but not in red blood cells, leukocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, it was released from platelets upon stimulation by various agonists. The purified 100-kDa protein was labeled with 125I to quantitate its binding to fibrillar type I collagen. The protein specifically bound to fibrillar collagen with the apparent dissociation constant of 5.6 x 10(-8) M for the high affinity site and 5.5 x 10(-7) M for the low affinity site. Analyses of amino acid sequences of both intact and tryptic fragments of this protein revealed that it had strong homology to the propolypeptide of human von Willebrand factor, which is also known as von Willebrand antigen II. Various properties of this protein listed above also strongly suggest that it was indeed the propolypeptide of bovine von Willebrand factor."
https://openalex.org/W1586318868,"Abstract The ADP-glucose synthetase of Escherichia coli K12 mutant 618 has a higher apparent affinity for the activator, fructose 1,6-P2 and a lower apparent affinity for the inhibitor, 5'-AMP, than the normal enzyme. The structural gene, glgC, of the mutant enzyme has been cloned and sequenced (Lee, Y. M., Kumar, A., and Preiss, J. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 10603). Substitutions in the mutant enzyme were amino acid residues 296 (Lys to Glu) and 336 (Gly to Asp). Single mutant enzymes, Glu296 and Asp336, were constructed using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The Glu296 enzyme had the same allosteric kinetic constants as the wild type enzyme. The Asp336 enzyme was catalytically defective. Thus, the mutations at 296 and at 336 separately could not account for the allosteric alterations of the mutant enzyme. A hybrid glgC gene was prepared from genes of wild type and mutant 618 glgC using DNA recombinant techniques. The C-terminal portion of mutant 618 containing Glu296 and Asp336, combined with the N-terminal portion of wild type enzyme, showed allosteric and substrate kinetics similar to mutant 618 enzyme. Thus, alteration of the normal allosteric properties in mutant 618 are due to changes of both Lys296 to Glu and Gly336 to Asp."
https://openalex.org/W1547546031,"Abstract The composition of the peptidoglycan of Bordetella pertussis and the nature of its turnover products was determined by a new combination of analytical techniques: high performance liquid chromatography of an enzymatic peptidoglycan hydrolysate and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and fast atom bombardment collision-activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. Sixteen major components of the peptidoglycan were purified, and assignment of complete or partial chemical structures was achieved for nine and seven species, respectively. At this level of resolution, a previously unrecognized heterogeneity of monomeric (five new species; nine total) and dimeric species (five new species; five total) was detected. No species containing diaminopimelyl-diaminopimelic acid cross-links or lysyl-arginine substitutions were found. Previous estimates of total cross-linkage and average chain length were revised downward to 32% and 21 disaccharide residues, respectively. Detection of a chemically novel species, a disaccharide octapeptide monomer, in both the peptidoglycan hydrolysate and culture supernatant fluid, suggests that an N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanine amidase acts on the intact peptidoglycan of Bordetella and participates in cell wall turnover. Five peptidoglycan turnover products were identified in the supernatant fluid of late logarithmic phase cultures, including the 1,6-anhydro monomeric species known as tracheal cytotoxin. Peptidoglycan turnover was detected at a low rate of approximately 10%/generation, a value sufficient to account for the generation of all tracheal cytotoxin found in culture supernatant fluids."
https://openalex.org/W1534019993,"This laboratory has reported recently that muscarinic receptor-stimulated release of norepinephrine from pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells is dependent upon an influx of Ca2+ through a Ca2+ channel that is regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein (G-protein) (lnoue, K., and Kenimer J. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8157–8161). In the present study, we have examined the role of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in this mechanism. The muscarinic agonist methacholine was shown to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis by a mechanism that was sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. When assayed in the absence of Ca2+, muscarinic-stimulated norepinephrine release but not phosphoinositide hydrolysis was blocked. Conversely, muscarinic-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis but not norepinephrine release was blocked in cells preincubated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. In contrast to several previous hypotheses that suggested that muscarinic-stimulated neurotransmitter release is dependent upon phosphoinositide hydrolysis, our results suggest that these two muscarinic-stimulated processes are independent events in PC 12 cells. Inhibition studies with muscarinic receptor subtype-specific antagonists suggest that norepinephrine release is regulated by an M2 subtype muscarinic receptor and that phosphoinositide hydrolysis is regulated by an M3 subtype muscarinic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1502084482,"Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has been used to detect, characterize, and to infer structures of o-semiquinones derived from stilbene catechol estrogens. Radicals were generated enzymatically using tyrosinase and were detected as their Mg2+ complexes. It is suggested that initial hydroxylation of stilbene estrogen gives a catechol estrogen in situ; subsequent two-electron oxidation of the catechol to the quinone, followed by reverse disproportionation, leads to the formation of radicals. Consistent with this mechanism, o-phenylenediamine, a quinone trapping agent, inhibits formation of o-semiquinones. A competing mechanism of radical production involves autoxidation of the catechol. Hydroxyl radicals are shown to be produced in this system via a mechanism involving reduction of iron and copper complexes by stilbene catechols. Possible differences in the reactivity of stilbene ortho- and para-semiquinones are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1622892471,"5-S-Ethyl-5-thio-D-ribose (ethylthioribose) exhibits antiprotozoal activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Giardia lamblia, and Ochromonas malhamensis, but is nontoxic to cultured human and murine bone marrow cells (Riscoe, M. K., Ferro, A. J., and Fitchen, J. H. (1988) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32, 1904-1906). We propose the following mechanism to account for the observed selective toxicity of ethylthioribose. 1) The cytocidal action of ethylthioribose against protozoa is a result of its conversion to ethionine, a well-known cytotoxic agent. 2) This transformation occurs through the pathway which normally converts 5-S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose (methylthioribose) to methionine. 3) Conversion of ethylthioribose to ethionine cannot occur in mammalian cells since these cells cannot phosphorylate methylthioribose (ethylthioribose), a first step in the pathway to methionine (ethionine). To test this hypothesis, [5-3H]ethylthioribose has been synthesized and its metabolism by cell-free extracts of Klebsiella pneumoniae and rat liver was examined. The pathway by which methylthioribose is converted to methionine in K. pneumoniae is well characterized. When supplemented with ATP and L-glutamine, the bacterial extract efficiently converted [5-3H]ethylthioribose to [3H]ethionine. By contrast, ethionine was not produced upon incubation of [5-3H]ethylthioribose, ATP, and L-glutamine with rat liver homogenate. The mammalian cell extract lacks a kinase activity capable of converting ethylthioribose to 1-phospho-5-S-ethyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribofuranoside, an obligate intermediate in the biosynthesis of ethionine from ethylthioribose in K. pneumoniae. These results support our hypothesis and provide a basis for understanding the apparently selective toxicity of ethylthioribose."
https://openalex.org/W1678875543,"The gp52 envelope glycoprotein of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) is a recombinant molecule derived from Friend murine leukemia virus (MuLV) by various deletions, insertions, and substitutions. The SFFV gp52 glycoprotein, unlike MuLV envelope glycoproteins, is defective in transport to the cell surface. Only 3-5% of gp52 eventually reaches the cell surface as a processed form (gp65). Although gp52 lacks cytoplasmic tail residues found in MuLV glycoproteins, we have previously shown that this deletion is not responsible for its defective transport. In order to investigate the basis for the defective transport of gp52, we have examined the folding and assembly of gp52 molecules into oligomeric molecules. CV-1 cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing SFFV gp52 were pulse labeled and the cell extracts were fractionated by velocity centrifugation through sucrose gradients. Immediately after a 10-min pulse, gp52 was detected as a monomer in the upper part of the sucrose gradient (fractions 12 and 14) and it remained as such after a 2-h chase period. However, the processed form, gp65, was found in a lower part of the gradient (fraction 8) after a 2-h chase. The position of gp65 was found to correspond to the position of trimeric influenza hemagglutinin which was analyzed on a parallel sucrose gradient, suggesting that gp65 also exists as a trimer in this fraction. These results indicate that changes in the external domain of gp52 result in improper folding of the glycoprotein molecule, and suggest that this lack of oligomerization is responsible for the defective transport of the molecules. Only those molecules that do form oligomeric structures are transported to the Golgi complex and undergo further oligosaccharide processing, and transport to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1563371370,"Abstract A novel method for the analysis of putative G-proteins has been developed that reveals the existence of a large family of GTP/GDP-binding proteins with similar characteristics to those of p21ras in 3T3 cell plasma membranes. In the presence of Mg2+, exchange of [alpha-32P]GDP with prebound ligand was very slow, but, as with p21ras, exchange was dramatically accelerated by excess EDTA. In the presence of Mg2+, three classes of binding sites were distinguishable. However, no p21ras was detected in the membranes with the pan-reactive anti-ras antibody, Y13-259. Gel filtration analysis resolved two peaks of binding activity centering at 60 and 21 kilodaltons. High resolution anion exchange chromatography separated at least 11 unique GDP-binding proteins from 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate-solubilized membranes, none of which cross-reacted with a pan-G alpha antiserum. Analogous to p21ras, the binding activities of 9 of the 11 species were sensitive to the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide, and six peaks possessed detectable GTPase activity in the absence of extrinsic factors. Addition of cytosol activated the GTPase activity of four of the peaks. We infer that the 11 peaks represent novel, small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, similar to those recently described in brain membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1517446349,"The phage T4 thymidylate synthase (td) gene contains an intron open reading frame that encodes a 245-amino acid-long basic protein (Chu, F. K., Maley, G. F., West, D. K., Belfort, M., and Maley, F. (1986) Cell 45, 157-166). The open reading frame (Irf) has been cloned as a fusion protein behind a phage T7 promoter and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The amplified Irf protein is associated with insoluble inclusion bodies and migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis about 7 kDa smaller than expected. Data obtained from DNA sequencing, amino acid sequencing of the fusion protein, and carboxypeptidase Y digestion suggest that although the cloned gene is not altered and the protein is made from the expected start codon, it appears to terminate about 90 amino acids before the encoded stop codon. Proteolytic cleavage during or soon after synthesis appears to be responsible for the truncated Irf. The expressed protein is solubilized in guanidine HCl and renatured by dialysis against high salt. This partially purified preparation has been found to contain a DNA endonuclease activity specific for the td delta I gene, which contains a precise deletion of the intron."
https://openalex.org/W1578949990,"Abstract Vasoconstriction and subsequent glycogenolysis stimulated by immune complex infusion into perfused rat livers was inhibited by prior infusion of isoproterenol. Similarly, isoproterenol inhibited the biosynthesis of bioactive lipid autacoids such as platelet-activating factor, prostaglandin E2, and thromboxane B2 which was stimulated by immune aggregates. The adrenergic receptor specificity of these effects was determined through the use of specific adrenergic subtype-specific agonists and antagonists to be mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Indirect evidence for the differential expression of hepatic sinusoidal and parenchymal beta-adrenergic receptors in the male rat during ontogeny suggested that inhibition of immune aggregate-stimulated autacoid biosynthesis, vasoconstriction, and glycogenolysis by isoproterenol occurs at a sinusoidal locus, most likely Kupffer cells. In contrast with the ability of beta 2-adrenergic agonists to inhibit immune aggregate- and platelet-activating factor-stimulated hepatic metabolism, dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not mimic these sinusoidal beta 2-adrenergic effects, despite stimulating hepatic parenchymal cell glycogenolysis as effectively as isoproterenol. These observations suggest a role for cyclic AMP-independent mechanisms in the regulation of heterologous stimulus-response coupling by hepatic sinusoidal beta 2-adrenergic receptors."
