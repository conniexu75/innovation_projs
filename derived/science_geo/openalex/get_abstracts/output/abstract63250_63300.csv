https://openalex.org/W1995336154,"The external surface of the higher plants comprises a cuticular layer covered by a waxy deposit. This deposit is believed to play a major part in such phenomena as the water balance of plants and the behavior of agricultural sprays. The wax contains a wide range of organic compounds. These complex mixtures are amenable to modern microchromatographic and microspectrometric analytical procedures. The few surveys which have been made of the species distribution of certain classes of constituents indicate that such distribution may be of limited taxonomic value; however, the wax composition of a species may differ for different parts of the same plant and may vary with season, locale, and the age of the plant. This fascinating subject, in which the disciplines of botany, biochemistry, chemistry, and physics overlap and interact, is still in a very active state. Much remains to be learned about the composition and fine structure of the wax deposits, and, for this, experimental study of wax crystallization and permeation through artificial membranes will be required. Enzymic studies, radiolabeling, and electron microscopy will be needed to reveal the mode of biogenesis of the wax constituents and their site of formation and subsequent pathway through the cuticle to the leaf surface."

https://openalex.org/W1606239426,"Abstract Flavodoxin has been crystallized from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii grown at low iron concentrations. The properties of this protein are similar to those of flavodoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum. It has a molecular weight of about 15,000 and contains 1 molecule of flavin mononucleotide per molecule of protein. It does not contain labile sulfide or iron. It lacks the amino acid histidine. Ferredoxin and flavodoxin are interchangeable in the oxidation of pyruvate by extracts of P. elsdenii from media either high or low in iron, and in the phosphoroclastic reaction of C. pasteurianum. On a molar basis flavodoxin is somewhat less effective than ferredoxin in these systems. Flavodoxin is reduced by light irradiation in the presence of EDTA and an intermediate having a spectrum characteristic of flavin neutral semiquinone is generated. The rate and extent of reduction are pH-dependent. The spectrum of the semiquinone is unaffected at high pH and by high concentrations of urea. The extinction coefficient of oxidized flavodoxin at 445 mµ is 10,200 m-1 cm-1. The extinction coefficient of flavodoxin semiquinone at 580 mµ is 4,500 m-1 cm-1."

https://openalex.org/W1535672017,"Abstract The availability of stable, purified preparations of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (mol wt 31,000) has prompted study of the reduction and re-formation of the two disulfide bonds cross-linking its single polypeptide chain. The two disulfide bonds of DNase are quantitatively reduced by mercaptoethanol and similar reagents in minutes at pH 7.2 and room temperature, without need for 8 m urea or any other denaturing agent. The reduced protein is inactive. The unusual ease of reduction of the disulfide bonds is accompanied by remarkable stability of the reduced form of the protein in the absence of divalent cations. After 24 hours of exposure to air oxidation at pH 7.5 in 1 mm EDTA, 95% of the half-cystine residues remain as cysteine. The situation changes if 4 mm Ca++ is added; re-formation of disulfide bonds and full regain of activity occurs in minutes. If Ca++ is present during the reduction, the product contains one disulfide bond and two —SH groups. The molecule is fully active and remains so even after the two —SH groups are carboxymethylated. The same half-reduced, half-oxidized molecule can be obtained by adding Ca++ to the fully reduced protein providing the reducing agent is still present. These experiments, and the requirement for a divalent cation-DNA complex as the substrate for DNase, demonstrate an ion-protein interaction. However, simple gel filtration at neutral pH removes 45Ca++ completely from both the native enzyme and the active form containing only one disulfide bond; thus, the divalent metal is not bound strongly in either case. The primary sequence of DNase is not sufficient to direct a rapid refolding of the reduced protein under conditions which are similar to those that are effective with RNase and a number of other proteins; in order for the information resident in the amino acid sequence of DNase to be fully expressed, and the native three-dimensional structure to be formed, divalent cations are required."
https://openalex.org/W1546867710,"Abstract α-Isopropylmalate synthase, the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of leucine, was purified to homogeneity from extracts of strain CV-19 of Salmonella typhimurium. From gel filtration and disc gel electrophoresis experiments it was deduced that the enzyme can exist in two physically distinguishable forms and that the equilibrium between these two forms is strongly and specifically influenced by leucine, the end product inhibitor. The pH optimum of the reaction was found to be at pH 8.5. The enzyme was about 30-fold more sensitive to leucine at pH 6.5 than at 8.5. Initial velocity studies revealed that the inhibition by leucine was noncompetitive with respect to α-ketoisovalerate and competitive with respect to acetyl coenzyme A. Under the conditions employed, there was no cooperation between α-ketoisovalerate binding sites. There was, however, increasing cooperation between at least two interacting acetyl coenzyme A binding sites in the presence of increasing concentrations of leucine. Cooperative interactions were also observed with leucine in the presence of substrates. Other inhibitors of the enzyme were α-ketoisocaproate, EDTA, and mercuric salts. The inhibition by leucine is discussed in terms of the model proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965))."

https://openalex.org/W2015180485,D(m)-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity is very low in normal adult rat brain; but during fasting it increases severalfold in parallel with the ketosis. The increase may represent part of a mechanism by which the brain adapts to changing patterns of substrate supply during starvation.
https://openalex.org/W1534168745,"Abstract Conditions leading to cleavage of all of the disulfide bridges in ribonuclease and several other proteins (0.32 m 2-mercaptoethanol in 8 m urea) caused in papain only partial reduction of the disulfide bonds. Electrophoretic studies indicated that alkylation of the partially reduced derivative yielded a unique molecular species (3-RCM papain) in which one specific disulfide bond had been split, rather than a mixture of unreduced and open chain papain. On the other hand, reduction of papain in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, followed by alkylation, yielded a completely open polypeptide chain (7-RCM papain). Alkylation of native papain after reduction in aqueous solution resulted in the sole blocking of the active sulfhydryl group (1-RCM papain). Immunological interactions with antipapain serum indicated identity between 1-RCM papain and native papain, whereas 7-RCM papain was completely unreactive. 3-RCM papain cross-reacted with 60% of the antibodies. The single cleaved disulfide bond in 3-RCM papain was identified by isolation and analysis of the peptides containing carboxymethylcysteine, obtained from a tryptic digest. It was shown to be the bond connecting the cysteine residues in positions 43 and 152 in the amino acid sequence of papain. It was also shown that during the reduction of native papain in 8 m urea autodigestion takes place. This phenomenon was avoided when 1-RCM papain was reduced instead of the native enzyme; in both cases the product of reduction and alkylation was 3-RCM papain."
https://openalex.org/W1817087658,"Abstract The reversible binding of erythromycin to ribosomes of Bacillus subtilis 168 has been studied with two bacterial strains, one sensitive to low levels of the antibiotic and the other a relatively resistant mutant. Each ribosome from the sensitive strain binds approximately 1 molecule of erythromycin when a concentration of 4 x 10-7 m is reached. As the concentration of antibiotic is raised to 10-5 m no further binding takes place. At still higher concentrations, multiple interactions of erythromycin and the ribosomes occur. In contrast to the 1st molecule of erythromycin, which is specifically bound to the 50 S ribosomal subunit, the additional antibiotic molecules are bound nonspecifically to either the 30 S or 50 S particles. When resistant ribosomes are studied, a single molecule of erythromycin can bind to each 50 S subunit, so long as the concentration of antibiotic is kept below 10-5 m. At higher concentrations, multiple interactions can take place, as with sensitive ribosomes. The main difference between sensitive and resistant ribosomes is that, with the former, the 1st erythromycin molecule is bound with sufficiently high affinity to produce a discontinuity in the curve relating the amount bound and the concentration. The 1st molecule of antibiotic is bound to each type of ribosome in the concentration range believed to exist within the cell when multiplication (protein synthesis) is inhibited. With either sensitive or resistant ribosomes, it appears that it is the 1st bound molecule of antibiotic which affects bacterial protein synthesis. Measurements of erythromycin binding under equilibrium conditions have revealed association constants of 2.6 x 107 and approximately 8 x 105 m-1 for sensitive and resistant ribosomes, respectively. Thus the mutant B. subtilis is probably resistant to erythromycin because of some change in ribosomal structure resulting in a lowered binding affinity for this antibiotic. Binding of the 1st molecule of erythromycin to sensitive ribosomes is dependent on the presence of monovalent cations (40 mm NH4+ or K+). The bound erythromycin is freely exchangeable with erythromycin of the medium, and the binding is unaffected by the presence of tetracycline, chlortetracycline, or chloramphenicol. Implications regarding the identity of the site (donor or receptor) occupied by erythromycin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608532815,"Abstract In the study of reactions designed to identify the amino acid residues most directly involved in the catalytic function of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease, the enzyme was first treated with iodoacetate under conditions similar to those which are effective in alkylating essential histidine residues in pancreatic ribonuclease; no inactivation of DNase occurred although some reagent was incorporated. DNase is an enzyme which requires divalent cations to be present with the substrate; when the iodoacetate reaction was tried in the presence of 0.1 m Mn++, DNase was inactivated at pH 7.2 in Tris-chloride buffer and the loss of activity paralleled the formation of 1 residue of 3-carboxymethylhistidine per molecule. The variation of the rate of inactivation with Mn++ concentration indicated that alkylation by iodoacetate is facilitated by the binding of 1 Mn++ per molecule of enzyme. Substitution of Mn++ by 0.1 mm Cu++ greatly increases the rate of alkylation; the half-life of the DNase activity is 5 min at 25° and the only substituted amino acid formed is 3-carboxymethylhistidine. A 29-residue peptide containing the modified histidine residue has been isolated in 90% yield after tryptic hydrolysis of the carboxymethylated DNase. The phenomena of substrate hydrolysis and carboxymethylation at the active site are thus both metal-dependent. The presence of Mn++ or Cu++ probably facilitates the alkylation by increasing the affinity of the active site for the carboxyl group of iodoacetate. A neutral alkylating agent, iodoacetamide, is without effect. The present results increase the number of enzymes of pancreatic origin but differing specificities which are known to have histidine at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1575698235,"Abstract The active site of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B was explored with iodoacetate. Iodoacetate binds reversibly to carbonic anhydrase to produce a completely inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex. It also reacts irreversibly and extremely rapidly with the 3'-nitrogen of only 1 out of 11 histidines present in the native enzyme. Chromatographically pure carboxymethyl carbonic anhydrase retains approximately 5% of the original CO2-hydrating activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that the reaction occurs at the active site. (a) The loss of esterase activity parallels the production of 3-carboxymethylhistidine. (b) Iodoacetate inactivates the enzyme irreversibly only while bound as a reversible inhibitor. (c) Sulfanilamide protects against irreversible inactivation. (d) The native conformation of the enzyme is required for rapid alkylation; in the presence of 8 m urea the rapid reaction with histidine is no longer observed. No gross conformational changes accompany carboxymethylation. The s20,w value and the optical rotatory dispersion are the same for native and modified enzymes. Both the reversible and irreversible interactions of carbonic anhydrase with iodoacetate were studied as functions of pH. The reversible binding of iodoacetate requires the acid form of a group on the enzyme with a pK of 6.9. The irreversible reaction at saturation with iodoacetate is controlled by a group on the enzyme-inhibitor complex with a pK of 5.8. Only the basic form reacts. The data are interpreted as follows. The pK at 6.9 is assigned to a water molecule bound to the zinc, and that at 5.8 to the reactive histidine. The presence of residual activity in the irreversibly inactivated enzyme suggests that this histidine does not play an essential role in catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1621137885,"Abstract ATP is a potent inhibitor of the activity of fumarase from yeast and pig heart (Ki = 0.005 mm and 0.03 mm, respectively). There is a sigmoid relation between the inhibition and the ATP concentration provided that Mg2+ is present. The sigmoid relationship is shown to be due simply to the fact that the MgATP complex does not inhibit, so that with increasing ATP concentration, the inhibition is not fully expressed until Mg2+ is titrated by ATP. Since several other enzymes in energy yielding pathways are known to be inhibited by free ATP but not by MgATP, this type of sigmoidal response is probably an important factor in sharpening feedback responses to ATP. The inhibition by ATP is increased at low pH, suggesting that ATPH3- may be a better inhibitor than ATP4-. Moreover, the ability of magnesium to diminish the inhibition is reduced at low pH, as would be expected from the fact that ATPH3- has a lower affinity than ATP4- for Mg2+. These phenomena may profoundly affect the metabolic consequences of intracellular cation movements, i.e. exchange of Mg2+ for H+ between two compartments such as mitochondria and cytosol would result in the liberation of ATP from MgATP in one compartment and binding of ATP in the other, producing inverse metabolic effects in the two compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2018643355,"The immunological properties of the erythrocyte catalase of mice-normal (wild type) strain, one lacking catalase (acatalasemic), and four with only slight catalase activity (hypocatalasemic strains)-have been investigated. Agardiffusion tests and antigen titration of red-cell lysates against rabbit antiserum to catalase from normal mouse blood showed that immunologically identical catalase protein was present in large amounts in the acatalasemic as well as in the hypocatalasemic mutant strains. Despite lack of catalatic activity, the erythrocytes lacking catalase as well as those with only a little catalase contain catalase protein that has been modified at the site of enzyme activity, although the antigenic determinants are identical with those of normal catalase protein. This mutation is purely structural, being characterized by modification of the enzyme active site but not of the antigenic site."

https://openalex.org/W1548965718,"Abstract A partially reduced derivative of papain, in which only the disulfide bond connecting the cysteine residues in positions 43 and 152 had been opened, was reacted with mercury chloride. The resulting crystallizable material contained 2 g atoms of mercury per mole of papain, and is denoted Pap·2Hg. One of the mercury atoms in this derivative is joined in complex with the free sulfhydryl group of papain which is involved in the catalytic site, whereas the second one is present in the form of an —S-Hg-S— bridge, which replaces the original —S—S— bond that had been reduced. Pap·2Hg is enzymatically active on a range of substrates; in respect to the hydrolysis of benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester its Vmax is similar to that of native papain, but its Km value is 0.042 compared to a value of 0.023 obtained for native papain. The internal mercury atom, in contrast to the one bound to the active sulfhydryl, is retained in the molecule under the conditions required for activating papain (0.005 m cysteine and 0.002 m EDTA). It is, however, totally removed upon extensive dialysis (48 hours) against 0.02 m EDTA, or when Pap·2Hg is exposed to the activating agents in the presence of 8 m urea. Fluorometric titrations of Pap·2Hg, in comparison to those of native papain and of commercial mercuripapain, show very high quenching effect of the 2 mercury atoms, but again indicate that during activation conditions 1 mercury atom is still present in the molecule. On the other hand, under the conditions leading to complete elimination of the mercury from Pap·2Hg, its titration curve is identical with that of native papain. The immunological reactivity of Pap·2Hg with antipapain serum is essentially identical with that of native papain."

https://openalex.org/W1560730406,"Abstract An investigation of radioactive peptides of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B labeled with 14C-iodoacetate was undertaken in order to locate reactive residues near the active site. A labeled pentapeptide from a papain digest was purified chromatographically on Sephadex G-10 and on the cation exchange resin AG 50-X8. Its sequence, determined by the Edman method, was threonyl-3-carboxymethylhistidylprolylprolylleucine. Labeled peptides were also isolated from 14C-carboxymethyl enzyme digested with papain, leucine aminopeptidase, and papain in succession. The products were as follows: 73% of the label occurred in three chromatographically distinct peptides composed of 3-carboxymethylhistidine, two prolines, and a leucine; 7% appeared in a minor fraction; and 20% of the radioactivity was lost during the purification procedure. The data suggest that the histidine residue in the sequence cited above is the target for a minimum of 73% of the radioactivity. They do not rule out the possibility that the remainder of the label is located there as well."

https://openalex.org/W1518654272,"The biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in bacilli has been investigated by studying the way that various species and strains carry out the desaturation of palmitic-1-14C acid. By this method, two distinct desaturation systems have been elucidated. One system, found in six different strains, results in the conversion of palmitate to 5-hexadecenoate, with no other double bond isomers appearing. A second system, found in five strains, results in a spectrum of double bond isomers centering around position 9 but including Δ8 and Δ10 isomers, sometimes as the major constituents. The two desaturating systems are further differentiated by the manner in which they respond to temperature changes of the medium. Thus, cultures desaturating palmitic acid in positions 8, 9, or 10 show no significant change in desaturation rate when the temperature of incubation with palmitate is varied between 20° and 30° (or in the case of Bacillus stearothermophilus 12977, between 20° and 60°). On the other hand, the rate of desaturation of palmitate to 5-hexadecenoate is under strict temperature control. Bacillus megaterium 14581 and other Δ5-desaturating bacilli desaturate palmitate readily at 20° but not at 30°. The rate of desaturation of palmitate is determined by the temperature at which the cultures are incubated with this substrate and not by the temperature of growth. Thus, B. megaterium grown at either 20° or 30° desaturates palmitate at 20° but does not do so at 30°. Further investigation of the temperature effect revealed that the Δ5-desaturating enzyme of B. megaterium is not present at 30° but can be induced by previously incubating a 30° grown culture at 20° for 1 or 2 hours. Chloramphenicol, if added at the beginning of the preliminary incubation period, completely prevents induction of the enzyme but has only an inhibitory effect, increasing with time, if added after preliminary incubation. This inhibitory effect at 20° is presumably due to slow inactivation of desaturating enzyme under circumstances in which replenishment by further protein synthesis is blocked. The induced enzyme is much more rapidly destroyed at 30°. Cultures grown in medium lacking iron have no desaturating activity but activity can be restored by the addition of iron (as ferric ammonium citrate) to the incubation medium. However, iron is not necessary for the temperature induction of the desaturating enzyme but rather appears to be acting as a cofactor in the desaturating system."
