The means through which these cellular interactions affect chemoresistance is unclear. Here, we show that fibroblasts diminish nuclear accumulation of platinum in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. We demonstrate that glutathione and cysteine released by fibroblasts contribute to this resistance. CD8+ T cells abolish the resistance by altering glutathione and cystine metabolism in fibroblasts. CD8+ T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)γ controls fibroblast glutathione and cysteine through upregulation of gamma-glutamyltransferases and transcriptional repression of system xc− cystine and glutamate antiporter via the JAK/STAT1 pathway. The presence of stromal fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells is negatively and positively associated with ovarian cancer patient survival, respectively. Thus, our work uncovers a mode of action for effector T cells: they abrogate stromal-mediated chemoresistance.

Capitalizing upon the interplay between chemotherapy and immunotherapy holds high potential for cancer treatment. Initial clinical response of ovarian cancer patients to surgical debulking and chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs is often excellent. However, relapse and metastasis due to drug resistance is common and patients oftentimes succumb to their disease. Studies regarding chemoresistance in ovarian cancer have focused on cancer genetic alterations, apoptosis, and drug metabolism. However, it is unknown whether and how effector CD8+ T cells play a role in drug resistance. The human cancer immune microenvironment holds the key to understanding the nature of immunity in response to tumor progression and tumor immunotherapy (Topalian et al., 2015Topalian S.L. Drake C.G.

Interestingly, the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and oncologic antibody targeting therapy also depends upon interferon signaling and CD8+ T cell immunity (Binder et al., 2015Binder D.C.

Regardless of the type of therapy, the presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is a favorable prognostic factor in many types of cancer, including ovarian cancer (Peng et al., 2015Peng D.

This raises the possibility that CD8+ T cells may play a role in the prevention of chemoresistance in human cancer. In the current work, we have tested this possibility in the context of ovarian cancer. In addition to T cells and tumor cells, fibroblasts are one of the major cellular components in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated fibroblasts are involved in immune regulation (Kraman et al., 2010Kraman M. Bambrough P.J. Arnold J.N. Roberts E.W. Magiera L. Jones J.O. Gopinathan A. Tuveson D.A. Fearon D.T. Suppression of antitumor immunity by stromal cells expressing fibroblast activation protein-alpha.Science. 2010; 330: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and tumor progression (Özdemir et al., 2014Özdemir B.C. Pentcheva-Hoang T. Carstens J.L. Zheng X. Wu C.C. Simpson T.R. Laklai H. Sugimoto H. Kahlert C.

Thus, in the current work, we examined the potential interaction between CD8+ T cells and fibroblasts in ovarian cancer and found that this interaction shapes the balance between chemotherapeutic resistance and sensitivity in ovarian cancer. We have further dissected the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms and its pathological relevance in patients with ovarian cancer. High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most aggressive subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. To test if HGSOC-associated fibroblasts play a role in platinum resistance, we isolated fibroblasts from HGSOC tissues for our studies (Table S1). Polychromatic flow cytometry analysis showed that fibroblasts were CD45−, epithelial cell adhesion molecule negative (EPCAM−), CD24−, CD44+, CD105+, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha positive (PDGFRA+) (Figure S1A). Immunofluorescence staining showed that isolated fibroblasts expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Figure S1B). We isolated primary epithelial ovarian cancer cells (OC8) from a patient with HGSOC (Cui et al., 2013Cui T.X. Kryczek I. Zhao L. Zhao E. Kuick R. Roh M.H. Vatan L. Szeliga W. Mao Y. Thomas D.G. et al.Myeloid-derived suppressor cells enhance stemness of cancer cells by inducing microRNA101 and suppressing the corepressor CtBP2.Immunity. 2013; 39: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). TP53 mutation is a feature of HGSOC (Domcke et al., 2013Domcke S. Sinha R. Levine D.A. Sander C. Schultz N. Evaluating cell lines as tumour models by comparison of genomic profiles.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We sequenced TP53 gene in OC8 and found that OC8 carried a hotspot TP53 mutation on exon 6 (Figure S1C; Table S2) (Soussi et al., 2010Soussi T. Hamroun D. Hjortsberg L. Rubio-Nevado J.M. Fournier J.L. Béroud C. MUT-TP53 2.0: a novel versatile matrix for statistical analysis of TP53 mutations in human cancer.Hum. Mutat. 2010; 31: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Next, we inoculated the mixture of GFP-labeled OC8 and primary fibroblasts into female NOD.SCID γc-deficient (NSG) mice and treated the mice with cisplatin. Fibroblasts had minimal effect on tumor volume in the control mice that were not treated with cisplatin (Figure 1A). However, tumor volume was increased in the cisplatin-treated mice injected with both OC8 and fibroblasts, compared with the cisplatin-treated mice injected with OC8 alone (Figure 1A). TUNEL assay demonstrated less cisplatin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells in the presence of fibroblasts (Figure 1B). A2780 ovarian cancer cells are used in cisplatin resistance studies. Whether A2780 are HGSOC may be controversial (Domcke et al., 2013Domcke S. Sinha R. Levine D.A. Sander C. Schultz N. Evaluating cell lines as tumour models by comparison of genomic profiles.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We mixed fibroblasts with A2780 and inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice and treated the mice with cisplatin. Similar to the OC8 model, fibroblasts protected A2780 from cisplatin-mediated apoptosis (Figures 1C and 1D). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the existence of SMA+ fibroblasts in tumors established by injection of both fibroblasts and cancer cells (Figure S1D). Thus, fibroblasts enhance cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vivo. When we co-cultured A2780 with fibroblasts in vitro, we found that fibroblasts protected tumor cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis as shown by reduced proportion of Annexin V+ tumor cells (Figure 1E) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S1E). To further investigate if the protective effects from fibroblasts required cell-to-cell contact, we cultured A2780 with fibroblasts in a Transwell and observed that all three fibroblast samples protected A2780 from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 1F). We observed similar protective effects of fibroblasts on OC8 (Figure 1G) and NIH:OVCAR3 (Figure 1H), another p53 mutant HGSOC cell (Table S2) (Domcke et al., 2013Domcke S. Sinha R. Levine D.A. Sander C. Schultz N. Evaluating cell lines as tumour models by comparison of genomic profiles.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), and cisplatin-sensitive TOV21G ovarian cancer cells (Figure S1F). We collected serum-free culture medium from fibroblasts (fibroblast medium) and performed identical experiments. Fibroblast medium also protected A2780 and OC8 from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figures 1I and 1J). We extended our studies to include carboplatin and oxaliplatin and observed similar results (Figures S1G and S1H). Thus, fibroblasts release soluble factor(s) and promote platinum resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The presence of CD8+ T cells is associated with prolonged survival in cisplatin-treated ovarian cancer patients (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang L. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Katsaros D. Gimotty P.A. Massobrio M. Regnani G. Makrigiannakis A. Gray H. Schlienger K. Liebman M.N. et al.Intratumoral T cells, recurrence, and survival in epithelial ovarian cancer.N. Engl. J.

Vatan L. et al.Cancer mediates effector T cell dysfunction by targeting microRNAs and EZH2 via glycolysis restriction.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To examine the potential involvement of CD8+ T cells in fibroblast-mediated platinum resistance, we collected the supernatants from activated CD8+ T cells and added it into the fibroblast and ovarian cancer cell co-culture system. We found that CD8+ T cell-derived supernatants abolished the protective effects of fibroblasts on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells (Figure 2A). We next pre-treated fibroblasts with CD8+ T cell supernatants and again fibroblasts lost the protective function on cancer cells treated with cisplatin (Figures 2B and S2A). The fibroblast numbers (Figure S2B) and viability (Figure S2C) were not changed by CD8+ T cell supernatants.Figure S2Effect of IFNγ on Fibroblast Cell Numbers and Viability, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Schematic experimental approach showing the interaction among CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts and tumor cells in the co-culture system.

We detected high levels of IFNγ in the activated CD8+ T cell-derived supernatants (Figure 2C). We hypothesized that CD8+ T cell-derived IFNγ abolished the protective effect of fibroblasts. To test this, we pre-treated the fibroblasts with IFNγ and observed more apoptotic A2780 (Figure 2D) or OC8 (Figure 2E) cells in the cultures containing IFNγ-primed fibroblasts compared to control fibroblasts. IFNγ treatment had no effect on fibroblast cell numbers or apoptosis (Figures S2B and S2C). Moreover, we cultured fibroblasts with CD8+ T cell supernatant in the presence of neutralizing anti-IFNγ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) antibody (Figure 2F) or JAK inhibitor I (Figure 2G). IFNγ signaling blockade restored the protective effect of fibroblasts on cisplatin-induced tumor cell apoptosis (Figures 2F and 2G). Thus, effector CD8+ T cells abolish fibroblast-mediated chemoresistance through the IFNγ signaling pathway. We further tested the effect of IFNγ on fibroblast-mediated cisplatin resistance in the OC8 bearing NSG model in vivo. IFNγ administration had no effect on tumor volume (Figure 2H). However, IFNγ administration increased the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin treatment as shown by reduced tumor volume (Figure 2H). Thus, IFNγ diminishes fibroblast-mediated platinum resistance in vivo. Cisplatin induces cytotoxicity mainly through DNA damage-mediated apoptosis (Wang and Lippard, 2005Wang D. Lippard S.J. Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). To uncover the molecular mechanism of fibroblast-mediated cisplatin resistance, we first examined whether fibroblasts change the cisplatin-induced apoptotic signaling pathway in cancer cells. Cisplatin treatment activated caspase 3 and caspase 9 in A2780, while the presence of fibroblasts reduced their activation (Figure S3A). Cisplatin causes DNA crosslinking and stimulates H2AX phosphorylation at Serine 139 to generate γH2AX as a major marker for DNA damage signaling in response to DNA double-strand break (Revet et al., 2011Revet I. Feeney L. Bruguera S. Wilson W. Dong T.K. Oh D.H. Dankort D. Cleaver J.E. Functional relevance of the histone gammaH2Ax in the response to DNA damaging agents.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 8663-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When ovarian cancer cells were cultured with fibroblasts, cisplatin-triggered γH2AX in A2780, OC8, and OVCAR3 was reduced (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that fibroblast medium also reduced γH2AX in cisplatin-treated A2780 (Figure S3B). Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that in the fibroblast and ovarian tumor cell co-injection animal model (Figure 1), fibroblasts led to decreased levels of γH2AX in tumor cells following cisplatin treatment (Figure 3B). Thus, fibroblasts may control cisplatin resistance in cancer cells at the DNA damage induction level.Figure 3Fibroblasts Reduce the Accumulation of Cisplatin in Cancer CellsShow full caption(A) Cisplatin-induced γH2AX in cancer cells cultured with fibroblasts was detected by western blotting.

Reduced intracellular cisplatin content can be linked to less DNA damage (Galluzzi et al., 2012Galluzzi L. Senovilla L. Vitale I. Michels J. Martins I. Kepp O. Castedo M. Kroemer G. Molecular mechanisms of cisplatin resistance.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 1869-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, Wang and Lippard, 2005Wang D. Lippard S.J. Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). Inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement revealed that intracellular cisplatin content was reduced in whole A2780 cells in the presence of fibroblasts with different concentrations of cisplatin (Figure 3C). Similar effects were observed in A2780 (Figure 3D) and OC8 (Figure 3E) using fibroblasts from several clinical specimens. Diminished cisplatin content was also detected in the genomic DNA of cisplatin-treated A2780 (Figure 3F) and OC8 (Figure 3G) cultured with fibroblasts. The presence of fibroblast-conditioned medium from different ovarian cancer patients also resulted in diminished cisplatin accumulation in the genomic DNA of cisplatin-treated tumor cells (Figure S3C). Using an antibody specific for cisplatin-DNA adducts, we found that cisplatin-DNA adduct formation in OC8 was decreased in the presence of fibroblasts (Figure 3H). In support of this observation, fibroblasts led to decreased tumor cell accumulation of cisplatin (Figure 3I) in tumor cells in cisplatin-treated mice (OC8-NSG model) (Figure S3D). Thus, fibroblasts confer cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer cells by reducing intracellular cisplatin accumulation. To further investigate the causal link between CD8+ T cell-derived IFNγ and cisplatin tumor accumulation in vivo, we adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells into the mice bearing tumors established with a mixture of tumor cells and fibroblasts and treated the mice with anti-human IFNγ antibody and cisplatin. Twenty-four hours after the treatment, we enriched GFP-labeled tumor cells (Figure S3D) and found platinum content was reduced by anti-human IFNγ (Figure 3J). Thus, fibroblasts confer cisplatin-resistance in ovarian tumor cells by reducing intracellular cisplatin accumulation and CD8+ T cell-derived IFNγ abolishes this effect. We dissected the mechanisms by which fibroblasts reduce cisplatin intracellular accumulation. Intracellular cisplatin content is regulated through cisplatin influx or efflux transporters (Wang and Lippard, 2005Wang D. Lippard S.J. Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). We found that fibroblasts neither decreased the expression of cisplatin influx transporters nor increased the expression of cisplatin efflux transporters in tumor cells (Figure S4A). Cisplatin can be chelated by glutathione and the glutathione (GSH)-platinum complex subsequently effluxes from the cell (Chen and Kuo, 2010Chen H.H. Kuo M.T. Role of glutathione in the regulation of Cisplatin resistance in cancer chemotherapy.Met. Based Drugs. 2010; 2010: 430939Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We observed that after co-culture with fibroblasts, the intracellular GSH level was increased in A2780 (Figure 4A), OC8 (Figure 4B), and OVCAR3 (Figure S4B). Similarly, fibroblast medium increased the intracellular GSH level in tumor cells compared to fresh culture medium and tumor cell medium (Figure 4C).Figure 4Fibroblasts Elevate Cancer Intracellular GSH Conferring Platinum ResistanceShow full caption(A and B) Intracellular GSH level in A2780 (A) or OC8 (B) co-cultured with fibroblasts.

Next, we investigated whether intracellular GSH level in tumor cells affected their apoptotic response to cisplatin. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a GSH precursor. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is an inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the first rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis. NAC increased intracellular GSH level (Figure 4D), decreased the level of cisplatin-induced γH2AX (Figure 4E), reduced platinum content in genomic DNA (Figure 4F), and protected ovarian tumor cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure S4C). BSO treatment decreased intracellular GSH level (Figure 4G), increased platinum DNA content (Figure 4H), and promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 4I) in A2780. Similarly, BSO treatment increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OC8 (Figure S4D) and OVCAR3 (Figure S4E). Treatment with NAC or BSO in the absence of cisplatin had no effect on the viability of A2780, OC8, and OVCAR3 (Figures 4I and S4C–S4E). Next, we constructed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector to downregulate the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) in A2780. shGCLC downregulated the protein expression of GCLC (Figure S4F), decreased intracellular GSH level (Figure 4J), and promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 4K).

These findings illustrate an evolutionary conserved epigenetic mechanism that determines the rate of aging downstream of mitochondrial perturbations. Aging is a deleterious and complex process characterized by the progressive decline of cellular and organismal homeostasis amid constantly increasing levels of entropy (Kirkwood, 2005Kirkwood T.B. Understanding the odd science of aging.Cell. 2005; 120: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) and represents the primary risk factor in major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G. The hallmarks of aging.Cell. 2013; 153: 1194-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7849) Google Scholar). Aging, however, is not only a response to experiences incurred toward the end of an organism’s life but it is also shaped and determined by experiences that have accumulated from the earliest stages of development, and even during the generations that came before it. The organism’s perpetuation of historic cues—how its patterns of gene expression change and become cemented in response to stresses that may have occurred long in the past or in parental populations—have proven to significantly affect long-term health and longevity, the mechanistic details of which are only beginning to emerge. It is thus that we now know, for example, that the transgenerational inheritance of chromatin marks can increase lifespan for multiple generations in Caenorhabditis elegans (Greer et al., 2010Greer E.L. Maures T.J. Hauswirth A.G. Green E.M. Leeman D.S. Maro G.S. Han S. Banko M.R. Gozani O. Brunet A.

One of the most dramatic examples in which early events have effects on longevity is found in the nematode C. elegans, in which mitochondrial stress during development can cause nearly a doubling of the animal’s lifespan (Dillin et al., 2002bDillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Rates of behavior and aging specified by mitochondrial function during development.Science. 2002; 298: 2398-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The timing and degree of mitochondrial dysfunction is highly selective: it must occur during a specific L3/L4 larval transition in order to cause lifespan extension, a time during which a heavy amount of germline-specific mitochondrial biogenesis also occurs (Rea et al., 2007Rea S.L.

Lemire B.D. Mitochondrial genome content is regulated during nematode development.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondrial dysfunction that is too severe or which is implemented too early or late can have a negative effect on lifespan. In many cases, titrating a level of dysfunction is absolutely required in order to observe an extension of lifespan (Rea et al., 2007Rea S.L. Ventura N. Johnson T.E. Relationship between mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction, development, and life extension in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e259Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Longevity caused by mitochondrial dysfunction also often fails to generate universal health benefits, as organisms may live longer but exhibit developmental delay and a drastic reduction in reproductive fitness (Dillin et al., 2002bDillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C.

These effects are surprisingly conserved: in yeast, flies, and mice, mitochondrial dysfunction can delay the aging process (Copeland et al., 2009Copeland J.M. Cho J. Lo Jr., T. Hur J.H. Bahadorani S.

Przedborski S. Mitochondria: the next (neurode)generation.Neuron. 2011; 70: 1033-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Within mitochondria, intricate surveillance systems monitor the quality of existing and newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins to ensure mitochondrial homeostasis (Baker et al., 2011Baker M.J. Tatsuta T. Langer T. Quality control of mitochondrial proteostasis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) consists of a signaling cascade that results in upregulation of nuclear-encoded genes to alleviate the stress sensed in mitochondria. Perception of misfolding in mitochondria requires the protease ClpP, which generates a mitochondrial-derived signal to activate downstream genes (Haynes et al., 2007Haynes C.M. Petrova K. Benedetti C. Yang Y. Ron D. ClpP mediates activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response in C. elegans.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). ClpP triggers the activation of the ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5, which acts as a coactivator of the transcription factor DVE-1. UBL-5 and DVE-1 respond to mitochondrial perturbation to increase expression of mitochondrial chaperones, including hsp-6 and hsp-60 (Benedetti et al., 2006Benedetti C. Haynes C.M. Yang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D. Ubiquitin-like protein 5 positively regulates chaperone gene expression in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response.Genetics. 2006; 174: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In parallel, the bZIP transcription factor ATFS-1 coordinates a wide cellular response to mitochondrial stress (Nargund et al., 2012Nargund A.M. Pellegrino M.W. Fiorese C.J. Baker B.M. Haynes C.M. Mitochondrial import efficiency of ATFS-1 regulates mitochondrial UPR activation.Science. 2012; 337: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, Nargund et al., 2015Nargund A.M. Fiorese C.J. Pellegrino M.W. Deng P. Haynes C.M. Mitochondrial and nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor ATFS-1 promotes OXPHOS recovery during the UPR(mt).Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Previously, several genes characterized for their role in the regulation of the UPRmt were identified as specific requirements for the long lifespan of animals with reduced mitochondrial function (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Houtkooper et al., 2013Houtkooper R.H. Mouchiroud L. Ryu D. Moullan N. Katsyuba E. Knott G. Williams R.W. Auwerx J. Mitonuclear protein imbalance as a conserved longevity mechanism.Nature. 2013; 497: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The requirements for these genes in electron transport chain (ETC)-mediated longevity suggested that the function of the UPRmt might have a beneficial effect on the organism and was required to maintain the longer lifespans in the mitochondrial mutants. In this model, mitochondrial dysfunction early in development was capable of imposing a mild, hormetic stress that could remodel gene expression patterns, perpetuating a beneficial effect long into adulthood (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In keeping with this hypothesis, induction of the UPRmt during early larval stages persists long into adulthood, suggesting that the animal may possess an epigenetic mechanism to maintain the activation of stress responses and ensure increased resistance to future mitochondrial insults (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In yeast, mitochondrial stress generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes an epigenetic remodeling that extends lifespan (Schroeder et al., 2013Schroeder E.A. Raimundo N. Shadel G.S. Epigenetic silencing mediates mitochondria stress-induced longevity.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 954-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and forced expression of UPRmt genes in Drosophila is sufficient to preserve mitochondrial function (Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013Owusu-Ansah E. Song W. Perrimon N. Muscle mitohormesis promotes longevity via systemic repression of insulin signaling.Cell. 2013; 155: 699-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this study we identify two conserved histone lysine demethylases as regulators of the ETC longevity pathway. Using RNAi-based screens in C. elegans, we isolated the conserved histone demethylases jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 as potent suppressors of longevity in response to mitochondrial perturbations. We demonstrate that both jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 are necessary and sufficient for activation of the UPRmt in C. elegans. Moreover, our experiments identify jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 as positive regulators of a longevity response that genetically requires UPRmt signaling. Using transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 coordinate the transcriptional response to mitochondrial stress. Furthermore, using a systems genetics approach, we find that the mammalian orthologs exhibit positive genetic correlations with UPRmt core components in the BXD mouse genetic reference population (Andreux et al., 2012Andreux P.A. Williams E.G. Koutnikova H. Houtkooper R.H. Champy M.F. Henry H. Schoonjans K. Williams R.W. Auwerx J.

Kutalik Z. et al.Multilayered genetic and omics dissection of mitochondrial activity in a mouse reference population.Cell. 2014; 158: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Together, these data reveal a conserved epigenetic mechanism that determines longevity and stress signaling in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We performed an RNAi-based screen to identify genes specifically required for the ETC-mediated longevity in C. elegans. Through these analyses, we identified a putative histone lysine demethylase of the JumonjiC (JmjC)-domain-containing protein family, jmjd-1.2 (F29B9.2), (Kooistra and Helin, 2012Kooistra S.M. Helin K. Molecular mechanisms and potential functions of histone demethylases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 297-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as a potent suppressor of the ETC longevity pathway (Figure 1A; Table S1). We hypothesized that other JmjC domain-containing demethylases may have similar effects on the regulation of lifespan. From the JmjC orthologs found in C. elegans, we identified a second histone lysine demethylase, jmjd-3.1 (F18E9.5), which was also an effective suppressor of ETC-mediated longevity (Figure 1B; Table S1). In their roles as demethylases, jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 have both distinct and overlapping specificity for histone modifications, most notably against H3K27me2/3 (Agger et al., 2007Agger K. Cloos P.A.C. Christensen J. Pasini D. Rose S. Rappsilber J. Issaeva I. Canaani E. Salcini A.E. Helin K.

We found that both jmjd-1.2 and jmjd-3.1 were required for the extended lifespan caused by point mutation in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (complex III), isp-1(qm150) (Feng et al., 2001Feng J.

Neither jmjd-1.2 nor jmjd-3.1 downregulation altered longevity of dietary-restricted eat-2(ad1116) animals (Figures 1E and 1F). We further found that jmjd-1.2 had no effect on the lifespan of animals in which stress responses of the ER or cytosol were constitutively activated (Baird et al., 2014Baird N.A. Douglas P.M.

In contrast, while jmjd-1.2 RNAi did not affect the extended longevity seen in daf-2(e1370) mutant animals or germline-deficient glp-1(e2141) animals (Figures 1G and S1B), we observed that the long lifespan daf-2(e1370) mutant worms depended on jmjd-3.1, albeit partially (Figure 1H). Recently, jmjd-3.1 was also reported to be required for the lifespan extension of germline-deficient glp-1 animals (Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015Labbadia J. Morimoto R.I. Repression of the heat shock response is a programmed event at the onset of reproduction.Mol. Cell. 2015; 59: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that while jmjd-3.1 is involved in several lifespan extension paradigms, both histone demethylases are required for ETC-mediated longevity. One of the most remarkable features of ETC-mediated longevity in C. elegans lies in its precise temporal requirements: reduction of ETC function during a narrow window of development is sufficient to extend lifespan throughout life (Dillin et al., 2002bDillin A.

https://openalex.org/W2343051572,"Organisms respond to mitochondrial stress through the upregulation of an array of protective genes, often perpetuating an early response to metabolic dysfunction across a lifetime. We find that mitochondrial stress causes widespread changes in chromatin structure through histone H3K9 di-methylation marks traditionally associated with gene silencing. Mitochondrial stress response activation requires the di-methylation of histone H3K9 through the activity of the histone methyltransferase met-2 and the nuclear co-factor lin-65. While globally the chromatin becomes silenced by these marks, remaining portions of the chromatin open up, at which point the binding of canonical stress responsive factors such as DVE-1 occurs. Thus, a metabolic stress response is established and propagated into adulthood of animals through specific epigenetic modifications that allow for selective gene expression and lifespan extension."
https://openalex.org/W2343813323,"Sleep exerts many effects on mammalian forebrain networks, including homeostatic effects on both synaptic strengths and firing rates. We used large-scale recordings to examine the activity of neurons in the frontal cortex of rats and first observed that the distribution of pyramidal cell firing rates was wide and strongly skewed toward high firing rates. Moreover, neurons from different parts of that distribution were differentially modulated by sleep substates. Periods of nonREM sleep reduced the activity of high firing rate neurons and tended to upregulate firing of slow-firing neurons. By contrast, the effect of REM was to reduce firing rates across the entire rate spectrum. Microarousals, interspersed within nonREM epochs, increased firing rates of slow-firing neurons. The net result of sleep was to homogenize the firing rate distribution. These findings are at variance with current homeostatic models and provide a novel view of sleep in adjusting network excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2213719612,"Endocannabinoids (eCBs) exert major control over neuronal activity by activating cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). The functionality of the eCB system is primarily ascribed to the well-documented retrograde activation of presynaptic CB1Rs. We find that action potential-driven eCB release leads to a long-lasting membrane potential hyperpolarization in hippocampal principal cells that is independent of CB1Rs. The hyperpolarization, which is specific to CA3 and CA2 pyramidal cells (PCs), depends on the activation of neuronal CB2Rs, as shown by a combined pharmacogenetic and immunohistochemical approach. Upon activation, they modulate the activity of the sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter, leading to a hyperpolarization of the neuron. CB2R activation occurred in a purely self-regulatory manner, robustly altered the input/output function of CA3 PCs, and modulated gamma oscillations in vivo. To conclude, we describe a cell type-specific plasticity mechanism in the hippocampus that provides evidence for the neuronal expression of CB2Rs and emphasizes their importance in basic neuronal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2343555205,"Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are important tumor suppressors whose best-characterized function is repair of damaged nuclear DNA. Here, we describe an essential role for FA genes in two forms of selective autophagy. Genetic deletion of Fancc blocks the autophagic clearance of viruses (virophagy) and increases susceptibility to lethal viral encephalitis. Fanconi anemia complementation group C (FANCC) protein interacts with Parkin, is required in vitro and in vivo for clearance of damaged mitochondria, and decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammasome activation. The mitophagy function of FANCC is genetically distinct from its role in genomic DNA damage repair. Moreover, additional genes in the FA pathway, including FANCA, FANCF, FANCL, FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2, are required for mitophagy. Thus, members of the FA pathway represent a previously undescribed class of selective autophagy genes that function in immunity and organellar homeostasis. These findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of FA and cancers associated with mutations in FA genes."

Here, we report a significant role of cholesterol metabolism in cancer metastasis. By using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we found an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester in human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines, mediated by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) enzyme. Expression of ACAT-1 showed a correlation with poor patient survival. Abrogation of cholesterol esterification, either by an ACAT-1 inhibitor or by shRNA knockdown, significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Mechanically, ACAT-1 inhibition increased intracellular free cholesterol level, which was associated with elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress and caused apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new strategy for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer by inhibiting cholesterol esterification."

Net glutamine uptake did not depend on ASCT2 but required expression of SNAT1 and SNAT2.

Navigating Metabolism. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015Google Scholar). Synthesis of macromolecules is limited to essential turnover of proteins and polynucleotides. Rapidly dividing cells, by contrast, synthesize significant amounts of protein, DNA, RNA, and membrane lipids de novo. Synthesis of these compounds withdraws large amounts of metabolites from metabolic pathways. Cyclic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, are very sensitive to withdrawal of metabolites because depletion of TCA cycle intermediates will render the cycle non-functional and compromise the capacity to generate energy (2Newsholme E.A. Crabtree B. Ardawi M.S. Glutamine metabolism in lymphocytes: its biochemical, physiological and clinical importance.Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 1985; 70: 473-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Linear pathways, by contrast, increase the flow-through to adapt to high metabolic demand. Converting the TCA cycle into a linear pathway is of considerable advantage to rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, activated lymphocytes, and stem cells. This linearized version of the TCA cycle has been termed glutaminolysis, allowing generation of energy and metabolic building blocks (2Newsholme E.A. Crabtree B. Ardawi M.S.

Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Glutamine, the starting substrate of this pathway, is imported by the cell and deaminated to glutamate. Glutamate is converted into 2-oxoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase or by a transaminase reaction. After going through several steps of the TCA cycle, malate or oxaloacetate is produced. Oxaloacetate can be converted into aspartate, which is a major precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis. Both oxaloacetate and malate can also be converted into pyruvate, which can be used to generate alanine, lactate, or acetyl-CoA. As a result, many cancer cells depend on glutamine unless they express glutamine synthetase (4Kung H.N. Marks J.R. Chi J.T. Glutamine synthetase is a genetic determinant of cell type-specific glutamine independence in breast epithelia.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002229Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that glutaminolysis through the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to oxaloacetate produces two NADH, one FADH, and one GTP and therefore provides the cell with significant energy. Activation of the glutaminolysis pathway in cancer cells is accompanied by a reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle (5Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B.

The adaptation of metabolism to cellular growth is associated with transcription factors MYC and HIF, both of which are up-regulated in many cancer cells (6Hitosugi T. Fan J. Chung T.W. Lythgoe K.

Oncol. 2012; 24: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast to differentiated cells, expression of glutamine transporters is essential for fast growing cells. Overexpression of MYC is associated with the induction of ASCT2 (SLC1A5) (8DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Daikhin E. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Wehrli S. Thompson C.B. Beyond aerobic glycolysis: transformed cells can engage in glutamine metabolism that exceeds the requirement for protein and nucleotide synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19345-19350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), a glutamine transporter highly expressed in many cancer cells (9Nakanishi T. Sugawara M. Huang W. Martindale R.G.

Commun. 2001; 281: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a result, ASCT2 is generally considered to mediate the entry of glutamine to the glutaminolysis pathway (e.g. Refs. 10Nicklin P. Bergman P. Zhang B. Triantafellow E. Wang H. Nyfeler B. Yang H. Hild M. Kung C. Wilson C. Myer V.E. MacKeigan J.P. Porter J.A. Wang Y.K.

DeBerardinis R.J. Metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell survival and growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In addition, ASCT2 is often expressed together with 4F2hc/LAT1 (SLC3A2/SLC7A5), a heteromeric antiporter that exchanges large neutral amino acids. Both transporters have been implicated in cancer growth and mTOR signaling in many studies (e.g. Refs. 12Fuchs B.C. Finger R.E. Onan M.C. Bode B.P. ASCT2 silencing regulates mammalian target-of-rapamycin growth and survival signaling in human hepatoma cells.Am. J. Physiol.

Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ASCT2 takes up glutamine, which then acts as an exchange substrate to accumulate leucine via 4F2hc/LAT1 (10Nicklin P. Bergman P. Zhang B. Triantafellow E. Wang H. Nyfeler B. Yang H. Hild M. Kung C. Wilson C. Myer V.E. MacKeigan J.P. Porter J.A. Wang Y.K. Cantley L.C. et al.Bidirectional transport of amino acids regulates mTOR and autophagy.Cell. 2009; 136: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). This proposal is problematic as ASCT2 is also an obligatory amino acid exchanger for small neutral amino acids and does not mediate net uptake of glutamine unless other amino acids are available for release (14Bröer A. Wagner C. Lang F. Bröer S. Neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 displays substrate-induced Na+ exchange and a substrate-gated anion conductance.Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 705-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, glutamine is not a good intracellular exchange substrate for 4F2hc/LAT1 (15Deitmer J.W. Bröer A. Bröer S. Glutamine efflux from astrocytes is mediated by multiple pathways.J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of a net transporter for neutral amino acids is likely to be important for cell growth. Net neutral amino acid transporters are found in the SLC38 family of sodium-neutral amino acid transporters (SNAT) (16Bröer S. The SLC38 family of sodium-amino acid co-transporters.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The family is subdivided into two groups, namely system A amino acid transporters and system N amino acid transporters. System A amino acid transporters (SNAT1 (SLC38A1), SNAT2 (SLC38A2), and SNAT4 (SLC38A4)) are Na+-neutral amino acid cotransporters transporting a wide variety of small neutral amino acids, whereas system N transporters (SNAT3 (SLC38A1), SNAT5 (SLC38A5), and SNAT8 (SLC38A8)) are more substrate-specific, preferring glutamine, asparagine, and histidine (16Bröer S. The SLC38 family of sodium-amino acid co-transporters.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Functionally, system N transporters are characterized by their tolerance to Na+ replacement by Li+, whereas system A transporters are sensitive to inhibition by the amino acid analogue N-methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB). SNAT5 has been shown to be activated by MYC, but its contribution to glutamine uptake in cancer cells has not been studied (17Wise D.R. DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. McMahon S.B. Thompson C.B. Myc regulates a transcriptional program that stimulates mitochondrial glutaminolysis and leads to glutamine addiction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18782-18787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that system A (SNAT1 and SNAT2) activity is essential to mediate net glutamine uptake and glutaminolysis in cancer cell lines, whereas ASCT2 and LAT1 harmonize intracellular amino acid pools. We thus propose a unified model of amino acid homeostasis in cancer cells. Human cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (HeLa) and human thymidine kinase-negative osteosarcoma cells 143B (TK−) (a gift from Dr. David Tscharke (Research School of Biology, The Australian National University)) were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (Sigma D8437) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For subculturing, cells were detached by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, EDTA; Gibco). Cell counting was performed using a Scepter cell counter (Millipore) or a hemocytometer. All complete media for maintaining cells were supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Gibco). Cell viability after trypsinization was generally ≥95% as evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. To eliminate effects of serum-derived trace glutamine, dialyzed FBS was used (Sigma). For growth assays, HeLa and 143B cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a density of 4,000–5,000 cells/well and kept initially in DMEM/Ham's F-12, 10% dialyzed FBS without glutamine. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with the desired test solutions, and cell proliferation was measured using an IncuCyte system (Essen BioScience). IncuCyte data are shown as cell confluence (mean ± S.E.) at set intervals. All uptake assays were performed in a water bath at 37 °C as described (15Deitmer J.W. Bröer A. Bröer S. Glutamine efflux from astrocytes is mediated by multiple pathways.J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm Petri dishes. For Na+-dependent transport, Hanks' balanced salt solution (136.6 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.7 mm Na2HPO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mm glucose was used. For Na+-independent transport, NaCl was substituted with N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride or LiCl, and sodium phosphate was substituted with potassium phosphate. l-[U-14C]glutamine (1.85 MBq/ml, 9.26 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used at ∼2,000 dpm/nmol with unlabeled l-glutamine adjusted to 100 μm final concentration. Transport rates were normalized to cell-derived protein content measured by Bradford reagent (Sigma). Uptake rates were expressed as mean ± S.D., and differences were evaluated by analysis of variance. Labeling of metabolite pools derived from [13C5]glutamine was carried out as described (18Zhang J. Ahn W.S. Gameiro P.A. Keibler M.A. Zhang Z. Stephanopoulos G. 13C isotope-assisted methods for quantifying glutamine metabolism in cancer cells.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 542: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 143B cells were labeled in the presence of 4 mm [13C5]glutamine for 1 or 24 h in otherwise glutamine-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. After the labeling period, medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of deionized water was added to the cells. After swirling briefly, the water was removed, and cells were covered with liquid nitrogen. Once the liquid nitrogen had evaporated, 600 μl of ice-cold CH3OH:CHCl3 (9:1) (supplemented with 1 mm ribitol) was added and incubated for 10 min. The cells were scraped together, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and incubated for an additional 5 min at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,100 × g, and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh 1.5-ml tube. Samples were sent on dry ice to Metabolomics Australia (Parkville, Victoria, Australia) for analysis. The HPLC system consisted of a Dionex UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC in line with a fluorescence FLD-3400 detector. To measure amino acid consumption over time, 143B cells were grown initially in 35- or 60-mm dishes and maintained in complete culture medium in the tissue culture incubator until grown to full confluence. Before starting the experiment, the cells were washed thrice in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm d-glucose and 0.024 mm NaHCO3. Cells were then incubated for 5 h in the same buffer containing 0.2 mm glutamine. Supernates were sampled at 0, 2, and 4 or 5 h; cleared by centrifugation; and freeze-dried overnight. Dried samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.0. Benzylserine (3 μl 1 mm) was added as an internal standard, and 10 μl of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (10 mm in CH3OH) was added for amino acid derivatization. Subsequently, samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and 10 μl was injected for analysis. Samples were eluted off a Kinetex 1.7-μm C18 (2.1 × 100-mm) column at 35 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient was A/B = 90/10% at 0 min increasing to 50/50% after 10 min and to 100% B after 12 min. Eluents were detected at λ = 335 nm. Standard curves were generated for amino acids of interest by varying the injection volume and integrating the corresponding peak areas. A NucleoSpin RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used to isolate total RNA from cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was quantified by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA of interest was amplified using Taq polymerase (Qiagen) using serial dilutions of the template to optimize semiquantitative analysis. PCR primer sequences are available on request. Low passages (<20) of 143B cells were grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine (total concentration, 4 mm). On the day before transfection, cells were split and seeded out in 35-mm cell culture dishes at 150,000–300,000 cells. Immediately before transfection, the medium was renewed. For transfection (all volumes per dish) 4 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) was combined with 250 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), and separately 30 pmol of RNAi construct (Ambion Silencer Select predesigned siRNAs as listed in Table 1) was combined with 250 μl of Opti-MEM. Both solutions were combined after 5 min and incubated for a further 20–30 min at room temperature before adding the transfection complexes dropwise to the cells. All transfections were performed in triplicates. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4–6 h after which the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine. Transport or Western blotting analyses were performed after 48 h unless stated otherwise.TABLE 1siRNA constructs used in this studyProtein targetTarget gene transcriptOriginhASCT2SLC1A5Ambion ID s12916hSNAT1SLC38A1Ambion ID s37592hSNAT2SLC38A2Ambion ID s632hSNAT4SLC38A4Ambion ID s30145hEIF2AK4GCN2Ambion ID s54069Universal Mission Negative control number 1ScrambledSigma Open table in a new tab A commercial CRISPR/Cas9 system was used (Sigma). The construct U6gRNA-pCMV-Cas9–2A-GFP contains a 22-bp guide RNA (cctcgaagcagtcaacctcccg), resulting in cleavage/repair of the Slc1a5 gene in exon 7. An endotoxin-free preparation (Macherey and Nagel) of the plasmid was used for transfection of 143B cells maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine. Cells were split and seeded out in a 60-mm dish to reach 40% confluence on the day before transfection. Immediately before transfection, the cells were replenished with fresh DMEM/Ham's F-12, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine. Plasmid DNA (4 μg) and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were separately incubated in 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature before combining them and incubating for a further 20–30 min at room temperature to form complexes. The complexes were then added dropwise to the cells and placed in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 followed by a medium change after 4–6 h. After 48 h of expression, cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin, EDTA (Invitrogen)) and collected by centrifugation (500 × g) followed by three washes in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 1% dialyzed FBS (Sigma). Cells were then passed through a cell strainer (70 μm; Corning), centrifuged, and suspended in PBS supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 1% dialyzed FBS. Single cell sorting was performed using an ARIA II FACS machine (FACS Facility, The Australian National University) with GFP intensity set at two different levels. Single cells were collected in 96-well plates containing DMEM/Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine and incubated for up to 3 weeks at 37 °C in 5%CO2. Established clones were trypsinized and seeded into 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning) for further propagation. A compound heterozygote mutation of human ASCT2 at the target site was identified by sequencing. Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes and washed thrice in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected and spun down for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was replaced by 5 ml of hypoosmotic buffer (15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0), and the cells were resuspended by mixing. After incubation on ice for 5 min, membranes were ruptured by 35 strokes in a Potter homogenizer. Debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. Membranes were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 180,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 5 mm glycine. For surface biotinylation, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes and washed thrice in 10 ml of modified PBS (supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0). Cells were then covered with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in modified PBS, pH 8.0, and incubated for 45 min at room temperature on a rotary shaker at low speed. Biotinylation was terminated by washing thrice in modified PBS supplemented with 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0. Cells were scraped together, transferred to a 1.5-ml reaction tube, and lysed by addition of 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5. The homogenate was incubated on ice for 1.5 h to complete lysis. Subsequently, the homogenate was centrifuged at 13,500 × g in a table top centrifuge for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. After protein determination, equal amounts of protein homogenate were added to 150 μl of high capacity streptavidin-agarose beads. The beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotary shaker before washing four times in lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose slurry was mixed with protein sample buffer and sample reducing reagent. After boiling for 5min, a 40-μl sample was loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. For protein extraction, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay protein extraction buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Total soluble proteins from the supernates were measured using the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To prepare protein samples for SDS-PAGE, 50–100 μg of total protein was mixed with 5 μl of 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of reducing agent (Invitrogen) and made up to 20 μl using Milli-Q water. Samples were then incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before loading onto the gel. Electrophoresis was performed using 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide NuPAGE® gels (Invitrogen) electrophoresed in an XCell SureLock® Mini-Cell (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions according to standard manufacturer procedures. The SeeBlue Plus 2 prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) was used to estimate the apparent molecular weight of fractionated proteins. Following SDS-PAGE, fractionated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) using a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols. Blots were blocked for 2 h at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C) in 50 ml of 10% (w/v) skim milk in PBS with 0.15% Tween 20 (PBS-T). After washing thrice in PBS-T for 10 min each, the blots were incubated with the first antibody for 2 h or overnight in 5 ml of skim milk (2%, w/v) in PBS-T at dilutions listed in Table 2. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing three times with PBS-T. Blots were incubated with 5 ml of diluted secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing thrice in PBS-T and a final rinse in PBS, reactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Luminata Crescendo or Forte Western HRP Substrate (Millipore Merck). For reprobing, the same blots were incubated for 45 min at 70 °C in 50 ml of stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Membranes were then washed thrice with PBS-T and blocked for 3 h using 10% (w/v) skim milk in PBS-T before reprobing with the next antibody as described above.TABLE 2Antibodies used in this study and their dilutionAntibodiesCompanyPhosphorylation siteDilutionAnti-ASCT2 (SLC1A5)Cell Signaling Technology1:2,000–1:3,000Anti-SNAT1 (SLC38A1)Millipore1:2,000Anti-SNAT2 (SLC38A2)Abcam1:2,000Anti-S6Cell Signaling Technology1:2,000Anti-P-S6Cell Signaling TechnologySer-240/Ser-2441:1,000Anti-eIF2Cell Signaling Technology1:2,000Anti-P-Eif2Cell Signaling TechnologySer-511:1,000Anti-LAT1Cell Signaling Technology1:1,000Anti-Na+/K+-ATPaseAbcam1:5,000–1:10,000Anti-c-MYCSanta Cruz Biotechnology1:200Anti-rabbit IgG-HRPGE Healthcare1:1,000–1:10,000Anti-mouse IgG-HRPCell Signaling Technology1:1,000–1:10,000Anti-4E-BP1Cell Signaling Technology1:3,000Anti-P-4E-BP1Cell Signaling TechnologyThr-37/Thr-461:2,000Anti-p70S6 kinaseCell Signaling Technology1:1,000Anti-P-p70S6 kinaseCell Signaling TechnologySer-3711:1,000 Open table in a new tab Xenopus laevis (Nasco) oocytes were isolated and maintained as described previously (19Bröer S.

Selected oocytes were injected with 10 ng of human ASCT2, human SNAT1, human SNAT2, or human SNAT5 cRNA and were used as described previously (20Bröer A. Brookes N. Ganapathy V. Dimmer K.S.

Growth curves were analyzed using the Gompertz equation for cell growth, y = a × exp(−exp(k(x − xc))), or the logistic equation, y = a/(1 + exp(−k(x − xc))). For all experiments, the number of technical repeats is shown as n, and the number of biological/experimental repeats is shown as e. Unpaired t tests were performed to compare means of the combined biological repeats. Glutamine is an essential amino acid for cells that carry out the glutaminolysis pathway (3Wise D.R. Thompson C.B. Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). In agreement with this metabolic phenotype, we found that growth of HeLa cells and 143B cells highly depended on glutamine. Both cell lines completely ceased growth in the absence of glutamine (data not shown). At the same time, both cell lines produced alanine, aspartate, and glutamate in a glutamine-dependent manner. For instance, 143B cells produced 4 ± 0.2 μm aspartate, 23 ± 5 μm glutamate, and 80 ± 10 μm alanine from 200 μm glutamine over 5 h. Moreover, metabolic labeling with [13C5]glutamine resulted in strong 13C enrichment of cellular glutamate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and aspartate pools (results presented further below). These results confirmed the use of the glutaminolysis pathway. Accordingly, MYC was detected in the nuclei of both cell lines (data not shown). Having established functional glutaminolysis in both cell lines, we wondered how import of glutamine is mediated in these cells. Analysis of amino acid transporter expression by RT-PCR revealed the presence of a variety of glutamine transporters, namely ASCT2, LAT1, LAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2. SNAT5 was detected in HeLa but not in 143B cells (Fig. 1, A and B). A separate analysis of SNAT isoforms in 143B cells showed high expression levels of SNAT1 and SNAT2 (Fig. 1C). SNAT4, SNAT7, and SNAT9 were weakly expressed and may serve roles in addition to glutamine transport. For instance, SNAT9 is a lysosomal arginine transporter involved in mTOR signaling (21Rebsamen M.

To correlate the expression data with functional data, we analyzed glutamine uptake into HeLa and 143B cells using competition experiments. The competing amino acids and analogues were chosen to identify system A activity (MeAIB), ASCT2 activity (Thr, which is not an inhibitor of system A), and system L (Leu) in an additive manner as published previously (23Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Laine R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. Identification of the protein responsible for hepatic system N amino acid transport activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the dominant mRNA expression of system A isoforms SNAT1 and SNAT2, the system A inhibitor MeAIB decreased glutamine uptake only by a small fraction (Fig. 1, D and E). Glutamine uptake was predominantly Na+-dependent, particularly in 143B cells. With the exception of system N (molecular isoforms SNAT3 and SNAT5), Na+-dependent transporters cannot use Li+ instead of Na+; thus, lithium tolerance is a good indicator of the presence of SNAT3 and SNAT5. However, replacement of Na"
https://openalex.org/W2337232953,"Deregulated cellular metabolism is a hallmark of tumors. Cancer cells increase glucose and glutamine flux to provide energy needs and macromolecular synthesis demands. Several studies have been focused on the importance of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. However, a neglected but very important branch of glucose metabolism is the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). The HBP is a branch of the glucose metabolic pathway that consumes ∼2-5% of the total glucose, generating UDP-GlcNAc as the end product. UDP-GlcNAc is the donor substrate used in multiple glycosylation reactions. Thus, HBP links the altered metabolism with aberrant glycosylation providing a mechanism for cancer cells to sense and respond to microenvironment changes. Here, we investigate the changes of glucose metabolism during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the role of O-GlcNAcylation in this process. We show that A549 cells increase glucose uptake during EMT, but instead of increasing the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, the glucose is shunted through the HBP. The activation of HBP induces an aberrant cell surface glycosylation and O-GlcNAcylation. The cell surface glycans display an increase of sialylation α2-6, poly-LacNAc, and fucosylation, all known epitopes found in different tumor models. In addition, modulation of O-GlcNAc levels was demonstrated to be important during the EMT process. Taken together, our results indicate that EMT is an applicable model to study metabolic and glycophenotype changes during carcinogenesis, suggesting that cell glycosylation senses metabolic changes and modulates cell plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2344034289,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a major component of the tumour microenvironment. A plethora of elegant studies focusing on tumour-derived MSCs have shown that they, unlike normal MSCs in other tissue, exhibit a strong ability to promote tumour progression. However, the mechanisms underlying the conversion of normal MSCs into tumour-associated MSCs are unknown. We report here a critical role of tumour cell-derived exosomes in endowing bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) with a tumour-favourable phenotype. Tumour cell-derived exosomes affected neither the growth factor production nor the immunosuppressive property of MSCs; rather, they endowed MSCs with a strong ability to promote macrophage infiltration into B16-F0 melanoma or EL-4 lymphoma. Ablation of macrophages by clodronate liposome administration reversed the tumour-promoting effect of MSCs educated by tumour cell-derived exosomes (TE-MSCs) on the tumour growth. By comparing the chemokine profile of BM-MSCs with that of TE-MSCs, we found that TE-MSCs produced a large amount of CCR2 ligands, CCL2 and CCL7, which are responsible for macrophage recruitment. CCR2-specific inhibitor was found to block the tumour-promoting effect of TE-MSCs. Thus, our investigations demonstrated that tumour cell-derived exosomes confer BM-MSCs the ability to enhance tumour growth. Therefore, we uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the conversion of normal MSCs to tumour-associated MSCs."

Activation of protein degradation systems has been proposed to be a potential strategy for removing pathological tau, but it remains unclear how effectively tau aggregates can be degraded by these systems. By applying our previously established cellular model system of AD-like tau aggregate induction using preformed tau fibrils, we demonstrate that tau aggregates induced in cells with regulated expression of full-length mutant tau can be gradually cleared when soluble tau expression is suppressed. This clearance is at least partially mediated by the autophagy-lysosome pathway, although both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway are deficient in handling large tau aggregates. Importantly, residual tau aggregates left after the clearance phase leads to a rapid reinstatement of robust tau pathology once soluble tau expression is turned on again. Moreover, we succeeded in generating monoclonal cells persistently carrying tau aggregates without obvious cytotoxicity. Live imaging of GFP-tagged tau aggregates showed that tau inclusions are dynamic structures constantly undergoing “fission” and “fusion,” which facilitate stable propagation of tau pathology in dividing cells. These findings provide a greater understanding of cell-to-cell transmission of tau aggregates in dividing cells and possibly neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2342836356,"The quantal nature of synaptic transmission requires a mechanism to transport neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles without promoting non-vesicular efflux across the plasma membrane. Indeed, the vesicular transport of most classical transmitters involves a mechanism of H(+) exchange, which restricts flux to acidic membranes such as synaptic vesicles. However, vesicular transport of the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate depends primarily on membrane potential, which would drive non-vesicular efflux, and the role of protons is unclear. Adapting electrophysiology to record currents associated with the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), we characterize a chloride conductance that is gated by lumenal protons and chloride and supports glutamate uptake. Rather than coupling stoichiometrically to glutamate flux, lumenal protons and chloride allosterically activate vesicular glutamate transport. Gating by protons serves to inhibit what would otherwise be substantial non-vesicular glutamate efflux at the plasma membrane, thereby restricting VGLUT activity to synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2346898981,"Colon cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer worldwide with less than 10% survival rate at the late stage. Although mutations of certain genes have been implicated in familial colon cancer development, the etiology of the majority of colon cancer remains unknown. Herein, we identified TYRO3 as a potential oncogene. Immunohistochemical staining results demonstrated that levels of TYRO3 were markedly elevated in polyps and colon cancer cells and were negatively correlated with prognosis. Overexpression of TYRO3 enhanced cell motility, invasion, anchorage-independent growth and metastatic ability, while knockdown of TYRO3 impaired all these processes. Results from meta-analysis showed that TYRO3 was associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that expression of SNAI1, the master regulator of EMT, was regulated by TYRO3 and played a major role in mediating TYRO3-induced EMT processes. The murine model also demonstrated that Tyro3 and Snai1 were upregulated in the early stage of colon cancer development. To provide a proof-of-concept that TYRO3 is a druggable target in colon cancer therapy, we raised anti-TYRO3 human antibodies and showed that treatment with the human antibody abolished TYRO3-induced EMT process. More importantly, administration of this anti-TYRO3 antibody increased drug sensitivity in primary cultured colon cancer cells and xenografted mouse tumors. These findings demonstrate that TYRO3 is a novel oncogene and a druggable target in colon cancer."

This study demonstrates that DATS targets breast cancer stem cells (bCSC). Exposure of MCF-7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells to pharmacological concentrations of DATS (2.5 and 5 μm) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of bCSC, as evidenced by a mammosphere assay and flow cytometric analysis of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity and the CD44high/CD24low/epithelial specific antigen-positive fraction. DATS-mediated inhibition of bCSC was associated with a decrease in the protein level of FoxQ1. Overexpression of FoxQ1 in MCF-7 and SUM159 cells increased ALDH1 activity and the CD49f+/CD24− fraction. Inhibition of ALDH1 activity and/or mammosphere formation upon DATS treatment was significantly attenuated by overexpression of FoxQ1. In agreement with these results, stable knockdown of FoxQ1 using small hairpin RNA augmented bCSC inhibition by DATS. Expression profiling for cancer stem cell-related genes suggested that FoxQ1 may negatively regulate the expression of Dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1), whose expression is lost in invasive breast cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed recruitment of FoxQ1 at the DACH1 promoter. Moreover, inducible expression of DACH1 augmented DATS-mediated inhibition of bCSC. Expression of FoxQ1 protein was significantly higher in triple-negative breast cancer cases compared with normal mammary tissues. Moreover, an inverse association was observed between FoxQ1 and DACH1 gene expression in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. DATS administration inhibited ALDH1 activity in vivo in SUM159 xenografts. These results indicate that FoxQ1 is a novel target of bCSC inhibition by DATS."

(Z)-3-Hexenal and (E)-2-hexenal are subsequently reduced to alcohols by aldehyde reductases, aldo/keto reductases (11.Yamauchi Y. Hasegawa A. Taninaka A. Mizutani M. Sugimoto Y.

In this study we identified (Z)-3:(E)-2-hexenal isomerase (HI) in various plant species and identified the common catalytic amino acids needed for isomerase activity by analysis of the enzymatic mechanism of isomerization. Overexpression of paprika (Capsicum annuum) HI (CaHI) in tomato plants led to a drastic change in hexenal composition in both leaves and fruits, indicating that this HI is a critical enzyme determining green odor in planta. Paprika (C. annuum L.), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia-0), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, cv. Micro-Tom), potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Sassy), tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), and rice (Oryza sativa, cv. Nipponbare) were sown on Jiffy-7 peat pellets (Sakata Seed Co., Yokohama, Japan) and kept at 4 °C for 3 days in the dark. The plants were then transferred to the conditions of a 14-h-light (80 μmol of photons m−2 s−1)/10-h dark cycle at 23 °C (for Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, tobacco, alfalfa, cucumber, and rice) or 28 °C (for paprika). Wounding treatment to leaves was performed with nipping by tweezers. (Z)-3-Hexenal was obtained from Bedoukian Research Inc. (Danbury, CT). Other chemicals of research grade were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). (Z)-3-Nonenal and (Z,Z)-3,6-nonadienal were obtained by oxidation with the Dess-Martin periodinane (Wako Pure Chemical) from (Z)-3-nonen-1-ol and (Z,Z)-3,6-nonadienol, respectively (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan). Plant material was homogenized with two volumes of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as a crude extract. Crude extract (up to 500 μl, depending on the activity) was incubated in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 10 mm (Z)-3-hexenal in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped and derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine by the addition of 25 μl of 20 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in acetonitrile and 20 μl of HCOOH. After 10 min, dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) derivatives were extracted with 300 μl of n-hexane. After centrifugation, 150 μl of the hexane layer was recovered and dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 200 μl of acetonitrile and filtered through a Cosmonice Filter (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), after which 10-μl aliquots were subjected to HPLC as described previously (17.Yamauchi Y. Hasegawa A. Mizutani M. Sugimoto Y. Chloroplastic NADPH-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase contributes to the detoxification of reactive carbonyls produced under oxidative stress.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Paprika pericarp (640 g) was homogenized with 1.5 volumes of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0. Debris was removed by filtration through two layers of gauze, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 30% saturation followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After lipids floating on the supernatant were removed by filtration through two layers of gauze, the supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (40 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30% saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (K-PB), pH 7.0. Proteins were eluted with 50 mm K-PB, pH 7.0, and the eluent was applied directly to a hydroxyapatite (Nacalai Tesque) column equilibrated with 50 mm K-PB, pH 7.0. After washing with 250 mm K-PB, pH 7.0, HI activity was eluted with 250 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1% Triton X-100. Nine volumes of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside were added to the fraction containing activity, which was then applied to a Mono Q mini column (total volume 2 ml, GE Healthcare). After washing with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside, proteins were eluted with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside and 1 m NaCl. The enzyme solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-30 (Merck Millipore) and diluted by 9 volumes of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside. The proteins were subjected to anion exchange column chromatography twice (Mono Q, 5/5, and subsequent MonoQ1.6/5, SMART System, GE Healthcare) and fractionated with a gradient of 0–0.6 M NaCl in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% β-d-dodecylmaltoside. All procedures were done below 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar). Purified paprika enzyme (2 μg) dissolved in 1 ml of 70% HCOOH was chemically fragmented with 1 mg of BrCN at room temperature overnight in the dark. Fragmented peptides recovered by centrifugal evaporation were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer and then separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the separated peptides were blotted onto a PVDF membrane with a semidry blotting system (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and peptides were visualized by CBB R-250 staining. Stained bands were excised from the membrane, and their amino acid sequences were determined with a protein sequencer (Procise Model 492, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A similarity search of internal amino acid sequences was performed against a Solanaceae-specific database (SolCyc Home). To confirm that Ca08g14620, including both internal amino acid sequences, was identical to CaHI, the open reading frame (ORF) of Ca08g14620 was cloned as follows. Total RNA was isolated from paprika fruits with an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was then synthesized with ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). To obtain the ORF of Ca08g14620, PCR was performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) using primers CaHI BamHI 5′ (5′-GGATCCATGGATTTAATATTGGCATCG-3′, the additional restriction site is underlined) and CaHI SalI 3′ (5′-GTCGACTTAAGGTGGGGCAATGACTGC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the TA Cloning vector pMD19 and then sequenced with a BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit for confirmation. qRT-PCR was performed with Thunderbird SYBR Green qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) and a LightCycler Nano System (Roche Applied Science) using template cDNA prepared as described above. Primers used for qRT-PCR are shown in supplemental Table S1. For analysis of relative transcript levels, internal standard mRNA (a list is shown in supplemental Table S1) was used in all qRT-PCR experiments, and the expression levels of genes of interest were normalized to that of the internal standard by subtraction of the cycle threshold (CT) value of the internal standard from the CT value of the gene of interest. Alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses were performed using the software MEGA 5 (19.Tamura K. Peterson D. Peterson N. Stecher G. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34906) Google Scholar). A list of protein sequences used for analysis is shown in supplemental Table S2. The ORF of HI was amplified by PCR using the primers shown in supplemental Table S3 and then subcloned into pMD19 (Takara Bio). After confirming DNA sequence, each HI gene was inserted into pColdProS2 vector (Takara Bio), and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the resultant expression plasmid. E. coli harboring the expression vector was grown with shaking at 37 °C in LB broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to midlogarithmic phase. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and cultures were grown for a further 16 h at 15 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended with 400 μl of PBS. After disruption of the cells by sonication (40 watts, 10 s, three times) on ice, recombinant HI protein in the soluble fraction was purified on a His SpinTrap column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An electrophoretically homogenous HI fraction was used for enzyme assays. Point mutation of recombinant CaHI (rCaHI) was performed with a PrimeSTAR Mutagenesis Basal kit (Takara Bio) using the primers shown in supplemental Table S4. 3-Hexyn-1-al was chemically synthesized from 3-hexyn-1-ol (Tokyo Chemical Industry) by oxidation with the Dess-Martin periodinane (Wako Pure Chemical) reagent according to the method of Wavrin and Viala (20.Wavrin L. Viala J. Clean and efficient oxidation of homoallylic and homopropargylic alcohols into β,γ-unsaturated aldehydes by the Dess-Martin periodinane.Synthesis. 2002; 3: 326-330Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm its purity, synthesized 3-hexyn-1-al was derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as described above and then analyzed by LC-MS and NMR. Synthesized 3-hexyn-1-al was incubated with purified rCaHI for 4 h on ice, and free 3-hexyn-1-al was then removed by ultrafiltration using Vivaspin 500–30K (GE Healthcare). Residual HI activity was measured by standard assay as described above. All NMR experiments were performed on a JEOL JNM-AL300 (300 MHz at 1H, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and chemical shifts were assigned relative to the solvent signal. Hexenal-DNP derivatives were dissolved in chloroform-d2 and added to tubes having a diameter of 5 mm. A DNA fragment of CaHI amplified with primers CaHI NdeI 5′ (5′-CATATGGATTTAATATTGGCATCG-3′) and CaHI SalI 3′ was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into the pRI101-AN vector (Takara Bio Inc.) to construct a 35Spromoter-driven expression plasmid. After Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1Rifr) was transformed by pRI101-AN::35S::CaHI, cotyledons of tomato plants (cv. Micro-Tom) were transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with kanamycin resistance as a selectable marker (21.Sun H.-J. Uchii S. Watanabe S. Ezura H. A highly efficient transformation protocol for Micro-Tom, a model cultivar for tomato functional genomics.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For confirmation of insertion of 35S-driven CaHI and the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene in regenerated transgenic tomato plants, genome PCR was performed using the primers 35S-F (5′-TCGCCGTAAAGACTGGCGAACA-3′) and CaHI SalI 3′. Candidates were further examined by qRT-PCR and volatile analysis to establish transgenic lines. Finally, transgenic lines showing stable seed production were used for analysis. Harvested tomato materials were placed in a Falcon tube (15 ml) with three stainless steel beads (5 mm inner diameter), and the tube was then sealed tightly with Parafilm. After samples were frozen in liquid N2, the tissues were completely disrupted by vigorous vortexing. When volatiles in intact tissues were analyzed, 1 ml of saturated CaCl2 solution was added to inactivate the enzymes. An SPME fiber (50/30 μm DVB/Carboxen/PDMS, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) was exposed to the headspace of the tube for 30 min (for leaf) or 60 min (for fruit) at 25 °C. The fiber was inserted into the insertion port of a GC-MS (QP-5050, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 0.25-μm × 30-m Stabiliwax column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA). The column temperature was programmed as follows: 40 °C for 1 min, increasing by 15 °C min−1 to 180 °C for 1 min (22.Matsui K. Sugimoto K. Mano J. Ozawa R. Takabayashi J. Differential metabolisms of green leaf volatiles in injured and intact parts of a wounded leaf meet distinct ecophysiological requirements.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36433Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The carrier gas (He) was delivered at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Splitless injection with a sampling time of 1 min was used. The fiber was held in the injection port for 1 min to remove all compounds fully from the matrix. The temperatures of the injector and interface were 200 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The mass detector was operated in electron impact mode with ionization energy of 70 eV. To identify compounds, retention indices and MS profiles of corresponding authentic specimens were used. Three-dimensional structures of HI proteins were deduced by homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL (23.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T.

SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W252-W258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of HIs were used to search for templates in the database. The templates were selected based on the Global Model Quality Estimation values and the QMEAN scores (26.Benkert P. Künzli M. Schwede T. QMEAN server for protein model quality.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W510-W514Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Templates and the sequence identity between the HIs and their corresponding templates are shown in the figures. The protein structures were analyzed with Swiss PdbViewer (27.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9578) Google Scholar). The full sequences of the CaHI and alfalfa HI (MsHI) have been deposited at the DDBJ data bank with accession numbers LC146479 and LC146718, respectively. At the start of this study, we screened plant materials for high HI activity. We first assayed activity in red bell pepper (C. annuum L.) fruits because bell pepper showed a large change in leaf aldehyde composition during ripening; (Z)-3-hexenal was the predominant GLV in green bell pepper, whereas (E)-2-hexenal became the predominant GLV during the change in fruit color from green to red (28.Luning P.A. Carey A.T. Roozen J.P. Wichers H.J. Characterization and occurrence of lipoxygenase in bell peppers at different ripening stages in relation to the formation of volatile flavor compounds.J. Agric. Food Chem. 1995; 43: 1493-1500Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This phenomenon suggested that abundant HI activity occurs in ripening bell pepper. As expected, we detected activity in red pepper fruits, and another bell pepper variant, red paprika, showed the most abundant activity (supplemental Fig. S1). We detected no isomerase activities in Arabidopsis leaves, tobacco leaves, or tomato fruits. We accordingly used red paprika as a source for purification of HI. CaHI was purified from pericarp of red paprika fruits by successive column chromatography steps (Table 1). At the final step of purification, fractions containing activity matched elution peaks of proteins (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that each fraction contained a single protein of 35 kDa (Fig. 2B), suggesting that CaHI was purified to homogeneity. Native CaHI is a trimetric protein, given that the molecular mass of nondenatured isomerase was estimated by BN-PAGE to be 110 kDa (Fig. 2C). Isomerization of hexenal by purified CaHI is unidirectional given that CaHI did not convert (E)-2-hexenal to (Z)-3-hexenal (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). (Z)-3-Nonenal and (Z,Z)-3,6-nonadienal, which are substrates for other fatty acid-derived volatiles (E)-2-nonenal (29.Galliard T. Phillips D.R. Reynolds J.

Kinetic parameters against (Z)-3-hexenal are shown in Table 2.

After the purified protein was chemically cleaved by BrCN, polypeptide fragments were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes (supplemental Fig. S4A). Among the blotted peptides, amino acid sequences of two major polypeptides could be determined (supplemental Fig. S4B). A homology search of these sequences using a Solanaceae-specific database indicated that the amino acid sequence of an unknown protein encoded by Ca08g14620 contained both sequences. To confirm that this unknown protein was identical to CaHI, the ORF of the unknown protein was cloned into pColdProS2 plasmid and then produced as a recombinant protein (supplemental Fig. S5A). The purified recombinant protein in soluble form showed high HI activity (supplemental Fig. S5B), indicating that Ca08g14620 encoded CaHI. rCaHI, like native CaHI, showed high activity at weakly acidic and neutral pH values (supplemental Fig. S3 B). BLAST search using the amino acid sequence of CaHI indicated that it is a member of the cupin superfamily. This superfamily is a large protein family containing diverse functional proteins such as storage proteins and various enzymes (31.Dunwell J.M. Purvis A. Khuri S. Cupins: the most functionally diverse protein superfamily?.Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A subfamily including CaHI is located near germin and a germin-like protein family including 11S globulin and vicilin (Fig. 3). CaHI and highly homologous proteins in Solanaceae species such as tomato and potato are included in a clade named Solanaceae HI, and another clade closely related to HI is named Solanace"
https://openalex.org/W2344203831,"Necroptosis is a RIP1-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) pathway that is distinct from apoptosis. Downstream effector pathways of necroptosis include formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which depend on glycolysis. This suggests that increased cellular glucose may prime necroptosis. Here we show that exposure to hyperglycemic levels of glucose enhances necroptosis in primary red blood cells (RBCs), Jurkat T cells, and U937 monocytes. Pharmacologic or siRNA inhibition of RIP1 prevented the enhanced death, confirming it as RIP1-dependent necroptosis. Hyperglycemic enhancement of necroptosis depends upon glycolysis with AGEs and ROS playing a role. Total levels of RIP1, RIP3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) proteins were increased following treatment with high levels of glucose in Jurkat and U937 cells and was not due to transcriptional regulation. The observed increase in RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL protein levels suggests a potential positive feedback mechanism in nucleated cell types. Enhanced PCD due to hyperglycemia was specific to necroptosis as extrinsic apoptosis was inhibited by exposure to high levels of glucose. Hyperglycemia resulted in increased infarct size in a mouse model of brain hypoxia-ischemia injury. The increased infarct size was prevented by treatment with nec-1s, strongly suggesting that increased necroptosis accounts for exacerbation of this injury in conditions of hyperglycemia. This work reveals that hyperglycemia represents a condition in which cells are extraordinarily susceptible to necroptosis, that local glucose levels alter the balance of PCD pathways, and that clinically relevant outcomes may depend on glucose-mediated effects on PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2344733597,"Peroxisome proliferation occurs by at least two routes, division of existing peroxisomes and de novo biogenesis from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The proteins and molecular mechanisms governing peroxisome emergence from the ER are poorly characterized. In this study, we report that two integral membrane peroxins (proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pex29 and Pex30, reside in distinct regions of the ER and associate with Rtn1 and Yop1, reticulon family members that contribute to ER morphology, to govern peroxisome emergence from the ER. In vivo and in vitro analyses reveal that peroxisome proliferation is therefore not restricted to the peroxisome but begins at the level of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2418204834,"Skeletal muscle atrophy promotes muscle weakness, limiting activities of daily living. However, mechanisms underlying atrophy remain unclear. Here, we show that skeletal muscle immobilization elevates Smad2/3 protein but not mRNA levels in muscle, promoting atrophy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that myostatin, which negatively regulates muscle hypertrophy, is dispensable for denervation-induced muscle atrophy and Smad2/3 protein accumulation. Moreover, muscle-specific Smad2/3-deficient mice exhibited significant resistance to denervation-induced muscle atrophy. In addition, expression of the atrogenes Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, which underlie muscle atrophy, did not increase in muscles of Smad2/3-deficient mice following denervation. We also demonstrate that serum starvation promotes Smad2/3 protein accumulation in C2C12 myogenic cells, an in vitro muscle atrophy model, an effect inhibited by IGF1 treatment. In vivo, we observed IGF1 receptor deactivation in immobilized muscle, even in the presence of normal levels of circulating IGF1. Denervation-induced muscle atrophy was accompanied by reduced glucose intake and elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids, effects that were Smad2/3-dependent. Thus, muscle immobilization attenuates IGF1 signals at the receptor rather than the ligand level, leading to Smad2/3 protein accumulation, muscle atrophy, and accompanying metabolic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2343543833,"The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the kinase that produces it have been implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases in mice and humans; however, little is known about the role of the 2 S1P-specific phosphohydrolase isoforms, SGPP1 and SGPP2, which catalyze dephosphorylation of S1P to sphingosine. To elucidate their functions, we generated specific knockout mice. Deletion of Sgpp2, which is mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, significantly reduced dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis severity, whereas deletion of ubiquitously expressed Sgpp1 slightly worsened colitis. Moreover, Sgpp1 deletion enhanced expression of multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and immune cell infiltration into the colon. Conversely, Sgpp2-null mice failed to mount a DSS-induced systemic inflammatory response. Of interest, Sgpp2 deficiency suppressed DSS-induced intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and improved mucosal barrier integrity. Furthermore, down-regulation of Sgpp2 attenuated LPS-induced paracellular permeability in cultured cells and enhanced expression of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Finally, in patients with ulcerative colitis, SGPP2 expression was elevated in colitis tissues relative to that in uninvolved tissues. These results indicate that induction of SGPP2 expression contributes to the pathogenesis of colitis by promoting disruption of the mucosal barrier function. SGPP2 may represent a novel therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.-Huang, W.-C., Liang, J., Nagahashi, M., Avni, D., Yamada, A., Maceyka, M., Wolen, A.

https://openalex.org/W2340313171,"Macrophages constitute a first line of pathogen defense by triggering a number of inflammatory responses and the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recently, we and others found that IκBζ, an atypical IκB family member and transcriptional coactivator of selected NF-κB target genes, is essential for macrophage expression of a subset of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12, and CCL2. Despite defective pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, however, IκBζ-deficient mice develop symptoms of chronic inflammation. To elucidate this discrepancy, we analyzed a regulatory role of IκBζ for the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and identified IκBζ as an essential activator of IL-10 expression. LPS-challenged peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from IκBζ-deficient mice revealed strongly decreased transcription and secretion of IL-10 compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, ectopic expression of IκBζ was sufficient to stimulate Il10 transcription. On the molecular level, IκBζ directly activated the Il10 promoter at a proximal κB site and was required for the transcription-enhancing trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4. Together, our findings show for the first time the IκBζ-dependent expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is crucial in controlling immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2343693716,"Accumulation of sterols in endoplasmic reticulum membranes stimulates the ubiquitination of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), which catalyzes a rate-limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol. This ubiquitination marks HMGCR for proteasome-mediated degradation and constitutes one of several mechanisms for feedback control of cholesterol synthesis. Mechanisms for sterol-accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of HMGCR have been elucidated through the study of cultured mammalian cells. However, the extent to which these reactions modulate HMGCR and contribute to control of cholesterol metabolism in whole animals is unknown. Here, we examine transgenic mice expressing in the liver the membrane domain of HMGCR (HMGCR (TM1-8)), a region necessary and sufficient for sterol-accelerated degradation, and knock-in mice in which endogenous HMGCR harbors mutations that prevent sterol-induced ubiquitination. Characterization of transgenic mice revealed that HMGCR (TM1-8) is appropriately regulated in the liver of mice fed a high cholesterol diet or chow diet supplemented with the HMGCR inhibitor lovastatin. Ubiquitination-resistant HMGCR protein accumulates in the liver and other tissues disproportionately to its mRNA, indicating that sterol-accelerated degradation significantly contributes to feedback regulation of HMGCR in vivo Results of these studies demonstrate that HMGCR is subjected to sterol-accelerated degradation in the liver through mechanisms similar to those established in cultured cells. Moreover, these studies designate sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2344492162,"A high rate of aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of malignant transformation. Accumulating evidence suggests that diverse regulatory mechanisms mediate this cancer-associated metabolic change seen in a wide spectrum of cancer. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion protein is found in approximately 3–7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Molecular evidence and therapeutic effectiveness of FDA-approved ALK inhibitors indicated that EML4-ALK is a driving factor of lung tumorigenesis. A recent clinical study showed that NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK rearrangements displayed higher glucose metabolism compared with EML4-ALK-negative NSCLC. In the current work, we presented evidence that EML4-ALK is coupled to overexpression of hexokinase II (HK2), one of the rate-limiting enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. The link from EML4-ALK to HK2 upregulation is essential for a high rate of glycolysis and proliferation of EML4-ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells. We identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) as a key transcription factor to drive HK2 gene expression in normoxia in these cells. EML4-ALK induced hypoxia-independent but glucose-dependent accumulation of HIF1α protein via both transcriptional activation of HIF1α mRNA and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-AKT pathway to enhance HIF1α protein synthesis. The EML4-ALK-mediated upregulation of HIF1α, HK2 and glycolytic metabolism was also highly active in vivo as demonstrated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging of xenografts grown from EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells. Our data reveal a novel EML4-ALK-HIF1α-HK2 cascade to enhance glucose metabolism in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2345994081,"Molecular profiling has led to identification of subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) differing in terms of oncogenic signaling and metabolic programs. The OxPhos-DLBCL subtype is characterized by enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. As increased oxidative metabolism leads to overproduction of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), we sought to identify mechanisms responsible for adaptation of OxPhos cells to these conditions. Herein, we describe a mechanism involving the FOXO1–TXN–p300 redox-dependent circuit protecting OxPhos-DLBCL cells from ROS toxicity. We identify a BCL6-dependent transcriptional mechanism leading to relative TXN overexpression in OxPhos cells. We found that OxPhos cells lacking TXN were uniformly more sensitive to ROS and doxorubicin than control cells. Consistent with this, the overall survival of patients with high TXN mRNA expression, treated with doxorubicin-containing regimens, is significantly shorter than of those with low TXN mRNA expression. TXN overexpression curtails p300-mediated FOXO1 acetylation and its nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress, thus attenuating FOXO1 transcriptional activity toward genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. We also demonstrate that FOXO1 knockdown in cells with silenced TXN expression markedly reduces ROS-induced apoptosis, indicating that FOXO1 is the major sensor and effector of oxidative stress in OxPhos-DLBCLs. These data highlight dynamic, context-dependent modulation of FOXO1 tumor-suppressor functions via acetylation and reveal potentially targetable vulnerabilities in these DLBCLs."
https://openalex.org/W2340839484,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Although the prevailing theory for the sepsis syndrome is a condition of uncontrolled inflammation in response to infection, sepsis is increasingly being recognized as an immunosuppressive state known as endotoxin tolerance. We found sialylation of cell surface was significantly increased on LPS-induced tolerant cells; knockdown of Neu1 in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells resulted in enhanced LPS-induced tolerance, whereas overexpression of Neu1 or treatment with sialidase abrogated LPS-induced tolerance, as defined by measuring TNF-α levels in the culture supernatants. We also found that the expression of Siglec-1 (a member of sialic acid-binding Ig (I)-like lectin family members, the predominant sialic acid-binding proteins on cell surface) was specifically up-regulated in endotoxin tolerant cells and the induction of Siglec-1 suppresses the innate immune response by promoting TGF-β1 production. The enhanced TGF-β1 production by Siglec-1 was significantly attenuated by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor. Knockdown of siglec-1 in RAW 264.7 cells resulted in inhibiting the production of TGF-β1 by ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Syk. Mechanistically, Siglec-1 associates with adaptor protein DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) and transduces a signal to Syk to control the production of TGF-β1 in endotoxin tolerance. Thus, Siglec-1 plays an important role in the development of endotoxin tolerance and targeted manipulation of this process could lead to a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2346106718,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network study of 12 cancer types (PanCancer 12) revealed frequent mutation of TP53, and amplification and expression of related TP63 isoform ΔNp63 in squamous cancers. Further, aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and TP53/p63/p73 targets were detected in the PanCancer 12 project, reminiscent of gene programs comodulated by cREL/ΔNp63/TAp73 transcription factors we uncovered in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). However, how inflammatory gene signatures and cREL/p63/p73 targets are comodulated genome wide is unclear. Here, we examined how the inflammatory factor tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) broadly modulates redistribution of cREL with ΔNp63α/TAp73 complexes and signatures genome wide in the HNSCC model UM-SCC46 using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). TNF-α enhanced genome-wide co-occupancy of cREL with ΔNp63α on TP53/p63 sites, while unexpectedly promoting redistribution of TAp73 from TP53 to activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites. cREL, ΔNp63α and TAp73 binding and oligomerization on NF-κB-, TP53- or AP-1-specific sequences were independently validated by ChIP-qPCR (quantitative PCR), oligonucleotide-binding assays and analytical ultracentrifugation. Function of the binding activity was confirmed using TP53-, AP-1- and NF-κB-specific REs or p21, SERPINE1 and IL-6 promoter luciferase reporter activities. Concurrently, TNF-α regulated a broad gene network with cobinding activities for cREL, ΔNp63α and TAp73 observed upon array profiling and reverse transcription–PCR. Overlapping target gene signatures were observed in squamous cancer subsets and in inflamed skin of transgenic mice overexpressing ΔNp63α. Furthermore, multiple target genes identified in this study were linked to TP63 and TP73 activity and increased gene expression in large squamous cancer samples from PanCancer 12 TCGA by CircleMap. PARADIGM inferred pathway analysis revealed the network connection of TP63 and NF-κB complexes through an AP-1 hub, further supporting our findings. Thus, inflammatory cytokine TNF-α mediates genome-wide redistribution of the cREL/p63/p73, and AP-1 interactome, to diminish TAp73 tumor suppressor function and reciprocally activate NF-κB and AP-1 gene programs implicated in malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2345306791,"Epidemiological studies showed that obesity and its related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. We aimed to uncover the genetic alterations of NAFLD-HCC using whole-exome sequencing. We compared HCC development in genetically obese mice and dietary obese mice with wild-type lean mice fed a normal chow after treatment with diethylnitrosamine. HCC tumor and adjacent normal samples from obese and lean mice were then subjected to whole-exome sequencing. Functional and mechanistic importance of the identified mutations in Carboxyl ester lipase (Cel) gene and Harvey rat sarcoma virus oncogene 1 (Hras) was further elucidated. We demonstrated significantly higher incidences of HCC in both genetic and dietary obese mice with NAFLD development as compared with lean mice without NAFLD. The mutational signatures of NAFLD-HCC and lean HCC were distinct, with <3% overlapped. Eight metabolic or oncogenic pathways were found to be significantly enriched by mutated genes in NAFLD-HCC, but only two of these pathways were dysregulated by mutations in lean HCC. In particular, Cel was mutated significantly more frequently in NAFLD-HCC than in lean HCC. The multiple-site mutations in Cel are loss-of-function mutations, with effects similar to Cel knock-down. Mutant Cel caused accumulation of cholesteryl ester in liver cells, which led to induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and consequently activated the IRE1α/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun/activating protein-1 (AP-1) signaling cascade to promote liver cell growth. In addition, single-site mutations in Hras at codon 61 were found in NAFLD-HCC but none in lean HCC. The gain-of-function mutations in Hras (Q61R and Q61K) significantly promoted liver cell growth through activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt pathways. In conclusion, we have identified mutation signature and pathways in NAFLD-associated HCC. Mutations in Cel and Hras have important roles in NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2347181220,"During the course of cancer progression, neoplastic cells undergo dynamic and reversible transitions between multiple phenotypic states, and this plasticity is enabled by underlying shifts in epigenetic regulation. Our results identified a negative feedback loop in which SET9 controls DNA methyltransferase-1 protein stability, which represses the transcriptional activity of the SET9 promoter in coordination with Snail. The modulation of SET9 expression in breast cancer cells revealed a connection with E2F1 and the silencing of SET9 was sufficient to complete an epigenetic program that favored epithelial–mesenchymal transition and the generation of cancer stem cells, indicating that SET9 plays a role in modulating breast cancer metastasis. SET9 expression levels were significantly higher in samples from patients with pathological complete remission than in samples from patients with disease recurrence, which indicates that SET9 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and that its expression may serve as a prognostic marker for malignancy."

We investigated the role of TyrB26, a conserved aromatic residue at this interface. To probe the evolutionary basis for such conservation, we constructed 18 variants at B26. Surprisingly, non-aromatic polar or charged side chains (such as Glu, Ser, or ornithine (Orn)) conferred high activity, whereas the weakest-binding analogs contained Val, Ile, and Leu substitutions. Modeling of variant complexes suggested that the B26 side chains pack within a shallow depression at the solvent-exposed periphery of the interface. This interface would disfavor large aliphatic side chains. The analogs with highest activity exhibited reduced thermodynamic stability and heightened susceptibility to fibrillation. Perturbed self-assembly was also demonstrated in studies of the charged variants (Orn and Glu); indeed, the GluB26 analog exhibited aberrant aggregation in either the presence or absence of zinc ions. Thus, although TyrB26 is part of insulin's receptor-binding surface, our results suggest that its conservation has been enjoined by the aromatic ring's contributions to native stability and self-assembly.

Finally, the TFIIH Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase Kin28/Cdk7 is required in vivo for an early step in transcription initiation (29Wong K.H. Jin Y. Struhl K.

Although there is good evidence that yeast TSS scanning requires Ssl2 function, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether Pol II RNA synthesis also contributes to scanning. Utilizing an in vitro transcription system with the yeast ADH1 promoter fused to a G-less cassette, Khaperskyy et al. (32Khaperskyy D.A. Ammerman M.L. Majovski R.C. Ponticelli A.S. Functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIIF during transcription start site utilization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that transcription initiated normally without added GTP. Because five guanine residues are located in the ADH1 non-template strand between the presumed PIC location and the TSS, this result showed that continuous RNA synthesis is not required for Pol II to transverse the scanned DNA. However, because of the spacing of guanine residues in this region, short RNAs of 15–17 bases could theoretically have been made and contributed to scanning. Other evidence suggests that Pol II and/or basal factors influence either scanning or TSS recognition. First, many mutations have been identified in basal transcription factors that alter yeast TSS location (10Hahn S. Young E.T. Transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: transcription factor regulation and function, mechanisms of initiation, and roles of activators and coactivators.Genetics. 2011; 189: 705-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Hampsey M. Molecular genetics of the RNA polymerase II general transcriptional machinery.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include mutations in TFIIB, TFIIF, and the Ssl2 translocase (24Goel S. Krishnamurthy S. Hampsey M. Mechanism of start site selection by RNA polymerase II: interplay between TFIIB and Ssl2/XPB helicase subunit of TFIIH.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutations that alter TSS usage have also been identified within Pol II. For example, Kaplan et al. (34Kaplan C.D. Jin H. Zhang I.L. Belyanin A. Dissection of Pol II trigger loop function and Pol II activity-dependent control of start site selection in vivo.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that Pol II mutations affecting elongation kinetics can alter the TSS in vivo. One possible explanation for these results is that RNA synthesis by Pol II contributes to the scanning and/or TSS selection process. To examine the involvement of Pol II RNA synthesis in the scanning process, we devised a system where transcripts of no longer than 2 bases could be synthesized within a scanned promoter region. Although we found that transcription initiated normally under these conditions, eliminating a required role for Pol II RNA synthesis in scanning, we surprisingly found that yeast transcription initiated in the absence of hydrolyzable ATP or dATP. From the series of experiments presented here, we conclude that the yeast system does not have a strict requirement for ATP/dATP and that other NTPs can fulfill the energy requirement for DNA opening and TSS scanning. Finally, our results point to a role for Pol II transcription in TSS selection. Triplex templates and disruption reactions were performed as described previously (21Fishburn J. Tomko E. Galburt E. Hahn S. Double-stranded DNA translocase activity of transcription factor TFIIH and the mechanism of RNA polymerase II open complex formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 30 fmol of holo-TFIIH (Rad3-E236Q) was added to 10-μl reactions containing 30 fmol of triplex DNA and allowed to bind for 10–30 min at room temperature. NTPs were added to 400 μm each unless otherwise indicated, and reactions were incubated for 1–15 min or 4 h at 26 °C degrees. Reactions were stopped with 3 μl 5× GSMB (15% glucose, 3% SDS, 250 mm MOPS (pH 5.5), and 0.04% bromphenol blue) and analyzed on 10% acrylamide gels in TAM buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 5.5), 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm magnesium chloride). The gels were dried, and products were visualized using by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Because the displaced oligonucleotide showed a tendency to stick to the sides of the reaction tubes, we found that the most reliable method of quantitation was comparing the amount starting triplex with that remaining after incubation with TFIIH and NTP(s). The DNA-dependent GTPase activity of TFIIH (Rad3-E236Q) was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Innova, 601-0120). Reactions were carried out as described previously for ATPase function (21Fishburn J. Tomko E. Galburt E. Hahn S.

After 30 min at room temperature, purified GTP (Innova, 602-9999) was added to 0.5 mm, and reactions were incubated for 20 min at 26 °C. Pi-lock Gold Mix was added to stop reactions and chased with stabilizer, and absorbance at 635 nm was measured after 30 min at room temperature. Standard curves were established using the included phosphate standard and used to determine GTPase activity. These values were plotted against DNA concentration and fit with the Michaelis-Menten expression to determine Vmax and Km. Reactions were performed as described previously (12Fishburn J. Hahn S.

Reactions also contained 0.03 units of creatine phosphokinase and 38 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma, P7936) or 38 mm creatine (Sigma, C0780) as indicated. Purified factors and DNA were mixed to form preinitiation complexes for 30 min at room temperature. Transcription was initiated by adding nucleoside triphosphates (GE Healthcare, 27202501) to ∼400 μm each and, where indicated, the dinucleotide primer GpA (Dharmacon) to ∼200 μm. After 30 min at room temperature, reactions were stopped or supplemented with 1 mm calcium chloride and treated with 1 unit RQ1 DNase (Promega, M6101) for 15 min at 37 °C degrees to eliminate the promoter DNA. Primer extension was performed as described using fluorescent or 32P-labeled lacI or 32P-labeled transcript-specific primers for the A-less and G + A-less transcripts. ATPγS and AMP-PNP were from Roche. As a first step in testing the contribution of RNA synthesis during yeast Pol II scanning and TSS selection, we modified the yeast HIS4 promoter so that the transcript lacked adenine (Fig. 1A). In vitro transcription from wild-type HIS4 primarily initiates 63 bp downstream from the beginning of the TATA and at several other downstream positions (12Fishburn J. Hahn S. Architecture of the yeast RNA polymerase II open complex and regulation of activity by TFIIF.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A small fraction of the total initiation begins 34 bp downstream from TATA, in a position analogous to where metazoan Pol II initiates with respect to the PIC (11Murakami K. Mattei P.-J. Davis R.E. Jin H. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Uncoupling promoter opening from start-site scanning.Mol. Cell. 2015; 59: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To generate the A-less HIS4 transcript, we changed the base at the primary upstream initiation site from adenine to guanine (Fig. 1A, +1) because yeast Pol II strongly prefers to initiate with a purine. We replaced other adenine residues in the transcribed region with thymines. In this modified promoter, there are 10 adenine residues located between the metazoan TSS position (−29) and the most upstream HIS4 TSS (+1) with five continuous adenine residues in one segment. The longest RNA that could be produced in the scanned region in the absence of ATP is 10 residues. Fig. 1B shows a primer extension assay of in vitro transcription products from wild-type and A-less HIS4 using purified and recombinant yeast basal factors and Pol II. As expected, transcription from WT HIS4 requires the basal factors TBP and TFIIH and all four NTPs (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5). Synthesis of the A-less transcript also required TBP and TFIIH (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8), and it was efficiently transcribed with 400 μm of the Pol II substrates GTP, CTP, and UTP (Fig. 1B, lane 9). In this reaction, 400 μm dATP was included to fulfill the expected requirement for Ssl2 function. Surprisingly, transcription was reduced by only 20% when dATP was omitted (Fig. 1B, lane 10). Combined, the results agree with an earlier study that continuous transcription is not required for TSS scanning (32Khaperskyy D.A. Ammerman M.L. Majovski R.C. Ponticelli A.S. Functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIIF during transcription start site utilization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, transcription in the yeast system displays an unexpected independence from ATP/dATP. One possible explanation for the lack of a strong ATP requirement might be the absence of a requirement for Ssl2 function in our transcription system. In contrast to this model, a transcription reaction containing TFIIH with the Ssl2 ATPase mutation E489Q shows no detectable HIS4 transcription (Fig. 2). Because transcription of the A-less cassette is only slightly less efficient when ATP/dATP is omitted, our combined results suggest that NTPs other than ATP can promote Ssl2 activity. However, another possible explanation for the apparent ATP independence of transcription is that our NTPs are contaminated with ATP. Our experiments use commercial preparations of NTPs that are >99.5% pure (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a test of ATP contamination, we added 0.4 μm ATP (0.1% final) to transcription reactions to determine whether this altered the transcription pattern (Fig. 3). We found that addition of this trace amount of ATP, and the dinucleotide GpA, promoted robust transcription initiation from the metazoan TSS position (−29 in Fig. 3, lane 3). The longer RNA contains nine adenines in the first 30 nucleotides of the transcript. Depleting the added ATP by addition of creatine and creatine phosphokinase significantly reduced the synthesis of this long transcript (Fig. 3, lane 4). Because the combination of CTP, UTP, and GTP does not promote the synthesis of this long transcript, we conclude that the ATP independence of yeast transcription is not due to contaminating ATP. DNA helicases have been observed to utilize non-adenosine NTPs as substrates but with reduced processivity compared with ATP (35Zhou X. Zolotukhin I. Im D.S. Muzyczka N.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA helicases.FEBS J. 2004; 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04093.xGoogle Scholar). As a test of whether TFIIH/Ssl2 can hydrolyze alternative NTPs, we examined its GTPase activity. These assays used purified yeast TFIIH containing a mutation that eliminates the ATPase function of the DNA helicase subunit RAD3 (21Fishburn J. Tomko E. Galburt E. Hahn S. Double-stranded DNA translocase activity of transcription factor TFIIH and the mechanism of RNA polymerase II open complex formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and measured phosphate released upon GTP hydrolysis. CTP and UTP hydrolysis could not be measured by this assay using commercially available nucleotides because they contain levels of phosphate that obscure phosphate release from NTP hydrolysis. We found that TFIIH/Ssl2 can hydrolyze highly purified GTP in a dsDNA-dependent manner (Fig. 4). GTPase activity was completely dependent on added DNA, with a short 60-bp DNA substrate promoting a 12% lower Vmax of GTP hydrolysis compared with plasmid DNA. Although these results show that GTP is a substrate for Ssl2, the Vmax of hydrolysis is 5.6-fold lower compared with ATP hydrolysis using the 60-bp DNA substrate. Furthermore, the Km for GTP is 2.5-fold higher compared with ATP using the 60-bp DNA substrate. We next assayed whether GTP, CTP, or UTP can promote displacement of a triple-stranded oligonucleotide by TFIIH, which we showed previously is a measure of TFIIH/Ssl2 DNA translocation (21Fishburn J. Tomko E. Galburt E. Hahn S. Double-stranded DNA translocase activity of transcription factor TFIIH and the mechanism of RNA polymerase II open complex formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In these assays, we utilized individual or combinations of NTPs at 400 μm, the levels added to our standard in vitro transcription reactions. Disruption was quantitated by comparing the amount of triplex with or without NTP addition. We found that measurement of triplex remaining after TFIIH and NTP addition, rather than the amount of displaced oligonucleotide, was more reproducible (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with earlier results, we found that, in the presence of TFIIH, either 400 μm ATP or a combination of all four NTPs promote 98% displacement of the 22 base triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) (Fig. 5A, lanes 6, 7, and 10). The combination of GTP, CTP, and UTP promoted 17% TFO displacement (Fig. 5B, lane 11). When individual NTPs were tested, UTP promoted 16% TFO displacement, whereas GTP and CTP had minimal effects. Increasing the concentration of UTP 3-fold led to 41% TFO displacement. (Fig 5A, lanes 12–15). Because GTP can be hydrolyzed by Ssl2 in a DNA-dependent manner (Fig. 4), it was surprising that GTP had little or no activity in the TFO displacement assay. However, it seems probable that TFO displacement requires higher Ssl2 processivity compared with translocation on double-stranded DNA, and this may account for the differences in the two assays. Together, our results show that GTP and UTP can both be utilized as Ssl2 substrates but with lower efficiency compared with ATP. Transcription in the mammalian system is inhibited by the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS. This nucleotide was presumed to function as an inhibitor of the Ssl2/XPB translocase because it rapidly reverses open complex formation (6Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.

Under the conditions of the assay, a combination of all four NTPs results in 86% displacement of the TFO within 15 min, and substitution of ATPγS for ATP blocks this reaction (Fig. 6A, lanes 5–9). Furthermore, ATPγS added at 1/3 or 1/9 the concentration of ATP inhibits TFO displacement, with the 1/9 and 1/3 ratios resulting in 55% and 46% displacement after 15 min (Fig. 6A, lanes 10–15). When ATPγS was added to transcription reactions, we found that a single round of transcription from HIS4 was inhibited ∼2-fold at the 1/3 ATPγS/ATP ratio and multiround transcription inhibited <12% (Fig. 7). Although Ssl2 function is clearly essential for transcription (Fig. 2), these results show that Ssl2 activity can be significantly r"

The cysteine-rich domain of sFRP2 is sufficient for Ror2 activation, and related sFRPs can substitute for this function.

IL-6 is a cytokine that was discovered in the 1980s and is produced by several types of cells from the innate immune system, as well as by other cells including those from several types of cancer (1Hirano T. Interleukin 6 and its receptor: ten years later.Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). IL-6 is activated by tissue damage and stress, and elevated IL-6 concentrations contribute to several inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In addition to its role in inflammation, IL-6 is involved in numerous cellular processes and associated diseases including cardial infarction, renal disease, cognitive dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and cancer, to name just a few. It is therefore no surprise that IL-6 and its receptor should be actively investigated as potential drug targets in a number of contexts. IL-6 signaling is transmitted through gp130 (2Hibi M.

Communication between IL-6 and gp130 occurs through the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R, also called gp80) (5Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T.

The extracellular domains of IL-6R and gp130 associate with IL-6 to form a ring-shaped hexameric complex with 2:2:2 stoichiometry. Although gp130 is present on a plethora of cell types (6Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Interleukin-6 and its receptor: a paradigm for cytokines.Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), IL-6R expression is limited to innate immune cells. Cells that do not express IL-6R can still be regulated by IL-6 through a so-called “trans signaling” mechanism (7Jones S.A. Rose-John S.

The crystals of the IL-6·61H7 complex contain one IL-6·Fab complex per asymmetric unit with a Vm value of 2.36 Å3/Da, which corresponds to a solvent content of 48%. A diffraction quality crystal of complex IL-6·68F2 was obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 277 K after 9 months in 25% PEG 4K, 0.15 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5. Crystal for data collection was transferred to mother liquor with 10% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected up to 2.9 Å resolution at 100 K on Beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Research Facilities Synchrotron (Grenoble, France), using an ADSC Quantum 4 detector. Data were processed with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (24Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of IL-6 in complex with Fabs 61H7 or 68F2 was determined by molecular replacement with Fab structures and the IL-6 structure using MolRep (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Refinement of the complexes was performed with auto BUSTER (26Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G.

Open table in a new tab Competition ELISA was performed as follows: non-neutralizing IL-6R antibody (BN12; Diaclone) was immobilized on Maxisorp plate at a concentration of 1 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Then 0.1 μg/ml of IL-6R (R&D Systems) was incubated 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated human IL-6 (0.025 μg/ml) alone or in combination with a concentration series of antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, biot-IL-6 bound to the IL-6R was detected with Strep-HRP. After addition of TMB and H2SO4 to stop the reaction, optical density was read at 450 nm. IL-6 was biotinylated using the Pierce kit with the modification that the biotinylation reaction was performed at pH 5.5 to only biotinylate the N terminus of IL-6. Antibody competition with biot-IL-6 for IL-6R binding was expressed as a percentage of biot-IL-6 binding as compared with biot-IL-6 alone using GraphPad Prism v6. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Biacore 3000) was used for competition experiments on a low density IL-6 coating (∼75–100 resonance units). mAb 61H7 was first injected at 50 μg/ml with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. A second antibody (50 μg/ml of 61H7 or 68F2) was added using COINJECT procedure at the same flow rate to investigate competition for binding to coupled IL-6. Mutations in HCDR3 were generated by overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pCB4-111A7 (containing the variable domains of 61H7 with few mutations in the framework to improve human identity without affecting affinity and fused to the human constant domain CH1 and Cλ) as template (50 ng) and PhusionTM DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, the DNA fragment containing frameworks 1–3 was generated using primers PelB3 (GCGCCAATTCTATTTCAAGG) and VH_W98X (5′ACCTGCACGATTTGCACAATAATAAACTGCGGTG 3′). The DNA fragment containing CDR3-FR4-CH1 product was generated with two different degenerated sense primers, one with a leucine at position 100 (VH_W98XL100, 5′-GTGCAAATCGTGCAGGTNNKGGTCTGGGTGATTATTGGGGACAGGGG-3′) and one with alanine at position 100 (VH_W98XA100, 5′-GTGCAAATCGTGCAGGTNNKGGTGCGGGTGATTATTGGGGACAGGGG-3′) and M13 (GCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGA) as antisense primer. The products were purified separately and combined for the final overlapping PCR using primers PelB3 and M13. The PCR amplicons were gel-extracted and cloned back into pCB4 Fab expression vector (phagemid devoid of pIII) containing the light chain of 111A7 and finally transformed into TG1 Escherichia coli cells. After HCDR3 mutagenesis, single bacterial clones were grown at 37 °C (while shaking at 180 rpm) in 2TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 96 deep well plates (Nunc). When optical density at 600 nm reached between 0.8 and 1.0, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce Fab expression in the bacterial periplasm. After overnight growth of the cells at 28 °C, periplasmic contents were extracted by a cycle of freezing (overnight, at −20 °C) and thawing in 100 μl of PBS (at 4 °C) causing cell lysis. After 1 h shaking at room temperature, the cells were pelleted again, and the PBS supernatant containing the periplasmic extract (containing the mutant Fabs) was used to determine the off rate (koff) by SPR, whereas the clones are sequenced. SPR was performed using a Biacore 3000 and low density IL-6 coating (∼75–100 resonance units) on a CM5-Chip (GE Healthcare) to determine the koff of Fab mutants produced in periplasmic fractions as previously described (22Klarenbeek A.

Affinity measurements of mAbs 61H7 and 68F2 were performed using a Biacore T200 and are described in supplemental Fig. S1. The proliferation assay using 7TD1 or B9 cells was performed as previously described (22Klarenbeek A. Blanchetot C. Schragel G. Sadi A.S. Ongenae N. Hemrika W. Wijdenes J. Spinelli S. Desmyter A.

From the amplified antibody repertoire of two llamas immunized with human IL-6, two leads with differing HCDR3 sequences were selected and their affinities further optimized by heavy chain and light chain shuffling. The two resulting mAbs and their Fabs will be further referred to as 61H7 and 68F2. For 61H7, heavy chain shuffling delivered a variant VH with identical HCDR3 sequence, hence derived from a common B cell clone, but with somatic mutations in HCDR1 and HCDR2, resulting in a potency of 3.5 and 1.7 pm as measured by blockade of IL-6-driven proliferation of 7TD1 and B9 cells, respectively (Table 1). Light chain shuffling of 68F2 yielded a variant λ light chain with identical LCDR3 sequence but with mutations in LCDR1 and LCDR2; the lead reformatted into human IgG1 turned out to have a potency as high as 60 and 70 fm as measured in the B9 and 7TD1 cell line based assays, respectively (Table 1). The affinity (KD) to IL-6 was estimated to be 63 pm for 61H7 and 21 pm for 68F2 as measured with SPR, although this could be underestimated because of the sensitivity limit of the machine (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). To better understand the very high affinity of the two antibodies the crystal structures of human IL-6 in complex with 61H7 and 68F2 were determined at 2.4 and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures were refined to low R values and good stereochemistry. In each case, the asymmetric unit contains a single Fab·IL-6 complex with 1:1 stoichiometry (Table 2 and Fig. 1). In both cases, a large interaction surface is observed involving both VH and VL chains. For the complex of IL-6 with 61H7, 940 Å2 of the Fab is buried, 60% of which concerns VH and 40% VL. The interactions are limited to the CDR1 and CDR3 of the light chain and the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of the heavy chain. In the complex with 68F2, VH (50%) and VL (50%) contribute equally to the large interaction surface (1156 Å2). Analogous to the 61H7·IL-6 complex, only the light chain CDR2 loop is not directly involved in the interaction. The full set of interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) observed between antibody and antigen are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2.TABLE 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics of structures of complexes of IL-6 with 61H7 and 68F2IL-6–61H7IL-6–68F2Data collection Protein Data Bank code4O9H4ZS7 BeamlineProxima 1 (SOLEIL)European Synchrotron Research Facilities Synchrotron ID14-4 Space group/cell dimensionsC2/a = 108 2 Å, b = 47.5 Å, c = 148.3 Å, β = 97°P2/a = 46.5 Å, b = 92.9 Å, c = 84.6 Å, β = 103.9° Resolution limits (Å)aParentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.45.0–2.36 (2.42–2.36)45.0–2.93 (3.0–2.93) Rmerge (%)aParentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.16.0 (65.0)18.0 (87) No. of observationsaParentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.116,261 (14,546)95,495 (5067) No. unique reflectionsaParentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.31,185 (2201)14,778 (969) Mean ((I)/S.D.

Discovery and characterization of olokizumab: A humanized antibody targeting interleukin-6 and neutralizing gp130-signaling.MAbs. 2014; 6: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), for all three antibodies the heavy chain contributes approximately the same amount of binding surface (∼590 Å2 for 68F2 and 61H7, 520 Å2 for olokizumab) but differ mostly in their amount of light chain binding surface (580 Å2 for 68F2 compared with 320 Å2 for olokizumab). Olokizumab also shows a significantly larger portion of hydrophobic contact surface (56%) compared with 68F2 and 61H7 (38 and 40%, respectively) and even IL-6R (46%). The structures of IL-6 as present in both Fab complexes were compared with the structures of IL-6 in its free state and bound to IL-6R and gp130 (29Somers W. Stahl M.

Fab binding does not disturb the four-helix bundle motif that is the core of the IL-6 fold (Fig. 2). Superposition of apo IL-6 (Protein Data Bank code 1ALU) with the cytokine from the IL-6·61H7 complex shows a very close agreement (RMSD 0.54 Å for all Cα atoms). This conformation is distinct from the one observed in the receptor complex (Protein Data Bank code 1P9M), where the RMSD is increased to 1.2 Å. Two loops differ in conformation. The first one, covering residues Asn48–Asn61, is a long loop that is unstructured in the apo IL-6 and in the IL-6·61H7 complex. This loop is stabilized in the IL-6·IL-6R structure by the binding of IL-6R. The second loop that differs in conformation is the loop that connects the mini helix to the helix α3 (Asn132–Pro141). The conformation of IL-6 in complex with 68F2 on the other hand is more deviant, with RMSD values ranging from 1.2 Å (IL-6 in the 61H7 complex) to >1.4 Å (apo IL-6) to >2.0 Å (complex with IL-6 and gp130). These differences result from a different orientation of residues 140–152, corresponding to the mini helix (Fig. 2). The latter rotates by roughly 25° around its N terminus. This movement is, however, not likely caused by the interaction with 68F2 because it is located on the opposite side of IL-6. Rather, because both loops on the N- and C-terminal sides of the mini helix lack density, the rearrangement may be due to loop cleavage. In the ternary complex between IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 (Protein Data Bank code 1P9M), there are three interaction interfaces involving IL-6 (30Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C.

They are termed sites I, II, and III, where site I corresponds to the interface between IL-6 and the D2 and D3 domains of IL-6R. It is worthwhile to mention that our antibodies were screened for their capability to block the interaction between IL-6 and IL-6R in an ELISA-based assay. Competition ELISA data show that both antibodies compete with IL-6 for IL-6R binding (Fig. 3A) and in an SPR-based assay with each other (Fig. 3B). Indeed, upon superposition of th"

Both receptors are predominantly expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, and an increase in extracellular ATP concentration under pathological conditions, such as tissue damage or visceral distension, induces channel opening, membrane depolarization, and initiation of pain signaling. Hence, these receptors are considered important therapeutic targets for pain management, and development of selective antagonists is currently progressing. To advance the search for novel analgesics, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against human P2X3 (hP2X3). We have found that these antibodies produce distinct functional effects, depending on the homomeric or heteromeric composition of the target, its kinetic state, and the duration of antibody exposure. The most potent antibody, 12D4, showed an estimated IC50 of 16 nm on hP2X3 after short term exposure (up to 18 min), binding to the inactivated state of the channel to inhibit activity. By contrast, with the same short term application, 12D4 potentiated the slow inactivating current mediated by the heteromeric hP2X2/3 channel. Extending the duration of exposure to ∼20 h resulted in a profound inhibition of both homomeric hP2X3 and heteromeric hP2X2/3 receptors, an effect mediated by efficient antibody-induced internalization of the channel from the plasma membrane. The therapeutic potential of mAb12D4 was assessed in the formalin, complete Freund's adjuvant, and visceral pain models. The efficacy of 12D4 in the visceral hypersensitivity model indicates that antibodies against P2X3 may have therapeutic potential in visceral pain indications.

Extracellular ATP and its metabolites bind and activate their cognate cell membrane receptors, namely the P1 and P2 purinergic receptors. In mammalian cells, seven different subunits (P2X1–7) have been found to compose the family of ATP-gated cation channel receptor subtypes, which play important roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes (1Burnstock G. Purinergic signalling: from discovery to current developments.Exp. Physiol. 2014; 99: 16-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2North R.A. P2X purinoceptor plethora.Semin. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 187-195Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Each P2X receptor is an oligomer assembled as either a homo- or a heterotrimer (3Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Coexpression of P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits can account for ATP-gated currents in sensory neurons.Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Individual subunits surround a central cation pore, and each is composed of two transmembrane spanning segments (TM1 and TM2) connected by a large extracellular domain (∼300 amino acid residues) containing 10 conserved cysteine residues (4Jiang L.H. Kim M. Spelta V. Bo X. Surprenant A. North R.A. Subunit arrangement in P2X receptors.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8903-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two reported crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X4 ion channel, one in its apo-state (5Kawate T. Michel J.C. Birdsong W.T. Gouaux E.

Molecular mechanism of ATP binding and ion channel activation in P2X receptors.Nature. 2012; 485: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), fully elucidate the trimeric structure of the channel and the topology of the individual subunits. Functional P2X receptors are widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and tissues of almost all main organs in the body (7Burnstock G. Knight G.E. Cellular distribution and functions of P2 receptor subtypes in different systems.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 240: 31-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). ATP-gated receptors are implicated in both transient signaling, such as intercellular communications, and long lasting signaling, such as cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. P2X-mediated neurotransmission and neuromodulation are well established in different regions of the peripheral and central nervous system. ATP signaling is involved in neuron to neuron, neuron to glia, and neuron to muscle cell interactions (8Jarvis M.F. Khakh B.S. ATP-gated P2X cation-channels.Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a crucial role of P2X receptors in the pathophysiology of visceral pain (9Burnstock G. Purinergic mechanisms and pain: an update.Eur. J.

In particular, the P2X3 and P2X2/3 subtypes of ATP-gated ion channels are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in nociception due to their predominant expression in sensory neurons (15Chen C.C.

Developments and challenges for mAb-based therapeutics.Antibodies. 2013; 2: 452-500Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), are increasingly utilized as therapeutics for the treatment of multiple diseases. Although a function modifying monoclonal antibody against the human P2X7 receptor was successfully generated several years ago by cell immunization (27Buell G. Chessell I.P. Michel A.D. Collo G. Salazzo M. Herren S. Gretener D. Grahames C. Kaur R. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Humphrey P.P. Blockade of human P2X7 receptor function with a monoclonal antibody.Blood. 1998; 92: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), obtaining modulatory antibodies against multispanning membrane proteins like ion channels is regarded as particularly challenging. Therefore, to increase the chance of obtaining antibodies that recognize the native P2X3 receptor, we utilized recombinantly expressed P2X3 purified in its native conformation in the presence of detergents as immunogen to raise antibodies by standard hybridoma technology. Using this approach, we generated, to our knowledge for the first time, monoclonal antibodies that potently impact the functional activity of P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors. We have extensively analyzed the mechanism of action of the mAbs and have tested their therapeutic activity in vivo. hP2X3 3The abbreviations used are: hP2X3 and hP2X2human P2X3 and P2X2, respectivelyDRGdorsal root ganglionαβ-meATPαβ-methylene ATPTNBS2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acidCFAcomplete Freund's adjuvantAbantibody. with an N-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into the pACMV-tetO vector with expression under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Stably transfected HEK293S GnTI cells (28Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Structure and function in rhodopsin: high-level expression of rhodopsin with restricted and homogeneous N-glycosylation by a tetracycline-inducible N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S stable mammalian cell line.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) were generated by selecting for successful integration of the neo gene using the selection agent Geneticin. Stably transfected hP2X3 HEK293S GnTI cells were grown in DMEM (without calcium salts) in a 10-liter wave bag, and hP2X3 expression was induced by the addition of 5 mg/liter sodium pantothenate and 2 mg/liter doxycycline. Cells were harvested by centrifugation ∼30 h after induction. Cells resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, PMSF, Roche protease inhibitors, 10 mm EDTA) were lysed using a microfluidizer. Lysed cells were first spun at low speed (5,000 × g) to remove cellular debris, followed by a high speed centrifugation step (45,000 × g) to isolate membranes. Membranes were homogenized and solubilized for 1 h in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, or Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% β-dodecylmaltoside, 0.01% cholesterol hemisuccinate, PMSF, and Roche protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by an additional high speed spin (200,000 × g). hP2X3 protein was allowed to bind to FLAG resin (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C; washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% β-dodecylmaltoside, 0.01% cholesterol hemisuccinate (wash buffer); and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). As a final step, hP2X3 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 10/300 Superdex200 (GE Healthcare) column in wash buffer. Fractions corresponding to the hP2X3 trimer (∼150 kDa) were collected and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. human P2X3 and P2X2, respectively dorsal root ganglion αβ-methylene ATP 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid complete Freund's adjuvant antibody. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated by standard hybridoma technology using BALB/c mice immunized with the purified recombinant hP2X3 described above. Gerbu Adjuvant MM#3001 was used following the manufacturer's instructions (Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany), and the myeloma cell line P3 × 63Ag8.653 was used as a fusion partner for splenocytes. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally and subcutaneously on days 0, 6, 14, 22, 28, and 42. On day 49, the mice were given a prefusion boost without the Gerbu adjuvant, and then the splenocytes were fused 4 days later on day 53. P2X-mediated currents were recorded using either an automated patch clamp system QPatch HT, (Sophion, Biolin Scientific, Denmark) or a conventional patch clamp set-up employing an EPC 10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronik Dr. Schulze GmbH, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Both single-hole and 10-hole QPlates with an integrated 250-μl waste container (QPlate 48L or 48X) were used, enabling washes and application of multiple concentrations/compounds per well. Compounds were added to the cells with the eight pipettes via the QPlate integrated glass microfluidic pathways. Usually, 5 μl of ligand was added for 3 s, followed by washout (six times with 5 μl of saline). Test compounds were typically preincubated for 345 s before the addition of agonist. The ligand induced currents were acquired at 5 kHz for 5 s. During whole-cell recording, the membrane potential was held at −90 mV. The extracellular recording solution contained 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm sucrose, adjusted to pH 7.4. The intracellular solution contained 130 mm CsF, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na2ATP, and 0.1 mm Tris-GTP, adjusted to pH 7.2. All QPatch data were analyzed using Sophion's QPatch Assay software. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done in Excel with a two-sample t test assuming equal variances. Manual whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from both stably transfected cells and primary neurons. Coverslips carrying cells were placed in a recording chamber and were constantly perfused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, 320 mosmol). Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished to 3–10-megaohm tip resistance. The internal pipette solution (ATP-regenerating solution, pH 7.3, 300 mosmol) consisted of 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 15.5 mm phosphocreatine, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm BAPTA tetrapotassium salt, and 10 mm HEPES. All recordings were made at room temperature (22–24 °C) using an EPC 10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronik Dr. Schulze GmbH). Cells were voltage-clamped at −90 mV, and control test responses were routinely recorded for a minimum of 10 min to ensure that the amplitude and kinetics of the response were stable. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Pulse-PulseFit (HEKA Electronik Dr. Schulze GmbH) and IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR). Agonists were applied to individual cells using a laboratory-built piezoelectrically driven rapid application system. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The human glial cell line 1321N1 stably expressing recombinant human or rat P2X3 receptors (Pfizer GR&D, Primary Pharmacology Group, Sandwich, UK) were grown in DMEM (catalog no. 10-01-CM, Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 10% FBS (JR Scientific, Inc., Woodland, CA), 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Mediatech) in 75-cm2 Falcon culture flasks in an incubator at 37 °C and 6% CO2 with saturating humidity. For recordings, the cells were dissociated with enzymatic detachment solution Detachin (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) and resuspended in serum-free medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). HEK293 cells transiently expressing human P2X2/3 or human P2X4 receptors (EZCellsTM TT) were purchased from ChanTest (ChanTest Corp., Cleveland OH). Cryopreserved cells were thawed rapidly and transferred to 75-cm2 Falcon culture flasks containing growth medium, consisting of DMEM (catalog no. 10-01-CM, Mediatech), 10% FBS (JR Scientific), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech). The cells were kept in an incubator at 37 °C and 6% CO2 with saturating humidity and used for electrophysiological recordings after 2–3 days of culturing. Lumbar DRG (L1–L5) were quickly removed following decapitation of CO2 anesthetized adult rats. After isolation, ganglia were desheathed and then enzymatically digested in a two-step procedure: 20-min incubation with collagenase A (1 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C (catalog no. 14025, Gibco) and 15-min incubation with collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics) and papain (30 units/ml; Worthington) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker. Pooled ganglia were transferred to DRG culturing medium containing DMEM/F-12 (Mediatech), 10% FBS (JR Scientific), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech) and were gently triturated with the use of Pasteur pipettes, fire-polished to progressively smaller openings. Dissociated neurons were plated on precoated coverslips (poly-d-lysine/laminin; Corning), flooded with DRG medium, and incubated at 29 °C in a humidified 5.5% CO2 incubator. The cells were used for electrophysiological recordings within 1–2 days in vitro. P2X3/1321N1-expressing cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in black wall, clear bottom 96-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (Costar, Fisher) and grown overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The mAbs were diluted in Calcium3 dye at 2× concentration, (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and then added to the cells for a final antibody concentration of 1 μm and a final concentration of Calcium3 dye of 1×. The mAbs were incubated with the cells and Calcium3 dye for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 15 min at room temperature. Calcium flux was stimulated by the addition of 10 μm αβ-meATP (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) and recorded using a FlexStation II 384 platform (Molecular Devices) with the following settings: excitation wavelength = 485 nm, emission wavelength = 538 nm, cut-off = 515 nm, and a 100-s run time measured with 2-s intervals. Cells were harvested using Free Cell Dissociation Solution, Hanks-based (Chemicon, EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA), spun down at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and washed once with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS (Mediatech). The cells were resuspended in ice-cold FACS staining buffer containing Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Mediatech), pH 7.4, 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml goat IgG (Jackson Immunolabs, Westgrove, PA), and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 107 cells/ml. 100 μl of cell suspension was added to 5-ml polystyrene round bottom tubes (Falcon, Fisher). The primary antibodies were added at 10 μg/ml, and incubation proceeded on ice for 1 h with occasional gentle mixing of the cell suspension. The samples were washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS, and 2 μg/ml Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted in FACS staining buffer was added. After incubation at 4 °C for 45 min in the dark, the cells were rinsed as described above. Cells were kept at 4 °C throughout the experiment, and buffers without Ca2+/Mg2+ were used to minimize cell clumping. Finally, the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS, and data were acquired on a FACSARIA sorter (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo, Ashland, OR). hP2X3/1321N1 cells were grown overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in a 12-well plate with DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, GE Healthcare). Before immunocytochemistry, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (Mediatech). All of the steps from this point on were done on ice and with ice-cold reagents to minimize channel internalization by endocytosis. Primary antibodies, directly conjugated to Alexa 488 (Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit, A-10235, Thermo Fisher) were added at 10 μg/ml in staining buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 5% goat serum (Life Technologies). Incubation proceeded for 40 min; the cells were rinsed as above and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for 10 min. After a final rinse, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with mounting medium ProLong Gold anti-Fade + DAPI as nuclear stain (Invitrogen). For the quenching experiment, the cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Alexa 488 (A-11094, Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL) at 20 μg/ml for 30–45 min after the fixation step. Microscopy was carried out on a Leica laser-scanning confocal microscope at room temperature (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), and images from z-stacks with 0.5-μm optical sections were collected using a ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens. Representative images are shown either as individual z-sections or as maximum projections from an entire z-stack as generated by the Leica LAS AF software. hP2X3/1321N1 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine coverslips as described above. Before immunocytochemistry, the medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 min at room temperature. After washing as above, the cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 5% normal goat serum (Life Technologies). Primary antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature and included anti-P2X3 antibodies directly conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 647 (Alexa Fluor 647 protein labeling kit, A-20173, Thermo Fisher) at 5 μg/ml and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to detect specific intracellular organelles according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The following antibodies were used: anti-giantin to detect the Golgi compartment (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-EEA1 to detect early endosomes (Abcam), and anti-cathepsin D to detect lysosomes (Calbiochem). The cells were washed as above, and the secondary antibody Cy3-goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:400) (Jackson Immunolabs) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed and mounted on slides as described above. For overnight mAb incubation experiments, the antibodies were incubated with cells at 1 μm. Microscopy was carried out as described above. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by an institutional animal care and use committee in an AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care)-approved facility. All testing was done by experimenters blind to both treatment and group assignment of individual animals. After overnight fasting, rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/ml)/xylazine (12 mg/ml) (1 ml/kg). An abdominal laparotomy was performed, and a TNBS solution (50 mg at 1.5 ml/kg, TNBS treatment group) or vehicle (sham group) was injected into the proximal colon (1 cm distal from cecum). The fourth day following surgery, the TNBS treatment group was subdivided into two groups, one receiving 12D4 (30 mg/kg i.v.) and the other receiving control IgG (30 mg/kg i.v.). On the seventh day following surgery, after a second overnight fast, TNBS-treated rats were tested for visceral pain threshold with balloon distension. A 5-cm latex balloon attached to a catheter was inserted into the distal colon with the base of the balloon 5 cm from the anus. The catheter was fixed to the tail with tape to prevent balloon movement. After a 30-min acclimation period, the balloon was inflated sequentially from 5 mm Hg to 80 mm Hg in 30-s intervals. Balloon distension was halted at the threshold pressure required to elicit a stereotypical rodent visceral pain posture known as the alpha position, repeated waves of contraction of oblique musculature with inward turning of the hind paw (29Wesselmann U. Czakanski P.P. Affaitati G. Giamberardino M.A. Uterine inflammation as a noxious visceral stimulus: behavioral characterization in the rat.Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 246: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and this was recorded as the visceral pain threshold. Animals were euthanized after the balloon distension test. Three days before testing, female rats received either PBS (vehicle) or 12D4 (30 mg/kg subcutaneously). Rats were routinely handled for 2 days before testing. On the day of testing, rats were habituated to clear, plexiglass arenas for at least 30 min. 50 μl of 0.5% formalin was injected into the plantar surface of the left hind paw. Painlike behavior (persistent flinching) of the injected paw was manually recorded (number of flinches per 5-min interval) for 60 min. Three days before CFA injection, animals were tested for baseline withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus and then received treatment (control IgG or 12D4 (30 mg/kg subcutaneously)). Baseline and post-treatment withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus were measured using the radiant heat test (30Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J. A new and sensitive method for measuring thermal nociception in cutaneous hyperalgesia.Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar) using a plantar test apparatus (IITC (Woodland Hills, CA), model 390). The stimulus intensity was set such that the preinjury withdrawal latencies were 15–18 s. The cut-off time was set at 30 s. Rats were placed on a glass platform warmed to 30 ± 2 °C and allowed to habituate to the testing chambers for a minimum of 15 min before each test session. The thermal stimulus was applied to the plantar surface of the paw, and three readings per rat per paw were taken at each test session. Thermal thresholds are defined as the latency in seconds to the first pain behavior, which includes nocifensive paw withdrawal, flinching, and biting and/or licking of the stimulated paw.

https://openalex.org/W2344569636,"PR domain-containing protein 7 (PRDM7) is a primate-specific histone methyltransferase that is the result of a recent gene duplication of PRDM9. The two proteins are highly homologous, especially in the catalytic PR/SET domain, where they differ by only three amino acid residues. Here we report that PRDM7 is an efficient methyltransferase that selectively catalyzes the trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) both in vitro and in cells. Through selective mutagenesis we have dissected the functional roles of each of the three divergent residues between the PR domains of PRDM7 and PRDM9. These studies indicate that after a single serine to tyrosine mutation at residue 357 (S357Y), PRDM7 regains the substrate specificities and catalytic activities similar to its evolutionary predecessor, including the ability to efficiently methylate H3K36.

It is selectively expressed in cells undergoing meiosis, and genetic deletion of the PRDM9 gene results in defective gametogenesis and sterility (15Hayashi K. Yoshida K. Matsui Y. A histone H3 methyltransferase controls epigenetic events required for meiotic prophase.Nature. 2005; 438: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, PRDM9 is currently the only PRDM family member for which detailed enzyme kinetics have been reported (14Eram M.S. Bustos S.P. Lima-Fernandes E. Siarheyeva A. Senisterra G. Hajian T. Chau I. Duan S. Wu H. Dombrovski L. Schapira M. Arrowsmith C.H. Vedadi M. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 by human methyltransferase PRDM9 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 12177-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is possible that other PRDMs require one or more interacting partners for histone methyltransferase activity, or perhaps they methylate non-histone targets. Most PRDM family proteins contain a variable number of C2H2 zinc finger repeats that may contribute to their interaction with DNA or protein partners in the cell. Some PRDMs act as scaffolding proteins by binding to DNA via these zinc finger motifs to recruit transcription factors to target gene promoters (reviewed in Refs. 27Brayer K.J. Segal D.J. Keep your fingers off my DNA: protein-protein interactions mediated by C2H2 zinc finger domains.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 50: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and 28Fog C.K. Galli G.G. Lund A.H. PRDM proteins: important players in differentiation and disease.BioEssays. 2012; 34: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In some cases these interactions may be essential for methyltransferase activity. Interestingly, certain PRDM isoforms lack the PR domain (29Györy I. Fejér G. Ghosh N. Seto E. Wright K.L. Identification of a functionally impaired positive regulatory domain I binding factor 1 transcription repressor in myeloma cell lines.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3125-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Fumasoni I. Meani N. Rambaldi D. Scafetta G. Alcalay M. Ciccarelli F.D. Family expansion and gene rearrangements contributed to the functional specialization of PRDM genes in vertebrates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that some PRDM proteins may function predominantly as scaffolding proteins. It also raises the intriguing possibility that PR domains that lack HMT activity may instead function as “reader” domains to further facilitate proper genomic localization. In primates, a recent gene duplication of PRDM9 has resulted in the creation of PRDM7 (30Fumasoni I. Meani N. Rambaldi D. Scafetta G. Alcalay M. Ciccarelli F.D. Family expansion and gene rearrangements contributed to the functional specialization of PRDM genes in vertebrates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PRDM7 is highly homologous with its ancestral gene product, sharing an amino acid sequence identity of 41% overall and 97% over the PR domain (Fig. 1a). Indeed, there are only three divergent residues between the PR domains of PRDM7 and PRDM9 (residues 244–358 in both proteins). Outside of the PR domain, PRDM7 has experienced major structural rearrangements with 0 or 4 zinc finger repeats (depending upon the isoform) versus 14 in PRDM9, and modified gene splicing due to tandem duplication of an 89-nucleotide long segment from ancestral exon 3 that codes for the C-terminal part of PR domain (Fig. 1b) (30Fumasoni I. Meani N. Rambaldi D. Scafetta G. Alcalay M. Ciccarelli F.D. Family expansion and gene rearrangements contributed to the functional specialization of PRDM genes in vertebrates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PRDM9 is the only member of the PR domain family whose expression is restricted to germ cells entering meiotic prophase (15Hayashi K. Yoshida K. Matsui Y. A histone H3 methyltransferase controls epigenetic events required for meiotic prophase.Nature. 2005; 438: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although PRDM7 maintains some tissue specificity, it is more broadly expressed than PRDM9 (30Fumasoni I. Meani N. Rambaldi D. Scafetta G. Alcalay M. Ciccarelli F.D. Family expansion and gene rearrangements contributed to the functional specialization of PRDM genes in vertebrates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study we have fully characterized the enzymatic properties of PRDM7. We show that PRDM7 is an active methyltransferase with different substrate specificity than that of the highly homologous PRDM9. [3H]S-Adenosylmethionine ([3H]AdoMet), containing the 3H radiolabel on the labile methyl group, was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (catalog number NET155V001MC, Specific activity range 12–18 Ci/mmol). S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) was obtained from AK Scientific (Union City, CA). Biotinylated peptide substrates were obtained from Peptide2.0 (Chantilly, VA) or Tufts University Peptide Synthesis Core Facility (Boston, MA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or LifeTech and were reagent grade or higher. Peptide sequences were as follows: H3(1–25), ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLATKAA-GK-biotin; H3K4A, ARTAQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLATKAA-GK-biotin; H3K4me1, ART(Kme1)QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLATKAA-GK-biotin; H3K4me2, ART(Kme2)QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLATKAA-GK-biotin; H3(21–44), ATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRPG-GK-biotin; H3K36me1, ATKAARKSAPATGGV(Kme1)KPHRYRPG-GK-biotin; H3K36me2, ATKAARKSAPATGGV(Kme2)KPHRYRPG-GK-biotin. A synthetic construct encoding for amino acids 1–482 of human PRDM7 was prepared by GenScript. A DNA fragment corresponding to the SET domain of PRDM7 (amino acid residues 195–392) was cloned into the pET28-MHL vector (Addgene plasmid number 26096) using the In-Fusion® cloning kit (Clontech). These boundaries were selected to optimize protein expression and solubility. Single-point PRDM7 mutants S289N, S312W, S357Y, and the triple mutant (S289N/S312W/S357Y) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis on a previously described PRDM9(195–385) construct (14Eram M.S. Bustos S.P. Lima-Fernandes E. Siarheyeva A. Senisterra G. Hajian T. Chau I. Duan S. Wu H. Dombrovski L. Schapira M. Arrowsmith C.H. Vedadi M. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 by human methyltransferase PRDM9 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 12177-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was performed to generate PRDM9 Y357S. A construct containing residues 195–367 of PRDM7 appended with residues 368–385 of PRDM9 was generated by amplifying the desired region of PRDM7 from the pET28-MHL construct using extended primers to introduce the PRDM9 sequence. A construct containing residues 195–367 of PRDM9 appended with residues 368–392 of PRDM7 was generated using a similar approach by using PRDM9(195–385) pET28-MHL as a template. Recombinant protein was overexpressed as a hexahistidine tag fusion in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) V2R-pRARE2 during an overnight induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C. Cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole. Chemical lysis was performed by rotating the cells for 30 min at 4 °C after the addition of 0.5% CHAPS, benzonase nuclease, 1 mm PMSF, 1× cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany), and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol followed by sonication for 5 min using a 50% duty cycle (10 s on/10 s off) at a power setting of 8 (Sonicator 3000, Misoni). The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 38,400 × g at 4 °C. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a HispurTM nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Thermo Scientific) and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole followed by a second wash with the same buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. Retained protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). The recovered protein was then concentrated, and further purified over a Superdex 200 26/60 size exclusion column in a running buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Recovered protein was concentrated and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS. Experiments were performed as previously described (31Niesen F.H. Berglund H. Vedadi M. The use of differential scanning fluorimetry to detect ligand interactions that promote protein stability.Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 2212-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were diluted to 0.24 g/liter in 20 mm Bis-tris propane (pH 8.0) in the presence of 5× SYPRO Orange (Life Technologies) dye in a 384-well white PCR plate (Axygen, number PCR-384-W). To this mixture was added AdoMet or a pH-matched vehicle control and fluorescence (excitation 465/emmission 580) was continuously monitored over a 25–95 °C temperature gradient at a rate of 4 °C/min using a Light Cycler 480 II Instrument (Roche). Tm values were calculated from Boltzmann regression analysis using Bioactive (version 2.1.10) software and analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.03). End point methylation reactions were performed in a buffer containing 60 mm Bis-tris propane (pH 9.0) supplemented with 10 mm DTT in a total volume of 40 μl. Histone peptides (250 μm) were incubated overnight (∼16–18 h) in the presence of 3 mm AdoMet with or without PRDM proteins (1 μm for WT, S289N, S312W; 0.1 μm for S357Y) at 22 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 110 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed using an Agilent LC/MSD Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. To remove buffer components from the reaction mixture, the samples were separated over a POROSHELL 300SB-C3 HPLC column over a 5–95% acetonitrile/water gradient. Similarly prepared samples were also subjected to Western blotting analysis as described below, except that all enzymes were used at a concentration of 1 μm. End point methylation reactions with nucleosome as substrate were performed using the same assay conditions as for peptides but at 5 μm PRDM7, 5 mm AdoMet, and 1 μm recombinant nucleosome. Western blotting was performed using specific antibodies for H3K36me1 (Abcam, ab9048), H3K36me2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2901), H3K36me3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9763), H3K4me1 (Abcam, ab8895), H3K4me2 (Millipore, 07030), and H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8585). The specificity of all H3K4 and H3K36 antibodies were assessed by immunoblotting methylated peptides as previously reported (14Eram M.S. Bustos S.P. Lima-Fernandes E. Siarheyeva A. Senisterra G. Hajian T. Chau I. Duan S. Wu H. Dombrovski L. Schapira M. Arrowsmith C.H. Vedadi M. Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 by human methyltransferase PRDM9 protein.J. Biol.

Radiometric methyltransferase assays were performed using biotinylated peptide substrates and [3H]AdoMet in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Bis-tris propane (pH 9.0) supplemented with 5 mm DTT and 0.01% Triton X-100. Ten microliter reactions were initiated with [3H]AdoMet and allowed to proceed at 23 °C before being quenched with excess guanidine hydrochloride. The range of specific activities of AdoMet used in assays is 1.8–0.06 Ci/mmol. For peptide screening, incorporated radioactivity was measured in streptavidin-coated 96-well scintillation proximity FlashPlates Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a TopCount NXT plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinetic constants were measured under pseudo first-order reaction conditions for each protein and incorporated radioactivity was captured on SAM2® Biotin Capture Membranes (Promega, Madison WI) and quantified using liquid scintillation counting. PRDM7 wild-type kinetic parameters for AdoMet and H3K4me2 were determined using a bi-substrate matrix assay format and analyzed using the Enzyme Kinetics module in SigmaPlot version 11.0. Due to the extremely high Kmapp of AdoMet for wild-type PRDM7, other apparent peptide Kmapp values for wild-type PRDM7 were determined at a concentration of 1000 μm AdoMet to maintain sufficient assay signal. The AdoMet Kmapp value for PRDM7 S357Y was determined using a fixed concentration of 50 μm H3K4me2 peptide. AdoMet Kmapp values for all other mutant proteins were determined using a fixed concentration of 10 μm H3K4me2 peptide. Peptide Kmapp values for mutant PRDMs were determined using the following AdoMet concentrations: S289N, 1000 μm; S312W, 250 μm; triple mutant, 250 μm; PRDM9 Y357S, 50 μm. Kinetic data from the mutant enzymes were analyzed using a Michaelis-Menten model in GraphPad Prism version 6.05. To examine the methylation of H3K4 and H3K36 in HEK293T cells (ATCC) by PRDM7, we performed an exogenous histone H3/PRDM7 overexpression assay as previously described (33Kaniskan H.Ü. Szewczyk M.M. Yu Z. Eram M.S. Yang X. Schmidt K. Luo X. Dai M. He F. Zang I. Lin Y. Kennedy S. Li F. Dobrovetsky E. Dong A. Smil D. et al.A potent, selective and cell-active allosteric inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3).Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2015; 54: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS and co-transfected with 0.9 μg of FLAG-tagged human PRDM7 (GenScript, OHu31053) and 0.1 μg of GFP-tagged histone H3 using 293fectin (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, benzonase and protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free mixture tablets, Roche Applies Science) for 15 min on ice. 1% SDS was added after incubation and lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) and 30 μg of lysate was used for Western blotting via SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted using the same antibodies for the histone peptide immunoblots as described above, and an anti-FLAG antibody to verify expression of PRDM7 (FLAG-M2, Sigma). Total histone H3 was assessed by blotting using anti-GFP (Clontech, Living Colors® Clone JL-8), which was used as a loading control for the quantifications. Membranes were developed using LI-COR IRDye infrared imaging. Western blots were quantified using ImageJ, with each sample corrected to its GFP loading control, and then normalized to FLAG-empty vector. Experiments were performed 4 independent times and are plotted as the average fold-change relative to control mean ± S.E. The PRDM7 sequence was tethered on the structure of mPRDM9 (mouse PRDM9) in complex with the cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and a H3K4me2 peptide (PDB code 4C1Q), and the energy of the system was minimized in the internal coordinates space with ICM (34Cardozo T. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Homology modeling by the ICM method.Proteins. 1995; 23: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of the PRDM7 and PRDM9 constructs were performed using the EMBOSS Needle Online Pairwise Sequence Alignment Tool. The SET domain of PRDM7 and PRDM9 were defined per the Uniprot annotation (residues 244–358 for both proteins). The alignment was performed using a BLOSUM62 matrix using a gap open penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 0.5, with no end gap penalty. The amino acid sequences of PRDM7 and PRDM9 are 97% identical across the PR domains (residues 244 to 358; Fig. 1). Therefore, PRDM7 was expected to show methyltransferase activity, perhaps with a substrate specificity and level of activity similar to PRDM9. We set out to fully characterize its enzymatic activity in vitro and in cells. We first tested its ability to bind to AdoMet using differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 2, A and B). AdoMet stabilized PRDM7 in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that PRDM7 retained the ability to bind AdoMet. Subsequently, we screened a library of 23 histone peptides including peptides with different methylation states of H3K4 and H3K36 using a radiometric assay to identify potential PRDM7 substrates. Although active with H3K4me0 and H3K4me1 as substrates, PRDM7 showed significantly higher activity with H3K4me2, indicating it is a more efficient H3K4 trimethylase (Fig. 2C). It was also inactive with the H3K4A(1–25) peptide, confirming that Lys-4 is the only methylation site up to residue 25 on the histone H3 tail. As expected, no activity was observed with histone H4, H2A, or H2B peptides. Surprisingly, no activity was observed with any of the peptides harboring H3K36. These findings were further investigated by mass spectral analysis (Fig. 3A) and Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4) of reaction products confirming H3K4me2 as the best substrate for PRDM7 with no significant activity on H3K36. Assay conditions were optimized with regards to common additives and pH (data not shown). To ensure accuracy of the kinetic parameters, the linearity of initial velocities for kinetic studies were also confirmed (data not shown). Full kinetic characterization of PRDM7 activity confirmed that it is much more active in trimethylating H3K4me2 (kcat of 190 h−1) than monomethylation of H3K4me0 (kcat of 9 ± 0.9 h−1) or dimethylation of H3K4me1 (kcat of 8 ± 0.5 h−1) with overall 5× higher catalytic efficiencies (Table 1, and FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). PRDM7 showed no activity in radiometric assays with H3K36me0, H3K36me1, or H3K36me2 with up to 250 nm enzyme, 900 μm AdoMet, and 50 μm peptide for a period of 1 h.FIGURE 3PRDM7 selectively trimethylates H3K4me2.

Very limited information exists on the potential role of RBPs in modulating kidney fibrosis, which is a major hallmark of chronic kidney disease. Here, we report a novel mechanism in kidney fibrosis involving a RBP, Musashi homologue 1 (Msi1), which is expressed in tubular epithelial cells. Using two mechanistically distinct mouse models of kidney fibrosis, we show that Msi1 protein levels are significantly down-regulated in the kidneys following fibrosis. We found that Msi1 functions by negatively regulating the translation of its target mRNAs, p21 and Numb, whose protein levels are markedly increased in kidney fibrosis. Also, Msi1 overexpression and knockdown in kidney epithelial cells cause p21- and Numb-mediated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we observed that Numb looses its characteristic membrane localization in fibrotic kidneys and therefore is likely unable to inhibit Notch resulting in tubular cell death. Oleic acid is a known inhibitor of Msi1 and injecting oleic acid followed by unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery in mice resulted in enhanced fibrosis compared with the control group, indicating that inhibiting Msi1 activity renders the mice more susceptible to fibrosis. Given that deregulated fatty acid metabolism plays a key role in kidney fibrosis, these results demonstrate a novel connection between fatty acid and Msi1, an RNA-binding protein, in kidney fibrosis.

NCKXs are bi-directional membrane transporters that transport 1 Ca2++K+ ions in exchange for 4 Na+ ions. Recent studies have linked mutations in the SLC24A4 (NCKX4) and SLC24A5 (NCKX5) genes to amylogenesis imperfecta (AI) and non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism (OCA6), respectively. Here, we introduced mutations found in patients with AI and OCA6 into human SLC24A4 (NCKX4) cDNA leading to single residue substitutions in the mutant NCKX4 proteins. We measured NCKX-mediated Ca2+ transport activity of WT and mutant NCKX4 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. Three mutant NCKX4 cDNAs represent mutations found in the SCL24A4 gene and three represent mutations found in the SCL24A5 gene involving residues conserved between NCKX4 and NCKX5. Five mutant proteins had no observable NCKX activity, whereas one mutation resulted in a 78% reduction in transport activity. Total protein expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane (the latter with one exception) were not affected in the HEK293 cell expression system. We also analyzed two mutations in a Drosophila NCKX gene that have been reported to result in an increased susceptibility for seizures, and found that both resulted in mutant proteins with significantly reduced but observable NCKX activity.

https://openalex.org/W2339941182,"Allergy to the short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) pollen is a major health problem. The ragweed allergen repertoire has been recently expanded with the identification of Amb a 11, a new major allergen belonging to the cysteine protease family. To better characterize Amb a 11, a recombinant proform of the molecule with a preserved active site was produced in Escherichia coli, refolded, and processed in vitro into a mature enzyme. The enzymatic activity is revealed by maturation following an autocatalytic processing resulting in the cleavage of both N- and C-terminal propeptides. The 2.05-A resolution crystal structure of pro-Amb a 11 shows an overall typical C1A cysteine protease fold with a network of molecular interactions between the N-terminal propeptide and the catalytic triad of the enzyme. The allergenicity of Amb a 11 was confirmed in a murine sensitization model, resulting in airway inflammation, production of serum IgEs, and induction of Th2 immune responses. Of note, inflammatory responses were higher with the mature form, demonstrating that the cysteine protease activity critically contributes to the allergenicity of the molecule. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that Amb a 11 is a bona fide cysteine protease exhibiting a strong allergenicity.

In the cornea, epithelium-specific expression of a dominant negative (DN) CLIM under the keratin 14 (K14) promoter causes blistering, wounding, inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and neovascularization followed by epithelial thinning and subsequent epidermal-like differentiation of the corneal epithelium. The defects in corneal epithelial differentiation and cell fate determination suggest that CLIM may regulate corneal progenitor cells and the transition to differentiation. Consistent with this notion, the K14-DN-Clim corneal epithelium first exhibits increased proliferation followed by fewer progenitor cells with decreased proliferative potential. In vivo ChIP-sequencing experiments with corneal epithelium show that CLIM binds to and regulates numerous genes involved in cell adhesion and proliferation, including limbally enriched genes. Intriguingly, CLIM associates primarily with non-LIM homeodomain motifs in corneal epithelial cells, including that of estrogen receptor α. Among CLIM targets is the noncoding RNA H19 whose deregulation is associated with Silver-Russell and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. We demonstrate here that H19 negatively regulates corneal epithelial proliferation. In addition to cell cycle regulators, H19 affects the expression of multiple cell adhesion genes. CLIM interacts with estrogen receptor α at the H19 locus, potentially explaining the higher expression of H19 in female than male corneas.

https://openalex.org/W2339062866,"The establishment of cell-cell contacts between presynaptic GABAergic neurons and their postsynaptic targets initiates the process of GABAergic synapse formation. GABAA receptors (GABAARs), the main postsynaptic receptors for GABA, have been recently demonstrated to act as synaptogenic proteins that can single-handedly induce the formation and functional maturation of inhibitory synapses. To establish how the subunit composition of GABAARs influences their ability to induce synaptogenesis, a co-culture model system incorporating GABAergic medium spiny neurons and the HEK293 cells, stably expressing different combinations of receptor subunits, was developed. Analyses of HEK293 cell innervation by medium spiny neuron axons using immunocytochemistry, activity-dependent labeling, and electrophysiology have indicated that the γ2 subunit is required for the formation of active synapses and that its effects are influenced by the type of α/β subunits incorporated into the functional receptor. To further characterize this process, the large N-terminal extracellular domains (ECDs) of α1, α2, β2, and γ2 subunits were purified using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. When these proteins were applied to the co-cultures of MSNs and α1/β2/γ2-expressing HEK293 cells, the α1, β2, or γ2 ECD each caused a significant reduction in contact formation, in contrast to the α2 ECD, which had no effect.

Activation of the UPR sensor PERK (EIFAK3/PEK) results in the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α-P), which represses translation initiation and reduces influx of newly synthesized proteins into the overloaded ER. As part of this adaptive response, eIF2α-P also induces a feedback mechanism through enhanced transcriptional and translational expression of Gadd34 (Ppp1r15A),which targets type 1 protein phosphatase for dephosphorylation of eIF2α-P to restore protein synthesis. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which Gadd34 expression is regulated through the activity of the zinc finger transcription factor NMP4 (ZNF384, CIZ). NMP4 functions to suppress bone anabolism, and we suggest that this occurs due to decreased protein synthesis of factors involved in bone formation through NMP4-mediated dampening of Gadd34 and c-Myc expression. Loss of Nmp4 resulted in an increase in c-Myc and Gadd34 expression that facilitated enhanced ribosome biogenesis and global protein synthesis. Importantly, protein synthesis was sustained during pharmacological induction of the UPR through a mechanism suggested to involve GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α-P. Sustained protein synthesis sensitized cells to pharmacological induction of the UPR, and the observed decrease in cell viability was restored upon inhibition of GADD34 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2337637644,"Eicosanoids are important mediators of fever, pain, and inflammation that modulate cell signaling during acute and chronic disease. We show by using lipidomics that thrombin-activated human platelets generate a new type of eicosanoid that both stimulates and primes human neutrophil integrin (Mac-1) expression, in response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine. Detailed characterization proposes a dioxolane structure, 8-hydroxy-9,11-dioxolane eicosatetraenoic acid (dioxolane A3, DXA3). The lipid is generated in nanogram amounts by platelets from endogenous arachidonate during physiological activation, with inhibition by aspirin in vitro or in vivo, implicating cyclooxygenase-1 (COX). Pharmacological and genetic studies on human/murine platelets revealed that DXA3 formation requires protease-activated receptors 1 and 4, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), Src tyrosine kinases, p38 MAPK, phospholipase C, and intracellular calcium. From data generated by purified COX isoforms and chemical oxidation, we propose that DXA3 is generated by release of an intermediate from the active site followed by oxygenation at C8. In summary, a new neutrophil-activating platelet-derived lipid generated by COX-1 is presented that can activate or prime human neutrophils, suggesting a role in innate immunity and acute inflammation."

Activation of the Arp2/3 complex by the actin filament binding protein Abp1p.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have now identified a novel binding partner that interacts with the N terminus of mAbp1. We found that depletion of mAbp1 or ectopic expression of the ADFH domain enhances cell invasion. Moreover the increased invasion observed with ectopic expression of the ADFH domain requires expression of FHL2. Our findings suggest that mAbp1 inhibits invasive migration of breast cancer cells at least in part through its interaction with FHL2 and the modulation of Rho GTPase signaling. These results identify a novel role for the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 in modulating MTLn3 breast cancer cell invasion. Alexa Fluor 405 phalloidin and rhodamine phalloidin were purchased from Invitrogen. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-mAbp1 from the University of Wisconsin antibody facility as described previously (30.Mamoune A. Luo J.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Calpain-2 as a target for limiting prostate cancer invasion.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-FHL2 clone F4B2-B11, (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti–β-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma), rabbit anti-GFP (Life Technologies), mouse anti-vinculin clone h-VIN1 (Sigma), rabbit anti-RhoA clone 67B9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), mouse anti-myc clone 9E10 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), rabbit anti-His6 (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc, Limerick, PA), rabbit anti-tag RFP (Evrogen), mouse anti-β-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-Histone-3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence include Marina blue goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), Pacific blue goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen), rhodamine red-X goat anti-mouse IgG, TRITC donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and FITC donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Gamma glutathione-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Secondary antibodies used for Odyssey Li-cor imaging of Western blots were mouse 680 (Invitrogen) and rabbit 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Rat tail collagen type I was used for collagen contraction assays (BD Biosciences). Gelatin from porcine skin (Sigma) was used for gelatin coating coverslips, and fibronectin was purified as described previously (31.Ruoslahti E. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M. Engvall E. Fibronectin: purification, immunochemical properties, and biological activities.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 803-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). EGF was acquired from Invitrogen. MTLn3 rat adenocarcinoma cells (provided by J. Condeelis and J. Segall, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro and Mediatech, Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231 human mammary adenocarcinoma (provided by A. Rapraeger, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were cultured in DMEM (Cellgro and Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro and Mediatech). HEK 293 and PhxA cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI FBS (Hyclone), nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro and Mediatech). Transient transfections of MTLn3 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 × 105 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate, and 2 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were used. Transfection mixtures incubated at room temperature in Opti-MEM media (Gibco for 30 min before adding to cells. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture 4 h before washing 3× with PBS. Cells then were cultured by standard methods as described under “Cell Culture” above. HEK 293 transient transfections were performed by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. All cells, with the exception of HEK 293 (cultured at 10% CO2), were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All constructs were generated by PCR amplification of product with cut sites in the primers as follows: full-length human mAbp1 and the ADFH, proline-rich region, or SH3 domains of mAbp1 were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector using the XhoI and BamHI cut sites. GFP-mAbp1-W415K was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type construct. GST-m+Abp1 was cloned into pGex-4T1 with BamHI and XhoI cut sites. RFP-FHL2 was cloned into tagRFP-C1 vector with HindIII and BamHI cut sites. Myc-FHL2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 myc vector with XhoI and EcoRI cut sites and the myc tag on the N terminus of FHL2. His-FHL2 was cloned into pTrcHisA vector with XhoI and EcoRI cut sites. Stable knockdown MTLn3 lines were generated with the pSUPER.retro RNAi system per the manufacturer's instructions (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). Briefly, to generate retrovirus for infection of MTLn3 cells, we plated 3 × 106 PhxA cells on a 10-cm dish. The PhxA cells were transfected with 12 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. 24-h virus was discarded, and 4 ml of new media were added. The 48-h and 72-h retrovirus was harvested, filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter, and mixed with 1× Polybrene before adding to a 6-cm dish of 1 × 105 MTLn3 cells. Cells were incubated in retrovirus mixture for 6 h at 32 °C. Retroviral media was removed, and cells were recovered in standard media for 24 h before selection. Cells containing retrovirus were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 5 days. Retroviral transduction of MDA-MB-231 cells was performed similarly with the exception that virus from 24, 48, 72, and 96 h was used for infection and virus-containing media remained on cells 24 h instead of 6. This longer infection was necessary for successful transduction of these cells. The most efficient rat mAbp1 shRNA target sequences were at nucleotides: 1334 sense (GATCCCCGTGGCTTCCTTGTTGCCTATTCAAGAGATAGGCAACAAGGAAGCCACTTTTTA) and 1334 antisense (AGCTTAAAAAGTGGCTTCCTTGTTGCCTATCTCTTGAATAGGCAACAAGGAAGCCACGGG) and 1464 sense (GATCCCCATGCTTACCGCAGCCTCTATTCAAGAGATAGAGGCTGCGGTAAGCATTTTTTA) and 1464 antisense (AGCTTAAAAAATGCTTACCGCAGCCTCTATCTCTTGAATAGAGGCTGCGGTAAGCATGGG). To generate an FHL2 knockdown in MTLn3 cells, 12 targets were attempted with the most efficient knockdown targeted at start nucleotide 152 with the primers 152 sense (GATCCCCGCAAGGACTTGTCCTACAATTCAAGAGATTGTAGGACAAGTCCTTGCTTTTTA) and 152 antisense (AGCTTAAAAAGCAAGGACTTGTCCTACAATCTCTTGAATTGTAGGACAAGTCCTTGCGGG). MDA-MB-231 stableknockdowns were generated with primers targeting nucleotide 1748: sense (GATCCCCGTGAACGTAGAGAATTGTTTTCAAGAGAAACAATTCTCTACGTTCACTTTTT) and 1748 antisense (AGCTAAAAAGTGAACGTAGAGAATTGTTTCTCTTGAAAACAATTCTCTACGTTCACGGG). Collagen contraction experiments were performed as follows. Desired volume of collagen was mixed 1:1 with 150 mm HEPES (Cellgro) in 2× PBS for a stock concentration of 4.5 mg/ml collagen and incubated on ice. 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were counted and resuspended in 656 μl of media. 444 μl of collagen stock was mixed with cells for a final collagen concentration of 2 mg/ml and immediately transferred to 1 well of a 6-well plate. The plate was rocked to spread collagen across the entire surface then cultured at 37 °C for 1 h to polymerize. When polymerized, 2 ml of media were added to well, and collagen was loosened from the well with gentle rocking. Cells were cultured, and images were taken at 24 h and 48 h. Percent contraction was quantified on metamorph imaging software. Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal protein levels were denatured in SDS and loaded on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with the appropriate antibodies, and imaged with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For GFP immunoprecipitation experiments, transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were cultured to ∼80% confluency on 10-cm plates, washed once with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 3 μg of rabbit-anti-GFP antibody. Immune complexes were captured on Gammabind G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), washed three times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Rho GTPase pulldown assays were performed with Rhotekin-RBD Protein GST beads (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) according the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. In brief, 3 × 106 MTLn3 cells were cultured on 15-cm dishes, serum-starved for 24 h, then treated with 5 nm EGF for 5 min. Cells were immediately lysed on ice in Rho lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min for clarification. A sample of lysate was removed for Western blot loading control, and the remainder of lysate was placed in a tube containing 60 μg of Rhotekin-RBD beads to capture active Rho. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before centrifuging for 1 min at 1000 rpm and washed 3× with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 1% PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Meanwhile, the positive and negative control lysates were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 15 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP, respectively. GTPγS is a non-hydrolysable GTP analog so that active Rho is pulled down from cell lysates. GDP inactivates Rho and blocks its binding to rhotekin RBD beads. MgCl2 (60 mm final concentration) was added to stop all reactions, and lysates were incubated on rhotekin beads and washed as described above. All samples were run on SDS-PAGE. The amount of Rho pulled down was calculated by densitometry analysis of Western blots. The ratio of active Rho pulled down to input Rho was calculated first. Then the ratio of active Rho pulled down per condition was normalized to control shRNA cells. Cell fractionation was performed as previously described (32.Suzuki K. Bose P. Leong-Quong R.Y. Fujita D.J. Riabowol K. REAP: a two-minute fractionation method.BMC Res. Notes. 2010; 3: 294Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were scraped from confluent 10-cm dishes on ice into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were briefly centrifuged, and supernatant was removed. Cells were then resuspended in 900 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and titrated 3×. 300 μl of lysate was removed as the whole cell lysate. Remaining lysate was briefly centrifuged, and supernatant was removed as the cytosolic fraction. Nuclear pellet was resuspended in 180 μl of SDS buffer. Samples were loaded on SDS page and analyzed on Western blot. Coverslips were acid-washed, ethanol-sterilized, coated with 2 mg/ml gelatin, and subsequently coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. 3.0 × 104 cells were plated in α-minimum Eagle's medium on coverslips for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, quenched with 0.15 m glycine for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS 3 times, and blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with primary antibody and/or rhodamine phalloidin for minimum of 1 h, washed, then incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were imaged either with a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope or with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. On the Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, images were captured with a Coolsnap ES2 camera or with an Evolve 512 Delta EM-CCD camera for confocal mode (Photometrics, Huntington Beach, CA) using a 63× oil/NA 1.4 Plan Apo immersion objective (Zeiss Immersol 518F oil) and processed with Zen (blue edition) software (Carl Zeiss). Images from the Nikon Eclipse TE300 were captured with a Coolsnap ES2 camera using a 60× oil/NA 1.4 Plan Apo oil immersion objective and processed with Zen imaging software. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and 2 × 105 cells were seeded into top chamber of 8-μm pore boyden chambers coated with Matrigel (BD Biosystems). Serum-starving medium for MTLn3 cells contained 1% FBS and antibiotics. Serum-starving medium for other cell types contained 0.2% fatty acid free BSA and no serum. Cells were allowed to invade for 16 or 48 h as indicated toward serum-containing media. Cells were removed from the top chamber, and cells remaining on the membrane were stained with a Hema-3 stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were counted from 12 representative 20× field of view images per condition from at least three independent experiments. All images were acquired with an Olympus 1X-70 inverted microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) using a 20×/NA 0.4 objective. Images were processed with Metavue imaging software v6.2 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Statistical analyses used were unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We previously reported that mAbp1 impairs the migration of Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (8.Boateng L.R. Cortesio C.L. Huttenlocher A. Src-mediated phosphorylation of mammalian Abp1 (DBNL) regulates podosome rosette formation in transformed fibroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether mAbp1 also negatively regulates invasion of breast cancer cells, we depleted mAbp1 in MTLn3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines using retroviral shRNA (Fig. 1, A, B, and H). Cell invasion through Matrigel-coated boyden chambers was enhanced 2–4-fold in mAbp1-deficient breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1, C, D, and I). This enhanced invasion was rescued to control levels with exogenous transient expression of GFP-mAbp1 in mAbp1-deficient MTLn3 cells (Fig. 1F). GFP-tagged mAbp1 localized to the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions (Fig. 1G) similar to endogenous mAbp1 as detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these findings identify an inhibitory role for mAbp1 during invasive migration of breast cancer cell lines. Invasive migration is dependent on Rho GTPase activityand subsequent cell contractility. To determine how mAbp1 impairs cell invasion, we used MDA-MD-231 cells that grow well in three-dimensional collagen gels to examine how mAbp1 expression modulates cell contraction. We found that in accordance with increased invasion, depletion of mAbp1 increased the contraction of collagen gels, indicating that mAbp1-deficient cells have enhanced cell contractility and force application in three-dimensional collagen (Fig. 1, J, and K). Likewise, mAbp1-deficient cells had higher RhoA activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Cell forces are applied to the extracellular matrix via adhesion sites known as focal adhesions. We found that mAbp1-deficient cells had larger focal adhesions and were more spread on two-dimensional surfaces (Fig. 2, C–F). Taken together, these results suggest that mAbp1 negatively regulates the invasion of breast cancer cells, at least in part through the modulation of Rho GTPase signaling. Mammalian Abp1 is an adaptor protein that binds to the actin cytoskeleton through its N-terminal ADFH domain and to dynamin (2.Xu W. Stamnes M.

To determine whether the SH3 domain is necessary for the inhibitory effects of mAbp1 on invasion, we expressed either full-length mAbp1, the ADFH domain alone, or an SH3 domain mutant (mAbp1-W415K) in mAbp1-deficient MTLn3 cells and measured invasion through Matrigel (Fig. 3, A–D). mAbp1-deplete"
https://openalex.org/W2345637395,"SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have generated a SALL4 transgenic (SALL4B Tg) mouse model with pre-leukemic MDS-like symptoms that transform to AML over time. This makes our mouse model applicable for studying human MDS/AML diseases. Characterization of the leukemic initiation population in this model leads to the discovery that Fancl (Fanconi anemia, complementation group L) is downregulated in SALL4B Tg leukemic and pre-leukemic cells. Similar to the reported Fanconi anemia (FA) mouse model, chromosomal instability with radial changes can be detected in pre-leukemic SALL4B Tg bone marrow (BM) cells after DNA damage challenge. Results from additional studies using DNA damage repair reporter assays support a role of SALL4 in inhibiting the homologous recombination pathway. Intriguingly, unlike the FA mouse model, after DNA damage challenge, SALL4B Tg BM cells can survive and generate hematopoietic colonies. We further elucidated that the mechanism by which SALL4 promotes cell survival is through Bcl2 activation. Overall, our studies demonstrate for the first time that SALL4 has a negative impact in DNA damage repair, and support the model of dual functional properties of SALL4 in leukemogenesis through inhibiting DNA damage repair and promoting cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2342378645,"The human pancreas expresses two major trypsinogen isoforms, cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) and anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2). Mutations in PRSS1 cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering cleavage of regulatory nick sites by chymotrypsin C (CTRC) resulting in reduced trypsinogen degradation and increased autoactivation. Despite 90% identity with PRSS1 and a strong propensity for autoactivation, mutations in PRSS2 are not found in hereditary pancreatitis suggesting that activation of this isoform is more tightly regulated. Here, we demonstrated that CTRC promoted degradation and thereby markedly suppressed autoactivation of human anionic trypsinogen more effectively than previously observed with cationic trypsinogen. Increased sensitivity of anionic trypsinogen to CTRC-mediated degradation was due to an additional cleavage site at Leu-148 in the autolysis loop and the lack of the conserved Cys-139–Cys-206 disulfide bond. Significant stabilization of anionic trypsinogen against degradation was achieved by simultaneous mutations of CTRC cleavage sites Leu-81 and Leu-148, autolytic cleavage site Arg-122, and restoration of the missing disulfide bridge. This stands in stark contrast to cationic trypsinogen where single mutations of either Leu-81 or Arg-122 resulted in almost complete resistance to CTRC-mediated degradation. Finally, processing of the trypsinogen activation peptide at Phe-18 by CTRC inhibited autoactivation of anionic trypsinogen, although cationic trypsinogen was strongly stimulated. Taken together, the observations indicate that human anionic trypsinogen is controlled by CTRC in a manner that individual natural mutations are unlikely to increase stability enough to promote intra-pancreatic activation. This unique biochemical property of anionic trypsinogen explains the lack of association of PRSS2 mutations with hereditary pancreatitis.

This unique biochemical property of anionic trypsinogen explains the lack of association of PRSS2 mutations with hereditary pancreatitis. The digestive proenzyme trypsinogen is typically expressed in multiple isoforms in the pancreas. The human pancreas secretes three isoforms as follows: cationic trypsinogen, anionic trypsinogen, and mesotrypsinogen, which are encoded by the PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3 genes, respectively (1Chen J.-M. Ferec C. Genes, cloned cDNAs, and proteins of human trypsinogens and pancreatitis-associated cationic trypsinogen mutations.Pancreas. 2000; 21: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cationic and anionic trypsinogen constitute more than 95% of total trypsinogen in the pancreatic juice, with a slight preponderance of the cationic isoform (2Guy O. Lombardo D. Bartelt D.C. Amic J.

Interestingly, expression of anionic trypsinogen is increased in inflammatory and malignant diseases of the pancreas and in chronic alcoholism resulting in a reversal of the relative isoform amounts (4Rinderknecht H.

Trypsinogen is activated to trypsin in the duodenum by the serine protease enteropeptidase, and active trypsin serves not only as the most abundant digestive protease but also as an activator of other proteolytic zymogens (7Rinderknecht H.

Trypsinogen can undergo autoactivation, a self-amplifying bimolecular reaction in which trypsin activates trypsinogen to yield two trypsin molecules. Autoactivation plays an important role in ectopic activation of trypsinogen inside the pancreas, which can lead to pancreatitis. Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in PRSS1 that result in increased intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation (8Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A.

Active cationic trypsin is also degraded by this mechanism but at a much slower rate due to unusual thermodynamic stability of the regulatory nick sites (11Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M.

PRSS1 mutations associated with hereditary pancreatitis can decrease or eliminate cleavage at Leu-81 (N29I, N29T, V39A, R122C, and R122H) and Arg-122 (V39A, R122C, and R122H) or increase cleavage of the activation peptide at Phe-18 (A16V and N29I) (Fig. 1A). As a result, cationic trypsinogen mutants autoactivate to high trypsin levels in the presence of CTRC (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

The discovery of the association of PRSS1 mutations and hereditary pancreatitis stimulated a number of investigations into the potential role of PRSS2 in chronic pancreatitis (14Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M.

PRSS2 is abundantly expressed; it shares 90% identity with PRSS1 at the amino acid level, and it also readily autoactivates (17Colomb E. Figarella C.

Interestingly, a polymorphic variant, G191R, was found with higher frequency in healthy controls (3.4%) versus pancreatitis patients (1.3%), indicating an ∼2.7-fold protective effect, as judged by the odds ratio in the largest cohort studied (14Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M. Landt O. Chen J.M. Kähne T. Drenth J.P. Kukor Z. Szepessy E. Halangk W. Dahm S. Rohde K. Schulz H.U. Le Maréchal C. Akar N.

Biochemical analysis revealed that variant G191R rendered anionic trypsinogen susceptible to autodegradation by introducing a new trypsin-sensitive cleavage site. Although the findings confirmed that anionic trypsinogen does contribute to intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation, the small protective effect pointed to a limited role. Taken together with the lack of pathogenic PRSS2 mutations, the observations to date led us to hypothesize that anionic trypsinogen may be more tightly regulated by CTRC, possibly preventing natural mutations from causing significantly increased activation of this isoform. Recombinant human CTRC was expressed and purified as described previously (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PageRuler prestained protein ladder was obtained from Thermo Scientific (catalog no. 26617, lot 00340439). Amino acid residues in human trypsinogen isoforms were numbered starting with the initiator methionine of the primary translation product, according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. The pTrapT7 intein-PRSS1 expression plasmid containing the coding sequence of human cationic trypsinogen N-terminally fused to a self-splicing mini-intein was constructed previously (20Király O.

The analogous pTrapT7 intein-PRSS2 expression plasmid was constructed by replacing the EcoRI-SacI fragment in the pTrapT7 intein-PRSS1 plasmid containing the N29I mutation with the PRSS2 coding sequence from the pTrapT7 PRSS2 plasmid (19Kukor Z.

Wild-type and mutant intein-trypsinogen fusion constructs were expressed in the aminopeptidase P-deficient LG-3 Escherichia coli strain (20Király O. Guan L. Szepessy E. Tóth M. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M.

In vitro refolding and purification of trypsinogen on immobilized ecotin was performed as described previously (21Király O. Guan L. Sahin-Tóth M.

Concentrations of trypsinogen preparations were determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients 38,890 m−1 cm−1 (PRSS2) and 37,525 m−1 cm−1 (PRSS1). Wild-type and mutant trypsinogens (1 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10, 25, 50, and 100 nm human CTRC and 10 nm initial trypsin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), the indicated concentrations of NaCl (typically 25 mm for anionic trypsinogen and no salt added for cationic trypsinogen), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20 (final concentrations). At the indicated times, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with 40 μl of assay buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. Trypsin activity was measured by adding 150 μl of 200 μm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide substrate (catalog no. L1725, Bachem, Torrance, CA) and following the release of the yellow p-nitroaniline at 405 nm in a SpectraMax Plus384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 1 min. Reaction rates were calculated from fits to the initial linear portions of the curves. The substrate was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. Trypsin activity was expressed as percent of maximal activity, which was determined either by autoactivation in 10 mm CaCl2 or by activation with 28.2 ng/ml human enteropeptidase (catalog no. 1585-SE, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Autoactivation experiments were performed in three technical replicates from two independent enzyme preparations. Representative time courses are shown. For clarity, error bars were omitted in most figures. All replicates were submitted for review. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out in duplicates; both gels were reviewed, but only representative gels are shown. Autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen has been extensively studied as the main pathogenic mechanism of trypsin generation in hereditary pancreatitis (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Although prior studies demonstrated that human anionic trypsinogen also undergoes autoactivation (17Colomb E. Figarella C.

Here, we utilized self-splicing mini-intein fusion technology to generate human trypsinogens with homogeneous authentic N-terminal sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”) (20Király O. Guan L. Szepessy E. Tóth M. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M.

Biol. 2011; 705: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When autoactivation was measured at pH 8.0 in 1 mm calcium, conditions chosen to approximate the physiological milieu in the pancreatic juice, both human trypsinogens were rapidly converted to active trypsin (Fig. 2, A and C). On SDS-PAGE, the activation was visualized as a characteristic small shift in mobility (Fig. 2, B and D). Autoactivation of anionic trypsinogen proceeded about 2-fold faster than its cationic counterpart; however, the trypsin plateau reached was lower (∼70%), indicating some degradation at this calcium concentration (Fig. 2C). SDS-PAGE analysis and N-terminal sequencing revealed that both trypsinogens were cleaved at the Arg-122–Val-123 peptide bond by trypsin, but anionic trypsinogen was also autolyzed at the Lys-193–Asp-194 peptide bond (Fig. 2, B and D, see also Fig. 1). Although cleavage at Arg-122 does not alter trypsin activity (26Maroux S. Desnuelle P. On some autolyzed derivatives of bovine trypsin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 181: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Ru B.G. Du J.Z. Zeng Y.H. Chen L.S. Ni Y.S. Tan G.H. Zhang L.X. Active products of porcine trypsin after autolysis.Sci.

Hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutation Asn21→Ile stabilizes rat trypsinogen in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Increasing NaCl concentrations progressively reduced the rate of autoactivation with no significant difference in salt sensitivity between the two isoforms (Fig. 2, A and C). For subsequent studies, we selected experimental conditions under which rates of autoactivation of cationic and anionic trypsinogen were comparable, and the entire time course could be measured within an hour. Therefore, cationic trypsinogen was assayed in the absence of added salt, whereas anionic trypsinogen was tested in the presence of 25 mm NaCl. Previously, we presented data demonstrating that autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen was suppressed by human CTRC (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M. Increased activation of hereditary pancreatitis-associated human cationic trypsinogen mutants in presence of chymotrypsin C.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To provide a framework for this study, we repeated these experiments using a somewhat higher concentration range (10–100 nm) of CTRC (Fig. 3). As expected, at pH 8.0, in 1 mm calcium, CTRC slightly increased the initial rate of autoactivation and markedly reduced final trypsin levels, although complete suppression was not achieved even at 100 nm CTRC concentration (Fig. 3A). Notably, degradation of active trypsin was negligible during the time course studied. Individual mutations of either the CTRC cleavage site Leu-81 (L81A) or the trypsin-sensitive autolytic site Arg-122 (R122A) resulted in almost complete stabilization against degradation and the development of high trypsin levels (Fig. 3, B and C). In the absence of degradation, the stimulatory effect of CTRC on the initial rate of autoactivation was more apparent in mutants L81A and R122A. When measured under similar conditions, autoactivation of anionic trypsinogen was more strikingly diminished by CTRC, and essentially no trypsin activity was detectable at 50 nm CTRC concentration (Fig. 4A). Mutation of Leu-81 (L81A) or Arg-122 (R122A) had no protective effect whatsoever; in fact, mutant L81A was even more sensitive to CTRC-mediated degradation (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast to cationic trypsinogen, CTRC did not seem to increase the initial rate of autoactivation of anionic trypsinogen. SDS-PAGE analysis of anionic trypsinogen treated with 10 nm CTRC for 10 min at pH 8.0 in the absence of calcium revealed that the earliest cleavage generated two bands that migrated in the vicinity of the 15-kDa molecular mass marker (Fig. 5A). The same bands were prominent when the cleavage pattern of mutant L81A was analyzed, indicating that CTRC rapidly cleaved human anionic trypsinogen at a site other than Leu-81 (Fig. 5B). The bands were transferred to PVDF membrane and subjected to Edman degradation, which identified the cleaved peptide bond as Leu-148–Ser-149 located in the so-called autolysis loop (Fig. 5C). Position 148 is Ala in cationic trypsinogen, which explains why this cleavage was not observed there. Mutation of Leu-148 (L148A) in anionic trypsinogen resulted in significant but incomplete stabilization against CTRC-mediated degradation (Fig. 6A, cf. Fig. 4A). Stability of anionic trypsinogen was progressively further increased by the addition of mutations L81A (double mutant L81A,L148A, Fig. 6B) and R122A (triple mutant L81A, R122A,L148A, Fig. 6C); however, degradation by CTRC still proceeded more rapidly than observed with cationic trypsinogen single mutants L81A or R122A (cf. Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 6Effect of mutation L148A on the autoactivation of human anionic trypsinogen in the presence of CTRC. Mutant L148A (A), double mutant L81A,L148A (B), and triple mutant L81A,R122A,L148A (C) anionic trypsinogen (1 μm) were incubated at 37 °C with 0–100 nm CTRC in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (final concentrations). At the indicated times, aliquots (10 μl) were removed, and trypsin activity was determined and expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental uncertainty and reproducibility are given under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite mutations of the primary CTRC cleavage sites Leu-81 and Leu-148 and the autolytic site Arg-122, anionic trypsinogen was still prone to CTRC-mediated degradation, suggesting that additional sites are susceptible to attack. N-terminal sequencing of the smaller bands seen in Fig. 5A identified a number of secondary CTRC cleavage sites, i.e. peptide bonds Tyr-37–Gln-38, Leu-41–Asn-42, Leu-166–Ser-167, and Leu-189–Glu-190 (see Fig. 1B). Although present, with the exception of Leu-41, none of these sites are cleaved in cationic trypsinogen suggesting that increased flexibility of anionic trypsinogen might be responsible for the exposure of potential CTRC-sensitive cleavage sites. Anionic trypsinogen is 90% identical to cationic trypsinogen in its primary amino acid sequence, but a notable difference is the absence of the disulfide bridge Cys-139–Cys-206 (Figs. 1A and 5C). Both Cys residues contributing to this bond in cationic trypsinogen are replaced with Ser in anionic trypsinogen. Overall, human anionic trypsinogen contains only four disulfide bridges, which is unique among vertebrate trypsinogens, the large majority of which harbor six. Restoration of the missing disulfide by mutations S139C and S206C resulted in measurable stabilization against CTRC (Fig. 7A). Remarkably, essentially complete stabilization was achieved with combination of the restored disulfide bridge and elimination of the Leu-81, Arg-122, and Leu-148 cleavage sites (quintuple mutant L81A,R122A,S139C,L148A,S206C) (Fig. 7B). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no detectable cleavage fragments when the quintuple mutant was treated with 10 nm CTRC for 10 min (Fig. 7C, cf. Fig. 5A). Cleavage of the activation peptide close to its N terminus at Phe-18 by CTRC accelerates autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Mutation A16V increases N-terminal processing by CTRC and causes hereditary or sporadic chronic pancreatitis (see Fig. 1A) (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Selective study of CTRC-mediated cleavage at Phe-18 in wild-type anionic trypsinogen was hampered by the multitude of other cleavages; therefore, we used the stable quintuple mutant to estimate cleavage rates. Anionic trypsinogen was processed at Phe-18 by CTRC 5-fold faster than cationic trypsinogen (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, however, we did not observe acceleration of autoactivation in the presence of CTRC in any of the experiments involving anionic trypsinogen (see Figs. 4, 6, and 7), not even with the quintuple mutant where degradation is unlikely to mask a stimulatory effect. To allow for a better comparison of how CTRC-mediated cleavage at Phe-18 affects anionic and cationic trypsinogen, we generated constructs with shortened activation peptides, starting with Asp-19 instead of Ala-16 (Ala-Pro-Phe deleted, APF-del). When autoactivation of N-terminally truncated (APF-del) cationic and anionic trypsinogen was compared, the two isoforms exhibited contrasting effects; activation of cationic trypsinogen was markedly increased and that of anionic trypsinogen was reduced, relative to wild type (Fig. 8B). The causative role of cationic trypsinogen mutations in hereditary pancreatitis was discovered in 1996 (8Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A. Furey W. Sossenheimer M.J. Ulrich C.D. Martin S.P. Gates Jr., L.K. Amann S.T. Toskes P.P. Liddle R. McGrath K. Uomo G. Post J.C. Ehrlich G.D. Hereditary pancreatitis is caused by a mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar); however, a mechanistic understanding of how these mutations trigger the disease was not achieved until 2012 (10Szabó A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although increased trypsinogen activation as an intuitive model was suggested early on, biochemical studies demonstrated only a slightly increased propensity for autoactivation of mutant trypsinogens, which seemed insufficient to explain pathogenesis (23Sahin-Tóth M.

Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A breakthrough in our research came with the realization that a lesser known digestive enzyme, CTRC, controls activation of human cationic trypsinogen through proteolytic cleavage of regulatory sites (see Fig. 1A) (10Szabó A.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The most common hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations alter these cleavages resulting in more robust activation and higher trypsin levels (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of trypsinogen mutations, the protective effect of CTRC against pancreatitis can be compromised by loss-of-function mutations in CTRC, which increase risk for sporadic chronic pancreatitis (31Rosendahl J. Witt H. Szmola R. Bhatia E. Ozsvári B. Landt O. Schulz H.U. Gress T.M. Pfützer R. Löhr M. Kovacs P. Blüher M. Stumvoll M. Choudhuri G. Hegyi P. et al.Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) variants that diminish activity or secretion are associated with chronic pancreatitis.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As our mechanistic insight into how PRSS1 mutations cause hereditary pancreatitis advanced, the nagging question why PRSS2 mutations are not associated with the disease has remained unanswered. Anionic trypsinogen is expressed to high levels and is capable of rapid autoactivation (17Colomb E. Figarella C. Comparative studies on the mechanism of activation of the two human trypsinogens.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Colomb E. Figarella C. Guy O.

Properties of autocatalytic activation and degradation and implications in pancreatic diseases.Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lack of a pathogenic role may be due to stronger control by protective mechanisms in the pancreas. The findings of this study confirm this notion as they demonstrated that CTRC promotes degradation of anionic trypsinogen more effectively than it does with cationic trypsinogen. Furthermore, in stark contrast with cationic trypsinogen, CTRC does not stimulate autoactivation of anionic trypsinogen through processing of the activation peptide; in fact, a slight inhibitory effect was observed. We found that robust degradation of anionic trypsinogen by CTRC was explained by the presence of the additional Leu-148 cleavage site in the autolysis loop and the absence of the Cys-139–Cys-206 disulfide bridge, which seems to increase flexibility and exposure of secondary CTRC cleavage sites such as Tyr-37, Leu-41, Leu-166, and Leu-189 (see Fig. 1B). Complete stabilization of anionic trypsinogen against CTRC-mediated degradation during autoactivation required elimination of the Leu-81, Leu-148, and Arg-122 cleavage sites and restoration of the missing disulfide bridge. This stood in dramatic contrast to cationic trypsinogen where single mutations of Leu-81 or Arg-122 afforded essentially complete protection (see Fig. 3) (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M. Increased activation of hereditary pancreatitis-associated human cationic trypsinogen mutants in presence of chymotrypsin C.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although data are not shown, introduction of the Leu-148 cleavage site into cationic trypsinogen (A148L mutation) resulted in efficient degradation by CTRC even when Leu-81 was mutated. Furthermore, elimination of the Cys-139–Cys-206 disulfide bond from cationic trypsinogen (C139S,C206S double mutation) caused significant autolytic degradation indicating markedly increased proteolytic instability (data not shown). Taken together, the observations demonstrate that because of specific evolutionary differences between the otherwise highly similar human trypsinogen isoforms, anionic trypsinogen is more susceptible to CTRC-dependent degradation. Consequently, natural mutations are less likely to induce significant stabilization that would increase intra-pancreatic activation to pathogenic levels as seen with cationic trypsinogen mutations in hereditary pancreatitis. A seemingly paradoxic effect of CTRC on cationic trypsinogen is the stimulation of autoactivation by cleaving the activation peptide at Phe-18 (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. Chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) stimulates autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11879-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Relative to trypsinogen degradation, this stimulatory effect is almost negligible in 1 mm calcium (see Fig. 3A). However, PRSS1 mutations A16V and N29I stimulate cleavage at Phe-18 by 5.8- and 2.6-fold, respectively, leading to increased autoactivation and chronic pancreatitis (10Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M. Increased activation of hereditary pancreatitis-associated human cationic trypsinogen mutants in presence of chymotrypsin C.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20701-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The activation peptide sequence of anionic trypsinogen is identical to that of the cationic isoform, and as expected, anionic trypsinogen was also processed by CTRC at Phe-18. The rate of cleavage was 5-fold increased relative to cationic trypsinogen, and this is partly explained by the presence of Ile-29 (versus Asn-29) in anionic trypsinogen, which mimics the effect of the N29I mutation in cationic trypsinogen. Importantly, however, the N-terminal processing of anionic trypsinogen resulted in slight inhibition of autoactivation, indicating that natural mutations that might alter cleavage at Phe-18 in this isoform would not have a pathogenic effect. The opposing effects of CTRC on autoactivation of the two human trypsinogen isoforms are the consequence of Asp-218 in cationic trypsinogen, which is replaced with Tyr in anionic trypsinogen (25Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. The tetra-aspartate motif in the activation peptide of human cationic trypsinogen is essential for autoactivation control but not for enteropeptidase recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Asp-218 forms part of the S3 subsite and interacts with Asp-21 of the activation peptide resulting in electrostatic repulsion and inhibition of autoactivation (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 25Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. The tetra-aspartate motif in the activation peptide of human cationic trypsinogen is essential for autoactivation control but not for enteropeptidase recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This inhibitory interaction is partly relieved by CTRC-mediated cleavage of the activation peptide likely due to increased flexibility. Introduction of Asp-218 into anionic trypsinogen reconstitutes the CTRC-mediated stimulation of autoactivation, whereas a Tyr-218 replacement in cationic trypsinogen abolishes the effect (25Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. The tetra-aspartate motif in the activation peptide of human cationic trypsinogen is essential for autoactivation control but not for enteropeptidase recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although PRSS2 mutations may not be causative in hereditary pancreatitis, anionic trypsinogen still contributes to intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation and pancreatitis risk, as demonstrated by the small protective effect of the self-degrading G191R variant (14Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M. Landt O. Chen J.M. Kähne T. Drenth J.P. Kukor Z. Szepessy E. Halangk W. Dahm S. Rohde K. Schulz H.U. Le Maréchal C. Akar N.

As we observed in this study, single mutations may cause limited stabilization of anionic trypsinogen against CTRC, which can result in slightly elevated autoactivation. Such a biochemical change can, in turn, translate to a small but measurable increase in pancreatitis risk. Therefore, it is possible that pancreatitis-associated variants in PRSS2 will be discovered in the future; however, none of these are expected to confer the high penetrance disease risk observed with PRSS1 mutations. Despite this theoretical possibility, genetic investigations to date failed to identify such PRSS2 variants (14Witt H. Sahin-Tóth M. Landt O. Chen J.M. Kähne T. Drenth J.P. Kukor Z. Szepessy E. Halangk W. Dahm S. Rohde K. Schulz H.U. Le Maréchal C. Akar N. Ammann R.W. et al.A degradation-sensitive anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2) variant protects against chronic pancreatitis.Nat.

A possible caveat to this study is that native human trypsinogens are sulfated on Tyr-154 (32Sahin-Tóth M. Kukor Z. Nemoda Z. Human cationic trypsinogen is sulfated on Tyr-154.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5044-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previously, we compared properties of sulfated and non-sulfated anionic trypsinogen and found that sulfation slightly inhibited autoactivation and CTRC-mediated degradation (33Rónai Z. Witt H. Rickards O. Destro-Bisol G. Bradbury A.R. Sahin-Tóth M. A common African polymorphism abolishes tyrosine sulfation of human anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2).Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although these small effects of sulfation may change the quantitative aspects of some of our results, the main conclusions would remain the same. In summary, we found that intra-pancreatic activation of human anionic trypsinogen is prevented through CTRC-mediated degradation much more effectively than previously demonstrated for cationic trypsinogen. The observations offer a plausible explanation for the conspicuous absence of anionic trypsinogen mutations in hereditary pancreatitis. Z.

https://openalex.org/W2345700225,"Bcl-3 is an atypical member of the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (IκB) family. It associates with p50/nuclear factor-κB1 (NF-κB1) and p52/NF-κB2 homodimers in nuclei where it modulates transcription in a context-dependent manner. A subset of B-cell tumors exhibits recurrent translocations of Bcl-3, resulting in overexpression. Elevated expression without translocations is also observed in various B-cell lymphomas and even some solid tumors. Here we investigated the role of Bcl-3 in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colon tumors, a mouse model for colitis-associated colorectal cancers in humans. Contrary to expectations, Bcl-3 suppressed colorectal tumor formation: Bcl-3-deficient mice were relatively protected from DSS-induced epithelial damage and developed more polyps after AOM/DSS treatment, although polyp size was unaffected. DSS-challenged mutant mice exhibited increased recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, consistent with protection of the epithelium. Loss of Bcl-3 in intestinal epithelial cells was sufficient to increase tumorigenesis. The added tumor burden in mutant mice was dependent on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a tumorigenic, NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway that was dampened by Bcl-3. These findings reveal a tumor-suppressive role for Bcl-3 in this inflammation-associated cancer model. Bcl-3 thus functions as a tumor promoter or suppressor, depending on the cellular and environmental context."
