The mechanism of PS appearance during apoptosis is not well understood but has been associated with loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and nonspecific flip-flop of phospholipids of various classes. The human leukemic cell line HL-60, the T cell line Jurkat, and peripheral blood neutrophils, undergoing apoptosis induced either with UV irradiation or anti-Fas antibody, were probed in the cytofluorograph for (i) surface PS using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V, (ii) PS uptake by the aminophospholipid translocase using [6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino] caproyl] (NBD)-labeled PS, (iii) nonspecific uptake of phospholipids (as a measure of transbilayer flip-flop) using NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine, and (iv) the appearance of hypodiploid DNA. In all three types of cells undergoing apoptosis, the appearance of PS followed loss of aminophospholipid translocase and was accompanied by nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop. Importantly, however, in the absence of extracellular calcium, the appearance of PS was completely inhibited despite DNA fragmentation and loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity, the latter demonstrating that loss of the translocase is insufficient for PS appearance during apoptosis. Furthermore, while both the appearance of PS and nonspecific phospholipid uptake demonstrated identical extracellular calcium requirements with an ED50 of nearly 100 μm, the magnitude of PS appearance depended on the level of aminophospholipid translocase activity. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that while nonspecific flip-flop is the driving event for PS appearance in the plasma membrane outer leaflet, aminophospholipid translocase activity ultimately modulates its appearance.

The appearance of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane appears to be a universal phenomenon in cells undergoing apoptosis, or programmed cell death (1Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Importantly, outer leaflet PS likely serves as a signal in tissues for the noninflammatory engulfment of apoptotic cells (Ref. 2Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar and see “Discussion”), a distinctly different response than the pro-inflammatory events following tissue necrosis. While phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; NBD, [6[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino] caproyl]; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. is actively transported from the outer to the inner leaflet by the aminophospholipid translocase (3Verhoven B.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which PS appears in apoptosis is not well understood. Verhoven et al. (3Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) reported that PS appearance was accompanied by both loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and enhanced nonspecific transbilayer movement of phospholipids, perhaps due to activation of a “scramblase.” Hence, they proposed that PS may become detectable in the outer leaflet due to the combination of these two events. However, to date, the relative contribution of these two events has not been clarified. Additionally, it is not known what role, if any, other changes occurring during apoptosis (e.g. membrane blebbing and vesiculation) may play in the appearance of PS in the outer membrane leaflet. We hypothesized that the appearance of PS on the surface of the cell undergoing apoptosis would result primarily from enhanced calcium-dependent transbilayer movement of phospholipids (flip-flop) across the plasma membrane. Here we present data that demonstrates that (i) the loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity alone does not result in PS appearance, (ii) the appearance of PS likely results from calcium-dependent phospholipid flip-flop that is nonspecific for head group, (iii) while loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity is insufficient to result in PS appearance, loss of its function is probably a necessary event, and (iv) the appearance of PS at the cell surface can be dissociated from nuclear changes (DNA fragmentation) during apoptosis. The human leukemia cell line HL-60 and the human T cell line Jurkat were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Both HL-60s and Jurkats were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere and harvested while in log phase of growth at approximately 1.5 × 106 cells/ml for HL-60s, and 1 × 106 cells/ml for Jurkat. The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and resuspended as described below. Human peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated by the plasma Percoll density gradient method from healthy donors as described previously (6Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60s were plated at 2 × 106 cells/ml in either 35-mm dishes or 12-well plates in RPMI with calcium (550 μm) or without calcium (nominally present at 620 nm) from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin, with or without 5 μm cytochalasin D. Neutrophils were plated at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 12-well plates in RPMI with or without calcium with 0.25% human serum albumin. Apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation at 254 nm for 10 min (neutrophils) or 5 min (HL-60s). Both cell types were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere for 2 h (HL-60) or 4 h (neutrophils) or as indicated to allow the apoptotic phenotypes to develop. Apoptosis was also induced in neutrophils by the addition of mouse anti-human Fas IgM (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) (400 ng/ml) with continued exposure for 4 h. Jurkat cells were incubated at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Hepes-buffered saline (see below) for 3 h with mouse anti-human Fas IgM (100 ng/ml), or apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation at 254 nm for 10 min. In experiments in which calcium was added back, the cells were initially incubated in RPMI without calcium, and then Ca(NO3)2 added to the concentrations and at the times indicated, and the cells replaced in culture until the end of the incubation period. As stated in the text, in certain experiments, cells were incubated with the following agents: BAPTA/AM (10 μm) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); dl-α-tocopherol (0.06–2 mm) from Roche Vitamins and Fine Chemicals (Nutley, NJ);N-acetylcysteine (5 or 10 mm), dithiothreitol (1–10 mm), ascorbic acid (0.06–2 mm), and EGTA (2 mm) were purchased from Sigma. At the end of the incubation period, cell cultures were subdivided and samples simultaneously stained for surface PS, phospholipid uptake, and DNA degradation as described below. Several experiments were conducted to determine if the calcium flux alone was sufficient to induce annexin binding and a loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity. In these experiments, HL-60 cells (without apoptosis induction) were harvested, washed as above, and then treated with the indicated concentrations of ionomycin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere 30 min and stained as described below. Cells bearing PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet were identified as those binding FITC-labeled annexin V using an Apoptosis Detection Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The binding of FITC-labeled annexin V to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells closely correlates with the appearance of nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation by light microscopy (7Bratton D.L. Hamid Q. Boguniewicz M. Doherty D.E. Kailey J.M. Leung D.Y.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 211-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the appearance of hypodiploid DNA (see below). Briefly, 105 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of Hepes-buffered saline, and 100 ng of FITC-labeled annexin V and 500 ng of propidium iodide were added. The cells were incubated 15 min at room temperature, then the samples were transferred to ice and the sample volume brought to 0.5 ml. Analysis was done on a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) FACScan or FACScalibur flow cytometer, and the results were analyzed with PC Lysis software. Annexin positive cells were determined as described in the Apoptosis Kit by setting quadrants to separate viable cells from PI permeant cells, and non-apoptotic cells from those staining highly for the FITC-labeled annexin V probe. Percent apoptosis was determined from the cells staining greater than the control population threshold. Mean fluorescence of the PI impermeant cells was simultaneously determined. Phospholipid uptake was carried out in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), with or without CaCl2 as indicated. Calcium concentrations of buffers were confirmed by the use of the calcium determination kit (Sigma) utilizing Arsenazo III reagent, and by the indo-1 method (8Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Leslie C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and was 1 mm unless otherwise stated. NBD-labeled phospholipids (Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) were prepared by drying 1 μg/sample of 1-palmitoyl-1-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino] caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) or 1 μg of 1-palmitoyl-1-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino] caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (NBD-PS) in a glass tube. The lipids were then resuspended in 20 μl of HBS containing 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 0.25% bovine serum albumin (or “lipopolysaccharide-free” human serum albumin when used in conjunction with neutrophils or Jurkats). Previous studies have shown that these NBD-labeled probe lipids are readily solubilized in aqueous media containing albumin and will partition into the plasma membrane outer leaflet (3Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 10Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22517-22523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the incubation period, cells were harvested, washed once, and then resuspended in HBS (1 × 107 cells/ml). The cells (5 × 105 in 50 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of the lipid suspension and 5 μl of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min at room temperature. Albumin extraction of the plasma membrane outer leaflet to remove probe lipid that had not entered the cell was performed (3Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 10Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22517-22523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 50 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin or human serum albumin in HBS for an additional 5 min and then samples were transferred to ice and diluted with 900 μl of ice-cold HBS and analyzed in the cytofluorograph within 2 h. Early experiments demonstrated that the signal from the cell-associated lipid was stable during this time frame. The mean fluorescence values of the phospholipid uptakes were determined by setting quadrants in such a manner as to separate cells staining positively for propidium iodide (dead or highly-permeant cells) from viable cell populations. In initial experiments, uptake of NBD-labeled sphingomyelin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a measure of endocytosis (12Kok J.W. Babia T. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For all three cell types under the conditions of incubation, we saw no evidence for endocytosis of the probe. This suggested that the endocytic route was not utilized for entry of the other phospholipids and we used NBD-labeled phospholipid uptake as a measure of transbilayer phospholipid flip-flop (3Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 10Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22517-22523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in our and others previous studies, NBD-PS was taken up quickly and was largely unavailable for albumin extraction in control cells, as is characteristic of cells demonstrating aminophospholipid translocase activity (4Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Hervé P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Sune A. Bette-Bobillo P. Bienvenüe A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, NBD-PC, a probe lipid not transported by the aminophospholipid translocase, and used here as a probe for “nonspecific” transbilayer movement of phospholipids, was taken up minimally by control cells and remained largely available for albumin extraction (3Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 4Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Hervé P. Devaux P.F.

Additionally, HL-60s, unlike neutrophils and Jurkats, undergo vesiculation as well as the blebbing (zeiosis) exhibited by all three cell types. To address the possible role of blebbing and vesiculation in the appearance of PS and development of phospholipid flip-flop sites, cytochalasin D (Sigma), 5 μg/ml, was added to prevent vesiculation (16Cotter T.G. Lennon S.V. Glynn J.M. Green D.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar) and microscopic evaluation confirmed the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D on blebbing and vesiculation. With or without cytochalasin D, the results of lipid uptake were similar, thus ruling out blebbing or vesiculation as an event required for either enhanced lipid uptake or the appearance of PS. Metabolism of the NBD-labeled probes did not occur during the incubation and was demonstrated by TLC of cellular lipids extracted by the acidified Bligh and Dyer method used previously (17Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). DNA degradation was determined by the appearance of a hypodiploid fraction in permeabilized propidium iodide-stained cells. Neutrophils and HL-60 cells (5 × 105) were pelleted, washed once, then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), which was then brought to 80% ethanol. The cells were then held at −20 °C overnight. Jurkat cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50% ethanol and stored overnight at 4 °C. All cells were pelleted, and treated with 200 ng/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with 500 ng/ml propidium iodide. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C for at least an hour before analysis in the flow cytometer. Nuclear changes were confirmed microscopically and DNA fragmentation identified by characteristic “laddering” in agarose gels (7Bratton D.L. Hamid Q. Boguniewicz M. Doherty D.E. Kailey J.M. Leung D.Y.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 211-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium concentration in HL-60s was determined by the method of Lennon et al. (18Lennon S.V. Kilfeather S.A. Hallett M.B. Campbell A.K. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 1.5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) for the final 30 min of the desired incubation period in a 37 °C water bath with occasional agitation to keep the cells in suspension. The cells were then washed in HBS or RPMI salt solution with or without calcium, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 3 ml at 37 °C in a cuvette in a SLM 8000 C spectrofluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 336 and 536 nm, respectively. Following recording of the fluorescence corresponding to basal intracellular calcium, or for 15 min following calcium addition in the repletion experiments, Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.1% (v/v)) was added to lyse the cells and determine the maximum fluorescence on release of the dye into 1.2 mmcalcium. Minimum fluorescence was achieved by addition of EGTA (final concentration 10 mm) in 4 m Tris. The detection of outer leaflet PS was temporally associated with both loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and enhancement of nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop in all three cells types and with both apoptotic stimuli. As shown for UV-irradiated HL-60s and neutrophils, cells undergoing apoptosis were found to be positive for PS in the outer leaflet after a latent period of approximately 1 h (Figs. 1 and2). Ultimately, in these cultures 60 ± 4% of HL-60s and 73 ± 6% of neutrophils stained positively for FITC-labeled annexin V by 2 and 3 h incubation, respectively. Apparent initial stimulation of PS uptake was seen inconsistently for cultures of HL-60s (Fig. 1) followed in all cases by decline. The appearance of PS followed loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity as measured by uptake of NBD-PS. Recognizing the requirement of extracellular calcium in the enhancement of transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids (10Bratton D.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and a potential role in the inhibition of the aminophospholipid translocase (4Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Hervé P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), we asked whether extracellular calcium is necessary for the appearance of PS. As shown in Fig. 3, omission of calcium (nominally present at 620 nm) from the incubation medium resulted in complete lack of detectible outer leaflet PS in both UV-irradiated HL-60s and anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells (and neutrophils, not shown) which was comparable to control (nonapoptic) cells. This was in marked contrast to cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence of calcium. Importantly, dissociation of PS appearance in the outer leaflet from loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity (loss of PS uptake) was demonstrated, in that PS uptake was completely unchanged whether calcium was added (550 μm) or nominally present (620 nm) (Fig. 4). The data also clearly dissociated the appearance of PS from the nuclear changes of apoptosis since calcium deprivation did not block the development of hypodiploid DNA (Fig. 4).Figure 2Time course of membrane changes during UV-induced apoptosis of HL-60s and neutrophils.

Cancer. 1996; 32A: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it has been shown to inhibit apoptosis of neutrophils (24Whyte M.K.B. Hardwick S.J. Meagher L.C. Savill J.C. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus it was necessary to determine intracellular calcium concentration during apoptosis. Confirming the work of Lennonet al. (18Lennon S.V. Kilfeather S.A. Hallett M.B. Campbell A.K. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we found that over the time course of culture in calcium-containing media, HL-60s undergoing apoptosis demonstrated no elevation of intracellular calcium as measured by the intracellular calcium indicator fura-2 (Table I). Since measures of steady state intracellular calcium do not eliminate the possibility of calcium flux across the plasma membrane, we explored the requirement of extracellular calcium further by UV irradiating neutrophils and HL-60s in RPMI without calcium, culturing for 1 h, and then adding different concentrations of calcium. As shown for HL-60s, incubation under calcium depleting conditions resulted in a mean intracellular calcium concentration of 44 nm, which was followed by rapid (steady state levels achieved within 2 min) repletion of intracellular calcium when extracellular calcium was added (Fig. 5). Using this deplete-replete protocol, as shown in Fig. 6, both the appearance of PS and uptake of NBD-PC (i.e. phospholipid flip-flop) had nearly identical requirements for extracellular calcium. The appearance of PS as determined by mean fluorescence of FITC-labeled annexin V binding was found to be half-maximal (EC50) at 105 μm (± 12 μm S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, the calcium dependence of PC uptake was nearly identical and determined to be half-maximal (EC50) at 94 μm (±20 μm S.E.,n = 4) (Fig. 6 B), closely linking the calcium requirement of both PS and PC flip-flop.Table IIntracellular calcium (nm) during apoptosisIncubation time1 h2 hHL-60s, control110 ± 21116 ± 6HL-60s, post-UV109 ± 9100 ± 8Intracellular calcium (nm) was determined in control and UV-irradiated HL-60s incubated in calcium containing buffer for the designated periods of time by the fura-2 method.

Data shown as mean ± S.E.,n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular calcium (nm) was determined in control and UV-irradiated HL-60s incubated in calcium containing buffer for the designated periods of time by the fura-2 method. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., n = 4. No significant differences were seen between control and UV-irradiated cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that flux of extracellular calcium during apoptosis, even in the absence of discernible elevation of intracellular calcium, is absolutely required for the appearance of outer leaflet PS during apoptosis and confirms that outer leaflet PS results from nonspecific flip-flop of phospholipids. These data do not, however, address whether calcium flux is sufficient for the appearance of PS. To address this possibility, HL-60s were treated with ionomycin (25 nm to 2 mm) which resulted in the rapid development of intracellular calcium concentration up to 1 μm, nearly 10 times that seen during apoptosis. However, the appearance of outer leaflet PS did not occur and PS uptake was unchanged over 30 min following treatment with ionomycin (Fig. 7). Thus calcium flux alone is insufficient to mimic the membrane events of apoptosis. Furthermore, these data suggest the hypothesis that if the aminophospholipid translocase is functioning, PS is not detected in the outer leaflet despite calcium flux and enhanced phospholipid flip-flop (17Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it was noted in the course of these experiments that prolonged incubation (3 h) of HL-60s in the presence of ionomycin resulted in development of the full apoptotic phenotype as has been shown previously (23Park H.J. Makepeace C.M. Lyons J.C. Song C.W. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 540-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the appearance of PS, loss of NBD-PS uptake, enhanced NBD-PC uptake, and DNA degradation (data not shown). To determine the relative importance of aminophospholipid translocase activity compared with nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop in the appearance of PS, attempts were made to prolong aminophospholipid translocase activity during apoptosis. Since the aminophospholipid translocase has been shown to be susceptible to oxidant injury (25Bevers E.M. Tilly R.H.J. Senden J.M.G. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2382-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) a variety of agents were used to preserve activity. Dithiothreitol, ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and tocopherol (see “Materials and Methods”) alone, and in combination, were used without efficacy to preserve aminophospholipid translocase activity. As calcium has also been reported to inhibit aminophospholipid translocase activity (albeit at high concentrations (4Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Hervé P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)), intracellular (BAPTA/AM) and extracellular calcium (EGTA) were chelated. Loss of PS uptake was unchanged even in the presence of chelators demonstrating that loss of aminophospholipid activity is calcium independent. In the absence of specific inhibitors or enhancers of the aminophospholipid translocase, as an alternative approach we sought to exploit both the calcium deplete-replete model used above and the latency period prior to complete loss of the aminophospholipid translocase to determine the effect of aminophospholipid translocase function on the appearance of PS. For these experiments, HL-60s were UV irradiated and incubated in RPMI without calcium to inhibit PS appearance until subsequent calcium (550 μm) addition at either 1 or 2 h. One hour was chosen since there is residual PS uptake at this time by a functioning aminophospholipid translocase (37 ± 17% of control), while at 2 h there is little translocase activity (10 ± 2% of control) remaining (Fig.8). At both times NBD-PC uptake as a measure of nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop is equivalent. We hypothesized that if aminophospholipid translocase activity is important in limiting the appearance of PS by returning PS to the inner leaflet, then given equivalent calcium-induced nonspecific phospholipid flip-flop, we would expect to detect less outer leaflet PS at 1 h than at 2 h following UV irradiation. In support of this hypothesis, the appearance of PS (measured as both percent of FITC-labeled annexin V positive cells and mean fluorescence) following calcium addition at 1-h post-UV irradiation was significantly less than that at 2 h post-UV irradiation (Fig. 8). The increased appearance of PS at 2 h was not attributable to increased “leakiness” of the cells since the rise in intracellular calcium was more robust when calcium was added at 1 h than at 2 h post-UV irradiation (data not shown). Notably, regardless of when calcium was added back (1 or 2 h), if cells were assayed with FITC-labeled annexin V at 3 h post-UV irradiation, all demonstrated identical and maximal appearance of outer leaflet PS and DNA degradation (data not shown). Calcium is thought to play a role in many model systems of apoptosis (26McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 27Vito P. Lacana E. D-Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). For example, in thymocytes, an increase in intracellular calcium is thought to activate a calcium/magnesium-dependent endonuclease which leads to DNA fragmentation, and in many cells, elevation of intracellular calcium with the use of ionophores and/or thapsigargin can induce apoptosis (22Zhu W.-H. Loh T.-T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Park H.J. Makepeace C.M. Lyons J.C. Song C.W. Eur. J.

Along these lines, the oncogene bcl-2associated with inhibition of apoptosis, may act in part, by controlling extrusion of calcium from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (26McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent intracellular targets relevant to the process of apoptosis likely include endonucleases (26McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), transglutaminases (29Amendola A. Gougeon M.L. Poccia F. Bondurand A. Fesus L. Piacentini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1996; 20: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and importantly, the proteolytic cascades involving calpain (31Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar) and the caspases (32Martin S.J. Finucane D.M. Amarante-Mendes G.P. O'Brien G.A. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28753-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Kumar S. Trends Biochem.

Indeed, a recent report suggesting the appearance of outer leaflet PS requires caspase activation (32Martin S.J. Finucane D.M. Amarante-Mendes G.P. O'Brien G.A. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28753-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 35Naito M. Nagashima K. Mashima T. Tsuruo T. Blood. 1997; 89: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led us to experiments employing various interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (caspase) inhibitors. Several interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitors did inhibit the entire process of apoptosis, but were not useful in dissecting the downstream events leading to the appearance of PS. On the other hand, calcium flux alone is insufficient to produce the plasma membrane changes of apoptosis (Fig. 7 and Ref. 36Duke R.C. Witter R.Z. Nash P.B. Young J.D.-E. Ojcius D.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracellular calcium does not appear to be elevated in cells undergoing apoptosis in a number of models (Table I and see Ref. 28Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and may appear only as a late consequence of the apoptotic process (18Lennon S.V. Kilfeather S.A. Hallett M.B. Campbell A.K. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, elevated intracellular calcium can inhibit apoptosis in neutrophils (24Whyte M.K.B. Hardwick S.J. Meagher L.C. Savill J.C. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the appearance of PS in the outer leaflet is totally inhibited in the absence of extracellular calcium and can be dissociated from the other events of apoptosis, namely DNA degradation and loss of the aminophospholipid translocase activity. These data strongly suggest that calcium flux, even in the absence of a lack of net change in the concentration of intracellular calcium (TableI), is a necessary downstream event resulting in the appearance of PS. The data presented here using the calcium deplete-replete model indicate that extracellular calcium of 100 μm (resulting in intracellular calcium concentration of 87 ± 4 nm(S.E.)) (Fig. 5) is required for 50% detection of PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet of HL-60s, neutrophils, and Jurkats undergoing apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 6). We have previously demonstrated a similar extracellular calcium requirement for enhanced transbilayer movement of phospholipids in the erythrocyte ghost model (half-maximal between 50 and 100 μm (10Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22517-22523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a recently described 37-kDa “phospholipid scramblase” isolated from the erythrocyte and reconstituted in proteoliposomes showed a similar requirement for calcium (half-maximal activity between 20 and 80 μm) (37Basse F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Alternative “scramblases” have been suggested; one most recently from the work of van Helvoort (38van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) may be the MDR-1p-glycoprotein which can be inhibited by the calcium channel blocker verapamil. Our attempts to block both NBD-PC uptake and the appearance of PS with verapamil were unsuccessful in neutrophils, Jurkat, and in HL-60s (except in the latter when very high doses of verapamil were used (200 μm)), suggesting that MDR-mediated phospholipid scrambling is unlikely to be important in these cells when undergoing apoptosis. Other targets that may modulate transbilayer movement of phospholipids include transglutaminase (11Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and membrane tethering proteins (such as fodrin) which are the focus of ongoing studies. Importantly, we have shown that loss of the aminophospholipid translocase activity, like DNA degradation, is not dependent on extracellular calcium (Fig. 4) and that the nuclear events of apoptosis can be completely dissociated from the appearance of PS. While we were able to show that loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity alone was insufficient to result in the appearance of PS, we have not been able to ascertain the degree to which loss of this activity is necessary for the appearance of PS. Our attempts to preserve activity with antioxidants were unsuccessful. Since a candidate aminophospholipid translocase has recently been cloned (39Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), genetic tools to modulate its activity will likely be available in the near future. Our data using UV-irradiated HL-60s do suggest that residual activity (37%) of the aminophospholipid translocase can attenuate the appearance of PS in the outer leaflet (Fig. 8). The diminished PS detection at the earlier time point (1 h) may be likened to the model of the activated neutrophil where outer leaflet PS is not detected in the presence of aminophospholipid translocase activity despite enhanced nonspecific transbilayer movement (17Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the thrombin-stimulated platelet, modest outer leaflet PS can be demonstrated despite enhanced aminophospholipid translocase activity, presumably due to PS externalization from flip-flop in excess of PS internalization by the aminophospholipid translocase (15Tilly R.H.J. Senden J.M.G. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1990; 1029: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also note that while the appearance of outer leaflet PS in HL-60s, Jurkats, and neutrophils undergoing apoptosis was accompanied by both loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and enhanced nonspecific phospholipid uptake, there were some quantitative differences in the degree of loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and the enhancement of nonspecific flip-flop. Thus, it is quite probable that future studies will show differences in the relative contribution of these processes to the appearance of PS and phospholipid flip-flop in different cells undergoing apoptosis or activation.

The cause of this is an autocatalytic process dependent on the generation of a dihydric phenol substrate, which acts as an activator of the enzyme. Experiments with N-substituted dihydric phenol substrates (N-methyldopamine,N-acetyldopamine) demonstrate that oxygen consumption is retarded in the N-acetyl substituted material due to a diminished rate of cyclization.

Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is an enzyme widely distributed in nature that catalyzes the oxidation of monohydric phenols (such as tyrosine). It exhibits unusual kinetic properties. Its natural substrate is considered to be tyrosine, yet it exhibits an induction period or a lag phase in the oxidation of this substrate (1Lerner A.B. Fitzpatrick T.B. Calkins E. Summerson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lag phase is explained by an autocatalytic mechanism that depends on the elaboration of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) 1The abbreviations used are: DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; DQ, dopaquinone; DPDA,N,N-dipropyldopamine; NMDA,N-methyldopamine; NADA, N-acetyldopamine; DMTA, N,N-dimethyltyramine; COMT, catecholO-methyltransferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Gy, gray. 1The abbreviations used are: DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; DQ, dopaquinone; DPDA,N,N-dipropyldopamine; NMDA,N-methyldopamine; NADA, N-acetyldopamine; DMTA, N,N-dimethyltyramine; COMT, catecholO-methyltransferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Gy, gray. in the initial phase of the reaction pathway of melanogenesis. There are two main mechanistic theories of tyrosinase autocatalysis: (a) allosteric activation and (b) the recruitment hypothesis, which depends on the two-electron reduction of the active site of the enzyme by the oxidation of dihydroxy substrates. There has been some controversy in the literature regarding the method of generation of DOPA and, therefore, of the explanation of the kinetics. According to one view (2Cabanes J. Garcia-Canovas F. Lozano J.A. Garcia-Carmona F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Tudela J. Varon R. Garcia-Carmona F. Garcia-Canovas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3801-3810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) DOPA is formed directly by the hydroxylation of tyrosine, whereas according to the alternative view (4Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) DOPA is formed indirectly. The studies reported were made to attempt to distinguish between the two theories. According to the indirect theory, dihydroxy derivatives involve formation by nucleophilic attack on dopaquinone, either by external nucleophiles (e.g. thiols such as cysteine) or by nucleophilic groups attached to the quinone as in the case of DOPA, where the side chain amino group acts as an intramolecular nucleophile. The nucleophilic property of the amino group is due to the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen, and attack on the ring by the amino group is followed by re-aromatization, involving hydrogen transfer to give the corresponding catechol as shown in Reaction 1. Evidence from pulse radiolysis experiments (5Chedekel M.R. Land E.J. Thompson A. Truscott T.G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1984; 1984: 1170-1172Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicates that 5,6-dihydroxyindolene (cyclodopa) reacts rapidly with dopaquinone to give rise to two products, DOPA and dopachrome (Reaction 2). Thus, according to this scheme, DOPA in essence arises by disproportionation of dopaquinone (DQ), i.e. 2 DQ → DOPA + dopachrome, and is not a direct product of tyrosine hydroxylation by tyrosinase. If Reaction 2 is correct, it should be possible to prevent the autocatalytic activation of tyrosinase by inhibiting or modifying the intramolecular ring formation of dopaquinone. There are several possible approaches to this including the following. (a) Acidification of the microenvironment of the reactants will protonate the side chain amino group and hinder intramolecular reductive addition. We have previously demonstrated that the autocatalytic activation of tyrosinase is progressively abolished by acidification (4Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The importance of acidification of the milieu interiéur of the melanosome in the control of melanogenesis has been recognized but misinterpreted by most commentators (6Bhatnagar V. Anjaiah S. Puri N. Darshanam B.N. Ramaiah A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, acidification also inhibits the rate of oxidation by tyrosinase and is thus unsatisfactory. (b) Inhibition of cyclization by exclusion of reactive nucleophilic groups from the reaction system should be readily achieved by the choice of analogue substrates that lack appropriately placed side chain functionalities, but the presence of nucleophilic groups on the enzyme means that reductive addition to the quinone by external nucleophiles can still occur. (c) Inhibition of cyclization by ring substitution has been found unsatisfactory because ring substitution alters the ease of oxidation, as in the case of substitution of the ring hydrogens by fluorine, or it prevents access to the active site of the enzyme, as in the case of ring methylation (7Naish-Byfield S. Cooksey C.J. Latter A.M. Johnson C.I. Riley P.A. Melanoma Res. 1991; 1: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). (d) Consideration of the process of intramolecular cyclization of DOPA suggests that substitution of the hydrogen atoms on the amino group will interfere with the hydrogen redistribution following the lone pair electronic attack on the quinone ring. This paper reports the results of experiments withN-substituted tyrosinase substrates. Tyramine hydrochloride (Sigma, 1.0 g, 5.76 mmol) was suspended in methanol (10 cm3), and aqueous ammonia (d = 0.880) was added dropwise until the solid dissolved. Bromomethane (4 cm3) was added, and the solution was allowed to evaporate over 1 week. Large pale brown crystals (778 mg, 52% yield) were obtained (melting point of 257.6 °C, 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 400 MHz) 9.36 s (1H), 7.09d (8.4 Hz, 2H), 6.73d (8.4 Hz, 3.46 cm (2H), 3.11 s (9H), 2.91 m (2H)). This compound was prepared from 4-(3-bromopropyl)phenol (8Bell V.L. Giddings P.J. Holmes A.B. Mock G.A. Raphael R.A J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1986; I: 1515-1522Crossref Google Scholar) in the following way. 4-(3-Bromopropyl)phenol (310 mg) in chloroform (2 cm3) was added to trimethylamine (2 cm3). After 24 h, the mixture was diluted with chloroform (5 cm3), and the product was filtered to give a white solid (396 mg) in quantitative yield that was characterized by 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz), 7.66d (8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.35d (8.4 Hz, 2H), 3.58dd (2H), 3.54 s (9H), 3.12t (7.2 Hz, 2H), 2.54qui (2H). DPDA was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). All other substrates were from Sigma, and other reagents were of analytical grade. Tyrosinase from Agoricus bisporus (3400 units/mg) was obtained from Sigma. Tyrosinase was dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and frozen in aliquots of 5 ml. Aliquots were warmed to room temperature before use. Substrates were made up freshly in phosphate buffer; normally 2 mm stock solutions were used, from which small volumes (10–200 μl) were added to the reaction chamber. Spectrophotometry was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrometer (model 8452A). A cuvette holder was constructed to position a modified silica glass cuvette in the light path so that the beam passed through the solution just above the tip of a Clark-type oxygen electrode inserted through a 8-mm orifice cut in the side of the cuvette 1 cm from the bottom of the chamber. The electrode was connected to an oximeter (Yellow Springs Instruments Co., model 5300) with an analogue output to a chart recorder. The solution was stirred with a small magnetic stirrer bar inserted into a slightly ribbed 8-mm diameter polypropylene “flying saucer” (Lensden Apparatus). The oximeter was calibrated with air (100%) and 1% sodium dithionite (0%), and the voltage-independence of the electrode current was checked before each set of assays. All assays were conducted at room temperature (approximately 24 °C). Oxygen levels were calculated with a temperature correction from the tabulated oxygen partial pressure in 0.1 m buffer (9Chappel R.J. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The spectral data were recorded using the Hewlett-Packard single cell kinetics program from which kinetic data were calculated for absorption at specified wavelengths. The tabulated values together with the oxygen utilization data derived from the oximeter recording were used to derive relative rates of change and stoichiometric ratios. The stoichiometry of oxygen utilization was expressed as the ratio of mol of oxygen consumed (100% O2 = 820 nmol) to mol of substrate calculated from the concentration and volume added. The pulse radiolysis experiments were performed with a 9–12-meV Vickers linear accelerator, using 50–200-ns pulses with doses up to 30 Gy and quartz capillary cells of optical path 2.5 cm (10Keene J.P.

Generation of the one-electron oxidizing species Br·̄2 or N3⋅ was achieved by irradiating nitrous oxide-saturated aqueous solutions of 100 mm KBr or 3 mm NaN3. Under such conditions, Br·̄2 or N3⋅ radicals are formed within ∼0.1 μs after the radiation pulse via Reactions 3–7. Substrates (1 mm) were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with 14.9 units of mushroom tyrosinase in a water bath at 37 °C. Generation of a quinone product was measured using Besthorn's hydrazone (3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone), which forms a colored adduct with quinones. The extinction of the adduct was measured at 505 nm (13Winder A.J. Harris H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The assay of catechol O-methyltransferase activity was essentially as described by Smit et al. (14Smit N.P.M. Pavel S. Kammeyer A. Westerhof W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HPLC separation used a μBondapak TM C18 column with a mobile phase of 50 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid (pH 4.7), 10 mmNa2S2O5, 1 mm EDTA, and 25% methanol, infused by a Gynkotek pump, model 300. The eluate was monitored with a Jasco model FP-920 fluorescence detector set at 280 nm (excitation) and 320 nm (emission). NMR spectra were obtained in methanol-d using a Bruker AC300 NMR spectrometer with standard parameters. These calculations were carried out using the AM1 semiempirical method (15Dewar M.J.S.

The calculated properties for each molecule were found by minimizing the energy with respect to all independent geometrical variables. Calculated bond lengths and angles were in good agreement with standard values (15Dewar M.J.S. Zoebisch E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.J.P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (14978) Google Scholar). The set of reactions involved in tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of natural diphenolic substrates can be conveniently summarized in the following six successive steps. D+0.5O2QCD+QD+0.5O2CQDHI+0.5O2D+1.5O2→Q+H2O→CD→CQ+D→Q+H2O→DHI→IQ+H2O¯→IQ+3H2O(tyrosinase­catalyzed oxidation)(spontaneous reductive cyclization)(redox exchange)(tyrosinase­catalyzed oxidation)(spontaneous tautomerization)(tyrosinase­catalyzed oxidation)(overall)(step1)(step2)(step3)(step4)(step5)(step6) where D represents dihydric phenol (e.g. DOPA); Q is the corresponding ortho-quinone (e.g.dopaquinone); CD is cyclic dihydric product (e.g.cyclodopa); CQ is cyclic quinone (e.g. dopachrome); DHI is dihydroxyindole derivative (e.g.5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid); and IQ is corresponding indolequinone (e.g. indole-2-carboxylic acid-5,6-quinone). We have examined the overall oxygen stoichiometry of DOPA and dopamine oxidation (Table I) and obtained values of 1.42 and 1.46, respectively, consistent with the theoretical ratio of 1.5. The rate-limiting reactions are likely to be the spontaneous steps (steps 2, 3, and 5). In the case of dopaquinone it is known that the rate of reaction (step 3, the redox generation of dopachrome) is exceptionally rapid, with a rate constant of >109m−1 s−1 (5Chedekel M.R. Land E.J. Thompson A. Truscott T.G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1984; 1984: 1170-1172Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under neutral conditions the reductive cyclization of dopaquinone is also fast (k ∼ 3–4 s−1) (16Lambert C. Truscott T.G. Land E.J. Riley P.A. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1991; 87: 2939-2942Crossref Google Scholar) so that the initial four steps in DOPA oxidation generally proceed rapidly. Tautomerization of dopachrome in the absence of the enzyme dopachrome tautomerase is a slow reaction and constitutes the rate-determining step leading to indolequinone (and the subsequent reactions of melanogenesis). Examination of the oxygen utilization kinetics of DOPA oxidation (Fig.1) shows that there is a rapid initial phase (phase Ia) of oxygen utilization with a stoichiometry of approximately 0.5 mol of oxygen/mol of substrate followed by a slower phase (phase Ib) accounting for a further 0.5 mol of oxygen/mol of substrate corresponding to steps 1 and 4. Since 5,6-dihydroxyindole oxidation in the presence of tyrosinase is rapid, the slow oxygen utilization rate (∼5 nmol of O2/min in phase II) is a measure of the rate of spontaneous tautomerization (step 5) under the experimental conditions. The oxidation kinetics of dopamine show the same pattern (data not shown).Table IOxygen utilization stoichiometry of tyrosinase substratesStoichiometry expectedStoichiometry observed1-aThe number of experimental determinations is shown in parentheses.Monohydric phenols Tyrosine2.02.01 (1) Tyramine2.01.94 (3) N-Acetyltyrosine2.01.93 (1) DMTA1-bOxidation by catechol-activated tyrosinase.1.00.97 (3) N,N,N-Trimethyltyramine1.00.98 (1)Dihydric phenols DOPA1.51.42 (2) Dopamine1.51.46 (2) NMDA1.00.95 (1) NADA1.00.89 (1) DPDA0.50.49 (5)1-a The number of experimental determinations is shown in parentheses.1-b Oxidation by catechol-activated tyrosinase. Open table in a new tab To investigate the conditions affecting the cyclization reaction, we examined phase I tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of three substituted dopamine analogues: N-methyldopamine (NMDA),N-acetyldopamine (NADA) andN,N-dipropyldopamine (DPDA). The comparative behavior of these substrates when oxidized by tyrosinase is illustrated in Fig. 2. These patterns were independent of the substrate concentration over the limited range possible with the apparatus used (maximum oxygen content was 820 nmol). The patterns of oxygen consumption are consistent with differences in the rates of the cyclization step (step 2). NMDA exhibited rapid phase I oxidation, whereas NADA exhibited a fast oxygen utilization to a stoichiometric ratio of approximately 0.5 followed by a nearly linear subsequent oxidation to reach a stoichiometry of nearly 1.0 (Table I) after a 7.5-min incubation. Since step 4 is identical to step 1 (the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of the dihydric phenol substrate), the slow rate of oxygen uptake is indicative of a slower rate of secondary substrate generation. DPDA was rapidly oxidized with a final oxygen stoichiometry of 0.495 ± 0.08 (Table I). This result indicates that steps 3 and 4 do not take place when DPDA is used as substrate. Simultaneous spectrophotometry showed the formation of a product with a maximum absorbance at 290 nm (Fig. 3) The molar extinction coefficient of the product, assuming complete conversion of the substrate to the product, was estimated as 4100 at 290 nm. The rate of product formation was double the rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 3).Figure 3Tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of DPDA.Shown is a comparison of the amount of product formed calculated from the change in absorption at 290 nm with the oxygen utilization shown by polarimetry.

The UV absorption spectrum was sensitive to pH. Titration with molar HCl diminished the absorbance in the shoulder regions (246 and 306 nm) (Fig. 4). The enzyme-generated product was isolated by evaporation at 0.01 mm Hg to give a crystalline solid, which was extracted with methanol. Filtration and evaporation of the filtrate at 0.01 mm gave a pale brown solid. Column chromatography on Silica Gel 60 eluting with 5:1 chloroform/methanol and then with 20:4:1 chloroform/methanol/acetic acid gave two fractions that, when analyzed by TLC (aluminum foil-backed Silica Gel 60, visualized with iodine vapor), showed separation of a single product (R F 0.19) from the starting material (R factor 0.35). Evaporation of the appropriate fractions gave colorless oils that solidified. The 1H NMR spectra were examined in CD3OD. Electron impact mass spectrometry at 70 eV of the fractions recovered from the NMR solvent showed small peaks at m/e 237, 238, and 239 for the starting material (C14H21D2NO2 = 239) andm/e 236 and 237 for the product (C14H21DNO2 = 237). The NMR spectrum of the product showed that it is a cyclic indolene. The aromatic ring protons were singlets at 6.94 and 6.80 ppm; the indolene ring protons were coupled triplets at 4.13 and 3.18 ppm; and the propyl groups showed two coupled doublets (4.9 Hz) of quartets (12.5 Hz) at 3.67 and 3.51 ppm, 2H multiplets at 1.73 and 1.42 ppm, and a methyl group triplet (7.4 Hz) at 0.95 ppm. A COSY spectrum showed the expected proton coupling pattern. These data are identical to those obtained from synthetically prepared material 2J. Clews, C. J. Cooksey, P. J. Garratt, E. J. Land, C. A. Ramsden, and P. A. Riley, submitted for publication. and are consistent with the indolium-5-olate structure shown in Fig.5 a. AM1 molecular orbital calculations indicate that this structure (Fig. 5 a) is more stable than the isomeric indolium-6-olate (Fig. 5 b). This result is in agreement with expectations, since for the indolium-5-olate a favorable resonance structure can be written that places the negative charge on a carbon atom adjacent to the positively charged nitrogen atom (Fig. 5 a). At pH >7 we therefore expect the betaine to be present in solution as the indolium-5-olate isomer. To prepare and investigate the properties of the ortho-quinone ofN,N-dipropyldopamine, the corresponding semiquinone was initially formed by pulse radiolytic one-electron oxidation of the catechol. On the basis of earlier studies (17Sugumaran M. Semensi V. Kalyanaraman B. Bruce J.M. Land E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Land E.J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 803-810Crossref Google Scholar), it was anticipated that disproportionation of this semiquinone would lead to formation of the required ortho-quinone. One-electron oxidation of DPDA was carried out by irradiation of an N2O-saturated 1.0 mm solution in the presence of excess KBr, buffered to pH 7.0 with phosphate. The spectrum obtained when most of the initial product, the semiquinone, had decayed showed little absorbance around 400 nm characteristic of the expectedortho-quinone. However, a comparison of the decay of the semiquinone at its peak at 310 nm with the transmission-against-time curve observed at 400 nm provided evidence of a delayed growth at 400 nm over ∼0.5 ms after the pulse that could be due to a short livedortho-quinone (lifetime approximately several milliseconds). Since catecholamine ortho-quinones can become longer lived upon changing from neutral to acid conditions (16Lambert C. Truscott T.G. Land E.J. Riley P.A. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1991; 87: 2939-2942Crossref Google Scholar, 19Thompson A. Land E.J. Chedekel M.R. Subbarao K.V. Truscott T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) the above experiment was repeated at pH 6. The spectrum with a wavelength maximum around 400 nm thus obtained (Fig. 6) is attributed to the ortho-quinone of DPDA. An extinction coefficient of 1400 m−1 cm−1 was obtained for the ortho-quinone at 400 nm at pH 6.0 based on a yield of oxidizing radicals of 0.62 μm/Gy (20Butler J. Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Prutz W. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1984; 23: 265-270Google Scholar). Thisortho-quinone appeared to decay unimolecularly with a rate constant of 48 s−1 into a stable species absorbing increasingly below 300 nm. No stable product absorbing around 480 nm that could be attributed to a “chrome” species analogous to dopachrome (19Thompson A. Land E.J. Chedekel M.R. Subbarao K.V. Truscott T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was formed. It was not practicable to study the spectrum of the stable product below 300 nm using 1.0 mm DPDA on account of the strong parent absorption in this region at such concentrations. However, since N3· radicals tend to react at least an order of magnitude faster with catechols than Br·̄2 (21Cooksey C.J. Land E.J. Rushton F.A.P. Ramsden C.A. Riley P.A. Quant. Struct. Act. Relat. 1996; 15: 498-503Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it was still possible with 0.1 mm DPDA to obtain practically complete scavenging of the alternative one-electron oxidant N3· and make spectroscopic observations inside the region of DPDA parent absorption down to 250 nm. Thus, an experiment using N2O-saturated 0.1 mm DPDA in the presence of excess NaN3 buffered to pH 6.0 showed that a stable product with a difference absorption maximum at 290 nm was formed, and the rate of formation of this product was identical to the rate of decay of the ortho-quinone at 400 nm. It is suggested that the final product results from the unimolecular cyclization of the DPDA-derived ortho-quinone formed via Reactions 8 and 9. To compare the product absorption spectrum found pulse radiolytically with that obtained enzymatically at physiological pH, the above experiment was repeated at pH 7.2. Based on a yield of N3· radicals of 0.62 μm/Gy (20Butler J. Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Prutz W. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1984; 23: 265-270Google Scholar), the absolute spectrum of the DPDA-derived oxidation product, corrected for parent DPDA depletion, presented in Fig. 4, can be seen to be identical to that of the product found by enzymatic oxidation. The general set of reactions involved are the same as those set out for dihydric phenol substrates except that the first step (1a) involves the generation of the corresponding ortho-quinone from the monophenol and involves two atoms of oxygen: M + O2 → Q + H2O (tyrosine-catalyzed oxidation), where M represents monohydric phenol substrate (e.g. tyrosine). This results in an overall oxygen stoichiometry for the six reactions leading to indolequinone of 2.0 mol of oxygen/mol of substrate. We examined the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of tyrosine and tyramine and confirmed this stoichiometric ratio (Table I). In the case of monohydric phenol substrates, the kinetics of oxygen utilization showed a pronounced lag period but were in other respects similar to DOPA and dopamine, as were the corresponding spectral changes (data not shown). We examined the oxidation of N-substituted monohydric phenols, including N-acetyltyrosine,N,N-dimethyltyramine (DMTA), andN,N,N-trimethyltyramine. The phase I oxygen uptake rates are shown in Fig. 7.N,N,N-Trimethyltyramine showed the shortest lag and the most rapid phase I oxidation. This was expected, since the charged quaternary nitrogen terminus of the side chain prevents cyclization and, therefore, the substrate behaves like other noncyclizing compounds such as 4-hydroxyanisole, where attack on the ring by nucleophilic groups on the enzyme accounts for the activation (4Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).N-Acetyltyrosine oxidation exhibited a pronounced lag period followed by rapid oxidation to a relative oxygen stoichiometry of approximately 1.0. Spectrophotometry showed coincident rates of formation of a (quinone) product with an absorption peak at 420 nm. This was succeeded by a slow oxidation, accounting for a further 0.5 mol of oxygen/mol of substrate. This observation is consistent with the results of tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of NADA indicating that the rate of cyclization is inhibited by the acetyl substituent on the nitrogen. This strongly suggests that the lag period is prolonged by the slow cyclization. This conclusion is reinforced by the data in the case of DMTA, where no significant oxidation was observed. However, this substrate was oxidized by tyrosinase in the presence of trace amounts of DOPA. DOPA at equivalent concentration to DMTA (100 μm) is rapidly oxidized with an oxygen stoichiometry of 1.5, but trace amounts of DOPA (0.1 μm) consumed a negligible amount of oxygen (Fig. 8). In the presence of this trace amount of DOPA, DMTA was oxidized by tyrosinase with a final stoichiometry of approximately 1.0 (Table I). Except for a slight difference in the oxidation rate this DOPA-stimulated oxidation of DMTA was independent of whether the DOPA was added before or after DMTA was introduced into the reaction vessel (Fig. 8). The oxygen stoichiometry of DMTA oxidation in the presence of trace amounts of DOPA was independent of the substrate concentration. The DMTA oxygen uptake was half that of tyramine (Fig.9). Other dihydric phenol substrates, including DPDA, were also effective in activating tyrosinase oxidation of DMTA. Preincubation of tyrosinase with DPDA was able to initiate the subsequent oxidation of DMTA (Fig.10).Figure 8Oxygen utilization kinetics during the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of DOPA and 400 nmol of DMTA in the presence of trace amounts of DOPA.

The absorption spectrum of the DMTA oxidation product was indistinguishable from that of the indoliumolate product of DPDA oxidation and exhibited a closely similar extinction coefficient at 290 nm. The indoliumolate, separated by HPLC, was insensitive to oxidation by silver nitrate in alkaline solution (using a 1:5 mixture of 0.1m silver nitrate and 5 m ammonium hydroxide). The DMTA oxidation product was also unreactive to an excess of sodium thiosulfate or dithiothreitol. We conclude that the indoliumolate generated by tyrosinase oxidation of DMTA exhibits oxidation-reduction properties that differ significantly from those of catechols orortho-quinones. Nevertheless, the indoliumolate was capable of methylation by COMT. Prolonged incubation led to the formation of a single major product with a retention time of 7.1 min with concurrent loss of the substrate (retention time of 4.8 min), suggesting that only one methylation product is formed (Fig.11). Our data demonstrate that dialkyl substitution of the side-chain amino group of N,N-dipropyldopamine results, on oxidation by tyrosinase, in the formation of a stable product. Pulse radiolysis experiments show that a product with the same spectral absorption is rapidly formed from the correspondingortho-quinone. The compound has a peak absorption at 290 nm with an estimated molar extinction coefficient of 4500 ± 400m−1 cm−1. The proton NMR spectrum is consistent with a cyclic product with a structure represented in Fig. 5. The cyclic product is not readily susceptible to oxidation or reduction, and there is no evidence that it reacts with the corresponding dopaminequinone. The failure to undergo redox exchange with N,N-dipropyldopaminequinone and hence to generate further substrate for tyrosinase oxidation is consistent with the observed oxygen stoichiometry of 0.5, which accounts for the following reaction: DPDA + 0.5 O2 → DPDQ →N,N-dipropylindoliumolate, where DPDQ =N,N-dipropyldopaminequinone. This contrasts with the oxidation of DOPA or dopamine in which the kinetics are complicated by further oxidation reactions, which account for the observed oxygen stoichiometry. In these cases the rate-limiting steps are the cyclization of dopaquinone and the conversion of dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (or the corresponding decarboxylated derivatives), which account for the kinetics of oxygen utilization (Fig. 1). The spectral data are consistent with the initial rapid tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation yielding dopaquinone and subsequently dopachrome as the major chromogens followed by a slower conversion to indolequinone. Oxidation of tyrosine and tyramine were found to proceed with characteristic lag kinetics. The oxygen stoichiometry was 2.0, consistent with the reaction scheme outlined (Scheme 1). When N,N-dimethyl tyramine was used as substrate, no significant oxidation took place. However, if the enzyme was primed with a trace amount of DOPA ( 11000 of the DMTA concentration) the substrate was oxidized with an oxygen stoichiometry of 1.0. The oxygen consumed by oxidation of the added DOPA was negligible. DOPA initiated the oxidation of DMTA when added either prior or subsequent to the monohydric phenol substrate. Dopamine and DPDA also acted as activators of DMTA oxidation by tyrosinase. The stoichiometry data show that, once the enzyme is activated by a dihydric phenol substrate, DMTA is oxidized to the correspondingortho-quinone, which, by analogy with DPDA, forms a stable cyclic product, DMTA + O2 → Q → N,N-dimethylindoliumolate, where Q representsN,N-dimethyldopaminequinone. This product has an absorption spectrum closely similar to the DPDA cyclic product. It is separable by HPLC from a reaction system consisting of DMTA and activated tyrosinase as a single peak, and this material was shown to be monomethylated by COMT. These results indicate that the reactions involved terminate with the formation of the stable cyclic product (Scheme 2). The failure of autoactivation of tyrosinase when DMTA is used as substrate is only explicable in terms of the theory that the dihydric phenol activator is formed indirectly by the disproportionation of theortho-quinone, since this reaction does not occur in the case of the N,N-dialkyl-substituted substrates. If the dihydric phenol substrate were to be formed directly as the hydroxylation product of the monohydric substrate, the oxidation of DMTA would exhibit kinetic characteristics similar to tyrosine or tyramine oxidation. Thus, the failure of autocatalytic oxidation of DMTA constitutes proof that the activating dihydric phenol is not directly generated. We conclude that tyrosinase does not possess two separable activities,i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA oxidase; the enzyme catalyzes the production of ortho-quinones from both monohydric and dihydric phenols. This is entirely consistent with the studies of Solomon and Lowery (22Solomon E.I. Lowery M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which show that the oxidation product is released as the quinone from a catecholate coordination complex with the copper atoms at the active site of the enzyme. The unusual kinetic behavior of tyrosinase is due to its activation by dihydric phenol substrates. Our data show that these are indirectly formed in a manner essentially as proposed by Evans and Raper (23Evans W.C. Raper H.S. Biochem. J. 1937; 31: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of dihydric phenol substrates could be by an allosteric mechanism (e.g. as proposed by Hearing et al.(24Hearing V.J. Ekel T.M. Montague P.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 13: 99-103Google Scholar), but there are good mechanistic reasons for supposing that it is due to recruitment of met-enzyme by reduction of the copper atoms at the active site as shown by Lerch (25Lerch K. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 13. Marcel Dekker, New York1981: 143-186Google Scholar). We have previously published evidence to support this second mechanism of tyrosinase autocatalysis (4Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)."

Living cells actively maintain low cytoplasmic sodium ion concentrations against large, inwardly directed Na+gradients. In animal cells, the intracellular Na+/K+ ratio is largely dependent on the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase, a P-type ion pump, that drives Na+ ions out of the cell in exchange for K+ ions (1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant Na+ gradient serves as the primary energy source for the transport of other ions and metabolites via an array of secondary, Na+-coupled carriers. In lieu of sodium, plants and fungi utilize H+-coupled circuits, driven by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, PMA1, also a member of the P-ATPase family (2Serrano R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Mechanisms for dealing with toxic concentrations of Na+have only recently begun to be elucidated at a molecular level, but are of increasing urgency as soil salinity rises and poses a significant threat to agricultural production worldwide (4Serrano R.

Because of a basic similarity in ion transport processes, the use of yeast as a model system to identify genes involved in halotolerance is of particular applicability to higher plants. The recent availability of the complete genome sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has brought to light unexpected homologs of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic Na+ transporters, providing a convenient starting point for dissecting the individual contributions of these transporters toward sodium tolerance. Multiple transport pathways, all of which are under complex regulation, appear to mediate cellular Na+ homeostasis in S. cerevisiae. One route of Na+ entry is thought to be the K+ transporters, TRK1 and TRK2 (6Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Ko C.H.

The primary pathway for Na+extrusion from the cell is through the P-type ion pumps encoded by thePMR2/ENA locus, consisting of an unusual tandem array of nearly identical genes (PMR2A-E; Refs. 13Rudolph H.K.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Three distinct genes encoding putative Na+/H+antiporters have been identified by the genome sequencing project. One of these, NHA1, was recently cloned by selection for increased NaCl tolerance from a multicopy genomic library (19Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.-L. Sychrova H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although activity and localization of the NHA1 protein has not yet been established, it is homologous (40% identity) to a plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, encoded by thesod2 gene in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which mediates Na+ extrusion at acidic to neutral pH (20Jia Z.-P. McCullough N. Martel R. Hemmingsen S. Young P.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Disruption of NHA1 confers significant Na+ sensitivity in a strain lacking the PMR2locus, but only a weak phenotype in a wild-type background.

A third yeast gene, YDR456w, encodes a protein sharing significant homology (∼30% identity) with the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE1–4) in animal cells (25Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The latter play physiologically vital roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, in Na+concentration, and in cell volume control. Activation by a variety of growth factors, hormones, and cytoplasmic acidosis leads to H+ extrusion from the plasma membrane, in exchange for an influx of Na+ ions (reviewed in Refs. 26Wakabayashi S.

In this work, we report that mutations in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, PMA1, confer Na+ tolerance in yeast. We show that the mutant cells sequester Na+ in a slowly exchanging pool, and that this sequestration is mediated via the yeast homolog of the mammalian amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger, which we term NHX1. All strains used in this study are isogenic to W303 (ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1) (28Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Spontaneous Na+-tolerant suppressors of calcineurin deficiency were isolated independently in two strains described previously (29Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), K473-2 (MATa pmc1::LEU2 cnb1-2) and K482-3 (MATα pmc1::TRP1 cnb1-3), by selection on YPD agar medium supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl. After 3 days at 30 °C, a single Na+-tolerant colony was picked from each patch, purified, and subjected to complementation testing. Of 41 independent suppressors, 35 were recessive and defined two complementation groups of 33 and 2 alleles, respectively. The remaining six suppressors were dominant or semidominant; after crossing with the parent of the opposite mating type, four alleles were tightly linked topmc1::TRP1 and one allele was tightly linked topmc1::LEU2 (zero recombinants in 26 complete tetrads). The PMC1 gene encodes a vacuolar Ca2+pump, which plays no detectable role in Na+ tolerance and is adjacent to the PMA1 gene. Complementation tests with well characterized alleles of pma1 (30Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed all five suppressors linked to PMC1 are alleles of PMA1. Strains K638 (PMA1) and K804 (pma1-α4) areMATα derivatives of W303 carryingpmc1::TRP1 and pmr2::HIS3(Δpmr2A-E) null alleles. YR89 (Δpmr2A-E) was a gift from Hans Rudolph (University of Stuttgart, Germany). YPD medium contained 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone (all from Difco), and was adjusted to pH 7 with sodium phosphate, where indicated. APG is a synthetic minimal medium containing 10 mm arginine, 8 mm phosphoric acid, 2% glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and trace minerals and vitamins, at pH 6.7, as described (11Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, NaCl was added, or the pH was adjusted to 5.0 by addition of acetic acid. Growth assays were performed by inoculating 1 ml of APG medium in a multiwell plate with 2–5 μl of a saturated seed culture. Growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm after culturing for 48 h at 30 °C. The chromosomal pma1alleles were rescued by digestion of genomic DNA with PstI, to release a ∼23-kilobase pair fragment containing the disruptedpmc1 gene (29Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and the adjacent pma1 gene. After treatment with DNA ligase and transformation into E. coli, AmpR plasmids were recovered, and a 4.8-kilobase pairHindIII fragment containing intact pma1 was cloned into the yeast centromeric vector YCplac111 (31Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into strain YR89 (Δpmr2A-E) using the lithium acetate procedure (32Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of YCplac111-based plasmids containing various fragments of the pma1-α4 allele, subcloned into wild-type PMA1, were generated and also introduced into strain YR89. By comparison of the Na+-tolerant phenotype conferred by the plasmids, the mutation in the pma1-α4allele was localized to a 615-base pair fragment betweenBstEII and EcoRI, and identified by DNA sequencing. A single base change, G → A, resulting in the substitution Glu367 → Lys, was found. The NHX1 gene was cloned by amplification of genomic DNA from K638 using the polymerase chain reaction and the following primers: sense primer 5′-CGCCATTGTGTATCCATTTATGC-3′ at −598 from the initiating codon ATG, and the antisense primer 5′-CTCACCAATTATACGAGTAG-3′ at +350 from the terminating codon TAG. The amplified product was digested with HindIII andNheI, and the resultant 2662-base pair fragment cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). A null allele (nhx1::URA3) was constructed by replacement of the 1286-base pairEcoRV-SpeI fragment of NHX1 with a 1-kilobase pair SmaI-HindIII fragment of URA3, after treatment of DNA fragments with Klenow enzyme to create blunt ends. Yeast strains were grown in APG medium, supplemented where indicated with 20 mmNaCl, to a density of 0.9–1.4 OD600 units/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in APG medium ± 20 mm NaCl (depending on growth conditions), and resuspended in the same medium at a density of 4–8 × 108cells/ml. Uptake was initiated by diluting the cells with an equal volume of APG medium containing NaCl at a final concentration of 20 mm and 22NaCl (NEN Life Science Products) at 13–30 μCi/ml. Samples were incubated at 23 °C, and at the indicated times aliquots were withdrawn and the reaction quenched by the addition of ice-cold AP medium containing 75 mmpotassium gluconate. The reaction mixture was rapidly filtered through 0.45-μm HAWP membranes (Millipore) and washed twice with 6 ml of quench buffer. Radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In assays of 22Na efflux, cells were loaded with 22NaCl exactly as above. After incubation for 45 min, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 1% glucose, 0.6 m sorbitol), and resuspended in the same buffer at room temperature. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn, filtered, and processed as described above. Steady-state labeling of cells with22Na was performed in 1 ml of APG medium containing 1–4 μCi of 22NaCl and varying concentrations of nonradioactive NaCl. Cultures were incubated at 23 °C for 96 h, after which the cells were collected by rapid filtration. Filters were washed twice with 6 ml of APG medium, and radioactivity assessed by liquid scintillation counting. The optical density of a duplicate, nonradioactive culture was measured to quantitate growth. After labeling with 22Na as described above, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold Buffer A (see above), and resuspended at 1 × 108cells/ml in Buffer A, essentially as described by Anraku and co-workers (33Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One half of the suspension was permeabilized by addition of CuSO4 to a final concentration of 500 μm, while the other half received an equal volume of water (22.5 μl). After incubation at 23 °C for the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn, filtered, and processed as described above. To assay22Na influx in permeabilized cells, cultures (2 × 108 cells/ml) were preincubated with 500 μmCuSO4 in Buffer A for 1 h as above. Uptake was initiated by diluting cells with an equal volume of Buffer A supplemented to give a final concentration of 20 mm NaCl, 9 μCi/ml 22Na, 2 mm Tris-ATP, and 500 μm CuSO4. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn for filtration as above. Calcineurin promotes Na+ tolerance by increasing expression of thePMR2A/ENA1 gene (17Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakamura T. Liu Y. Harata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and by converting the K+ transport system to a high affinity, Na+discriminatory state (12Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Loss of calcineurin function, as incnb1 mutants, therefore causes sensitivity to high salt conditions. To learn more about salt tolerance in yeast, we isolated spontaneous Na+-resistant suppressors of thecnb1 mutants by selection on YPD medium supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl. Five dominant mutations were mapped to thePMA1 locus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All five mutations in PMA1 conferred different degrees of Na+ tolerance (Fig.1 A), and Li+tolerance (data not shown), relative to the parent strains. All five Na+-tolerant mutations in PMA1 also conferred sensitivity to H+ (low pH) and were recessive to wild type for this phenotype. Several pma1 alleles isolated in genetic screens not involving high salt (30Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were also found to be recessive for H+ sensitivity and dominant or semidominant for Na+ tolerance when calcineurin is inactivated (data not shown). These results suggest the Na+-tolerant alleles ofPMA1 are loss-of-function mutations with regard to H+ pumping and thus are referred to as recessivepma1 alleles. Because of its strong Na+-tolerant phenotype,pma1-α4 was chosen for further analysis. The mutant allele was rescued from the chromosome, subcloned, and partially sequenced (see “Experimental Procedures”) to reveal the nature of the mutation: a single amino acid substitution, Glu367 → Lys, within the highly conserved phosphorylation domain of the ATPase (Fig. 1 B). ATPase activity measured in total membrane preparations, was reduced by 45%, relative to the PMA1 control (data not shown). Mutations in the immediate vicinity of this residue (Ser368) have been reported to cause a similar reduction in ATPase activity, H+ pumping, and defects in membrane potential (34Perlin D.S. Brown C.L. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18118-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was unlikely that the pma1-α4mutant had gained a novel ability to pump Na+ ions, despite its dominance over PMA1 in Na+ tolerance. The Na+-tolerant phenotype of the pma1-α4 mutation was also found to be independent of the entire PMR2 locus, in the absence or presence of calcineurin function (Fig.1 C). This ruled out the possibility that PMR2 expression or function was improved by the pma1 mutant. Finally, it should be noted that the effects of pma1-α4 on Na+tolerance were found to be completely independent of the vacuolar Ca2+ transporters encoded by PMC1 andVCX1 (data not shown), mutations in which were included in some experiments for technical reasons. These results suggest thatpma1-α4 promotes Na+ tolerance through processes independent of calcineurin and the PMR2-encoded Na+ efflux pumps. Because the plasma membrane H+-ATPase generates the driving force for active transport, we tested the hypothesis that reduced influx of Na+ in the pma1-α4 mutant contributes to Na+ tolerance. Fig.2 A shows the time course of22Na uptake by the pma1-α4 mutant (K804) and the isogenic PMA1 strain (K638), after culture in APG medium lacking NaCl (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previous work has shown that under these conditions, uptake of monovalent cations (K+, Rb+) is in the low affinity mode and is unaffected by dissipation of the H+ gradient in response to protonophore addition or ATP depletion (11Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, initial rates of 22Na uptake were similar in both mutant and control, although at longer time points, uptake in the mutant consistently exceeded that of the PMA1 control cells (Fig. 2 A). A shift in the cation uptake system to a high affinity, K+-selective mode has been reported to occur within 4 h of K+ depletion from the growth medium; under these conditions, transport is sensitive to protonophore addition and ATP depletion and is dependent on the TRK1 transporter (11Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of the K+-selective mode has also been reported to occur after exposure to Na+ or Li+ in the growth medium (9Haro R. Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that, after growth in APG medium containing 20 mm NaCl, 22Na uptake in the control strain K638 was drastically reduced, consistent with increased discrimination against Na+ ions. Furthermore, uptake was reduced by an additional 2-fold in the pma1-α4mutant, relative to control. The results demonstrate that, after salt adaptation, the pma1-α4 mutation increases Na+tolerance by limiting Na+ influx, possibly through modulation of the TRK1 transporter. External pH had a striking effect on Na+ tolerance; at neutral pH, the pma1-α4mutant (K804) grew to higher cell densities (10-fold relative to control, K638) in response to increasing concentrations of NaCl (Fig.3 A). However, Na+tolerance increased with decreasing pH and was similar in bothpma1-α4 mutant and control strains at pH 5 (Fig.3 B). To assess intracellular Na+ levels, cells were grown to saturation in APG medium containing 22NaCl (0.1 μm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled NaCl (see “Experimental Procedures”). Surprisingly, accumulation of Na+ in the sodium-tolerant mutant exceeded that of control cells, by 2–5-fold, in media containing tracer 22Na alone (Fig. 3, C and D, inset). As external NaCl concentrations increased, intracellular Na+ in the mutant reached stable levels at both pH values tested (Fig. 3,C and D) and correlated with a similar stability in cell density. Overall, a 7-fold increase in external NaCl concentrations elicited only a 2-fold increase in intracellular Na+ in the mutant. In PMA1 control cells, a similar response was observed at pH 5; in contrast, at neutral pH, intracellular Na+ rose by 12-fold over the same range and was accompanied by a drastic decline in cell density. Thus, the ability to limit intracellular Na+ levels correlates with sodium-tolerant growth. To determine the intracellular distribution of sodium, plasma membranes were selectively permeabilized by exposure to Cu2+ ions, as described by Anraku and co-workers (33Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 50% of intracellular Na+ in the pma1-α4 mutant appeared to be retained in a Cu2+-resistant pool under all conditions tested (Fig. 3, E and F). By comparison, in the PMA1 control, approximately 90% of intracellular Na+ was released after Cu2+ treatment of cells grown in media containing low NaCl. Based on a previous demonstration (33Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the Cu2+ permeablization technique allows the specific extraction of cytosolic pools of ions, amino acids, and other metabolites, our results strongly suggest a cytoplasmic localization of sodium in the PMA1 control cells. After exposure to higher concentrations of NaCl, particularly at acidic pH, Na+sequestration in the PMA1 control increased to levels comparable to the pma1 mutant. A range of control experiments, including assays of 45Ca2+ uptake, release of nucleotides, and turbidity changes in the cell suspension (33Ohsumi Y. Kitamoto K. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used to confirm that both mutant and control cells were equally permeabilized by the treatment with Cu2+ ions (data not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate that thepma1-α4 mutation enhances the ability to sequester Na+ in an intracellular pool, and that this sequestration may contribute significantly to halotolerance. Based on previous observations that reduced H+ pumping inpma1 mutants leads to reductions in cytoplasmic pH (36Vallejo C.G. Serrano R. Yeast. 1989; 5: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that cytosolic pH may be a controlling factor in sodium tolerance. Because cytoplasmic acidosis has been shown to activate the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger in mammalian cells (37Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that activation of a similar exchanger might mediate Na+ tolerance in yeast. Systematic sequencing of the yeast genome has uncovered a gene present on chromosome IV (YDR456w), encoding a protein of 633 amino acids that we have named NHX1 on the basis of homology with the family of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE1–4) found in mammals and other vertebrates, as well as in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and the euryhaline crab Carcinus maenas (Fig.4). We analyzed the effect of targeted disruptions of this gene in the following isogenic set of yeast strains: K601 (W303- derivative; see “Experimental Procedures”), K638 (Δpmc1 Δpmr2 PMA1), and K804 (Δpmc1 Δpmr2 pma1-α4). In each of these genetic backgrounds, disruption ofNHX1 led to a significant decrease in Na+tolerance at pH 4 or 5 (Fig. 5,B, D, and F), substantiating its prominent role in mediating salt tolerance at acid pH. At neutral pH, however, the disruption had little or no effect on sensitivity to Na+ in the PMA1 strains (Fig. 5, Aand C). In striking contrast, disruption of NHX1effectively nullified the Na+-tolerant phenotype of thepma1-α4 mutant at neutral pH (Fig. 5 E). The results demonstrate that Na+ tolerance in thepma1-α4 mutant is largely mediated by the putative Na+/H+ exchanger, NHX1.Figure 5Effect of NHX1 gene disruption on Na+ tolerance. Growth was monitored as a function of NaCl concentrations in APG medium at the indicated pH. Open symbols denote the Δnhx1 strain; the isogenic parent strain is shown in closed symbols. Parent strains and relevant genotypes are as follows.

In the PMA1control strain, addition of Cu2+ elicited an immediate efflux of 22Na, with less than 10% remaining in 20 min. By contrast, efflux of 22Na was slow and biphasic in thepma1-α4 mutant, with approximately 50% remaining in the cells after treatment with Cu2+ for 2 h. Disruption ofNHX1 in the pma1-α4 mutant effectively nullified the ability to sequester sodium, resulting in almost complete release of intracellular 22Na upon permeabilization of the plasma membrane. The data also indicated that, in the absence of Cu2+ treatment, 22Na efflux was low or absent in all three strains (Fig. 6 A). Thus, there was no evidence that NHX1 was involved in a Na+ efflux mechanism in thepma1 mutant cells; instead, the data suggest that thePMR2/ENA pumps are the major route for Na+efflux. Uptake of 22Na was also monitored in Cu2+-permeabilized cells (Fig. 6 B). The results demonstrate a substantial enhancement of Na+ uptake into Cu2+-resistant compartment(s) in thepma1-α4 mutant, relative to the PMA1control, that is completely abolished by the disruption inNHX1. Thus, a putative Na+/H+exchanger is required for sequestration of Na+ within an intracellular, Cu2+-resistant pool, possibly the vacuole. One possibility is that mislocalization of the mutant pma1protein to an intracellular compartment may stimulate Na+/H+ exchange by contribution of a proton motive force, although a plasma membrane localization for pma1-α4 has been confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). We suggest that cytoplasmic acidosis, caused by the pma1-α4 mutation or by growth in low pH conditions, increases expression or function of NHX1 to promote Na+ tolerance. Mutations in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase confer sensitivity to weak acids and low extracellular pH, reflecting a reduced ability to pump protons from cells (39McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The resultant defect in the electrochemical H+ gradient is also believed to be responsible for the observed resistance of pma1 mutants to cytotoxi"

Mutations corresponding to the human MH mutations were made in a full-length rabbit RYR1 cDNA, and wild type and mutant cDNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells. After about 48 h, intact cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+indicator, fura-2, and intracellular Ca2+ release, induced by caffeine or halothane, was measured by photometry. Ca2+release in cells expressing MH or CCD mutant ryanodine receptors was invariably significantly more sensitive to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane than Ca2+ release in cells expressing wild type receptors or receptors mutated in other regions of the molecule. Linear regression analysis showed that there is a strong correlation (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) between caffeine sensitivity of different RYR1 mutants measured by the cellular Ca2+ photometry assay and by the clinical in vitro caffeine halothane contracture test (IVCT). The correlation was weaker, however, for halothane (r = 0.49, p > 0.05). Abnormal sensitivity in the Ca2+ photometry assay provides supporting evidence for a causal role in MH for each of 15 single amino acid mutations in the ryanodine receptor.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) 1The abbreviations used are: MH, malignant hyperthermia; CCD, central core disease; IVCT, in vitrocaffeine halothane contracture test; CHCT, caffeine halothane contracture test. is an autosomal dominant muscle disorder in which genetically susceptible individuals among populations of humans and domestic animals respond to the administration of potent inhalational anesthetics and depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants with high fever and skeletal muscle rigidity (1Britt B.A. Schonbaum E. Lomax P. Thermoregulation: Pathology, Pharmacology and Therapy. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 179-292Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S.

The Rockefeller University Press, New York1995: 89-100Google Scholar). Central core disease (CCD) is a rare, non-progressive myopathy, presenting in infancy and characterized by hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness (4Shy G.M. Magee K.R. Brain. 1956; 79: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). An important feature of CCD is its close association with MH susceptibility (5Denborough M.A. Dennett X. Anderson R.M. Br. Med. J. 1973; 1: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although diagnosis of CCD is made on the basis of the lack of oxidative enzymatic activity in central regions of skeletal muscle fibers (6Dubowitz V. Pearse A.G.E. Lancet. 1960; : 23-24Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the only accepted diagnostic test for MH susceptibility in humans is the North American caffeine halothane contracture test (CHCT) (7Larach M.G. Anesth. Analg. 1989; 69: 511-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or its European counterpart, the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) (8European Malignant Hyperthermia Group Br. J. Anaesth. 1984; 56: 1267-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These tests are based on the hypersensitivity of contracture, induced in muscle strips obtained by biopsy, in the presence of caffeine or halothane. Early genetic linkage studies showed that a single amino acid mutation, Arg615 → Cys (R615C), in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) is tightly linked to MH in swine (8European Malignant Hyperthermia Group Br. J. Anaesth. 1984; 56: 1267-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,9Fujii J. Otsu K. Zorzato F. de Leon S. Khanna V.K. Weiler J.E. O'Brien P.J. MacLennan D.H. Science. 1991; 253: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Further genetic and biochemical data have supported the view that this mutation is causal of MH in swine and humans (2MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutation (R614C) has been linked to MH in some human families (11Gillard E.F. Otsu K. Fujii J. Khanna V.K. De Leon S. Derdemezi J. Britt B.A. Duff C.L. Worton R.G. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1991; 11: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 12Hogan K. Couch F. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Anesth. Analg. 1992; 75: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but in other families, discordance has been reported (13Deufel T. Sudbrak R. Feist Y. Rubsam B. Du Chesne I. Schafer K.L.

Greenberg C.R. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Discordance raises questions concerning the causal nature of such mutations, but other reasons for discordance include the possibility that two MH mutations might be segregating in one family or that the in vitro contracture test for MH susceptibility fails to provide a phenotypic diagnosis of MH with sufficient accuracy for genetic analysis (15MacLennan D.H. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Analysis of the CHCT as a diagnostic test for MH indicates that it can achieve 97% sensitivity and 79% specificity, 2Allen, G. C., Larach, M. G., and Kunselman, A. R., (1997) Anesthesiology, in press. whereas the IVCT can achieve 99% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity (17Ording H. for the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group Acta Anesthesiol. Scand. 1997; 41: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The IVCT protocol permits an equivocal diagnosis (MHE) if the muscle biopsy responds to either caffeine or halothane, but not both. To date, 17 point mutations have been described in humanRYR1. Amino acid residue 4 (Gly4) in the rabbitRYR1 sequence, expressed in this study, is deleted in the human RYR1 sequence, accounting for discrepancies in numbering of these mutations in the two species. Twelve mutations have been linked to human MH only (C35R, G248R, G341R, R552W, R614C, R614L, R2163C, V2168M, T2206M, G2435R, R2458C and R2458H), and five have been linked to human CCD plus MH (R163C, I403M, Y522S, R2163H, and R2436H) in several human families (11Gillard E.F. Otsu K. Fujii J. Khanna V.K. De Leon S. Derdemezi J. Britt B.A. Duff C.L. Worton R.G. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1991; 11: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Chen H.S.

These mutations clearly fall in two distinct clusters in the linear sequence of RYR1 lying between residues 35 and 614 and between residues 2163 and 2458. Of these mutations, only the human R614C mutation has been characterized thoroughly in the form of the corresponding R615C mutation in swine. In this case, gating has been confirmed to be more sensitive to caffeine and halothane than the normal Ca2+release channel in tests utilizing vesicles (28Ohnishi S.T. Taylor S. Gronert G.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 161: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), single channel assays (29Fill M. Coronado R. Mickelson J.R. Vilven J. Ma J. Jacobson B.A. Louis C.F. Biophys.

J. 1994; 301: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The G2434R mutation has been shown to have higher than normal [3H]ryanodine binding in human MHS muscle, an indication of its greater open probability (33Richter M. Schleithoff L. Deufel T. Lehmann-Horn F. Herrmann-Frank A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5256-5260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the remainder of these mutations, there is no biochemical evidence to support their causal role in MH susceptibility. Strong linkage data are available for several of the mutations, but others, such as the G248R mutation, found in the RYR1 gene in a single MH family of five members (11Gillard E.F. Otsu K. Fujii J. Khanna V.K. De Leon S. Derdemezi J. Britt B.A. Duff C.L. Worton R.G. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1991; 11: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), or the I403M mutation, found in two members of a single, small CCD pedigree (20Quane K.A. Healy J.M.S. Keating K.E. Manning B.M. Couch F.J. Palmucci L.M. Doriguzzi C. Fagerlund T.H. Berg K. Ørding H. Bendixen D. Mortier W. Linz U. Müller C.R. McCarthy T.V. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), could represent rare polymorphisms rather than causal mutations. A method of demonstrating defects in these and other mutations that would associate them in a functional way with MH and/or CCD is an important goal. In this study, we have introduced each of 15 known MH mutations into a rabbit RYR1 cDNA, expressed each mutation in HEK-293 cells, and measured the intracellular responses of wild type and mutated channels to caffeine and halothane. The caffeine and halothane sensitivities of RYR1 mutants, measured in the Ca2+ photometry assay and by the clinical IVCT, were compared. The study shows that each mutant protein is more sensitive to the Ca2+-releasing effects of caffeine and halothane than the wild type channel. A strong correlation was observed between the caffeine sensitivities measured in the two assays, but a weaker correlation was observed for halothane sensitivities. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, Promega, and Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibody 34C (34Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Judith Airey, University of Nevada, Reno. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) and pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes. Caffeine was from Sigma, and ryanodine was obtained from AgriSystems International (Windy Gap, PA). Halothane was from Fluka. All other reagents were of reagent (or highest available) grade. The cloning and expression of the full-length rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) cDNA has been described previously (35Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M.S. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Chen S.R.W. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Barlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as all of our mutations are confirmed by sequence analysis, it was necessary to develop a series of “cassettes” that can be removed from full-length RYR1 for mutagenesis and sequencing using standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). As the first step, we dividedRYR1 cDNA into 11 cassettes by utilization of five endogenous unique restriction endonuclease sites and the introduction of five new unique sites at intervals of about 1500 bases, as shown in Fig. 1 B. The five endogenous restriction endonuclease sites are marked above the long horizontal bar in Fig.1 B, and the five restriction endonuclease sites introduced into RYR1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis are markedbeneath the long horizontal bar. The 5′XbaI site and the 3′ HindIII site were unique sites introduced into the clone earlier (36Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). To work with these cassettes, two new vectors, pBS1 and pBS2, were also constructed by the introduction of additional restriction endonuclease sites into the multiple cloning site between BamHI and Sma I in pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene). The multiple cloning site in pBS1 containsBamHI-BglII-NdeI-StuI-AatII-BspMII-HpaI-SmaI and, in pBS2, containsBamHI-NdeI-MluI-AvrII-BstBI-SplI-Bsu36I-NheI-SmaI restriction endonuclease sites. In the introduction of the new restriction endonuclease sites by mutagenesis, the HpaI (1686)/HpaI (7155) fragment from RYR1 cDNA (pBS-RYR1) was subcloned into pBS1 to yield plasmid pBS1-H. Two restriction endonuclease sites,BstBI (3798) and MluI (5355), were introduced into pBS1-H to yield pBS-HBM. The XhoI (6600)/XhoI (12317) fragment from pBS-RYR1 was subcloned into Bluescript SK II(+) to yield pBS-X. Two restriction endonuclease sites, SpeI (6822) and AvrII (9804), were then introduced into pBS-X to yield pBS-XSA. The NdeI (11290)/ClaI (14427) fragment from pBS-RYR1 was subcloned into pBS1 to yield pBS1-NC, and then the NdeI (11290)/SacII (13015) fragment from pBS1-NC was subcloned into pBS1 to yield pBS-NS. A restriction endonuclease site,NheI (12675), was introduced into pBS1-NS to yield pBS1-NSN. The three fragments from pBS1-HBM, pBS-XSA and pBS1-NSN, with five newly introduced restriction endonuclease sites, were subcloned back into pBS-RYR1 to yield pBS-RYR1c in the Bluescript KS vector. The 11 cassettes were subcloned from pBS-RYR1c into pBluescript KS(+), pBS1, and pBS2 to yield pBS-RYR1cs1–11 as follows: XbaI (Bluescript)/SalI (677), SalI/Bsu36I (2349), Bsu36I/BstBI (3798),BstBI/MluI (5355),MluI/SpeI (6822), SpeI/SplI (8461), SplI/AvrII (9804),AvrII/NdeI (11290),NdeI/NheI (12675),NheI/ClaI (14427), andClaI/HindIII (Bluescript). The full-lengthRYR1 cDNA, with introduced restriction endonuclease sites (pBS-RYR1c) (Fig. 1 B), could not be cloned into the PMT2 vector, which has EcoRI, XbaI,SalI, and EcoRI cloning sites. Accordingly, PBS-RYR1c was digested with HindIII at a unique site, blunt-ended, and digested with XbaI to obtain a full-length XbaI-blunt fragment. This was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pMT2 (a gift of Dr. R. Kaufman, Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) after blunt-ending the SalI site and digesting the XbaI site. Some mutant clones were introduced directly into the XbaI-HindIII site of an expression vector pcDNA3(−) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Short fragments were removed from pBS-RYR1cs1, pBS-RYR1cs2, or pBS-RYR1cs6, as indicated by the small bar in Fig. 1 C, and ligated into the polylinker region of Bluescript, pBS1, or pBS2 for site-specific mutagenesis by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mutated segment of the cDNA insert was checked by sequencing the entire insert by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sangeret al. (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). Fragments containing mutations were subcloned back into their original position in pKS-RYR1 or pKS-RYRc vectors for expression in HEK-293 cells. Mutations R164C, G249R, G342R, I404M, Y523S, and R615C were subcloned into the original pMT2-RYR1 vector, and mutations G2435R and R2436H were subcloned into the pMT-RYR1c vector. Mutations C36R, R553W, R615L, R2163C, R2163H, R2458C, or R2458H were subcloned into pcDNA3(−) vector. The expression of wild type cDNA in all these vectors yielded virtually identical expression levels and activities. HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm minimal Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, 4.5 g of glucose/liter, and 10% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DNA transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Chen and Okayama (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Ten μg of plasmid DNA were used to transfect 2 × 105 cells/60-mm plate. Control cells were treated in the same way, but with no DNA or with expression vector DNA. Immunocytochemical staining was carried out as described by Chen et al. (36Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 34C (a kind gift from Dr. Judith Airey) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were used to detect expressed ryanodine receptor protein in HEK-293 cells. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and p-nitrotetrazolium chloride blue (Sigma) were used in the development of the color reaction. Immunoblotting was performed on total proteins collected from one 60-mm plate of whole cells using detergent solution, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated first with monoclonal antibody 34C at a dilution of 1:500 and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary IgG at a dilution of 1:5000 in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% BSA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20). Finally, the blots were incubated with the SuperSignal ultra chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to a BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). A Photon Technologies Inc. (PTI) microfluorimetry system was used to measure the effect of caffeine on Ca2+ release by the different ryanodine receptor proteins expressed in HEK-293 cells. Briefly, cell culture and DNA transfection were carried out as described above. Growth medium was replaced 20 h after transfection, and Ca2+ photometry was carried out on intact cells about 48 h after transfection (44Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded with 1 μm fura-2 AM, 0.02% pluronic F-127 for 30 min at pH 7.4, and room temperature in a physiological medium (KRH) containing, in mm: NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; MgSO41.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2; glucose, 6; Hepes-NaOH buffer, 25 (45Malgaroli A. Milani D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The glass coverslips were placed in a holder on the stage of an inverted Diaphot microscope (Zeiss Canada). The samples were excited alternately at 340 nm and 380 nm using a dual monochromator. The emitted fluorescence was filtered through a 510-nm filter, before feeding into the photomultiplier tube. Averaged light intensities over excitation periods of 0.05 s at each of the two wavelengths were used to calculate the 340/380 nm ratio using Felix (PTI) software. Ca2+ transients are presented as the ratio of fura-2 emission with no attempt to calculate [Ca2+] i . Bathing solutions containing incremental levels of caffeine or halothane were added on one side of the stage and aspirated on the opposite side. Each solution was then washed out over a period of a few minutes before addition of the next increment of releasing buffer. Dose-response curves were generated and normalized to the maximal release response observed at 10 mm caffeine for both the caffeine and the halothane responses. The standard European IVCT protocol (8European Malignant Hyperthermia Group Br. J. Anaesth. 1984; 56: 1267-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) was used in all diagnoses provided. The laboratory of origin of these tests and their detailed analysis is provided by Manning et al.3 Linear regression analysis was performed using Origin software (Microcal software Ltd., Northampton, MA). An unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons of mean values between samples. A value ofp < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. The cloning, sequencing, and functional expression of RYR1 cDNA have been reported previously (35Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M.S. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Sphingolipids and their metabolic derivatives elicit a wide variety of eukaryotic cellular responses (1Saba J. Obeid L. Hannun Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Speigel S. Merrill A. FASEB. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Although the stimuli and biological end points differ in each cell type, the role of sphingolipid by-products as second messengers in specific, growth regulatory signal transduction pathways appears to be a universal theme among eukaryotic cells (3Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S-1-P) 1The abbreviation used is: S-1-P, sphingosine 1-phosphate. are both catabolites of sphingolipid breakdown, which have been shown to modulate DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation in mammalian cells (4Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that S-1-P is largely responsible for these effects. In addition, S-1-P has recently been shown to inhibit the growth, motility, and invasiveness of tumor cells (5Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9686-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 6Spiegel S. Olivera A. Zhang H. Thompson E. Su Y. Berger A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Free sphingosine and S-1-P are maintained at very low levels in mammalian cells (7Merrill A. Wang E. Mullins R. Jamison W. Nimkar S. Liotta D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that potent second messengers would be tightly regulated in the absence of a particular stimulus. The mechanism(s) by which the intracellular levels of sphingosine and S-1-P are regulated have not been established. Such control could occur at the synthetic stage, via regulation of the activities of ceramidases and sphingosine kinase (8Buehrer B. Bell R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, control could occur at the catabolic stage, through regulation of the activity of sphingosine phosphate lyase (9Veldhoven P.V. Mannaerts G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 69-98Google Scholar). Sphingolipids exist in yeast where they provide vital yet unknown functions (10Wells G. Lester R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we cloned the sphingosine phosphate lyase gene through its ability to suppress sphingosine-induced growth suppression when present on a high-copy vector in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following yeast strains were used: SGP3 (leu2–3,112 trp1 ura3–52 his3 ade8 ras1::HIS3), JS14 (SGP3 [pRS202-BST1]); JS16 (SGP3 bst1Δ::NEO); JS29 (SGP3bst1Δ::NEO [pYES2-BST1]); Jk93d (ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his4 trp1 rme1). The pRS202 library used in all transformations was constructed by Connelly and Heiter. 2C. Connelly and P. Hieter, unpublished data. The vector is a modified version of the pRS306 vector, into which a 2-micron plasmid piece was inserted. Inserts from this library are approximately 6–8 kilobases in length. Wild type yeast were transformed with the high-copy library, selected for uracil prototrophy, and transformants were pooled and replated at a concentration of 106 cells/plate onto 1 mmd-erythro-sphingosine plates. Six transformants which grew large colonies on 1 mmd-erythro-sphingosine plates were grown in selective medium, and control SGP3 colonies were grown in minimal medium, at 30 °C until saturated. Absorbance at 660 nm was used to correct for small variations in cell concentration between cultures. Serial dilutions were performed, and cells were template-inoculated onto 1 mmd-erythro-sphingosine plates, incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The creation of genomicbst1Δ alleles was performed by replacing BST1with kanMX, which confers resistance to G418. The kanMX marker replaced all sequence between nucleotide 396 and 1770 of the 1770-base pair open reading frame, creating a 1373-base pair deletion. Disruption was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA from G418-resistant clones, using primers to genomic sequence just 5′ and 3′ to the region replaced by the disruption. Uptake and metabolism studies were performed using [C3-3H]sphingosine (NEN Life Science Products). Specific activity of sphingosine was 22 Ci/mmol, 0.1 mCi/ml. Cells were incubated in a volume of 5 ml for varying times with sphingosine at a final concentration of 1 μm, final specific activity of 0.4 mCi/μmol and cell density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were harvested, washed in sterile water, and subjected to Bligh-Dyer extraction (14Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). Radioactivity present in the aqueous (upper) phase of the Bligh-Dyer extraction of whole cells was determined using a standard scintillation counter. TLC conditions for initial evaluation of sphingosine recovery were butanol:acetic acid:water (3:1:1). Identification of the unknown lipid as sphingosine 1-phosphate was performed under the following conditions, with the resulting R F values: butanol:water:acetic acid (3:1:1), 0.47; chloroform:methanol:water (60:35:8), 0.22; chloroform:methanol:water:acetic acid (30:30:2:5), 0.33. Sphingosine phosphate lyase activity was determined essentially as described (11Veldhoven P.V. Mannaerts G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), using unlabeledd-erythro-dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) andd-erythro-dihydrosphingosine [4,5-3H]1-phosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Specific activity was 100 mCi/mmol. We had previously observed that long chain sphingoid bases inhibit proliferation of S. cerevisiae cells in liquid culture. To determine whether this inhibition could be employed in a selection scheme, 1 × 106 exponentially growing yeast cells were inoculated onto 1 mmd-erythro-sphingosine plates and incubated for several days. Under these conditions growth was completely inhibited, whereas no growth inhibition occurred with eitherl-erythro-sphingosine or stearylamine. The stereospecificity of sphingosine-induced growth inhibition indicated interaction with a biological target or receptor. Our strategy was to transform wild type yeast cells with a yeast genomic library carried on the pRS202 high-copy shuttle vector (12Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a selectable nutritional marker (URA3) and then to subject pooled transformants tod-erythro-sphingosine selection. Utilizing this approach, we expected to identify S. cerevisiae genes involved in sphingolipid signal transduction and/or metabolism. Numerous clones which demonstrated between 100- and 1000-fold greater resistance to sphingosine than the parent strain were identified (Fig.1 A). The most highly represented insert, 13-1, was subcloned and sequenced identifying a novel gene on S. cerevisiae chromosome IV, which we namedBST1 (bestower of sphingosinetolerance) (GenBank™ accession number U51031; S. cerevisiae genome data base accession number YDR294C). TheBST1 nucleotide sequence encodes a predicted protein of 65,523 kilodaltons and 589 amino acids in length. This sequence is 23% identical to gadA and gadB, two nearly identicalE. coli genes encoding glutamate decarboxylase, a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of the neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid. To explore the function of BST1, a deletion strain was created through homologous recombination using aNEO-selectable marker (13Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Whereas our original selection was performed in the SGP3 yeast strain due to its high transformation efficiency, we were concerned that the deletion of the RAS1gene in this strain might complicate phenotypic analysis ofBST1 deletion. Therefore, deletion of BST1 and all subsequent biological studies were performed in both SGP3 and another strain, JK93d. Heterozygous diploids were sporulated and spores segregated 2:2 for G418 resistance. Both G418-resistant and-sensitive progeny were viable, indicating that BST1 is not an essential gene. Despite weak nucleotide sequence homology between BST1 andgadA/gadB, analysis of glutamate decarboxylase activity in cytosolic extracts from wild type, BST1 overexpression andbst1Δ strains refuted the notion that BST1encodes the S. cerevisiae homologue of glutamate decarboxylase (data not shown). However, deletion of BST1was associated with another interesting phenotype, severe sensitivity to d-erythro-sphingosine (Fig. 1 B). Concentrations as low as 10 μm sphingosine completely inhibited growth of bst1Δ strains but had no effect on the viability of wild type cells. In comparison with the control strain, the bst1Δ strain also demonstrated greater sensitivity to 100 μm phytosphingosine, the long chain base endogenous to S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1 C). We did not appreciate a noticeable difference between the growth of wild type andBST1 overexpression strains on phytosphingosine, which is only minimally toxic to wild type cells at this concentration. To determine whether differences in sphingosine uptake or metabolism were responsible for these sensitivity differences, BST1wild type, overexpression and bst1Δ strains were exposed to 3H-labeled sphingosine and subjected to Bligh-Dyer extractions (14Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). There were no major differences in sphingosine recovery among the three strains. However, the aqueous phase from thebst1Δ strain contained a 10-fold increase in radioactivity over that of control and BST1 overexpression strains (Fig.2 A). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the lipid fractions revealed a sphingosine band, which appeared equivalent in each strain. Interestingly, we observed the presence of another radioactive compound, distinct from sphingosine, in the extracts from the bst1Δ strain, but not in the wild type or BST1 overexpression strains (Fig.2 B). This compound accumulated rapidly, reaching a plateau by 60 min (Fig. 2 C). The presence of significant radioactivity in the aqueous phase and an unknown compound in the organic phase of bst1Δ strain extracts led us to consider whether the unknown lipid might be S-1-P, well known for its unusual solubility properties. We first confirmed that at neutral pH and ambient temperature, S-1-P partitions 65% in aqueous and 35% in organic phases of a (chloroform:methanol:water 1:1:0.9) mixture. We then evaluated the unknown lipid and an S-1-P standard under three separate TLC conditions and found the two compounds to comigrate in each case, confirming the lipid to be S-1-P. Hyperaccumulation of S-1-P and hypersensitivity tod-erythro-sphingosine could be explained by a failure to metabolize S-1-P. Degradation of S-1-P requires cleavage at the C2–3 carbon bond by a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme, sphingosine phosphate lyase. The enzyme is stereospecific for thed-erythro sphingoid base, but demonstrates less specificity toward the type of sphingoid base. It was, therefore, possible that we had isolated sphingosine phosphate lyase through a screen employing a nonendogenous but stereospecifically acceptable sphingolipid. Lyase activity in BST1 wild type, overexpression, and deletion strains correlated with BST1expression (Fig. 3, A andB), confirming BST1 to be the yeast homologue of sphingosine phosphate lyase. Cloning of the first sphingosine phosphate lyase gene from S. cerevisiae indicates that phosphorylated sphingoid base signaling is conserved throughout evolution, and thus isolation of other genes responsible for sphingolipid metabolism, transport and signaling should be possible in yeast. Our findings indicate that sphingosine phosphate lyase catalyzes a rate-limiting step in sphingolipid catabolism, and regulation of intracellular S-1-P levels should be possible by regulating lyase activity. Further analysis of the bst1Δstrain may provide insights into the role(s) of sphingosine 1-phosphate in eukaryotic cell signaling, and knowledge of the yeast sphingosine phosphate lyase sequence should provide a means for the isolation of the sphingosine phosphate lyase genes from higher eukaryotes.

Previous studies in rat hepatocytes suggested that organic anion uptake is associated with base exchange. To better characterize the mechanism of oatp-mediated organic anion uptake, we examined transport of taurocholate in a HeLa cell line stably transfected with oatp under the regulation of a zinc-inducible promoter (Shi, X., Bai, S., Ford, A. C., Burk, R. D., Jacquemin, E., Hagenbuch, B., Meier, P. J., and Wolkoff, A. W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25591–25595). Whereas noninduced transfected cells showed virtually no uptake of [3H]taurocholate, taurocholate uptake by induced cells was Na+-independent and saturable (K m = 19.4 ± 3.3 μm; V max = 62.2 ± 1.4 pmol/min/mg protein; n = 3). To test whether organic anion transport is coupled to HCO3− extrusion, we compared the rates of taurocholate-dependent HCO3− efflux from alkali-loaded noninduced and induced cells. Monolayers grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; intracellular pH (pHi) was measured by excitation ratio fluorometry. Noninduced and induced cells were alkalinized to an equivalent pHi (∼7.7) by transient exposure to a 50 mmHCO3−, Cl−-free solution. In the absence of extracellular Cl− and taurocholate, isohydric reduction of superfusate HCO3−concentration from 50 to 25 mm resulted in an insignificant change in pHi over time (dpHi/dt) in both groups. Addition of 25 μm taurocholate to the superfusate led to a rapid fall in pHi in induced (−0.037 ± 0.011 pH units/min to pHi of 7.41 ± 0.14) but not in noninduced (0.003 ± 0.006 pH units/min to pHi of 7.61 ± 0.08) cells (p < 0.03). These data indicate that oatp-mediated taurocholate transport is Na+-independent, saturable, and accompanied by HCO3−exchange.

Recently, using a functional expression cloning strategy, a rat liver cDNA encoding a Na+-independent organic anion transport protein, oatp, was isolated (5Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

Stable transfection of this cDNA into HeLa cells using a vector containing a zinc-inducible promoter has allowed for characterization of transporter activity in the absence of other hepatocyte cell membrane transporters that may mediate and/or modify organic anion uptake (7Shi X.

Whereas parent and noninduced transfected HeLa cells show no significant base line BSP transport, zinc-induced transfected cells avidly take up the organic anion in a manner identical to that previously described in cultured rat hepatocytes (7Shi X.

The mechanism by which oatp mediates organic anion transport has not been established. Studies in short term cultured rat hepatocytes showed that BSP uptake is stimulated by an outwardly directed pH gradient (pHi > pHo) (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that a component of BSP uptake is associated with H+ cotransport or OH− (or HCO3−) exchange. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether oatp-mediated organic anion transport is coupled to base exchange. To this end, we used a fluorescence assay to examine the capacity of organic anions to stimulate HCO3− extrusion in alkali-loaded HeLa cells transfected with oatp cDNA under regulation of a zinc-inducible promoter. Whereas previous analyses of oatp-mediated organic anion uptake were performed with [35S]BSP (7Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol.

We thus chose to use the colorless organic anion taurocholate, also a substrate for oatp (8Kanai N. Lu R. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F319-F325PubMed Google Scholar), throughout this investigation. Initial studies were performed to validate that the characteristics of taurocholate transport mediated by oatp in these cells were similar to those previously described for BSP (7Shi X. Bai S.

Cell protein was determined in replicate plates by the method of Lowry et al. (9Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. These studies were performed at taurocholate concentrations of 1–200 μm. Preliminary studies showed that uptake of [3H]taurocholate by zinc-induced cells was linear for at least 5 min. Uptake of [3H]taurocholate was determined at 4 and 37 °C over the initial 5 min of linear uptake. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression (SigmaPlot version 5.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), and K m andV max were calculated. Medium was prepared in which NaCl was substituted isosmotically by KCl. Initial uptake of [3H]taurocholate was determined over 5 min in KCl-substituted medium. Modified serum-free medium was prepared as above except that the pH was adjusted to 6.0 or 8.0 with 1m NaOH. Cells were washed twice with 1.5 ml of either pH 6.0 or 8.0 medium in which they were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Unidirectional pH gradients were generated by rapidly incubating the cells in medium of the opposite pH, as described previously (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Initial uptake of [3H]taurocholate was determined over 5 min after addition of the organic anion to the medium. pHi was estimated by excitation ratio fluorometry using a silicon-intensified target video camera (Dage, Michigan City, IN) attached to the cine port of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope, as described previously (10Satlin L.M.

Cells were identified using a 50× Leitz water objective. The green fluorescence of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF; Molecular Probes) was visualized with a Nikon B filter cassette. There was no detectable autofluorescence of the cells or any of the solutions used. Sequential fluorescence images of BCECF-loaded cells were obtained at 10-s intervals at excitation wavelengths of 490 and 440 nm (emission at 530 nm) and stored on a Digital Instruments computer. Data were analyzed with a commercially available digital video image analysis system (MetaFluor; Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). An intracellular calibration was performed at the conclusion of each experiment using the nigericin technique, as described previously (10Satlin L.M. Matsumoto T. Schwartz G.J. Am. J.

Solutions were adjusted to 290 mosmol/kg H2O by addition of H2O or the major salt and were gassed at 37 °C. Coverslips to which cell monolayers were attached were placed on the floor of a temperature-controlled specimen chamber, bathed with standard perfusate (Table I, solution 1) at 37 °C, and gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Bath exchanges were performed manually by rapidly replacing the ∼1.5 ml volume of bathing solution three times. After equilibration, cell monolayers were exposed to 20 μm BCECF acetoxymethyl ester for 10–15 min. After rinsing and obtaining base line pHi measurements, cells were alkali-loaded by isohydric application of a 50 mmHCO3−, Cl−-free solution (Table I, solution 3). This solution was prepared by replacing 25 mm sodium gluconate in the standard Cl−-free solution (Table I, solution 2) with an additional 25 mmNaHCO3 and gassing with 90% O2, 10% CO2. After obtaining a stable 490 nm/450 nm fluorescence signal over a given cell, cells were alkali-loaded (10Satlin L.M. Matsumoto T. Schwartz G.J. Am. J.

In the continued absence of Cl−, the 490 nm/450 nm fluorescence ratios were monitored. Thereafter, taurocholate (2.5 or 25 μm) and finally Cl− (Table I, solution 1) were added to the superfusate and 490 nm/450 nm emissions monitored. For each cell studied, the initial rate of change in pHi(dpHi/dt) observed in response to a change in superfusate was calculated by linear regression analysis, as described previously (10Satlin L.M.

At least 5 data points were used for each slope determination. As buffer capacity measurements of HeLa cells were not performed, cellular OH−(HCO3−) fluxes were not determined.

Significant differences between paired data were determined by paired t test. Comparisons of unpaired data were performed by t test or analysis of variance and multiple range test, as appropriate. The software programs SigmaPlot (version 5.0) and SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific) were used for all statistical analyses. Significance was asserted if p < 0.05. Taurocholate uptake by induced oatp-transfected HeLa cells was rapid and linear over 5 min at 37 °C (Fig.1). In contrast, little ligand associated with induced cells at 4 °C (Figs. 1 and 2). The initial rate of taurocholate uptake in induced cells exceeded the rates of nonspecific association of the ligand with noninduced cells measured at 37 °C and both induced and noninduced cells studied at 4 °C (Fig.2).Figure 2Uptake of [3H]taurocholate by zinc-induced and noninduced oatp-transfected HeLa cells. The initial rate of uptake over 5 min of 1 μm taurocholate by induced cells significantly exceeded that measured in noninduced cells at 37 °C. Uptake by noninduced cells at 37 °C did not differ from the negligible nonspecific taurocholate uptake measured in both induced and noninduced cells at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initial uptake of taurocholate was saturable (Fig.3). The mean K m was 19.4 ± 3.3 μm and V max was 62.2 ± 1.4 pmol/min/mg protein (n = 3 experiments). As previously reported for BSP uptake in rat hepatocytes (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), substitution of extracellular Na+ by K+ had no effect on the initial rate of [3H]taurocholate uptake (102% of control; n = 2), confirming that oatp-mediated taurocholate uptake is Na+-independent. These studies also suggest that this process is not electrogenic, as exposure to a high K+ bathing solution that should result in cell depolarization did not alter the rate of taurocholate uptake. Previous studies in cultured rat hepatocytes identified a pH dependence of BSP uptake (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of pH on oatp-mediated taurocholate transport, unidirectional pH gradients were established and the initial rate of taurocholate uptake determined. With an outwardly directed OH− gradient (pHi/pHo = 8/6), in the nominal absence of HCO3−/CO2, taurocholate uptake was >2-fold higher than uptake observed in the presence of an inwardly directed pH gradient (pHi/pHo = 6/8) (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the pH optimum for oatp-mediated taurocholate transport is ∼7.2 and that uptake is associated with OH− (or HCO3−) exchange or H+cotransport. In preliminary experiments, we determined that extracellular Cl−replacement with gluconate led to a reversible 0.19 ± 0.04 pH unit increase in steady-state pHi of parent HeLa cells (7.33 ± 0.10 to 7.52 ± 0.09; n = 3;p < 0.05). Pretreatment of cells with 0.5 mm 4–4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid inhibited this cell alkalinization response (ΔpHi = 0.05 ± 0.04 pH unit; n = 3), consistent with the presence of Cl−/HCO3− exchange, a transport pathway previously proposed to be present in HeLa cells (14Holsey C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Nair C.N. J. Cell Physiol. 1990; 142: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We exploited the activity and reversibility of this Cl−/HCO3− exchanger to load HeLa cells with HCO3−. Exposure to a 50 mm HCO3−, Cl−-free solution led to a significant increase in pHi in noninduced cells (7.42 ± 0.07 to 7.64 ± 0.07; n = 8; p < 0.05) over ∼10 min. Induced cells, characterized by a resting pHi of 7.59 ± 0.14, showed insignificant additional alkalinization (to pHi 7.76 ± 0.10; n = 7;p = 0.3) in response to this maneuver. Reduction of the extracellular HCO3− concentration from 50 to 25 mm in the continued absence of Cl− led to no significant change in pHi in either noninduced or induced cells (Figs. 5 and 7).Figure 7Effect of 25 μm taurocholate on steady state pHi values of noninduced (A) and zinc-induced (B) oatp-transfected HeLa cells during recovery from an acute alkali load. The pHi values indicated include resting in standard perfusate, maximal after alkali loading, steady state on reduction of extracellular HCO3− from 50 to 25 mm in the absence of Cl−, steady state following addition of 25 μm taurocholate to the bathing medium, and value 5 min after restoration of Cl− to the superfusate. In noninduced cells (A; n = 7), pHi recovery was observed only after restoration of Cl− to the bath. In contrast, in induced cells (B; n = 6), recovery of pHi was observed after exposure to taurocholate. Results are means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 or +, 0.05 < p < 0.10 compared with pHi in 25 mm HCO3−, Cl−- and taurocholate-free medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 A depicts a representative tracing of taurocholate-dependent pHi recovery of a single alkali-loaded noninduced HeLa cell. In this experiment, the cell was alkali-loaded from a resting pHi of 7.4 to a maximum pHi of 7.6. pHi recovery (i.e.extrusion of the HCO3− load) was followed initially in the absence of Cl− and taurocholate and then following the sequential addition of 2.5 and 25 μmtaurocholate to the bathing medium. Note that pHi did not return toward base line until Cl− was restored to the superfusate. We found that the rate of Cl−-independent pHirecovery in noninduced cells did not differ from zero on addition of 2.5 or 25 μm taurocholate to the bathing medium (Fig.6). The absence of significant taurocholate-dependent pHi recovery in noninduced cells was reflected in the absence of change in pHi observed in response to exposure to either 2.5 μm (7.56 ± 0.06 to 7.59 ± 0.06) or 25 μm (Fig. 7 A) taurocholate. Restoration of extracellular Cl− to the bathing medium led to significant (p < 0.05) pHi recovery in cells exposed to 2.5 μm(−0.041 ± 0.009 pH units/min to a final pHi of 7.35 ± 0.08) and 25 μm (−0.043 ± 0.011 pH units/min to a final pHi of 7.31 ± 0.09) taurocholate. A representative tracing of taurocholate-dependent pHi recovery of a single alkali-loaded zinc-induced HeLa cell is shown in Fig. 5 B. In this experiment, the cell was alkali-loaded from a resting pHi of 7.5 to a maximum pHi of 7.8. In the absence of Cl− and taurocholate, pHi remained high on reduction of the extracellular HCO3−concentration from 50 to 25 mm. Addition of 2.5 μm taurocholate, however, led to a prompt, albeit partial, reduction in pHi. On exposure to 25 μm taurocholate, pHi rapidly fell to base line. Readdition of Cl− to the extracellular medium had no further effect on pHi. The rate of Cl−-independent pHi recovery in induced cells was −0.024 ± 0.010 pH units/min in the presence of 2.5 μm taurocholate (Fig. 6); pHi fell from its maximum of 7.81 ± 0.08 to 7.69 ± 0.07 (p = 0.005) in this group of cells. Restoration of Cl− to the medium bathing these cells led to a further reduction in pHi at a rate of −0.037 ± 0.007 pH units/min to stabilize at a pHi of 7.40 ± 0.04 (p < 0.05 compared with pHi in absence of Cl−). In a separate group of induced cells, addition of 25 μmtaurocholate caused cell pHi to fall at a rate of −0.037 ± 0.011 pH units/min (Fig. 6) from a maximal pHi of 7.69 ± 0.11 to 7.41 ± 0.14 (Fig.7 B). In this group of cells, restoration of cell Cl− led to no further decrease in pHi, which had already reached base line (dpHi/dt = −0.014 ± 0.015 pH unit/min to 7.37 ± 0.16; p = NS compared with pHi in 25 μm taurocholate, Cl−-free medium and initial resting pHi). Cumulative evidence suggests that a variety of cells possess a zinc-sensitive H+ conductance (13Lukacs G.L. Kapus A. Nanda A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C3-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether exposure to ZnSO4 altered H+/HCO3− transport in HeLa cells, we compared resting pHi and Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in parent HeLa cells grown in the absence or presence of 100 μm ZnSO4 for 48 h. Our observation of statistically similar resting pHi values (7.16 ± 0.08 versus 7.27 ± 0.07; p = 0.36) and increases in pHi (0.21 ± 0.08 versus0.26 ± 0.10; p = 0.74) in response to extracellular Cl− replacement with gluconate in cells grown in the presence (n = 5) and absence (n = 5), respectively, of ZnSO4 suggested it unlikely that this compound systematically altered pHiregulatory pathways or capacity for Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Functional characterization of individual transport pathways mediating uptake of organic anions in the rat liver has been complicated by the presence in hepatocytes of multiple endogenous organic anion transport proteins (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Wolkoff A.W. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 179-188Google Scholar). To selectively characterize the mechanism of oatp-mediated taurocholate transport, we used HeLa cells permanently transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing an inducible oatp cDNA (7Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that oatp-mediated transport of taurocholate is Na+-independent, saturable, and temperature-dependent. These transport characteristics are similar to those previously described for oatp-mediated BSP transport (7Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed that taurocholate uptake is stimulated by imposition of an outwardly directed pH gradient, as previously reported for BSP transport in cultured hepatocytes (3Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Coupling of organic anion transport to pH gradients could arise from anion/OH− (or HCO3−) exchange, a process equivalent to anion-H+ cotransport. Indeed, cholate uptake in the intact liver has been postulated to be mediated, at least in part, by bile acid/OH− (or HCO3−) exchange (16Blitzer B.L. Terzakis C. Scott K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12042-12046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Veith C.M. Thalhammer T. Felberbauer F.X. Graf J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that oatp-mediated taurocholate uptake is coupled to base exchange, we examined the capacity of extracellular taurocholate to stimulate base efflux in HCO3−-loaded noninduced and induced HeLa cells. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, extracellular taurocholate stimulated HCO3−extrusion in alkali-loaded induced cells alone. These results indicate that oatp expression confers on HeLa cells the capacity for taurocholate/HCO3− exchange. The recovery of pHi in induced cells to a value below their initial resting pHi may represent “overshoot” of taurocholate uptake. The cessation of taurocholate/HCO3− exchange upon reduction of pHi may explain, at least in part, the reduction in organic anion uptake previously observed in cells depleted of ATP (4Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,7Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although not examined in the present study, pHi would be expected to fall with ATP depletion, reducing the driving force for organic anion/HCO3− exchange. Our results indicate that oatp mediates Na+-independent, high affinity transport of taurocholate. A Na+-dependent bile acid transporter (ntcp) cloned from rat liver (18Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) has also been recently characterized. COS-7 cells transfected with ntcp cDNA revealed Na+-dependent taurocholate transport with aK m of 29 μm (19Boyer J.L. Ng O.C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G382-G387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although under normal conditions the majority of bile acid uptake by the liver is thought to be Na+-dependent (20Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G801-G812PubMed Google Scholar), the relative contributions of oatp and ntcp to conjugated bile acid transport in various pathobiologic states remain to be determined. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that oatp is localized to the basolateral (sinusoidal) plasma membrane of hepatocytes, a location consistent with its presumed role in clearing ligands from the circulation (21Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Steiger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the transporter would be expected to extrude cellular HCO3−, if that were the physiologic substrate extruded in exchange for organic anion uptake, into the circulation. In rat liver, both a Na+/H+antiporter (22Moseley R.H. Meier P.J. Aronson P.S. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G35-G43PubMed Google Scholar) and Na+-HCO3−symporter (23Gleeson D. Smith N.D. Boyer J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Renner E.L. Lake J.R. Scharschmidt B.F. Zimmerli B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1225-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are localized to the basolateral membrane; the latter transporter is believed to function as a base loader under resting conditions (25Fitz J.G. Lidofsky S.D. Weisiger R.A. Xie M.H. Cochran M. Grotmol T. Scharschmidt B.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of a basolateral organic anion/base exchanger might provide a pathway for OH−(or HCO3−) exit from the hepatocyte. Although the pHi of the hepatocyte is ∼7.2 (26Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Corasanti J.G. Haddad P. Graf J. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G512-G522PubMed Google Scholar) and thus presumably slightly more acidic than the portal blood (pH 7.4), the outward movement of base may be favored by local outwardly directed gradients established by the basolateral Na+-HCO3− symporter and the negative cell potential (−40 mV) (27Fitz J.G. Scharschmidt B.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G56-G64PubMed Google Scholar, 28Graf J. Henderson R.M. Krumpholz B. Boyer J.L. J. Membrane Biol. 1987; 95: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It should be noted that our demonstration of taurocholate/HCO3− exchange does not prove that HCO3− is the physiologic substrate for oatp in vivo. Other potential substrates capable of driving uphill oatp-mediated organic anion transport include α-ketoglutarate and metabolic intermediates that accumulate to relatively high concentrations within the hepatocyte. While beyond the scope of the present study, identification of the physiologic substrate(s) for oatp remains an important goal for future investigation."

To study the usefulness of aspirin as a chemopreventative agent for UV-induced human skin cancer, we investigated the effect of aspirin on UVB-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. In the JB6 cell culture system, aspirin or sodium salicylate (SA) inhibited UVB-induced AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner; this inhibitory effect occurred only in cells pretreated with aspirin or SA before UVB irradiation but not cells treated with aspirin or SA after UVB irradiation. Furthermore, these inhibitory effects on UVB-induced AP-1 activity appeared to be mediated through blocking of activation of MAP kinase family members, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38. It was not due to absorption of UVB light by aspirin. In the skin of AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice, UVB irradiation induced a rapid increase in AP-1 activity, which reached the peak at 48 h post-UVB irradiation. The topical pretreatment of mouse skin with aspirin markedly blocked the UVB-induced AP-1 transactivation in vivo. These data provide the first evidence that aspirin and SA are inhibitors of UV-induced signal transduction and thus could be used as a chemopreventative agent for skin cancer.

Furthermore, using an animal model Craven and De Rubertis reported that aspirin inhibited 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis in rats injected with aspirin 1 week before carcinogen administration, whereas it had no effect when administered 4 weeks after carcinogen treatment (8Craven P.A.

Therefore, the inhibition of COX does not appear to be sufficient to explain all the anti-cancer effects of aspirin. More recently, we demonstrated that aspirin and sodium salicylate (SA) inhibited the transactivation of AP-1 activity in the same dose range as seen for inhibition of tumor promoter-induced cell transformation (20Dong Z.

AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid stably transfected mouse epidermal JB6 P+1-1 cells were cultured in monolayers at 37 °C, 5% CO2 using Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg of gentamicin/ml. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Life Technologies, Inc.; Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); luciferase assay substrate was from Promega; aspirin was from Sigma. The phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of Erks, p38 kinase, and JNK assay kit were from New England Biolabs. 2X TRE-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were originally established by R. A. Flavell and his co-workers (30Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A C57BL/6 male mouse carrying the 2X TRE-luciferase transgene was crossed with DBA/2 (SASCO, Omaha, NE 68101) females (29Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The F1 offspring were screened by testing both the basal level and TPA-induced level of luciferase activity for the presence of the AP-1-luciferase reporter gene. Males and females were housed separately in solid bottom polycarbonate cages on ventilated animal racks (∼4–5 mice/cage, individualized by incisions in the ears) in temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled conditions. Food and water were available ad libitum, and the dorsal skin of the mice was shaved every week during the experiment period. The Animal Facility at the Hormel Institute is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Confluent monolayers of JB6 P+1-1 cells were trypsinized, and 8 × 103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS MEM were added to each well of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 12–24 h later, cells were starved by culturing them in 0.1% FBS MEM for 24 h prior to exposure to UVB irradiation. The cells were exposed to UVB for AP-1 induction with or without different concentrations of aspirin. After 24 h culture, the cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Monolight 2010). The results are expressed as relative AP-1 activity (26Huang C. Schmid P.C. Ma W.-Y. Schmid H.H.O. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4187-4194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Immunoblots for phosphorylation of Erks and p38 kinase were carried out as described by the protocal of New England Biolabs using phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of Erks and p38 kinase, respectively. JNK activity was assayed as described by the protocol of New England Biolabs. In brief, JB6 C141 cells were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS MEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were first treated with different concentrations of aspirin for 30 min and then exposed to UVB (4 kJ/m2) in the chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808® filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm followed by culturing for another 20 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer/sample (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of N-terminal c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 500 ml of lysis buffer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. C-Jun phosphorylation was selectively measured by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific c-Jun antibodies against phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63. All the mice were characterized by testing both the basal level and UVB-induced level of luciferase activity. The AP-1-luciferase reporter bearing male and female mice (6–9 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups, including negative control group (control), UVB control group (UVB), aspirin-treated (10 μmol/mouse) group (experimental group 1), and aspirin-treated (40 μmol/mouse) group (experimental group 2). There were 13–14 mice in each group. 2 weeks after grouping, both the basal level and UVB-induced level of luciferase activities were measured with the skin biopsy tissue obtained by using biopsy punch (1.5 mm) (Acuderm, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL). 2 weeks after the last punch biopsy, five topical doses of aspirin dissolved in 300 μl of acetone were applied to the dorsal skin of the mice over 8 days. The last of the five topical doses of aspirin was given 3 h prior to UVB irradiation. Then the mice were placed in a box and exposed to 10 kJ/m2 of UVB irradiation. 48 h after UVB exposure, the mice were punch biopsied to determine the effect of aspirin on UVB induction of AP-1 transactivation in the epidermis. Negative control mice were treated with acetone alone. The luciferase activity of punch biopsied epidermis was measured as described previously (26Huang C. Schmid P.C. Ma W.-Y. Schmid H.H.O. Dong Z.

The significance of the difference in the AP-1 activity was determined with the Student's t test. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. To determine whether aspirin and its analogue, SA, have any inhibitory effects on UVB-induced AP-1 activation, we incubated the JB6 cells with these compounds. Both aspirin and SA show marked inhibition of UVB-induced AP-1 activity (Fig. 1 A). This inhibitory effect appears to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). The inhibitory concentration range of aspirin and SA was from 0.25 to 4 mm (Fig. 1 B). To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of AP-1 activity by aspirin and SA is due to their cytotoxic effect on JB6 cells, we observed the influence of aspirin and SA on cell proliferation. JB6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in the presence of different concentrations of aspirin or SA. After 36 h of culture, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. The cells were harvested 12 h later, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The results indicated that aspirin and SA at doses ranging from 0.25 to 4 mm did not show any cytotoxic effect on JB6 cells (data not shown). To determine when aspirin or SA must be present to inhibit UVB-induced AP-1 activity, the aspirin or SA was added to cell cultures at different time points before or after cell exposure to UVB irradiation. As shown in Fig.2, the AP-1 activity of JB6 cells induced by UV irradiation was markedly inhibited by aspirin or SA when given 1 h prior to UVB irradiation, but there was no inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity observed if the agents were given after UVB irradiation (Fig. 2).Figure 2Requirement of pretreatment of aspirin (Asp) or SA for inhibition of UVB-induced AP-1 activity in JB6 cells. P+1-1 cells suspended in 5% FBS MEM were added to each well of 96-well plates. The cells were cultured and starved as described under “Materials and Methods.” Then the cells were treated with aspirin or SA at the time (as indicated) before or after the cells exposure to UVB (2 kJ/m2). 24 h later, the AP-1 activity was determined by luciferase activity assay. The results are presented as relative AP-1 activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because normal UVB lamps also generate some UVC light, we compared the AP-1 inductions between normal UVB light and UVB light filtered with a Kodak Kodacel K6808® filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 3. AP-1 activity could be induced by either UVB light with or without filter (Fig. 3 A), but a higher dose of filtered UVB light is required for similar AP-1 induction as compared with normal UVB light (Fig. 3 A). The similar inhibition of AP-1 activity induced by filtered UVB light by aspirin is also observed as compared with those induced by normal UVB light (Fig. 3 B). It is well known that UV irradiation results in activation of Erks and JNKs as well as p38 kinase (31Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that pretreatment of cells with aspirin led to an inhibition of UVB-induced AP-1 activation. Because AP-1 has been identified as a target of MAP kinase family, including Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinase, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of aspirin on UVB-induced JNK activities and phosphorylation of Erks and p38 kinase. We found that pretreatment of cells with aspirin blocked UVB-induced JNK activity (Fig. 4 A) and phosphorylation of Erks and p38 kinase (Figs. 4, B and C). These data suggested that inhibitory effects of aspirin on UVB-induced AP-1 activity are possibly modulated by blocking the activation of the MAP kinase family. To rule out the possibility that the blocking activity of aspirin on UVB-induced signal transduction is due to its absorbance of UVB light, we determined the absorbing wavelengths of aspirin and examined its ability to absorb UVB light between the wavelengths of 290–320 nm, which was used in the present study. We observed that aspirin absorbs UV light in the wavelength range of 210–280 nm (Fig.5), and aspirin did not show significant absorbance of UVB light at concentrations between 0.5–2.0 mm, which is the dose range used for blocking AP-1 activity and MAP kinase activation (Table I). Therefore, we concluded that inhibitory effects of aspirin on UVB-induced signal transduction were not through its absorbance of UVB light.Figure 5Absorbing wavelength of aspirin to UV light.

Open table in a new tab Because the binding of AP-1 protein to DNA does not always result in an induction of transcription, the AP-1 DNA binding activity measured by gel shift assay may not correlate with AP-1 transcriptional activity in some cases (35Herr I. VanDarn H. Angel P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether UVB irradiation leads to elevation of AP-1 transcription activity in vivo, we used AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice. UVB (10 kJ/m2) irradiation induced a rapid increase of AP-1 activity in mouse skin within 12 h after exposure to UVB irradiation (Fig.6 A). The maximum induction of AP-1 activity (∼160-fold) was observed at 48 h post-UV irradiation (Fig. 6 A, n = 7), and the activity returned to near basal levels after 10 days (data not shown). The UV dose response study indicated that optimum UVB dose for induction of AP-1 was 10 kJ/m2 (Fig. 6 B,n = 7); this dose for AP-1 induction is consistent with the previous dose used for skin tumor induction (36Gensler H.L.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3428-3435PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrated for the first time that UVB irradiation leads to activation of AP-1 transcription activity in AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice. Our preliminary results from using mouse epidermal cell line JB6 indicated that aspirin inhibits UVB-induced AP-1 activity in vitro. To test this effect in vivo, we first determined the reproducibility of UVB-induced AP-1 activation between two times of UVB exposure in the same group of AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice. The transgenic mice were punch biopsied (1.5 mm) twice on the dorsal skin to determine the basal luciferase activity with a 3-week interval. 1 week after each of these punches, the mice were irradiated with 10 kJ/m2 of UVB, and 48 h later the same mice were punch biopsied to determine the UVB-induced AP-1 activity. The UVB-induced levels of luciferase activity from the two time points in the same group of mice were similar (n = 13, p> 0.05) (Fig. 7 A). These data suggested that induction of AP-1 activity by UVB in the same transgenic mice can be used as a control. Because chemoprevention of cancer is a long term process, the aspirin inhibition of AP-1 induction by UVB irradiation was determined following five applications of aspirin to mouse skin over 8 days. Multiple treatments of mouse dorsal skin with aspirin resulted in significant inhibition of UVB-induced AP-1 activity at both 10- and 40-μmol doses/mouse as compared with either UVB control group mice or experimental control mice (Fig. 7 B) (n = 13, p < 0.05). These results strongly demonstrate that application of aspirin not only blocks UVB-induced AP-1 activity in a cell culture model but also inhibits AP-1 transactivation in vivo. Both epidemiological and clinical studies have indicated that aspirin and related compounds have considerable potential as chemopreventative agents for cancers. Because several lines of evidence have suggested a causal role for AP-1 during tumor promotion, here we investigated the inhibitory effect of aspirin on UVB-induced AP-1 activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Pretreatment of cells with aspirin significantly blocked the UVB-induced AP-1 transactivation and JNK activation, as well as phosphorylation of Erks and p38 kinases. This inhibition by aspirin was only observed when the aspirin treatment of the cells preceded UVB irradiation but not post-UVB irradiation. The negative results for the absorbance of UV light by aspirin suggested that inhibitory effects of aspirin on UVB-induced signal transduction is due to its pharmacological effects and not due to UVB absorbance. Topical application of aspirin on AP-1 reporter transgenic mice markedly inhibits UVB-induced AP-1 transactivation. Thus, these results, together with previous findings that UVB-induced AP-1 transactivation is a major mediator of development of human skin cancer, indicated that aspirin may serve as a chemopreventative drug for skin cancers induced by UV irradiation. Exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation not only causes DNA damage, resulting in either cell death or somatic mutation, but also induces specific cell reactions, including induction of transcriptional activation such as AP-1 and nuclear factor-κB (39Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffer A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 40Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways leading to transcription factor activation have been extensively studied in the last several years. It is believed that stress-related signals, such as UV light, induce the activation of MAP kinase pathways (Erks, JNKs, and p38). AP-1, consisting of Jun/Fos dimers, is a downstream target of these three MAP kinase members (42Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). We have reported that the anti-tumor promotion effects of aspirin are mediated by blocking tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation (20Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have found that aspirin inhibited UVB-induced AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect appears to be through blocking UVB-induced activation of Erks and JNKs as well as p38 kinase. Interestingly, it appears that the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of AP-1 by UVB irradiation is different from that induced by TPA or epidermal growth factor because although aspirin inhibits UVB signals through MAP kinase-dependent pathway, it blocks TPA- or epidermal growth factor-induced signaling through a MAP kinase-independent pathway (20Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings agree with the Schwenger et al. report that SA inhibited tumor necrosis factor-induced Erks activation but did not affect Erk activation by epidermal growth factor under the same condition (43Schwenger P. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8089-8094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Solar irradiation has been associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer for centuries (44Matsui M.S. Delco V.A. Mukhtar H. Photocarcinogenesis by Ultraviolet A and B. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). Epidemiological investigation found that outdoor laborers, such as fisherman and gardeners, are more prone to skin cancer, particularly in the sun-exposed areas of the body (44Matsui M.S. Delco V.A. Mukhtar H. Photocarcinogenesis by Ultraviolet A and B. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). The incidence of skin cancers in Caucasians has been reported to be higher in populations living closer to the equator (44Matsui M.S. Delco V.A. Mukhtar H. Photocarcinogenesis by Ultraviolet A and B. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that the degree of intrinsic skin pigmentation was inversely correlated with the incidence of cutaneous cancer (44Matsui M.S. Delco V.A. Mukhtar H. Photocarcinogenesis by Ultraviolet A and B. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that the UV spectrum in solar light is responsible for its carcinogenic effect. The UV spectrum is subdivided into three ranges, including short (UVC, 200–280 nm), long (UVA, 320–400 nm), and mid-wavelengths (UVB, 280–320 nm). UV irradiation acts as both a tumor initiator and promoter in animal models (27Strickland P.T. J. Invest.

It was generally accepted that the initiating effect of UV light is through the absorption of energy of UV light by DNA of irradiated cells and resulting in formation of pyrimidine dimers, whereas the activation of membrane-related signal transduction pathway, leading to activation of AP-1, is responsible for UV tumor promotion action (44Matsui M.S.

AP-1 was first considered as a mediator of tumor promotion by its ability to alter gene expression in response to tumor promoters, such as epidermal growth factor, TPA, or UV irradiation (52Angel P. Karin M. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). It was found that AP-1 activity is progressively elevated in mouse epidermal JB6 cell variants representing various stages of tumor promotion (53Dong Z. Watts R.G. Sun Y. Zhan S.N. Colburn N.H. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 359-364PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, blocking of AP-1 activity by either pharmacological inhibitors, such as flucinolone acetonide, retinoic acid, or molecular biological inhibitors, including dominant negative c-Jun (TAM67) and dominant negative phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (Δp85), impaired neoplastic transformation (21Dong Z.

Moreover, acquisition of a tumor promotion-resistant phenotype is associated with a loss of responsiveness to tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation (56Bernstein L.R. Bravo R. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1992; 6: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and rescuing the response to tumor promoter in AP-1 activation by introducing wild-type extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-2 (Erk2) converts tumor promotion-resistant phenotype to tumor promotion-sensitive phenotype. 2C. Huang and Z. Dong, unpublished data. This notion was further supported by our very recent finding that the retinoid SR11302, an AP-1 inhibition-specific retinoid, markedly inhibits the TPA-induced papilloma formation and AP-1 activation in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated AP-1-luciferase transgenic mouse skin, whereas repeated applications of another retinoid, SR11235, a transcriptional activator of retinoic acid response element, does not inhibit papilloma formation and AP-1 activation (26Huang C.

In light of the role of AP-1 activation in chemical- and photo-carcinogenesis, we investigated the possible usefulness of aspirin in chemoprevention of UV-induced skin cancer by determining its inhibitory effect on UVB-induced AP-1 activity in both a cell culture model and in an AP-1-luciferase transgenic mouse model. The results indicated that pretreatment of cells and mouse skin with aspirin blocks UV-induced AP-1 transactivation effectively in both models. It is suggested that aspirin may be used as a chemoprevention agent for nonmelanoma skin cancers. We thank Dr. Harald H. O. Schmid for critical reading, Dr. Richard A. Flavell and Dr. Mercedes Rincon for the generous gift of the C57BL/6 AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice, Ruth Morton for helping with the animal care, and Carmen Hotson for secretarial assistance."

The TNF-R1 associated death domain protein interacts with the p55 TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain and recruits the Fas-associated death domain protein (which directly activates the apoptotic proteases), the protein kinase receptor interacting protein, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). TRAF2 has previously been demonstrated to activate both transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway, which in turn stimulates transcription factor activating protein 1 (AP1) mainly via phosphorylation of the c-Jun component. We have investigated the signaling properties of NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), a TRAF2-associated protein kinase that mediates NFκB induction. NIK was found to be unable to activate JNK/SAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or p38 kinase. Moreover, NIK was not required for JNK/SAPK activation by TNF-R1, thus representing the first TNF-R1 complex component to dissect the NFκB and the JNK/SAPK pathways. Despite being unable to activate JNK/SAPK and mitogen-activated protein kinase, NIK strongly activated AP1 and was required for TNF-R1-induced AP1 activation. Therefore, NIK links TNF-R1 to a novel, JNK/SAPK-independent, AP1 activation pathway.

Therefore, although TNF-R1-induced apoptosis requires FADD, stimulation of gene expression mainly depends on TRAF2. p75 TNF-R2 does not recruit TRADD but directly interacts with TRAF2 (10Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar); therefore it is able to activate NFκB and JNK/SAPK in a TRAF2-dependent manner (13Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 16Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), but it does not induce FADD-dependent apoptosis. Signaling events downstream of TRAF2 are largely unknown. The protein kinase NIK has been recently identified and cloned as a TRAF2-interacting protein that is both sufficient and required for NFκB activation (23Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). However, the role of NIK in additional TNF-R1 pathways is not known. We therefore investigated the signaling properties of NIK and its role in JNK/SAPK and p38 activation by TNF-R1. Full-length human NIK cDNA was PCR amplified from a human placental cDNA library using a mixture ofTaq and Pwo polymerases (Boehringer). The primers used were NIK1 (5′-TCCGCTAGCATGGCAGTGATGGAAATG-3′) and NIK2 (5′-CTCTCTAGATTAGGGCCTGTTCTC-3′); the PCR fragment was digested withNheI and XbaI and cloned in pCDNA3-HA. pCDNA3-HA was constructed by insertion of aBglII/BamHI fragment from pActII (CLONTECH) into the BamHI site of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc). NIKΔ1234 (deletion of aa 1–334) was constructed by PCR amplification of full-length NIK using the primers 1234 (5′-TTGCTAGCGAATACCTAGTGCATGCTCTG-3′) and NIK2. NIKΔ2101 (deletion of aa 1–623) was amplified using the primers 2101 (5′-TTGCTAGCATGCCTCTCACAGCCCA-3′) and NIK2. Both PCR fragments were cloned in pCDNA3-HA as above. NIK-KR was obtained by two-step PCR using the mutagenic primers KRS (5′-CAGTGCGCTGTCAGGAAGGTGCGGCTGGA-3′) and KRAS (5′-CAGCCGCACCTTCCTGACAGCGCACTG-3′). HA-p46SAPKγpCDNA3 and HA-SEKALpMT2 (gifts of J.

Ulevitch. 293 cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method using 8 μg of total plasmid DNA, whereas HeLa cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonilfluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration was measured using a commercial Bradford protein assay (Promega). Equal amounts of each lysate (usually 500 μg) were incubated on ice with 2 μg of anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer) (JNK assays) or anti-FLAG antibody (IBI Kodak) (p38 assays) for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected by protein A-agarose for 25 min, washed thrice with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm DTT, and washed once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride). Samples were finally resuspended with 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and either 2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (1–141) (JNK assays) or 8 μg of mielin basic protein (p38 assays) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer; samples were boiled and loaded on 12.5% SDS-acrylamide gels. After fixing and drying, gels were autoradiographed at −70 °C. Radioactivity in each spot was quantitated with a PhosphorImager. The amount of exogenous transfected kinase in each sample was analyzed by Western blotting. Reporter gene assays were performed as described (24Chirillo P. Falco M. Puri P.L. Artini M. Balsano C. Levrero M. Natoli G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 641-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both 293 and HeLa cells, TRADD, TRAF2, and NIK are able to induce a strong NFκB activation (NIK being the strongest activator) (Fig. 1, A and B). Deletion of the N-terminal (putatively regulatory) domain of NIK (NIKΔ1234) does not apparently affect NFκB activation, whereas the deletion of the catalytic domain (NIKΔ2101) or its inactivation (Lys → Arg mutation at aa 429) abolish NFκB activation (Fig.1 B). Consistent with a requirement for NIK in TNF-induced NFκB activation, overexpression of a C-terminal NIK fragment (NIKΔ2101), which binds TRAF2 and presumably blocks the recruitment of endogenous NIK and/or titrates downstream effectors (23Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), significantly impairs the induction of NFκB by either TNF treatment or overexpression of TNF-R1 complex components (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that NIK is required for the activation of NFκB by TNF-R1/TRAF2 in different cell types. Because TRAF2 overexpression is sufficient to activate both NFκB and JNK/SAPK (13Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 14Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we examined whether NIK is able to activate JNK/SAPK as well. NIK was cotransfected in HeLa and 293 cells together with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SAPKγ expression vector, and the activity of exogenous transfected SAPK was assayed 36–48 h after transfection. In 293 cells, wherein TRAF2 usually gives the highest activation of SAPK/JNK, neither NIK or NIKΔ1234 (which are both efficient NFκB activators) were able to elevate JNK/SAPK activity over the baseline. In a similar manner, we were unable to detect any JNK/SAPK activation by NIK in HeLa cells (Fig. 2, Aand B). Similarly to JNK/SAPK, p38 activation by TNF depends on TRAF2 (14Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) 2G. Natoli, A. Costanzo, F. Moretti, M. Fulco, C. Balsano, and M. Levrero, unpublished results. but is not dependent on NIK (Fig. 2 C). Apart from inducing a prolonged activation of JNK/SAPK and p38, TNF-R1 engagement provokes a mild and transient activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whose biological role has not been defined (26Van Lint J. Agostinis P. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25916-25921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vietor I. Schwenger P. Li W. Schlessinger J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18994-18999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK activation by TNF may depend on a TNF-R1 domain that is distinct from the TRADD interaction domain and that interacts with a recently identified protein known as FAN (28Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Consistent with MAPK activation being a TRADD-independent function, neither TRAF2 or NIK were able to activate MAPK in the cells tested (Fig. 2 D). The effects of the dominant negative NIK mutant (NIKΔ2101) on JNK/SAPK activation by TNF-R1 were next evaluated. The expression of Δ2101 at levels that gave maximal inhibition of NFκB induction (Fig. 1 C) did not impair the ability of either TNF or TRAF2 to activate JNK/SAPK (Fig. 2 E). Therefore, when the NIK pathway is blocked by expression of dominant negative NIK, both receptor cross-linking and overexpressed TRAF2 still activate JNK/SAPK. Taken together our results suggest that: (i) NIK is neither sufficient nor required for JNK/SAPK activation by TNF-R1/TRAF2; (ii) the bifurcation between the NFκB pathway and the JNK/SAPK pathway occursimmediately downstream of TRAF2; and (iii) dominant negative NIK does not disrupt the TNF-R1 complex nonspecifically. Therefore, NIK dissects the TRAF2 pathway leading to NFκB activation from the pathway leading to JNK/SAPK activation; this suggests that the ability of TNF-R1/TRAF2 to activate JNK/SAPK must depend on a different TRAF2-interacting protein. One possible candidate is represented by MEKK1, a kinase that phosphorylates and activates SEK/JNKK, which in turn phosphorylates JNK/SAPK (29Lange-Carter C. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 30Lin A. Minden A. Martineto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to detect a physical interaction between TRAF2 and MEKK1.2Therefore, the evidence for a role of MEKK1 in TNF-R1 signaling is indirect and arises from the ability of catalytically inactive MEKK1 (MEKK1-KM) to block TNF-R1/TRAF2-induced activation of SAPK/JNK (14Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar); at this point we cannot exclude the possibility that SAPK/JNK activation by TNF-R1/TRAF2 depends on a putative MEKK1-related protein whose activity is inhibited by MEKK1-KM overexpression. The prolonged activation of JNK/SAPK by TNF and the consequent phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun transcriptional activation domain correlate with the sustained induction of AP1-dependent genes (33Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 34Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP1 is composed of proteins of the Jun and Fos families that associate to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers that bind to a common recognition element known as either the tetradecanoic phorbol acetate-response element or the AP1 binding site (35Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar); the presence of AP1 sites in the promoters of several genes, including those encoding for cytokines and adhesion molecules, contributes to the induction of such genes by TNF as well as by other AP1 inducers. With respect to TNF, TRAF2 (which is an efficient JNK/SAPK activator) was found to be a stronger stimulator of AP1-dependent transcription (Fig.3 A). Unexpectedly, overexpression of NIK, which activates neither JNK/SAPK nor MAPK, strongly activated transcription directed by a canonical AP1 site. This effect of NIK was dependent on an intact protein kinase domain. Moreover, AP1 activation by NIK was not blocked by dominant negative SEK/JNKK (Fig.3 B) or by chemical inhibitors of p38 and MAPK/Erk.2 Evidence that NIK contributes to the induction of AP1 activity by TNF-R1/TRAF2 comes from experiments with dominant negative NIK; indeed, NIKΔ2101 was able to reduce TNF-induced activation of AP1 by more than 50% without any evident effect on basal AP1 activity (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, when the NIK pathway is blocked and the JNK/SAPK pathway fully active (Fig. 2), the ability of TNF-R1 to stimulate AP1 activity is severely impaired. The effect of NIKΔ2101 on TRAF2-dependent activation of AP1 was slightly less evident; this may reflect a major contribution of the JNK/SAPK pathway to AP1 activation by overexpressed TRAF2, consistent with the greater potency of transfected TRAF2 compared with TNF in JNK/SAPK induction (Fig. 2). TRAF2 is a critical signaling molecule that links both p55 TNF-R1 and p75 TNF-R2 to NFκB and JNK/SAPK activation pathways. TRAF2-dependent activation of NFκB is required for the induction of several genes, including those protecting cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (14Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).2 The results reported here indicate that the NFκB and the JNK/SAPK pathways bifurcate immediately downstream of TRAF2; this would suggest that TRAF2 signals by interacting with and activating at least two distinct effectors, namely NIK, which seems to be responsible for NFκB activation (possibly through direct activation of the recently identified IκB kinase) (41Regnier C.H.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar), and yet unknown transducers are responsible for JNK/SAPK activation. Apart from inducing NFκB, NIK couples TNF-R1/TRAF2 to AP1 activating pathways that are alternative to MAPK and JNK/SAPK. The inhibitory effect of dominant negative NIK on AP1 activation by TNF suggests that this AP1 activation pathway is not redundant but probably collaborates with the JNK/SAPK and the MAPK pathways to achieve an optimal AP1 activation. The mechanisms of AP1 activation by NIK is still unclear. Because AP1 is a collection of dimers composed by several Fos and Jun family proteins, it is highly likely that a number of regulatory mechanisms other than c-Jun phosphorylation contribute to control its activity at various levels. The identification of downstream target(s) of NIK will help elucidate the mechanism of AP1 activation through this pathway. We thank David V.

However, the mechanisms controlling cell cycle-dependent activation of nuclear PKC are not known. We now report that nuclear levels of the major physiologic PKC activator diacylglycerol (DAG) fluctuate during cell cycle. Specifically, nuclear DAG levels in G2/M phase cells are 2.5–3-fold higher than in G1 phase cells. In synchronized cells, nuclear DAG levels rise to a peak coincident with the G2/M phase transition and return to basal levels in G1 phase cells. This increase in DAG level is sufficient to stimulate βIIPKC-mediated phosphorylation of its mitotic nuclear envelope substrate lamin B in vitro. Isolated nuclei from G2 phase cells contain an active phospholipase activity capable of generating DAG in vitro. Nuclear phospholipase activity is inhibited by the selective phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor 1-O-octadeyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and neomycin sulfate, but not by the phosphatidylcholine-PLC selective inhibitor D609 or inhibitors of phospholipase D-mediated DAG generation.

Growth factor receptors containing intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity activate PI-PLC γ isoforms through direct tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme (4Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G.

Activation of PI-PLC enzymes leads to generation of inositol trisphosphate and DAG, two metabolites of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate that stimulate intracellular calcium release and activate PKC isozymes, respectively. Extracellular ligands can also stimulate activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and/or phospholipase D (PLD) activities (5Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

https://openalex.org/W2077216446,"The transcription factors Fos, Jun, and Ets regulate the expression of human stromelysin-1 and collagenase-1 genes. Recently, we found that ERG, an Ets family member, activates collagenase-1 gene but not stromelysin-1 by physically interacting with c-Fos/c-Jun. Interestingly, ERG binds to stromelysin-1 promoter and represses its activation by ETS2. Here, to investigate the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we have used an in vitroprotein-protein interaction assay and studied the transcription factor interactions of ETS2. We found that ETS2 could weakly associate within vitro synthesized ETS1, c-Fos, and c-Jun and strongly with c-Fos/c-Jun complex and ERG via several distinct ETS2 domains including the C-terminal region that contains the DNA-binding domain. Strikingly, these interactions were stabilized in vitro by DNA as they were inhibited by ethidium bromide. Both the N-terminal region, comprising the transactivation domain, and the C-terminal region of ETS2 associated with ERG and, interestingly, the interaction of ERG through the transactivation domain of ETS2 was DNA-independent. The DNA-dependent interaction of ETS2 with c-Fos/c-Jun was enhanced by specific DNA fragments requiring two Ets-binding sites of the stromelysin-1 promoter.

The transcription of genes is controlled positively or negatively by a variety of extracellular stimuli, yielding to a finely tuned regulation of gene expression. Gene transcription requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II with a multiprotein preinitiation complex at specific DNA sequences including the TATA promoter box. Interactions of general transcription factors with basal promoter elements are generally essential for basal transcription but cannot be sufficient to increase or decrease its rate. Activation and repression of gene transcription depend on the binding of several transcription factors to DNA-specific motifs that, when bound to their promoter elements, stimulate or inhibit transcription through protein-protein interactions with the basal transcription machinery (for review see Goodrichet al. (1Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)).An extensive number of transcription activators and repressors that regulate cellular and viral genes have been characterized including the Fos, Jun, and Ets families of transcription factors. Generally, transcription factors contain distinct domains with different functions. For instance, Fos and Jun contain a leucine zipper domain that allows the formation of homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes and a basic region, via which the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer binds to the 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ DNA sequence or AP-1 site (2Gentz R.

Similarly, the ETS family of transcription factors is composed of two main domains, the transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain via which they bind to the 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ core sequence (3Crépieux P. Coll J. Stéhelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 615-638PubMed Google Scholar, 4Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, Ets1, Ets2, Erg, and Fli1 share 98% homology in the ETS domain but have divergent transactivation (TA) domains (6Karim F.D. Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additional domains other than DBD and TA have been identified for Ets1, Ets2, and Erg. These domains include regulatory regions that modulate positively or negatively the transactivation property of the ETS proteins and inhibitory domains (ID) that interfere with the binding of the Ets proteins to their DNA motifs (8Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 617-625PubMed Google Scholar, 9Siddique H.R. Rao V.N. Lee L. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1751-1755PubMed Google Scholar, 10Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J.

It has been suggested that accessory factors would relieve the inhibitory effect of DNA binding by interacting with the ID domains (8Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B.

However, supporting evidence for such interactions remains to be established.The Fos, Jun, and Ets transcription factors can regulate the same set of cellular genes that contain composite target motifs (12Wu H.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cellular genes controlled by Fos, Jun, and Ets include the well studied stromelysin-1 and collagenase-1 genes that encode two matrix metalloproteinases implicated in normal growth and development, as well as in tumor invasion and metastasis. The functional DNA motifs by which Fos, Jun, and Ets transcription factors regulate basal and induced transcription activities have been characterized (14Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B.

Although the AP-1 site is a well conserved sequence motif in collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 genes and binds the Fos and Jun heterodimer, the Ets-binding sites (EBS) differ by sequence and position between the two genes, and they display different binding affinities for the Ets transcription factors. Recently, we reported that the adjacent EBS and AP-1 motifs of collagenase-1 promoter are both necessary for collagenase-1 activation by ERG. We have shown that ERG in defined conditions does not bind to the collagenase-1 EBS unless it is recruited, via physical interaction, by the c-Fos/c-Jun complex that binds to the adjacent AP-1 site. In contrast to the collagenase-1 promoter, ERG binds to the two linked EBS of the stromelysin-1 promoter but does not activate this gene. In transiently transfected cells, ETS2 activates stromelysin-1 gene; however, when ERG is coexpressed with ETS2, ERG inhibits stromelysin-1 activation by ETS2, suggesting a possible mechanism of interaction between ETS2 and ERG.In this report, we demonstrate that the ETS2 transcription factor physically interacts with the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer and with other Ets family members. We found that different domains of ETS2 make contacts with the Fos/Jun complex and with other members of the Ets family to form stable heterotrimeric ETS2/Fos/Jun and heterodimeric ETS2/ERG and ETS2/ETS1 complexes. Also, we found that these complexes were stabilized by DNA and that stromelysin-1 promoter DNA specifically stabilized the ETS2/Fos/Jun complex, dependent on the two linked EBS. We discuss the implications of these results for combinatorial gene regulation and for stromelysin-1 gene regulation by the Ets family of transcription factors.DISCUSSIONSynergistic repression or activation of gene expression plays an important role in gene regulation. Combinatorial protein-protein interactions between multifunctional modular domains of transcription factors can provide the necessary complexity required to achieve appropriate gene regulation. In this study, using in vitroprotein binding assay, we showed that the transcription factor ETS2 binds to the c-Fos/c-Jun complex and members of the Ets family such as ETS1 and ERG. We characterized the ETS2 binding domain and found that binding to c-Fos/c-Jun and ETS1 occurred through the C-terminal end (residues 289–469), which contains the inhibitory domain ID1-(289–358), the DNA binding domain (residues 359–439), and the inhibitory domain ID2-(440–469). None of these domains could separately bind to c-Fos/c-Jun and ETS1 although significant binding occurred through the combined DNA binding and ID domains. ETS2 binding to ERG through its C-terminal end was similar to that observed for c-Fos/c-Jun and ETS1. In addition, ERG interacted with the N-terminal region (residues 1–290) containing the TA of ETS2 and significant binding also occurred through the N-terminal residues 1–129. This region constitutes the first half of the TA domain of ETS2. In comparison with the full-length ETS2, this region retained 30% of the capacity to bind to ERG.Significance of Interactions between DNA-binding DomainsThe major findings of our studies are that (i) only the C-terminal part of ETS2, which contains the DBD and the two C- and N-terminal IDs, makes contacts with the Fos/Jun heterodimer, and that (ii) this interaction is enhanced by specific DNA motifs suggesting diverse possible mechanisms of gene regulation by Fos, Jun, and Ets transcription factors. While this work was in progress, Leiden and co-workers (27Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ELF1, an Ets family member, associates with the basic domain of Jun and thus can form the heterotrimeric complex ELF1/Jun/Fos. Therefore, it appears here that the ETS2/Fos/Jun/ protein-protein interactions are mediated via the DBD or basic domain of Jun, as demonstrated by Bassuk and Leiden (27Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and via the C-terminal domain of ETS2 that includes DBD and the two IDs, as shown in this study. It is relevant to note that DNA binding domains have been found to be implicated in protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors (28Choubey D. Li S.J. Datta B. Gutterman J.U. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5668-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For instance, the p202, an interferon-inducible nuclear protein, interacts with the DNA binding domain of Fos and Jun and inhibits the expression of reporter genes activated by c-Fos and c-Jun (29Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent results from Graf and co-workers (30Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) demonstrate that MafB, an AP-1 like protein, interacts via its basic region with the DBD of ETS1 and represses ETS1-mediated activation of the transferrin receptor gene. It is therefore easy to imagine that transcription factors that interact via their DBDs can interfere with each other in DNA binding and as a result reciprocally inhibit gene transcription. Although the use of a DBD for a protein-protein interaction region would explain, in a simplistic way, interference and antagonistic effects in gene regulation, it might appear paradoxical to explain synergistic activation. It is intriguing, however, to note that protein-protein interactions involving the DBD are dependent on the presence of DNA as demonstrated by us and observed by few others (27Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Remarkably, we found that the amount of ETS2/Fos/Jun complex is enhanced by the presence of specific DNA promoter fragments, suggesting that DNA binding possibly increases the protein area of contact, and as a result the quaternary complex ETS2/Fos/Jun/DNA is more stable. In support of this view, the x-ray crystal structure of the heterodimer c-FOS/c-JUN bound to the DNA recently identified (32Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) shows that the FOS/JUN/DNA complex exhibits a certain asymmetry in its coiled-coil and flexibility in its protein fork. The authors suggest that this special feature would allow the heterodimer to recognize disparate binding surfaces presented on other transcription factors bound at adjacent sites on the DNA. As more information of protein-DNA interactions will clearly come from x-ray crystal structures, it will be very interesting to reveal in more detail the interaction we have detected in this study with the stromelysin-1 promoter DNA complexed with Fos, Jun, and Ets transcription factors.Implications of the Role of DNA in Transcription Factor InteractionsIt is intriguing that the protein-protein interactions of DNA-binding domains of several transcription factors often are DNA-dependent. As originally described by Lai and Herr (26Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), the DNA intercalator EtBr provides a simple tool for distinguishing genuine protein-protein interactions (DNA-independent) from those that are DNA-dependent. Although the protein associations stabilized by DNA (which is a contaminant, e.g.in samples of in vitro synthesized proteins) may be specific or nonspecific, DNA may play a significant biological role in the protein-protein interactions of transcription factors. DNA, by making weak (i.e. nonspecific) contacts with transcription factors, can significantly increase the probability for transcription factor interactions and, at the same time, generate stable DNA-transcription factor complexes. Similarly, although the protein-protein interactions of transcription factors can be weak, so weak that they may not last in solution, however, because of additional contacts with DNA, the transcription factor complex should be stabilized. Indeed, it makes sense that transcription factor interactions should preferentially occur on DNA rather than in solution. The significance of physical interactions between transcription factors such as Ets- and c-Fos/c-Jun-families members is that it can effectively link different promoter elements such as EBS and AP-1 in gene regulation. Our results give significance not only for the stromelysin-1 and collagenase-1 regulation but also for other genes regulated by Ets and AP-1 transcription factors.Inhibitory Domains of ETS2 Enhance Protein-Protein InteractionsAs shown here the c-Fos/c-Jun complex, as well as ETS1 and ERG, binds to the C-terminal region of ETS2. This region comprises not only the DBD but also the two inhibitory domains ID1 and ID2. These domains interact with each other and with the DBD via intramolecular contacts thus preventing the DBD to interact with the DNA. It has been suggested that association of the two IDs with other factors can release the DBD from their negative influence (10Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 33Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is intriguing, however, that the inhibitory domains alone do not bind to any of the transcription factors tested, c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Fos/c-Jun, ETS1, and ERG (Fig. 4). In contrast when ID2 or both ID1 and ID2 are coupled to the DBD of ETS2, we detected increased binding of the transcription factors. Of interest is that ID2, which corresponds to the C-terminal end of 29 residues of ETS2, contributed largely to the increase of proteins bound to the DBD. Also, the C-terminal segment of 37 amino acids adjacent to the DBD (ETS domain) of GA binding protein α was found to mediate protein-protein interaction with the GA binding protein β subunit (34Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Repression of Transcription by Masking Transactivation DomainsThe Ets family members ETS2, ETS1, FLI1, and ERG and their combinations differentially regulate collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 promoter activity, in an additive or antagonistic fashion in HepG2 cells (18Butticè G. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Basuyaux J.P. Carrere S. Kurkinen M. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2297-2306PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, while ETS2 enhanced the stromelysin-1 promoter activity, ERG inhibited the ETS2-mediated activation of stromelysin-1 promoter. Therefore, we hypothesized a protein-protein interaction between ERG and ETS2 as a possible mechanism of the antagonistic effect on the stromelysin-1 regulation. Our results here demonstrate that ETS2 physically interacts with ERG via several domains including the TA domain of ETS2, suggesting that ERG represses the ETS2-mediated activation in part by blocking the TA of ETS2. Transactivation domains of several other transcription factors are implicated in protein contacts leading to repression or activation of transcription. Thus, the protein product of the retinoblastoma gene represses transcription by interacting directly with E2F and blocking its transactivation domain (35Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). PU.1, a lymphoid-specific transcription factor, can directly bind to both TFIID and retinoblastoma protein via its activation domain (36Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Our results show that not only the TA of ETS2 associates with ERG but also the C-terminal part of ETS2. However, the latter interaction is sensitive to EtBr treatment, suggesting that it is DNA-dependent. By contrast, the interaction of ERG to the TA of ETS2 is a direct protein-protein interaction apparently not affected by the presence of DNA. Interestingly, these results raise two possible mechanisms of gene regulation by ERG and ETS2, one of which involves the TA of ETS2 and the other one the DBD. In one possibility, ERG would inhibit the ETS2 effect by masking its TA and therefore cancelling out the activation potential of ETS2. In another possibility, ERG, by interacting with the DBD of ETS2, would prevent it from binding to the DNA.To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the formation of Ets heterodimers, ETS2/ETS1 and ETS2/ERG, in vitro and in vivo in yeast. Whether they exist as heterodimer or as a multiprotein complex with other cofactors in the cell still needs to be explored. Recently, only a few other groups (30Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 37Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirschner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the Ets family of transcription factors interacts with other transcription factors. Thus, the region of ETS1 (residues 123–240) that covers TA and ID1 domains interacts with the Runt domain of polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2α (37Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirschner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), whereas the DBD of ETS1 associates with PAX-5 in a DNA-dependent manner (31Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and with MafB (30Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Finally, we would like to propose that the C-terminal region of ETS2 is multifunctional, as it is capable not only of DNA sequence recognition but also of protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors. Here, we provided novel evidence demonstrating that the TA domain of ETS2 is implicated in protein-protein interaction with another member of the same family, ERG, and that this interaction might have functional relevance in the repression of gene transcription such as that of the stromelysin-1 promoter. In summary, our results provide a molecular basis to a better understanding of the synergistic or antagonistic gene regulation by the different members of the Ets- and AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) families. The transcription of genes is controlled positively or negatively by a variety of extracellular stimuli, yielding to a finely tuned regulation of gene expression. Gene transcription requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II with a multiprotein preinitiation complex at specific DNA sequences including the TATA promoter box. Interactions of general transcription factors with basal promoter elements are generally essential for basal transcription but cannot be sufficient to increase or decrease its rate. Activation and repression of gene transcription depend on the binding of several transcription factors to DNA-specific motifs that, when bound to their promoter elements, stimulate or inhibit transcription through protein-protein interactions with the basal transcription machinery (for review see Goodrichet al. (1Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)). An extensive number of transcription activators and repressors that regulate cellular and viral genes have been characterized including the Fos, Jun, and Ets families of transcription factors. Generally, transcription factors contain distinct domains with different functions. For instance, Fos and Jun contain a leucine zipper domain that allows the formation of homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes and a basic region, via which the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer binds to the 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ DNA sequence or AP-1 site (2Gentz R. Rauscher F.J. Abate C. Curran T. Science. 1989; 243: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ETS family of transcription factors is composed of two main domains, the transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain via which they bind to the 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ core sequence (3Crépieux P.

https://openalex.org/W2064583831,"In this report, we demonstrate that insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) is phosphorylated on tyrosine following treatment of UT-7 cells with erythropoietin. We have investigated the expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in several cell lines with erythroid and/or megakaryocytic features, and we observed that IRS-2 was expressed in all cell lines tested. In contrast, we did not detect the expression of IRS-1 in these cells. In response to erythropoietin, IRS-2 was immediately phosphorylated on tyrosine, with maximal phosphorylation between 1 and 5 min. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 was associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and with a 140-kDa protein that comigrated with the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, SHIP. Moreover, IRS-2 was constitutively associated with the erythropoietin receptor. We did not observe the association of IRS-2 with JAK2, Grb2, or PTP1D. Using BaF3 cells transfected with mutated erythropoietin receptors, we demonstrate that neither the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain nor the last 109 amino acids of the erythropoietin receptor are required for erythropoietin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Altogether, our results indicate that erythropoietin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation could account for the previously reported activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediated by erythropoietin receptors mutated in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-binding site (Damen, J., Cutler, R.

Moreover, IRS-2 was constitutively associated with the erythropoietin receptor. We did not observe the association of IRS-2 with JAK2, Grb2, or PTP1D. Using BaF3 cells transfected with mutated erythropoietin receptors, we demonstrate that neither the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain nor the last 109 amino acids of the erythropoietin receptor are required for erythropoietin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Altogether, our results indicate that erythropoietin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation could account for the previously reported activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediated by erythropoietin receptors mutated in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-binding site (Damen, J., Cutler, R. L., Jiao, H., Yi, T., and Krystal, G. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23402–23406; Gobert, S., Porteu, F., Pallu, S., Muller, O., Sabbah, M., Dusanter-Fourt, I., Courtois, G., Lacombe, C., Gisselbrecht, S., and Mayeux, P. (1995)Blood 86, 598–606). Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PTB domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain; PI, phosphatidylinositol; IL, interleukin; Epo, erythropoietin; SCF, stem cell factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. is a major substrate of the IGF-1 and insulin receptors (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS-1 is a hydrophilic protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 131 kDa that migrates between 160 and 185 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis partially because of a high serine phosphorylation state (2Sun X.J.

IRS-1 contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a PTB domain, and at least 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites including nine YXXM motifs that are consensus binding sites for the SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit (p85) of PI 3-kinase (4Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). IRS-1 binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-1 and insulin receptors through its PTB domain and becomes a docking protein for signaling proteins such as PI 3-kinase, Grb2, PTP1D, and Nck after tyrosine phosphorylation (5White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report shows that the pleckstrin homology domain could also be involved in the association of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor (6Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). More recently, a second IRS protein was identified that was designated IRS-2 (7Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This protein corresponds to the previously identified 4PS protein (for IL-4-inducedphosphotyrosine substrate) (8Wang L.M.

IRS-2 exhibits a high structural similarity to IRS-1, with a strong conservation of the PTB and pleckstrin homology domains. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation sites shown to bind PI 3-kinase, Grb2, and PTP1D in IRS-1 are also conserved in IRS-2. Not only insulin and IGF-1 receptors, but also several cytokine and interferon receptors can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 (9Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Li W. Lienhard G.E. Pacini S.

Indeed, it has been shown that IRS-1 and IRS-2 bind to a peptidic sequence of the activated IL-4 receptor with a typical NPXY PTB domain-binding motif (19Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and IRS-1 or IRS-2 expression appears to be required for IL-4-induced mitogenesis (10Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, other cytokine receptors that induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 do not possess typical PTB domain-binding motifs, and the mechanism of IRS-1 and IRS-2 activation by these receptors remains unknown. The erythropoietin (Epo) receptor also belongs to the cytokine receptor family (20D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G.

However, binding of PI 3-kinase to the Epo receptor does not appear to be required for Epo-induced PI 3-kinase activation since Epo receptors devoid of Tyr479 still activate PI 3-kinase (35Damen J.E.

Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Epo could activate PI 3-kinase by several mechanisms. However, these alternate pathways for Epo-induced PI 3-kinase activation have not been identified up to date. We have previously shown that one of these mechanisms required only the first 127 amino acids of the Epo receptor intracellular domain and was not dependent on the phosphorylation of the single tyrosine residue (Tyr343) present in this region (36Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that erythropoietin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Epo-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation does not require the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor, and IRS-2 appears to be constitutively associated with the Epo receptor. After Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-2 associates with PI 3-kinase and with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein comigrating with SHIP (p140). In contrast, we did not detect the association of Grb2 with IRS-2 in Epo-stimulated cells. Thus, our results strongly suggest that IRS-2 binding could be an alternate mechanism for Epo-induced PI 3-kinase activation. The highly purified recombinant human Epo (specific activity of 120,000 units/mg) used throughout this study was a generous gift from Dr. M. Brandt (Boehringer Mannheim). Recombinant SCF was kindly provided by Dr. A. Shimosaka (Kirin Brewery Co., Tokyo). Anti-IRS-1 (catalog number 06-248), anti-IRS-2 (catalog number 06-506), and anti-JAK2 (catalog number 06-255) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-PI 3-kinase (p85 subunit; catalog number P13030) and anti-SHC (catalog number S14630) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-Grb2 antibodies (catalog number C-23) were from Santa Cruz. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were a generous gift from Dr. B. Drucker. Anti-Epo receptor antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with a recombinant protein composed of the full intracellular domain of the human Epo receptor fused to GST. Anti-GST antibodies were also prepared in our laboratory using the same protocol. Whole anti-GST and anti-Epo receptor sera were used. A subclone of the human leukemic cell line UT-7 (37Komatsu N.

These cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum complemented with 2 units/ml Epo, 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF, or 50 ng/ml SCF.

Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) cells were cultivated in the same medium complemented with 2.5% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. WEHI-conditioned medium is the supernatant of end-logarithmic phase cultures of WEHI-3B cells (ATCC TIB-68). BaF3 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutated Epo receptors and selected for their ability to grow in Epo as described previously (36Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before each experiment, these cells were serum- and growth factor-deprived by incubation for 5 h in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Exponentially growing hematopoietic cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer at a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Samples corresponding to 5 × 105 cells (or 2.5 × 105 cells for NIH 3T3 control cells) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 6.5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were done as described previously (25Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 1% Brij 96 was used to solubilize the cells instead of 1% Nonidet P-40. ECL (Amersham Ltd., Les Ullis, France) was used for Western blot visualization. Each experiment was performed at least twice with similar results. To test for the possible involvement of IRS-1 or IRS-2 in the Epo mode of action, we first investigated whether these proteins were expressed in erythroid and other hematopoietic Epo-responsive cells. As a positive control, we used an NIH 3T3 cell lysate that was previously shown to express both IRS-1 and IRS-2 (18Welham M.J. Bone H. Levings M. Learmonth L. Wang L.M. Leslie K.B. Pierce J.H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1377-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, all hematopoietic cells tested expressed IRS-2, although IRS-2 expression appeared to be relatively low in Mo7E cells. IRS-2 migrated as diffuse bands with apparent molecular masses of 160–175 kDa in the murine cells (T3Cl2, BaF3, FDCP-1, HCD57, and NIH 3T3) and 170–190 kDa in the human cells (UT-7, Mo7E, and TF-1). In contrast, IRS-1 expression was not detected in these cells. (The faint band in Fig. 1 (lower panel) was exactly at the same position as IRS-2, and its intensity varied as did the IRS-2 signal in Fig. 1 (upper panel). Thus, it most likely corresponds to some cross-reactivity of the anti-IRS-1 antiserum with IRS-2.) In another experiment, we immunoprecipitated UT-7 cell extracts with anti-IRS-1 antibodies, and we analyzed these immunoprecipitates by Western blotting using anti-IRS-1 antibodies. Again, no IRS-1 protein was detected in these cells (data not shown). Serum- and growth factor-deprived UT-7 cells were stimulated for 2.5 min with 25 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 units/ml Epo, or 100 ng/ml SCF. To ensure maximal response to the cytokine, each cell population was previously cultured for at least 3 weeks in the corresponding growth factor. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-2 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 A, Epo (but not GM-CSF or SCF) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins of 180 and 140 kDa immunoprecipitated by anti-IRS-2 antibodies. Reprobing the blot with anti-IRS-2 antibodies confirmed that the 180-kDa protein was IRS-2. To control the efficiency of cytokine stimulation, the same extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 (Epo- or GM-CSF-stimulated cells) or with anti-c-Kit (SCF-stimulated cells) antibodies and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2 B, JAK2 was activated by GM-CSF, although with a lower intensity than by Epo. Moreover, a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Kit was detected in SCF-stimulated UT-7 cells. Thus, although GM-CSF and SCF receptors were also efficiently stimulated, only Epo induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in UT-7 cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was maximal after 1–5 min of Epo stimulation and then started to decrease, although it remained detectable after 1 h of stimulation (Fig.3). The tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS-2-associated 140-kDa protein seemed to be more transient. Indeed, it appeared to be induced also very quickly, but to disappear earlier, and it was only barely detectable after 30 min of Epo stimulation. In addition, another faintly stained band was observed in Fig. 3. It exhibited a molecular mass of 70 kDa and could correspond to the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptor. A typical Epo dose-response curve is shown in Fig. 4. Epo-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation exhibited a strong correlation with Epo binding to its receptor. The dose-response curve for Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was similar to the previously reported dose-response curves for Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its own receptor (25Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Epo-induced PI 3-kinase activation (33Mayeux P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Mauduit P. Sabbah M. Drucker B. Vainchenker W. Fischer S. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Epo-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in UT-7 cells was consistently observed in 11 independent experiments. Moreover, Epo-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in HCD57 cells (data not shown) and in BaF3 cells transfected with the Epo receptor (see below).Figure 4Epo-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with Epo receptor occupancy. Growth factor- and serum-deprived UT-7 cells were stimulated for 2.5 min with the indicated Epo concentrations. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-2 antibodies, and immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (anti-PY). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-IRS-2 antibodies. Assuming an equilibrium dissociation constant of 200 pm for the Epo receptor in UT-7 cells (49Hermine O. Mayeux P. Titeux M. Mitjavila M.T. Casadevall N. Guichard J. Komatsu N. Suda T. Miura Y. Vainchenker W. Breton-Gorius J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), receptor occupancy was 2% for 10 milliunits/ml Epo, 18% for 100 milliunits/ml, 70% for 1 unit/ml, 95% for 10 units/ml, and 99.5% for 100 units/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then tested the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 with signaling proteins after Epo stimulation of UT-7 cells. The blot presented in Fig. 3 was reprobed with anti-PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit (p85) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 A, p85 was clearly detected in IRS-2 immunoprecipitates from Epo-stimulated cells. To confirm that PI 3-kinase associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2, lysates from Epo-stimulated UT-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 5 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of a band comigrating with IRS-2 was significantly increased in Epo-stimulated cells. Most likely, this band corresponded to IRS-2, although only a very faint band was detected by anti-IRS-2 antibodies in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates due to the relatively poor sensitivity of the anti-IRS-2 antiserum (data not shown). We then tested whether Grb2, SHC, or PTP1D also associated with IRS-2 in Epo-stimulated UT-7 cells. Lysates from Epo-treated UT-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for these proteins and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-IRS-2 antibodies. No IRS-2 protein either tyrosine-phosphorylated or not was detected in these immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Moreover, Grb2, SHC, and PTP1D were not detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for these proteins (data not shown). In contrast, IRS-2 was associated with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 140 and 70 kDa, respectively, in Epo-stimulated cells (see Fig. 3). In many cells, Epo induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 140-kDa SHC-associated protein that was identified as the PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, SHIP (44Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L.

A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the 140-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-2 antibodies comigrated with the SHC-associated SHIP and most likely corresponds to this protein. The apparent molecular mass of the other IRS-2-associated protein suggests that it could be the tyrosine-phosphorylated Epo receptor. To test this hypothesis, anti-Epo receptor immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.7, only a faint band comigrating with IRS-2 was detected in extracts from Epo-stimulated cells. We next probed the same blot with anti-IRS-2 antibodies. Surprisingly, the IRS-2 protein was easily detected in anti-Epo receptor immunoprecipitates from both resting and Epo-stimulated UT-7 cells (Fig. 7, lower panel), showing that IRS-2 was constitutively associated with the Epo receptor. Control anti-GST antibodies did not immunoprecipitate any protein revealed by either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-IRS-2 antibodies.Figure 6The 140-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with IRS-2 comigrates with SHC-associated SHIP.

These cells were stimulated for 2.5 min with 10 units/ml Epo. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-2 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, Epo induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in BaF3 cells expressing each type of Epo receptor, demonstrating that the tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of the Epo receptor are not required for Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Reprobing the blot with anti-IRS-2 antibodies showed equal loading of each line (Fig. 8, right panel). Epo-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was significantly higher in cells expressing the Epo receptor devoid of intracellular tyrosine residues. This result was consisten"

Mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CEBPα (C/EBPα−/− mice) die shortly after birth of hypoglycemia, with no detectable hepatic PEPCK mRNA and negligible hepatic glycogen stores. Half of the mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CEBPβ (C/EBPβ−/−mice) have normal glucose homeostasis (phenotype A), and the other half die at birth of hypoglycemia due to a failure to express the gene for PEPCK and to mobilize hepatic glycogen (phenotype B). Insulin deficiency induces C/EBPα and PEPCK gene transcription in the livers of 19-day fetal rats, whereas dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) increases the expression of the gene for C/EBPβ and causes a transient burst of PEPCK mRNA. Bt2cAMP induces PEPCK mRNA in the livers of fetal C/EBPα−/− mice, but at only 20% of the level of control animals; however, there is no induction of PEPCK mRNA if the cyclic nucleotide is injected into C/EBPα−/− mice immediately after delivery. The expression of the gene for C/EBPβ is markedly induced in the livers of C/EBPα−/− mice within 2 h after the administration of Bt2cAMP. C/EBPβ−/− mice injected at 20 days of fetal life with Bt2cAMP have a normal pattern of induction of hepatic PEPCK mRNA. In C/EBPβ−/− mice with phenotype B, the administration of Bt2cAMP immediately after delivery induces PEPCK mRNA, causes the mobilization of hepatic glycogen, and maintains normal glucose homeostasis for up to 4 h (duration of the experiment). We conclude that C/EBPα is required for the cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression in the liver and that C/EBPβ can compensate for the loss of C/EBPα if its concentration is induced to appropriate levels.

The stepwise differentiation of gene expression has been intensively studied (1Greengard O. Litwack G. Biochemical Action of Hormones. I. Academic Press, New York1970: 53-87Google Scholar, 2Powell D.J. Friedman J.M. Oulette A.J. Krauter K.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The liver-specific expression of genes is defined by a combination of hepatic enriched nuclear transcriptional activators that bind their cognate DNA motifs in the target genes. Four families of such activators (HNF-1, 1The abbreviations used are: HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; kb, kilobase pair; CRE, cAMP response element; DBP, D binding protein. -3, and -4 and the C/EBP family of transcription factors), whose members bind to the same DNA motif, have been characterized to date. Regulatory regions of liver-specific genes include a combination of recognition motifs of several distinct activators from one or more of these families. The coexistence of a specific combination of these activators in the cell and their binding to the cognate target motifs are essential for the liver-specific gene transcription (3De Simone V. Cortese R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Crabtree G.R. Schibler U. Scott M.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation.

Thus, the ordered initiation of transcription of each liver-specific gene depends on the developmental appearance of the appropriate set of transcriptional activators that appear sequentially during liver development in correlation with the initiation of expression of their target genes (6Zaret K.S. Tavloni N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 135-143Google Scholar). For example, members of the HNF-3 family appear in primordial hepatocytes (7Ang S.-L. Wierda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1301-1315PubMed Google Scholar), whereas two important members of the C/EBP family (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) are transcribed initially in the liver during the last trimester of development (8Berkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and D Binding Protein (DBP) is present only after birth (10Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The signals that induce the appearance of these transcription factors during liver development have not been identified. The involvement of hormone-mediated signal transduction has been previously suggested in the case of C/EBPα (11McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Glueckshon-Waelch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and demonstrated for adipocyte differentiation in cultured cells, where the expression of the genes for members of the C/EBP family is induced (8Berkenmeier E.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There is also a differential modulation of members of this family during the growth and arrest phases of liver regeneration (14Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rana B. Mischoulson D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation of at least two members of the C/EBP family in the liver (8Berkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 16Mencher D. Cohen H. Benvenisty N. Meyuhas O. Reshef L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), during a period of profound changes in the hormonal environment of the neonate, suggests that hormones might be involved in triggering the expression of the genes for these two transcription factors. This has been reinforced by our previous studies that have implicated members of the C/EBP family in the onset of transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK; EC4.1.1.32) at birth (17Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although this gene is not expressed in the fetal liver and appears at birth (18Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it can be prematurely activated by increasing the glucagon/insulin ratio to a state that is similar to that which prevails at birth (19Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B. Kervran A. Rieutort M. Assan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is possible to cause the premature activation of PEPCK gene expression by injecting fetusesin utero with Bt2cAMP or by administering streptozotocin, which causes insulin deficiency (20Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Ballard J. Fed. Proc. 1975; 34: 166-171PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mencher D. Reshef L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chromatin conformation of the PEPCK gene in the liver undergoes a gradual transition from a “compact” conformation on day 19 of gestation to an “open” conformation just prior to the initiation of its transcription at birth (18Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Injecting 19-day fetal rats with Bt2cAMP induced both this process and the expression of the gene for PEPCK in the fetal liver (18Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There may thus be a gradual assembly of nuclear factors onto the PEPCK promoter during development, which is prompted by alterations in the concentration of hepatic cAMP. DNase I footprinting analysis of the PEPCK promoter using nuclear extracts from the livers of fetal, newborn, and adult rats indicated distinct binding interactions that were developmentally regulated,i.e. they were fully present in nuclear proteins extracted from the livers of newborn and adult animals, but deficient in liver extracts from fetal rats (17Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins from the livers of newborn and adult rats protected all of the eight binding sites in the PEPCK promoter that have been previously mapped by Roesler et al. (22Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9657-9664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These included binding to the recognition sites for nuclear factor-1 and cAMP response element-binding protein and to the sites for the hepatocyte-enriched factors HNF-1 and HNF-4 and for three C/EBP motifs (Fig. 1). However, nuclear proteins from the fetal liver interacted poorly with those sites in the PEPCK promoter that bind C/EBP (17Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggested that whichever member of the C/EBP family binds to the PEPCK promoter, it is developmentally regulated, i.e. it is deficient in rat liver at 18 days of fetal life and accumulates at birth. The pattern of development of the binding activity exactly coincides with the appearance of C/EBPα in the liver (8Berkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The importance of C/EBPα in the control of glucose homeostasis was clearly demonstrated in the studies of Wang et al. (24Wang N.D. Finegold M. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) using mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for this transcription factor. These mice die at birth of profound hypoglycemia; they have no mRNA for PEPCK or glucose-6-phosphatase in their livers and have only marginal levels of hepatic glycogen present at birth. Mice with a deletion in the gene for C/EBPβ have a more complex pattern of regulation of glucose homeostasis. Only half of the expected mendelian ratio of C/EBPβ−/− mice from the mating of mice heterozygous for the deletion in the C/EBPβ gene are alive at weaning; these animals are more susceptible to infections (25Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V.

Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we report that the other 50% of C/EBPβ-deficient mice die of profound hypoglycemia and that they are unable to induce the initial transcription of the gene for PEPCK in the liver at birth and hence are unable to synthesize hepatic glucose during the critical perinatal period. The availability of these “knockout” animal models provided us with a unique tool to study the effect of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ on the development of PEPCK gene transcription in particular and on the normal pattern of development of glucose homeostasis in general. Our results demonstrate that C/EBPα is required for the normal induction of hepatic PEPCK gene transcription by cAMP during the perinatal period; C/EBPβ is not required for cAMP induction of PEPCK gene transcription before birth, but is necessary for the normal development of PEPCK gene expression in the liver immediately after birth. There is thus a complex interaction between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ that results in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription during the perinatal period. Bt2cAMP, theophylline, streptozotocin, guanidine thiocyanate, and cesium chloride were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. An ECL Western blot analysis kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. Sabra rats of Wistar origin were provided by the Harland Breeding Farm at the Hebrew University Medical School. Adult rats were 6-week-old males. Rats pregnant for 18 and 19 days were anesthetized with ether; uteruses were exposed by partial laparectomy; and fetuses were injected through the uterine wall with 25 μg of Bt2cAMP and 25 μg of theophylline in 15 ml of saline. Fetal rats at 18 days of gestation were injected with Bt2cAMP and theophylline as noted above and killed 24 h later. Animals at 19 days of gestation were killed either 40 min (0.7 h) or 3 h after injection. Immediately upon termination of the injections, the fetuses were put back into the dam's abdomen, and the wall was sutured. Control animals were surgically treated without any injections. Insulin deficiency was generated by streptozotocin treatment as described previously (18Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, streptozotocin (480 mg/ml of 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) in 0.9% NaCl) was freshly dissolved immediately before the injection. Fetal rats were injected in utero with 5 ml of streptozotocin once daily on 2 successive days. Mice homozygous for deletions in the genes for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were generated as described by Wang et al. (24Wang N.D. Finegold M. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) and by Screpanti et al. (25Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), respectively. For our studies, we used mice heterozygous for the deletion in the respective gene to generate animals. At 20 days of fetal life, the mice were injected with 125 mg of Bt2cAMP/kg of body weight (27Loose D. Shaw P. Krauter K.S. Robinson C. Englard S. Hanson R.W. Gluechsohn-Waelsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5184-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in utero as described above for rats and killed 2 h later. The livers were removed, and RNA was isolated. Alternatively, the mice were delivered by cesarean section at 20 days of fetal life and then injected with 125 mg of Bt2cAMP/kg of body weight; the animals were maintained in a humidicrib at 37 °C for the periods indicated in the figure legends before being used for the analysis of blood glucose using a Beckman commercial glucose analyzer and for the determination of the concentration of specific mRNA in the liver. The PEPCK cDNA probe was a 1.6-kbPstI fragment (28Yoo-Warren H. Monahan J.E. Short J. Short H. Bruzel A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Meisner H.M. Samols D. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 767-776Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and the C/EBPα genomic fragment used to screen for C/EBPα−/− mice was a 1.8-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragment of the C/EBPα gene (24Wang N.D.

The C/EBPβ cDNA probe was a 0.67-kb PstI mouse fragment (30Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or a 0.7-kb BamHI mouse genomic fragment (25Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), which was used to screen for C/EBPβ−/−mice. The superoxide dismutase cDNA was a 0.62-kb PstI human fragment (31Sherman L. Dafni J. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5465-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the albumin cDNA was a 1.2-kbHindIII fragment from the rat (32Kioussis D. Hamilton R. Hanson R.W. Tilghman S.M. Taylor J.M.

Ponte P. Kedes L. Hickey R.J. Skoultchi A.I. Cell. 1984; 36: 709-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (34Eisenberger C.L. Nechushtan H. Cohen H. Shanti M. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1396-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using either 5 μg of poly(A)+RNA or 20 μg of total RNA. Briefly, total RNA from tissues was extracted with guanidine thiocyanate and centrifuged through a CsCl cushion following the method of Chirgwin et al. (35Chirgwin J.M. Prezybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (36Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). For the analysis of PEPCK mRNA in the livers of the mice used in this study, total RNA was used directly for Northern analysis. Nuclei were prepared from the livers of adult and 19-day fetal rats as described by Meisner et al. (37Meisner H. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Elongation of nascent RNA chains from the isolated nuclei was carried out essentially as described by Schibler et al. (38Schibler U. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Pittet A.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), except that heparin sulfate was not used and there was a lower concentration of (NH4)2SO4(35 μm) in the reaction mixture. Labeled RNA was extracted from the reaction mixture (39Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and hybridized to DNA, which was bound to GeneScreen Plus (NEN Life Science Products). Immobilization of linearized plasmid DNA and hybridization were performed according to Aloni et al. (40Aloni R. Peleg D. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The hybridization signal was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Nuclear extracts from the livers of 19-day fetal and adult rats were prepared by the method of Gorskiet al. (41Gorski K. Carneino M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (17Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed according to Towbin et al. (42Towbin H. Stahlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-mg nuclear extracts were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to filters that were first immunoreacted with a polyclonal antibody to C/EBPα (kindly provided by Dr. Steven L. McKnight, University of Texas, Southwest Medical Center) and then stripped of the radioactive probe after detecting the signal and reacted with a polyclonal antibody to C/EBPβ (kindly provided by Dr. D. Ron, New York Medical Center). The commercial ECL Western blot analysis kit was used for detection of the signals. To determine the role of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in the expression of the gene for PEPCK in the liver during development, we have used mice that contain deletions in the genes for these transcription factors. The level of PEPCK mRNA in the livers of 20-day fetal mice with a deletion in the genes for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was determined 2 h after the administration of Bt2cAMP to animalsin utero (Fig. 2). PEPCK mRNA in the livers of control mice at day 20 of fetal life was not detectable, but injecting the mice with Bt2cAMP resulted in a marked induction of transcription of the PEPCK gene. With C/EBPα−/− mice, the induction of expression of the PEPCK gene in the liver by Bt2cAMP was ∼20% of that noted with wild-type mice or with animals heterozygous for a deletion in the gene for C/EBPα. In contrast, Bt2cAMP caused the expected induction of PEPCK mRNA in the livers of mice either heterozygous or homozygous for a deletion in the gene for C/EBPβ. Thus, C/EBPα is required for the normal full induction of PEPCK by cAMP in the livers of fetal mice. We next determined the relative importance of the two C/EBP isozymes in the expression of the gene for PEPCK in the livers of mice in the immediate postnatal period (Fig.3). C/EBPα−/− mice had barely detectable levels of PEPCK mRNA in their livers 2 h after birth. The administration of Bt2cAMP caused a marginal induction of PEPCK gene expression in the livers of these mice 2 h after the administration of the cyclic nucleotide. For comparison, the effect of Bt2cAMP on the induction of PEPCK mRNA in the livers of 20-day fetal mice with a deletion in the gene for C/EBPα is included. Fig. 3 (middle panel) shows the expected induction by Bt2cAMP of PEPCK gene expression in the livers of wild-type mice either at 20 days of fetal development or at 2 h after birth. In this case, there were only marginal levels of PEPCK mRNA in the livers of the mice, and the administration of Bt2cAMP resulted in a rapid and marked accumulation of PEPCK mRNA in the liver within 2 h. The situation with the C/EBPβ−/− mice is more complex. These animals have two distinct phenotypes; mice with phenotype A have normal glucose homeostasis, but are more susceptible to infections (25Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V.

Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Mice with phenotype B have severe hypoglycemia: 10–16 mg/dl glucose as compared with 60 mg/dl in the blood of normal mice at the same age (data not shown) and no detectable PEPCK mRNA. These mice also have a hepatic glycogen concentration of ∼3%, which is in the same general range as noted for normal littermates of the same age (data not shown). When C/EBPβ−/− mice with phenotype B were injected with Bt2cAMP 2 h after delivery, there was a marked increase in the expression of the gene for PEPCK within 2 h of the injection of the cyclic nucleotide, with a resultant accumulation of PEPCK mRNA in the liver (Fig. 3). We next determined the time course of Bt2cAMP induction of expression of the genes for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PEPCK in the livers of 19-day fetal rats. RNAs for both isoforms 2The term isoforms, as used in this paper, refers to the various members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors (i.e. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and D binding protein). of C/EBP were detectable in the fetal liver, albeit at low levels relative to those in the livers of adult rats. The injection of Bt2cAMP into fetuses had no effect on C/EBPα mRNA, but induced the level of C/EBPβ mRNA. Although the concentration of C/EBPβ mRNA increased only 5-fold, it shared the same transient pattern of induction as that of PEPCK mRNA (Fig.4). As anticipated, PEPCK mRNA was markedly induced in the livers of these fetuses by 40 min (0.7 h in Fig. 4) after the administration of Bt2cAMP and increased further over the next 3 h. By 24 h, PEPCK mRNA was no longer detectable in the liver (Fig. 4). The levels of PEPCK mRNA at the peak exceeded those noted in the livers of control fetuses by a factor of at least 500, as judged by comparison of the autoradiographic signals at different exposure times. Run-on transcription assays were then performed to assess whether the premature induction of PEPCK gene expression in the livers of 19-day fetal rats resulted from the initiation of gene transcription (Fig.5). Pooled cDNAs of five different ribosomal proteins (S4, L5, L7, L18A, and L19), whose transcription rates in the liver are stable later in development (40Aloni R. Peleg D. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were used to normalize the transcriptional activities of the various nuclear preparations. In addition, since the rate of albumin gene expression on a per hepatocyte basis is the same in the fetal and adult livers (43Cascio F. Zaret K.S. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 217-225PubMed Google Scholar), its rate of transcription was used to determine the fraction of the parenchyma-derived nuclei in the fetal liver compared with that in the adult liver. The rate of transcription of the albumin gene in the fetal liver was 30–40% of that in the adult liver. On this basis, we estimated that the parenchymal cells in the livers of 19-day fetal rats constitute ∼30–40% of the liver cells. The injection of Bt2cAMP into these fetuses resulted in the onset of transcription of the PEPCK gene in the liver (within 40 min after the injection), which exceeded by at least 200-fold that of control animals of the same age; the level of transcription was 25% of the rate obtained with nuclei from the livers of adult rats. The marginal transcription rate of the C/EBPβ gene in nuclei from either the adult or fetal liver precluded any conclusion regarding an effect of cAMP on the transcription of this gene (Fig. 5). In contrast to the gene for C/EBPβ, transcription of the gene for C/EBPα was readily detected in nuclei from the adult liver, but not in those from the fetal liver whether before or after injection of Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5). At birth, there is a relative insulin deficiency; when streptozotocin was injected into fetal rats, it caused an induction of PEPCK gene expression in the fetal liver that was independent of cAMP (16Mencher D. Cohen H. Benvenisty N. Meyuhas O. Reshef L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Mencher D. Shouval D. Reshef L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from fetuses treated with streptozotocin indicated the presence of PEPCK mRNA, the estimated level of which reached ∼5% of that found in adult tissues (data not shown). The rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene after the administration of streptozotocin was ∼10% of that noted after injection of Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5), corroborating the lower increase in the abundance of PEPCK transcripts. More important, streptozotocin treatment greatly induced C/EBPα gene transcription, surpassing by ∼3-f"
https://openalex.org/W2090340745,"We describe here the cloning of mouse complementary DNAs encoding a novel protein, Rb-8 neural cell adhesion molecule (RNCAM), with a predicted extracellular region of five immunoglobulin C2-type domains followed by two fibronectin type III domains. Alternative splicing is likely to generate two RNCAM isoforms, which are differently attached to the cell membrane. These structural features and overall sequence identity identify this protein as a novel member of a cell adhesion molecule subgroup together with vertebrate neural cell adhesion molecule, <i>Aplysia</i> cell adhesion molecule, and <i>Drosophila</i> fasciclin II. In insects, fasciclin II is present on a restricted subset of embryonic central nervous system axons where it controls selective axon fasciculation. Intriguingly, RNCAM likewise is expressed in subsets of olfactory and vomeronasal neurons with topographically defined axonal projections. The spatial expression RNCAM corresponds precisely to that of certain odorant receptor expression zones of the olfactory epithelium. These expression patterns thus render RNCAM the first described cell adhesion molecule with a potential regulatory role in formation of selective axonal projections important for olfactory sensory information coding."
https://openalex.org/W2046820814,"We studied the extent of cellular inhibitory activity of α1-antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX), a potent inhibitor of proprotein convertases of the subtilisin/kexin type. We compared the inhibitory effects of α1-PDX on the intracellular processing of two model precursors (pro-7B2 and POMC) mediated by six of the seven known mammalian convertases, namely furin, PC1, PC2, PACE4, PC5-A, PC5-B, and PC7. The substrates selected were pro7B2, a precursor cleaved within the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and pro-opiomelanocortin, which is processed in the TGN and secretory granules. Biosynthetic analyses were performed using either vaccinia virus expression in BSC40, GH4C1, and AtT20 cells, or stable transfectants of α1-PDX in AtT20 cells. Results revealed that α1-PDX inhibits processing of these precursors primarily within the constitutive secretory pathway and that α1-PDX is cleaved into a shorter form by some convertases. Evidence is presented demonstrating that in contrast to the full-length α1-PDX (64 kDa), the cleaved (56 kDa) secreted product does not significantly inhibit furin activity in vitro. Cellular expression of α1-PDX results in modified contents of mature secretory granules with increased levels of partially processed products.

Biosynthetic data suggested that α1-PDX is primarily secreted via the constitutive secretory pathway and that it can be cleaved by some PCs.

VV:mPOMC and VV:α1-PDX, VV:α1-AT Pittsburgh, and VV:α1-AT were generous gifts of Dr. Gary Thomas (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). BSC40, GH4C1, and AtT20 cells were infected with the specified plaque forming units (pfu)/cell of VV:PC, VV:7B2, and VV:α1-PDX. The media and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a 7B2 (24Seidah N.G. Hsi K.L. De Serres G. Rochemont J. Hamelin J. Antakly T. Cantin M. Chrétien M. Arch. Biochem.

Seventeen hours post-infection, serum-free media of AtT20 cells overexpressing either α1-PDX (2 pfu/cell) alone or in combination with furin (4 pfu/cell) were concentrated 100-fold on a Centriprep-10 (Amicon), diluted 1:1 with 70% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Purification of α1-PDX on Superose 12 (1 × 30 cm) (Pharmacia), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.5, was performed on media isolated from a total of 3 × 109 cells. The eluted fractions (0.2 ml) were tested for α1-PDX immunoreactivity by radioimmunoassay using an α1-AT antibody (Sigma). Enzymatic activity was assessed using the fluorogenic substrate pERTKR-MCA (Peptides International) as described previously (31Munzer J.S. Basak A Zhong M. Mamarbachi A. Hamelin J. Savaria D.

Essentially, varying amounts of the concentrated cell media, obtained following VV:α1-PDX infections, were added to the reaction mixture (containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.5, 1 mmCaCl2, and soluble before cystein-rich domain (BRCD)-hfurin (31Munzer J.S.

Following addition of the fluorogenic substrate, fluorescence was monitored at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min using a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer (model LS 50B). The rate of substrate hydrolysis was constant for at least 60 min. In those assays requiring inhibition of secreted shed furin, concentrated media were first treated with 100 μmRVKR-chloromethyl ketone (RVKR-CK) (Bachem) for 30 min at room temperature and the reaction stopped with 0.2% bovine serum albumin followed by four washes on a Centricon-30 (Amicon). Media from VV:α1-PDX and [VV:α1-PDX + VV:hfurin]-infected AtT20 cells were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and the separated proteins electroeluted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Schleichter & Schuell). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Boehringer Mannheim) using the α1-AT antiserum. Densitometry of ECL films was carried out as described (31Munzer J.S.

Full-length α1-PDX cDNA cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (InVitrogen) or an empty pcDNA3 vector were transfected into AtT20 cells. Three G418-resistant clones expressing α1-PDX were isolated. One of the clones expressing the highest amount of α1-PDX was selected for further analysis. Stimulation of secretion with 5 mm8-Br-cAMP was done as described (32De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D.

Following separation of media and cell extracts by SDS-PAGE, radioimmunoassays using a β-endorphin antibody were performed on material extracted from 1-mm thick gel slices, as described (9Benjannet S.

Localization of α1-PDX in transfected AtT20 cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (33Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J.

Guinea pig anti-TGN38 antibody (kindly donated by Dr. W. Garten, Marburg, Germany) was used at a 1:50 dilution and the guinea pig anti-ACTH at 1:100. When primary antibodies were from guinea pig, the immunoreaction was revealed using a fluoresceine-labeled secondary antibody raised in goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) diluted 1:10 in 10% normal goat serum. Samples were examined using a Zeiss microscope with an epifluorescence attachment, equipped with a Plan-Neofluor 40 × 0.75 objective. Treatment of AtT20 cells with 20 μm of the lysosomal inhibitor methionine methyl ester (Sigma) for 4 h was performed as described (33Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L.

To define the extent by which α1-PDX inhibits the intracellular processing of precursors, we have co-expressed this serpin with the model substrate pro7B2 (24Seidah N.G. Hsi K.L. De Serres G.

The processing of pro7B2 (30 kDa) into 7B2 (23 kDa) in BSC40 cells was studied following a pulse of 30 min with [35S]Met and a chase of 60 min. The data show that this cleavage is effectively blocked by α1-PDX (Fig.1). In contrast, α1-PDX only partially inhibits pro7B2 processing in GH4C1 and AtT20 cells which contain secretory granules, and the extent of inhibition is greater in the latter cells. As measured by biosynthetic analysis, the expression levels of either 7B2 (Fig. 1) or α1-PDX (not shown) in the three cell lines were comparable. We next compared the inhibitory profile in the above 3 cell lines in which 7B2 and α1-PDX were co-expressed with each PC or with the wild type (WT) vaccinia virus control (Fig.2 A). The convertase PC2 was not studied, as the C-terminal of pro7B2 is an effective inhibitor of this enzyme (26Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Benjannet S. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). First, biosynthetic analyses demonstrated that the protein expression levels of furin, PC1, PC5-A, PC5-B, and PC7 are comparable to within a factor of 1.5 in each cell type (not shown). Only the PACE4 immunoreactivity could not be tested, since antibodies recognizing the mature human enzyme were not available. Second, the extent of α1-PDX inhibition of the PC-generated processing of pro7B2 is maximal in BSC40 cells as compared with GH4C1 and AtT20 cells (Fig.2 A). Third, in all three cell types and in the presence of α1-PDX, pro7B2 processing by furin and especially by PACE4 and PC5, results in the appearance of a secreted 25-kDa product (Fig.2 A). These data agree with those of Fig. 1 showing the presence of a 25-kDa intermediate in the media of GH4C1 cells expressing α1-PDX. GH4C1 cells are known to express significant amounts of these three PCs (3Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Day R. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Fourth, in BSC40 cells PC5-A produces an intracellular 28-kDa intermediate. Fifth, pro7B2 processing into the 23-kDa 7B2 by PC7 is scarcely inhibited by α1-PDX (Fig.2 A). Sixth, when similar experiments were performed with either α1-AT Pittsburgh or α1-AT, no inhibitory effect on the processing of pro7B2 by any PC was observed in the above cell lines (not shown), emphasizing the PC specificity of α1-PDX. The N-terminal immunoreactive 25- and 28-kDa intermediates observed in the presence of PC5 and α1-PDX are likely to represent C-terminally truncated forms of pro7B2, possibly resulting from cleavage at either one of the only two potential pairs of basic residues QGKR165 and VAKK173 found in the segment 156–186 of mouse pro7B2 (25Mbikay M. Grant S.G.N. Sirois F. Tadros H. Skowronski J. Lazure C. Seidah N.G. Hanahan D. Chrétien M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 33: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since C-terminal sequencing of radiolabeled proteins is not trivial, we attempted to identify these intermediates by generating C-terminally truncated mutants of pro7B2. Thus, in Fig. 2 B we compare the results of co-expression of PC5-A with pro7B2(1–186) (30 kDa), pro7B2(1–171) (28 kDa), or 7B2 (1–150) (23 kDa) in the absence or presence of α1-PDX. The data show that PC5 does not process 7B2(1–150), but cleaves pro7B2(1–186)and pro7B2(1–171) to produce 23- and 25-kDa forms of 7B2, suggesting cleavage at both RRKRR155 and QGKR165 (25Mbikay M. Grant S.G.N. Sirois F. Tadros H. Skowronski J. Lazure C. Seidah N.G. Hanahan D. Chrétien M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 33: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), respectively. The migration position of pro7B2(1–171) (28 kDa) resembles that of the product generated by PC5 in the presence of α1-PDX (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the 28-kDa form is obtained following cleavage at VAKK173. Thus, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 lead us to conclude that in the constitutively secreting BSC40 cells, α1-PDX is effective in inhibiting the cleavage of pro7B2 into the 23-kDa 7B2 by all convertases tested except for PC7. However, alternative processing into a 25-kDa form of 7B2 by furin, PACE4, and PC5 is not effectively inhibited by α1-PDX. In contrast, in regulated cells and especially in AtT20 cells, α1-PDX is only partially able to inhibit the PC-mediated processing of pro7B2, possibly because of the participation of endogenous convertases sorted to secretory granules, such as PC1. Since α1-PDX was derived from α1-AT by mutagenesis of its enzyme-binding site into an Arg355-X-X-Arg358sequence (17Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the minimal recognition motif of PCs (12Bresnahan P.A. Hayflick J.S. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Loh Y.P.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 181-203Google Scholar), it was plausible that the selectivity of α1-PDX for PCs (17Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Vollenweider F. Benjannet S. Decroly E. Savaria D. Lazure C. Thomas G. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reflects their ability to recognize this motif and possibly to cleave it. Accordingly, we undertook the analysis of the biosynthetic products of α1-PDX in BSC40 versus AtT20 cells in the absence or presence of co-expressed furin or PC7, which are differentially inhibited by α1-PDX in BSC40 cells (Fig. 2 A). Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met for 10 min followed by chase periods of 10, 20, and 45 min (AtT20 cells) or 45, 90, and 180 min (BSC40 cells) (Fig. 3). In both cell types, α1-PDX is first synthesized as a 59-kDa protein which is progressively transformed into a 64-kDa (AtT20 cells) or 62-kDa (BSC40 cells) secretable protein. Interestingly, the data show that the rate of cellular trafficking in AtT20 cells is much more rapid than in BSC40 cells, since the secreted α1-PDX is first detected in these cells at 45 versus 90 min of chase, respectively. Notice the presence of very low levels of a 52–54-kDa form of α1-PDX at the 10-min pulse. We belie"

Also, a fatty acid, [1-13C]octanoate, or ketone bodies were added at concentrations providing acetyl-CoA at a rate resulting in either low or substantial pyruvate decarboxylation. Relative contributions of pyruvate and fatty acids to citrate synthesis were determined from the13C labeling pattern of effluent citrate by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (see companion article, Comte, B., Vincent, G., Bouchard, B., and Des Rosiers, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26117–26124). Precision on flux measurements of anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation depended on the mix of substrates supplied to the heart. Anaplerotic fluxes were precisely determined under conditions where acetyl-CoA was predominantly supplied by β-oxidation, as it occurred with 0.2 or 1 mm octanoate. Then, anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation provided 3–8% of the OAA moiety of citrate and was modulated by concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in the physiological range. Also, the contribution of pyruvate to citrate formation through carboxylation was equal to or greater than through decarboxylation. Furthermore, 13C labeling data on tissue citric acid cycle intermediates and pyruvate suggest that (i) anaplerosis occurs also at succinate and (ii) cataplerotic malate decarboxylation is low. Rather, the presence of citrate in the effluent perfusate of hearts perfused with physiological concentrations of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate and concentrations of octanoate leading to maximal oxidative rates suggests a cataplerotic citrate efflux from mitochondria to cytosol. Taken altogether, our data raise the possibility of a link between pyruvate carboxylation and mitochondrial citrate efflux. In view of the proposed feedback regulation of glycolysis by cytosolic citrate, such a link would support a role of anaplerosis and cataplerosis in metabolic signal transmission between mitochondria and cytosol in the normoxic heart.

Evidence supports the importance of anaplerosis, especially from glutamate and aspartate, for heart function in ischemia-reperfusion (4Weisner R.J. Rosen P. Grieshaber M.K. Biochem. Med. Metab.

Regulation of pool sizes by means of anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions is likely to be involved not only in feedback control of the turnover of the cycle itself (1Peuhkurinen K.J. Takala T.E.S. Nuutinen E.M. Hassinen I.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: H281-H288PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sundqvist K.E. Vuorinen K.H. Peuhkurinen K.J. Hassinen I.E. Eur. Heart J. 1994; 15: 561-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also in the transmission of signals between mitochondria and the cytosol. The latter is illustrated by the possibility of feedback inhibition of phosphofructokinase by cytosolic citrate accumulating during fatty acid oxidation (12Barron J.T. Kopp S.J. Tow J. Parillo J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H764-H769PubMed Google Scholar, 13Garland P.B. Randle P.J. Newsholme E.A. Nature. 1963; 200: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, in the heart, the significance of this regulatory mechanism is questioned because of the low activity of the tricarboxylate transporter (14LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sluse F.E. Meijer A.J. Tager J.M. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation prevented the contractile dysfunction of hearts perfused with ketone bodies (KB; 16Russell III, R.R. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J.

Physiol. 1994; 267: H462-H470PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo, the normoxic heart could rely on blood lactate and pyruvate for anaplerosis. In the isolated heart, the constant need for anaplerotic substrates is illustrated by the decrease in tissue levels of glutamate, or aspartate, upon perfusion with glucose alone, or glucose and long chain fatty acid, respectively (4Weisner R.J. Rosen P. Grieshaber M.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1988; 40: 19-34Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Sundqvist K.E. Vuorinen K.H. Peuhkurinen K.J. Hassinen I.E. Eur. Heart J. 1994; 15: 561-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anaplerosis from pyruvate can occur through either pyruvate carboxylase or NADP-malic enzyme. The relative contribution of these reactions is debated (12Barron J.T. Kopp S.J. Tow J. Parillo J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H764-H769PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peuhkurinen K.J. Hassinen I.E.

Using 14C- and13C-labeled substrates, several authors documented the reciprocal regulation of pyruvate decarboxylation and fatty acid oxidation (see for example Refs. 25McVeigh J.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1079-H1085PubMed Google Scholar, and 28Chatham J.C. Forder J.R. Glickson J.D. Chance E.M. J. Biol.

However, in these studies, the relative contributions of pyruvate decarboxylation and carboxylation to citrate formation could not be assessed directly because of methodological limitations. Here we report data on simultaneous measurements of pyruvate carboxylation and decarboxylation, and of fatty acid oxidation, using a strategy described in the companion article (Comte et al.(67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). This was achieved using 13C-substrate(s) and analyzing the 13C labeling pattern of effluent citrate by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Our 13C data show how the contributions of anaplerotic OAA and acetyl-CoA from pyruvate for citrate formation are modulated by the nature and the concentration of substrates feeding the CAC. They also suggest another site of anaplerosis as well as probable sites for cataplerosis. Part of this work was presented in abstract form (31Comte B. Jetté M. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-770Google Scholar, 32Vincent G. Comte B. Des Rosiers C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 269Google Scholar, 33Comte B. Des Rosiers C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 268Google Scholar). Chemicals, enzymes, and coenzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval, Quebec), Fisher (Montreal, Quebec), Sigma, and Anachemia (Dorval, Quebec). [U-13C3]Lactate (99%), [U-13C3]pyruvate (99%), and [1-13C]octanoate (99%) were obtained from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH) and Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The derivatization agentN-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide was supplied by Regis Chemical (Morton Grove, IL). Acetoacetate (AcAc) was prepared as described previously (34Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Garneau M. David F. Mamer O.A. Daloze P. Toffolo G. Cobelli C. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E519-E528PubMed Google Scholar). All solutions were made with water purified by a “Milli-Q” system (Millipore, St. Laurent, Quebec). Procedures for isolation and perfusion of rat hearts were as described in previous publications (35, and Comteet al. (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Briefly, hearts from fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Quebec) weighing 120–220 g (heart wet weight, 1.1–1.3 g) were perfused according to the Langendorff technique at a constant pressure of 80 mmHg with a non-circulating modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mm: 119 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 0.5 or 1 lactate, 0.05 or 0.2 pyruvate, 0.02, 0.2, or 1 octanoate, 0.15 AcAc, 0.15 β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ± 0.001 norepinephrine (NE) or 1 dichloroacetate (DCA)). The perfusion buffer was gassed with 95% O2:5% CO2 (pH 7.4) at 38 °C. Functional parameters were monitored continuously as described previously (36 and Comte et al. (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). After a 15–20-min equilibration period, unlabeled lactate, pyruvate, and octanoate were replaced by 99% [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, and when indicated, [1-13C]octanoate and perfusion was continued for another 40 min. When used, DCA was present throughout the experiment, whereas infusion of NE was started 10 min before the labeling period. Perfusate NE concentration was kept constant despite variations in coronary flow using a computer program (37Montgomery J.A. Jetté M. Huot S. Des Rosiers C. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) developed for feedback control of a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments, Southnatick, MA). Samples of effluent perfusate (20 ml) were collected every 5 min starting 10 min before the labeling period and processed as follows: (i) 7 ml was immediately made with 10 mm hydroxylamine-hydrochloride and sonicated for 1 min to convert α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to its oxime derivative (36Laplante A. Comte B. Des Rosiers C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), (ii) 10 ml was made 1% sulfosalicylic acid, and (iii) 1 ml was left untreated. Samples were stored at −20 °C until further analyses. At the end of the experiment, hearts were freeze-clamped and stored in liquid nitrogen. Procedures for determination of the13C-mass isotopomer distribution (MID) of tissue and effluent metabolites (citrate, OAA, and acetyl moieties of citrate, αKG, succinate, malate, fumarate, and pyruvate) are described in the accompanying report (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MID data are expressed as mol fraction (MF) or molar percent enrichment (MPE). The MF in a given mass isotopomer (M i ) is MF (M i ) =AM i /(ΣAM i ), where Arepresents the peak area of each fragmentogram, determined by computer integration and corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes (38Des Rosiers C.

Biochem. 1991; 173: 96-105Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and i ranges from 0 to n, nbeing the number of carbon atoms. MPE is equivalent to MF × 100. The concentration of KB (AcAc + BHB) was determined using an internal standard of [2H6]BHB as described previously (34Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Garneau M. David F. Mamer O.A. Daloze P. Toffolo G. Cobelli C. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E519-E528PubMed Google Scholar), in effluent perfusates treated with 1 mNaBH4 (500 μl/10 ml: to reduce AcAc to BHB). The concentrations of lactate and pyruvate were determined enzymatically (40Williamson D.H. Mellanby J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 1836-1843Google Scholar) in neutralized sulfosalicylic acid influent and effluent perfusates. The concentration of octanoate was determined using a kit (NEFA C, ACS-ACOD method, Wako, VA), in untreated perfusates. Equations to calculate the relative contributions of pyruvate and octanoate to citrate formation from the13C labeling pattern of citrate released from hearts perfused with [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, and [1-13C]octanoate are presented in the accompanying report (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Note that in the present report, we will refer to these equations using the same numbering. Individual enrichments are averages of three to five GCMS injections. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. when n >2 or S.D. when n = 2 perfusions. Hearts perfused with 1 mm lactate, 0.2 mmpyruvate, and 0.2 mm octanoate were taken as controls. Statistical significance at p < 0.05 was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test, unless otherwise specified. Anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation was examined in hearts perfused with physiological concentrations of glucose (11 mm), lactate (0.5–1 mm), and pyruvate (0.05–0.2 mm). Lactate and pyruvate were present in a fixed ratio to clamp the redox state. Also, a source of acetyl-CoA other than pyruvate, either the medium chain fatty acid, octanoate, or the KB, AcAc, and BHB, was provided. Medium chain fatty acids is not subjected to carnitine palmitoyltransferase I regulation (41Weiss R.G. Kalil-Filho R. Herskowitz A. Chacko V.P. Litt M. Stern M.D. Gerstenblith G. Circulation. 1993; 87: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Gavva S.R. Wiethoff A.J. Zhao P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Biochem.

Thus, the perfusate octanoate concentration sets the rate of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA generation. In a first series of heart experiments, octanoate was supplied at 0.2 mm or greater, leading to maximal rate of β-oxidation (41Weiss R.G. Kalil-Filho R. Herskowitz A. Chacko V.P. Litt M. Stern M.D. Gerstenblith G. Circulation. 1993; 87: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Gavva S.R. Wiethoff A.J. Zhao P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and thus of acetyl-CoA formation. This should favor (i) pyruvate carboxylation over its decarboxylation and (ii) citrate synthesis from OAA formed by anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation. Under these conditions, we attempted to increase substrate flux through pyruvate decarboxylation by adding known activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase, either 1 mm DCA or 1 μm NE. However, results obtained prompted us to favor pyruvate decarboxylation by decreasing the supply of acetyl-CoA from sources other than pyruvate. Thus, in a second series of experiments, hearts were supplied with either 0.02 mm octanoate, leading to submaximal rate of oxidation, or with 0.15 mm AcAc and 0.15 mm BHB. For simplicity, data obtained in these two series of experiments are presented sequentially. Hearts perfused with physiological concentrations of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate and concentrations of octanoate leading to maximal oxidative rates (i.e. ≥0.2 mm, Ref. 44Forsey R.G.P. Reid K. Brosnan J.T. Can. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 401-406Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) maintained spontaneous beating at 305 ± 14 beats/min, a coronary flow rate of 10.0 ± 0.5 ml/min, and a rate pressure product of (23.1 ± 1.9) × 103 mmHg × beats/min (n = 14). The latter parameter was increased significantly by the addition of NE ((33.6 ± 2.8) × 103, n = 3). In a previous study, similarly perfused rat hearts consumed oxygen at a rate varying between 3.7 and 5 μmol/min (37Montgomery J.A. Jetté M. Huot S. Des Rosiers C. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and released minimal quantity of lactate dehydrogenase or glutathione (45Brunet J. Boily M.J. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 19: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rates of pyruvate, lactate, or glucose uptake in a single pass could not be calculated from the influent and effluent concentrations since the differences were too small to be measured with precision. Rates of octanoate uptake were similar under all conditions tested, on average 0.57 ± 0.05 μmol/min (n = 17, ranging from 0.24 to 0.86). These rates are in agreement with literature values (44Forsey R.G.P. Reid K. Brosnan J.T. Can. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 401-406Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, KB (AcAc + BHB) were released into the effluent perfusate at rate of 258 ± 13 nmol/min (n = 9, Ref. 32Vincent G. Comte B. Des Rosiers C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 269Google Scholar). Although the heart is normally a net consumer of KB, pseudoketogenesis can occur via the reversal of the succinyl-CoA transferase reaction (46Fink G. Desrochers S. Des Rosiers C. Garneau M. David F. Daloze T. Landau B.R. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18036-18042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We interpret this KB release as reflecting acetyl-CoA spillover from the CAC. TableI and Fig.1 show the 13C labeling of tissue pyruvate and of various CAC metabolites when hearts were perfused for 40 min with physiological concentrations of [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, and 0.2 or 1 mm[1-13C]octanoate under various conditions. The MPE of influent pyruvate was 96.6 ± 0.4% in M3, 3.0 ± 0.2% in M2, and 0.03 ± 0.02% (n = 3) in M1 isotopomers. The effluent pyruvate was slightly diluted (MPE M3: 86 ± 1%). Tissue pyruvate showed even more dilution of M3 isotopomers (from 61 to 85%; Table I). When corrected for the presence of M2 and M1 isotopomers in the infused pyruvate, tissue pyruvate enrichment in M2 or M1 isotopomers was negligible (not significant, means tested against null hypothesis) or very low (MPE M1 = 0.2% with DCA).Table I13C labeling of tissue pyruvatePerfusion conditions (n)MPE tissue pyruvateM1M2M31 mm[U-13C3]lactate + 0.2 mm[U-13C3]pyruvate+ 0.2 or 0.02 mm [1-13C]octanoate (3)0.23 ± 0.110.01 ± 0.0172.1 ± 1.5+ 0.2 mm[1-13C]octanoate + 1 mm DCA (5)0.19 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05: means tested against the null hypothesis.0.00 ± 0.0085.1 ± 2.51-bp < 0.05, all conditions versus 1 mm lactate + 0.2 mm pyruvate + 0.2 or 0.02 mm octanoate, using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.+ 0.2 mm[1-13C]octanoate + 1 μm NE (4)0.20 ± 0.070.05 ± 0.0265.6 ± 0.70.5 mm [U-13C3]lactate + 0.05 mm [U-13C3]pyruvate+ 0.2 mm [1-13C]octanoate (4)0.10 ± 0.050.22 ± 0.1463.1 ± 2.71-bp < 0.05, all conditions versus 1 mm lactate + 0.2 mm pyruvate + 0.2 or 0.02 mm octanoate, using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.+ 1 mm [1-13C]octanoate (2)1.04 ± 0.500.51 ± 0.5161.5 ± 2.41-bp < 0.05, all conditions versus 1 mm lactate + 0.2 mm pyruvate + 0.2 or 0.02 mm octanoate, using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.+ 0.15 mm (AcAc + BHB) (4)0.17 ± 0.051-ap < 0.05: means tested against the null hypothesis.0.28 ± 0.041-ap < 0.05: means tested against the null hypothesis.48.8 ± 4.91-bp < 0.05, all conditions versus 1 mm lactate + 0.2 mm pyruvate + 0.2 or 0.02 mm octanoate, using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.Other data from heart perfusion experiments described in Figs. 1 and 2.

Data, corrected for natural abundance in heavy isotopes and light isotopic impurities of the tracer, are expressed as MPE and are means ± S.E. (n > 2) or S.D. (n = 2). Of all tissue CAC metabolites, citrate showed the highest total13C enrichment (p < 0.001), predominantly M1, M2, and M3 isotopomers (Fig. 1). The enrichments in M4, M5, and M6 citrate were less than 1.5, 0.2, and 0.1%, respectively, under all conditions tested. The total MPE decreased from citrate to αKG and succinate: a greater difference was observed between αKG and succinate than between citrate and αKG (1.5 versus1.1-fold, respectively). These differences in total MPEs reflect in part the conversion of labeled to unlabeled isotopomers in the CAC due to the loss of 13CO2. When this process is taken into account, the 13C dilution attributed to entry of unlabeled αKG and/or succinate was estimated (from Eq. 10, Comteet al. (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) to be 1.13 ± 0.04 (p < 0.05, n = 8) and was similarly increased by NE and DCA (1.29 ± 0.03, n = 9; p < 0.05 unpaired t test). In all cases, the enrichments in M3, M2, and M1 isotopomers of tissue citrate were not significantly different from that of effluent citrate at 25–40 min of perfusion (not shown; paired t test), a time when isotopic steady state was attained (see Comte et al. (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). A similar 13C enrichment was also observed for tissue and effluent αKG (not shown). Furthermore, the total13C enrichment and the 13C MID of the OAA moiety of effluent citrate were similar to that of tissue malate or fumarate (Fig. 1). These data indicate rapid isotope randomization through the reversible fumarase reaction. Note that tissue fumarate and malate, and the OAA moiety of effluent citrate, are more enriched in M3 isotopomers (Fig. 1 D) than tissue succinate. This can only be explained by an entry of M3 isotopomers at the level of malate or OAA by anaplerotic carboxylation of [U-13C3]pyruvate. The 13C enrichment of tissue pyruvate and of the acetyl and OAA moieties of citrate, isolated from the effluent of hearts perfused for 25–40 min with [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, and [1-13C]octanoate, allows calculation of relative substrate fluxes relevant to pyruvate and fatty acid metabolism. Under these conditions, all assumptions on which equations were developed were validated (see Comte et al. (67Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26117-26124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). From the M3 enrichment of tissue pyruvate, we calculate that more than 60% of the pyruvate converted to OAA arose from exogenously supplied pyruvate and/or lactate (FCPYRe→PYRi; Eq. 3 of Ref. 67; where FC is fractional contribution; PYRi and PYRe indicate intracellular and extracellular pyruvate). The percent contribution of glucose and/or glycogen to pyruvate generation (1 − FCPYRe→PYRi) was 33.8 ± 1.6% in all conditions, except with 1 mm DCA where it was decreased significantly to 14.4 ± 2.5% (p < 0.001, unpairedt test). These changes support an inhibitory (47Clark A.S. Mitch W.E. Goodman M.N. Fagan J.M. Goheer M.A. Curnow R.T. J. Clin.

Removal of the Gla domain of protein C results in the loss of most of the binding affinity. This observation is compatible with at least two models: 1) the Gla domain of protein C interacts with phospholipid on cell surfaces to stabilize interaction with EPCR or 2) the Gla domain of protein C makes specific protein-protein interactions with EPCR. The latter model predicts that chimeric proteins containing the protein C Gla domain should interact with EPCR. To test this, we constructed a prothrombin chimera in which the Gla domain and aromatic stack of prothrombin were replaced with the corresponding region of protein C. The 125I-labeled chimera (K d = 176 nm) and 125I-APC (K d = 65 nm) both bound specifically to 293 cells stably transfected with EPCR, but both bound poorly to sham-transfected cells. The chimera also blocked APC binding to EPCR-transfected cells in a dose-dependent fashion (K i ≈ 139 nm) similarly to protein C (K i ≈ 75 nm). Chimera binding to EPCR-transfected cells was blocked by soluble EPCR, demonstrating direct protein-protein interaction between the chimera and EPCR. Consistent with this conclusion, the isolated Gla domain of protein C blocked APC binding to EPCR-transfected cells (IC50 = 2 μm). No inhibition was observed with the isolated prothrombin Gla domain. A protein C chimera with the prothrombin Gla domain and aromatic stack failed to bind to EPCR detectably.

The pathway has also been implicated in regulating the inflammatory response, including providing protection against septic shock (7Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A. Esmon C.T. D'Angelo A. Vigano-D'Angelo S.

Recently, the endothelial cell surface was shown to bind protein C and APC with high affinity (12Bangalore N. Drohan W.N. Orthner C.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the responsible cell-surface glycoprotein, EPCR, was identified by expression cloning (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPCR binds directly to protein C and APC with high affinity even when expressed in a soluble form (14Fukudome K. Kurosawa S.

Blocking protein C binding to EPCR with a monoclonal antibody results in an ∼4–5-fold decrease in the rate of protein C activation over the surface of the endothelium, with no change in the rate of activation when substrates lacking the vitamin K-dependent Gla domain are employed (Gla domainless protein C) (15Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The interaction of soluble EPCR with APC blocks plasma anticoagulant activity and the ability of APC to inactivate factor Va without altering reactivity with protein C inhibitor or α1-antitrypsin (16Regan L.M.

Previous studies have shown that recombinant Gla domainless protein C cannot inhibit the binding of APC to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the Gla domain is required either for binding to the membrane phospholipid, thereby promoting binding to EPCR, or for binding to EPCR itself. The observation that the affinity of soluble recombinant EPCR (sEPCR) for protein C/APC is comparable to the affinity for cell-surface EPCR suggested that phospholipid-protein C interaction contributes little to the affinity of protein C for the endothelial cell surface (14Fukudome K.

The inability of Gla domainless protein C to inhibit APC binding could reflect either a difference in global folding, particularly Ca2+-induced conformational changes (17Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Laue T.M. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5554-5560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sugo T. Björk I. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5705-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the loss of direct protein C Gla domain interaction with EPCR. Either function differs from the membrane phospholipid binding activity normally ascribed to the Gla domain of vitamin K-dependent proteins (19Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 20Castellino F.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The major exception to this function of Gla domains is the binding of factor IXa to the factor IXa receptor on endothelial cells. This interaction was shown to be mediated by the Gla domain (21Cheung W.-F. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20529-20531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Geng J.-P. Christiansen W.T. Plow E.F. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8449-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of the Gla domain of protein C in binding to EPCR using a prothrombin chimera in which the Gla domain and aromatic stack of prothrombin were replaced with the corresponding region of protein C (PT-PC Gla). We find that this domain mediates direct protein-protein interactions with the receptor. Human protein C (23Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), human prothrombin (24Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 594-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and soluble recombinant EPCR (14Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. The Gla domains from bovine protein C and prothrombin were prepared by limited proteolysis of the plasma zymogens with chymotrypsin as described previously for bovine protein C (25Esmon N.L. DeBault L.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5548-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients ((mg/ml)−1 cm−1) and molecular weights used in this study were 1.45 and 62,000 for APC and protein C, 1.55 and 72,000 for prothrombin, 1.55 and 72,000 for PT-PC Gla, 1.45 and 62,000 for the protein C-prothrombin Gla domain chimera (PC-PT Gla), 1.45 and 58,000 for Gla domainless protein C, 1.45 and 4,000 for the protein C Gla domain peptide, 1.55 and 4,000 for the prothrombin Gla domain peptide, and 1.0 and 42,000 for sEPCR. IODO-GEN (Pierce) was used to label APC and PT-PC Gla with Na125I according to the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2.125I-Labeled proteins were separated from free125I by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The active site of APC was labeled with fluorescein (Fl-APC) after inhibition of APC withN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (Molecular Innovations) by a modification (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Bock (26Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and then reacting the modified enzyme with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Prothrombin cDNA was ligated into the SmaI and EcoRI restriction sites of pUC19 (pUC-II). Using the unique XhoI restriction enzyme site in exon IV of the prothrombin cDNA (base 287), a double digestion of pUC-II withXhoI and XbaI (a site on the polylinker cloning site on pUC) released the first three exons of the prothrombin cDNA as well as 21 base pairs of the beginning of exon IV. Two PCR primers were synthesized. The sense primer (5′-GTCGTCTAGACCCGGGATGTGGCAGCTCACAAGCCT-3′) starts at the initiation codon of the protein C cDNA and contains XbaI and SmaI restriction sites at the 5′-end (underlined). The antisense primer (5′-GCGTCTCGAGGCGTCCTCGCTGTCTCACAAGCGACGTGCTTGGACCAGAAGGC-3′) starts at the last nucleotide of exon III in the protein C cDNA and contains an XhoI restriction site along with 21 base pairs of exon IV of the prothrombin cDNA (underlined). After PCR amplification of the protein C cDNA with these primers and a double digestion with XhoI and XbaI, the DNA fragment was ligated into the identical sites of pUC-II. The modified prothrombin cDNA was cleaved by SmaI andEcoRI from the pUC-II plasmid and ligated into the identical sites on the pNUT expression vector. After sequencing, the DNA was transfected into baby hamster kidney cells as described previously for the wild-type counterparts (27Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was purified using the monoclonal antibody HPT 959 (27Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) linked to Affi-Gel-10. PT-PC Gla was eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 3 murea and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. PT-PC Gla was further purified on a Pharmacia Mono Q HR 5/5 column eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.1–0.6m NaCl in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). A protein C chimera was constructed in which the first three exons of prothrombin (i.e. coding for the signal peptide, the Gla domain, and the aromatic stack regions) replaced the corresponding regions of protein C. Mutagenesis was performed by PCR methodology. The wild-type protein C cDNA was ligated into theHindIII and XbaI sites of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to form RSV-PC as described previously (28Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is a unique BstEII restriction site in the protein C cDNA in the beginning of exon IV, which encodes the N-terminal EGF domain. Double digestion of RSV-PC with HindIII andBstEII removed the DNA sequences of the first three exons of protein C as well as the first codon of exon IV, which is an Asp. To exchange exons I–III of protein C with those of prothrombin, two PCR primers were synthesized. The prothrombin sense primer (5′-CGCTAAGCTTCCATGGCCCGCATCCGAGGCTT-3′) starts at the initiation codon of the prothrombin cDNA and contains aHindIII restriction enzyme site at the 5′-end of the primer (underlined). The prothrombin antisense primer (5′-GAGTGGTCACCGTCTGTGTACTTGGCCCAGAACA-3′) starts at the last nucleotide of exon II in the prothrombin cDNA and also contains the native BstEII restriction enzyme site containing the missing Asp codon in the beginning of exon IV of protein C cDNA. Following PCR amplification of prothrombin cDNA with these two primers and double digestion with HindIII and BstEII, the DNA fragment was ligated into the identical sites of the wild-type protein C expression vector described above. After sequencing, the mutant construct was transfected into human 293 cells, and chimeric protein C was purified from the cell culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using the calcium-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 as described previously (28Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC-PT Gla was further purified by Mono Q chromatography essentially as described (23Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). γ-Carboxyglutamic acid content was determined by the base hydrolysis method described by Smalley and Preusch (30Smalley D.M. Preusch P.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, proteins (0.5 nmol each) were dried and hydrolyzed with 2 n NaOH, in the absence of oxygen, for 16 h at 110 °C. Samples were desalted over Dowex resin (Sigma) and dried. Samples were then derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate (Pierce) and dried. Samples were resuspended in 0.14m Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 0.05% triethylamine, and 1% acetonitrile. Gla, aspartate, and glutamate were resolved in this buffer on an Alltech C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column. Cells were incubated in suspension as indicated in the figure legends. Samples were then layered over 100 μl of apiezon oil (31Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4033-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Hu C.Y. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm. Tubes were cut, and the cell pellet was counted (32Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Hu C.Y. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For direct binding experiments, increasing concentrations of125I-APC or 125I-PT-PC Gla were incubated with the cells in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 3 mmCaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide (binding buffer) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were treated as described above.K d values were determined by Scatchard analysis. The regression procedures were those of Marquardt (33Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) as described by Bevington (34Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 204-246Google Scholar), using data analysis software kindly provided by J. Jesty (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). Some experiments were performed using 125I-APC modified in the active site with d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), which binds identically as the unmodified form to EPCR-transfected cells. For sEPCR competition experiments, increasing concentrations of sEPCR were incubated with cells in the presence of 60 nm125I-PT-PC Gla or 125I-APC in binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were treated as described above. For competition experiments using sEPCR, K i determinations were performed by fitting data points using the equationY = A·B/(B +X) for simple competitive inhibition, whereA = % APC bound in the absence of inhibitor (100%),B = K i, and X = concentration of inhibitor in the reactions. Curves were held at 100% at zero inhibitor. Regression procedures were performed as described above. For competition experiments using unlabeled PT-PC Gla and protein C,K i values were determined with the same equation, but since the concentration of labeled protein was at or aboveK d, B = K i (1 + S/K d ), where S = concentration of APC added to the reaction (60 nm) and K d = 65 nm for 125I-APC experiments. Stably transfected EPCR-positive (E7) and sham-transfected EPCR-negative (N1) human 293 cells were prepared as described previously (14Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in binding buffer. Cells were incubated as indicated in the figure legends, washed with 200 μl of binding buffer, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. After pelleting, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer, and binding was measured as described previously (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using a Calibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). The amount of Fl-APC that bound to N1 cells was taken as nonspecific binding and subtracted from all data points.K i values were determined as described above usingK d = 30 nm (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by direct binding studies with the lot of Fl-APC used in the present analysis. The PT-PC Gla chimera was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was homogenous on SDS gel electrophoresis (data not shown). When the chimera was chromatographed on Mono Q, two peaks were partially resolved. The chimera from the trailing fractions of the second peak bound most tightly to EPCR-expressing cells and contained 9 mol of Gla residues/mol of protein. The chimera in the first peak bound less tightly (see below) and contained 8 mol of Gla residues/mol of protein. To determine whether the protein C Gla domain conferred specific binding of the chimera to E7 cells, the chimera was iodinated and incubated at increasing concentrations with E7 cells (Fig.1 A). The small amount of binding of the chimera to N1 cells was subtracted from all points. Scatchard analysis of the data resulted in K d = 176 ± 26 nm and (13.7 ± 3.9) × 106sites/cell. A similar experiment using 125I-APC resulted inK d = 65 ± 6 nm and (8.0 ± 2.7) × 106 sites/cell. To determine if the Gla domain was involved in phospholipid-protein interactions or protein-protein interactions, we investigated the effect of sEPCR, which does not bind to phospholipid, on the binding of125I-APC and 125I-PT-PC Gla to E7 cells (Fig.1 B). If the Gla domain were involved in protein-protein interactions, the sEPCR should inhibit the binding of the chimera to the cells. sEPCR inhibited chimera binding in a concentration-dependent fashion similar to that observed with APC. We assumed that this inhibition was due to a decrease in free ligand caused by complex formation with sEPCR. Using this assumption and the concentration dependence of binding seen in Fig. 1 A, we calculated K i values of sEPCR of 109 ± 20 nm for the chimera and 141 ± 39 nm for APC (Table I). This suggests that EPCR can bind the Gla domain of both APC and PT-PC Gla in solution, and therefore, the Gla-dependent binding is mainly through protein-protein interactions.Table IBinding amd inhibition parametersDirect bindingK d (n = 3)1-an = number of experiments/set.nm125I-APC65 ± 6125I-PT-PC Gla176 ± 26Inhibition by sEPCRK i (n = 3)nm125I-APC141 ± 39125I-PT-PC Gla109 ± 20Inhibition of Fl-APCK i (n = 4)nmProtein C75 ± 16PT-PC Gla139 ± 43Inhibition of125I-APCK i (n = 4)nmProtein C100 ± 7PT-PC Gla139 ± 10IC 50(n = 5)μmProtein C Gla peptide2Prothrombin Gla peptideND1-bNo inhibition detected at 2 μm.Constants were determined for each set of experiments (mean ± S.D.).1-a n = number of experiments/set.1-b No inhibition detected at 2 μm. Open table in a new tab Constants were determined for each set of experiments (mean ± S.D.). Prothrombin, Gla domainless protein C, protein C, and the chimera were used to compete with the binding of either Fl-APC (Fig.2 A) or 125I-APC (Fig. 2 B) to E7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, prothrombin and Gla domainless protein C failed to compete effectively with Fl-APC for binding to EPCR expressed on the cell surface. In contrast, protein C and PT-PC Gla inhibited Fl-APC binding to these cells effectively and with similar dose-response curves. Analysis of the competition indicated that the K i for protein C was 75 ± 16 nm and for the chimera was 139 ± 43 nm (Table I). PT-PC Gla with an incomplete complement of Gla residues (8Esmon C.T. Schwarz H.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was not nearly as effective as fully carboxylated PC-PT Gla in blocking Fl-APC binding to the cells. The ability of the Gla domain of protein C to impart to prothrombin the capacity to compete effectively for binding to EPCR-expressing cells suggests that the Gla domain of protein C provides the majority of the binding energy of the protein C/APC-EPCR interaction. The observation that the chimera could compete effectively with APC for binding to the cells eliminates the possibility that chimera binding to EPCR-transfected cells was due to the presence of more prothrombin-specific binding sites on these cells than on the sham-transfected cells. These results were confirmed with a similar assay using125I-APC binding to E7 cells (Fig. 2 B). TheK i for protein C was found to be 100 ± 7 nm, whereas the K i for PT-PC Gla was 139 ± 10. Again, prothrombin and Gla domainless protein C did not inhibit APC binding effectively. Under-carboxylated PT-PC Gla again failed to compete as effectively as the fully carboxylated chimera (data not shown). Since the Gla domain of protein C appears to be required for binding to EPCR, we examined the possibility that the isolated Gla domain (residues 1–41) might be able to compete with APC for binding to EPCR-transfected cells. As a control for specificity, we employed the isolated Gla domain of prothrombin (Fig.3). Consistent with the predictions based on the chimera, the isolated Gla domain of protein C exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of APC binding (IC50 = 2 μm). In contrast, the Gla domain of prothrombin was not an effective competitor. Since these two Gla domains are structurally similar, we conclude that the isolated Gla domain of protein C is capable of specific interaction with EPCR on cell surfaces. To assess the possibility that EPCR-binding sites on protein C outside of the Gla domain and hydrophobic stack might contribute significantly to the binding interaction, we examined the ability of the PC-PT Gla chimera to compete with Fl-APC for binding to E7 cells (Fig. 4). Unlike the PT-PC Gla chimera, the PC-PT Gla chimera failed to compete for binding to these cells. The competition studies were chosen for this analysis since it is easier to detect low affinity binding by competition than by direct binding analysis. Failure to bind the E7 cells was not due to improper folding of the chimera since it inactivates factor Va on phospholipid vesicles as does wild-type APC, binds to vesicles essentially equivalently, has more plasma anticoagulant activity than wild-type APC, and contains the expected number of Gla residues (35Smirnov M. Rezaie A.R. Regan L.M. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Circulation. 1996; 94 (abstr.): I-694Google Scholar). These results confirm the conclusions about the importance of the Gla domain of protein C in binding to EPCR. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins possess a Gla domain that binds Ca2+ and imparts to these proteins the ability to bind to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces. These binding interactions are critical to the assembly of physiologically relevant coagulation complexes. One of the major regulatory events that controls the coagulation cascade appears to be the expression of negatively charged phospholipids on the surface of activated cells, particularly platelets. Exposure of membrane surfaces capable of binding vitamin K-dependent proteins requires very strong cellular activators (36Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Blood Rev. 1991; 5: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In vivo studies imply that there is little procoagulant surface available under physiological conditions since the infusion of potent clotting factors such as factor Xa has little coagulant activity unless negatively charged phospholipids are infused simultaneously (37Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. Hoogendoorn H. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 59: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the normal vasculature has very little negatively charged phospholipid exposed under physiological circumstances. The observations reported here suggest that activation of the vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant zymogen protein C can proceed in a Gla domain-dependent fashion, but without a requirement for negatively charged phospholipid surfaces. In vivostudies have shown that thrombin infusion can rapidly activate protein C without a requirement for exogenous phospholipids (38Comp P.C. Jacocks R.M. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated a second endothelial cell receptor, EPCR, in protein C activation (15Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and the present study suggests that the binding interaction involved in the activation involves primarily the vitamin K-dependent Gla domain of protein C. The Gla domain involvement in protein-protein interactions between protein C and EPCR is consistent with the previous observation that binding to EPCR is Ca2+-dependent and abolished by proteolytic removal of the Gla domain (12Bangalore N. Drohan W.N. Orthner C.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the under-carboxylated forms of the chimera interact weakly with EPCR-expressing cells and compete poorly with Fl-APC for binding to the receptor suggest that the Ca2+-mediated conformational changes in the Gla domain of protein C are important for optimal binding interactions with EPCR. These properties are similar to the requirements of the factor IX receptor, the other receptor constitutively expressed on the endothelium (21Cheung W.-F. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20529-20531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cheung W.-F. van den Born J. Kuhn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein C is most homologous to factors X, IX, and VII since all contain a Gla domain, a hydrophobic stack, two EGF domains, and a protease domain. EGF domains have been implicated in many protein-protein interactions involved in blood coagulation (41Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stopelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol.

Prothrombin is structurally distinct from these coagulation factors in that the EGF domains are replaced by kringle domains. Therefore, to eliminate the possibility of EGF domain contribution to EPCR binding and to test the importance of the protein C Gla domain, we prepared the PT-PC Gla chimera described herein. The observation that this chimera binds to EPCR with affinities very similar to those of protein C strongly supports the conclusion that the binding is mediated primarily by the Gla domain. The K d observed for protein C was ∼2–3-fold higher than the K d observed in earlier binding studies (13Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and by competition in solution. The basis for this discrepancy is unclear, but may be due to some complex binding processes on the cell surface, differences in protein preparations, or simple error in the measurements. It is clear, however, that protein C and the PT-PC Gla chimera compete effectively with Fl-APC or125I-APC for binding to the EPCR-transfected cells and that sEPCR can block binding of both molecules with similar dose-response relationships. These data unambiguously demonstrate that the major binding energy for the protein C-EPCR interaction is mediated by the protein C Gla domain. This conclusion is bolstered by the observation that the isolated Gla domain can block the reaction, albeit with lower efficiency than the intact chimera. The decreased affinity for EPCR is probably due to the fact that the isolated Gla domain prepared by chymotryptic digestion is not in an optimal conformation (48Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49Christiansen W.T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5901-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For instance, Colpitts and Castellino (48Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that the aromatic stack, in addition to the Gla domain of protein C, is essential for phospholipid binding. It would appear based on this study and the results reported herein that the aromatic stack plays a more important role in phospholipid binding than in binding to EPCR. While the Gla domain appears to be the major determinant of binding to EPCR, this does not rule out a contribution of other parts of protein C/APC to the binding. The thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction is largely determined by EGF domains 5 and 6, but requires EGF-4 to effect the substrate specificity switch of thrombin from a procoagulant to an activator of protein C anticoagulant activity (Refs. 50Stearns D.J.

Therefore, it could be expected that another part of the protein C/APC molecule can bind to EPCR and in that way affect the ability of APC to cleave its substrates and/or allow APC to cleave new substrates. Requirement for γ-carboxylation in the Gla domain also has clinical implications. Coumadin inhibits the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of coagulation proteins. This will inhibit APC binding not only to negatively charged surfaces, but also to endothelial cells through interaction with EPCR. The physiological significance of this effect is not known at this time. However, it should be clarified once we have a better understanding of the in vivo function of the protein C/APC·EPCR complex.

The specific activity of the purified fusion enzyme is 80 nmol of 5-hydroxytryptophan/min/mg. Multifunctional regulatory 14-3-3 proteins were purified from fresh bovine brain. Phosphorylation and 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in the regulation of TPH activity. We have found that phosphorylation of TPH by cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased the activity of the hydroxylase by 25–30% and that 14-3-3 proteins increased the hydroxylase activity of phosphorylated TPH by ∼45%. Under these conditions, the 14-3-3 proteins were not phosphorylated, and unphosphorylated TPH was not activated by 14-3-3 proteins. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated TPH with an affinity constant (K a ) of 4.5 × 107m−1. Binding studies using affinity chromatography also showed that 14-3-3 proteins interact with phosphorylated TPH. The dephosphorylation of TPH by protein phosphatase-1 was inhibited by 14-3-3 proteins.

Peroutka S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Because of its low abundance and extreme instability, biochemical characterization of TPH has been hampered (7Kuhn D.M. Ruskin B. Lovenberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4137-4143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakata H. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 41-47Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TPH isolated from different sources also exhibits distinct properties (8Nakata H. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 41-47Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Yang X.-J. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl.

Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and extremely unstable (11Vrana K.E. Rucker P.J. Kumer S.C. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, little is known about its regulatory properties in vitro, except that it is sensitive to substrate inhibition (12Friedman P.A. Kappelman A.H. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4165-4173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins are acidic, ubiquitous, and highly conserved proteins that were first discovered in the brain (reviewed in Ref. 13Aitken A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The first function assigned to 14-3-3 proteins was that of activators of the neuronal enzymes tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (14Isobe T. Hiyane Y. Ichimura T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the 14-3-3 family of proteins was shown to bind to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (15Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Given the large and diverse numbers of proteins that can apparently bind 14-3-3, it is important to determine the nature of these interactions. Several observations suggest that 14-3-3 interactions involve binding to phosphoserine. Activation of tyrosine hydroxylase by 14-3-3 requires prior phosphorylation of the hydroxylase with the serine/threonine kinase calmodulin kinase II (24Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase treatment of Raf-1 and Bcr inhibits their association with 14-3-3 in vitro (25Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and 14-3-3 binding to Raf-1 blocks the ability of phosphatases to inhibit Raf-1 activity (26Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 14-3-3 may bind to phosphoserine in a sequence-specific manner (57Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Several reports have described the bacterial expression of TPHs from different species (9Yang X.-J. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Tipper J.P. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem.

Brain Res. 1991; 9: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the bacterially expressed enzymes have proven to be mostly insoluble. By use of a fusion expression system, soluble TPH species have been expressed in E. coli (8Nakata H. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 41-47Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Stoll J. Kozak C.A. Goldman D. Genomics. 1990; 7: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been reported for rat phenylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylases that the baculovirus expression system yields recombinant enzymes with properties that are more similar to those of the native enzymes than these hydroxylases expressed in E. coli (29Fitzpatrick P.F. Chlumsky L.J. Daubner S.C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2042-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.H. Citron B. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we decided that the baculovirus-insect cell expression system might provide an approach to obtaining soluble active TPH. This study describes the high level expression of rabbit brain histidine-tagged TPH in insect cells. Using unphosphorylated and phosphorylated TPHs, we have studied the stability and binding of TPH to 14-3-3 proteins as well as the effect of this interaction on activation and dephosphorylation of TPH. The BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression vector kit, DH10BAC competent cells, CellFectin reagent, Ni2+-NTA resin, and recombinant TEV protease were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The bovine brain catalytic subunit of PKA was purchased from Sigma, and the PKA inhibitor isoquinolinesulfonamide was from Research Biochemicals Inc. The Mark 12 molecular mass marker was from Novex. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system was used for expression of rabbit brain TPH. The TPH coding sequence (1.58 kilobases) was amplified from plasmid pjptRABB6016 (10Tipper J.P. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-CGC TCA TGA TTG AAG ATA ATA AAG AG-3′ (N terminus) and 5′-TGC TCT AGA TCA GAC ACT CAG CTG CCT-3′ (C terminus) and was cloned into the pUC18 vector. After confirmation by DNA sequencing, the TPH sequence was digested with BspHI (leaving a compatible end with NcoI) and XbaI and cloned into the NcoI and XbaI sites of the donor plasmid pFASTBACHTa. After site-specific transposition of the recombinant plasmid in E. coli DH10BAC competent cells, colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by disruption of the lacZα gene. The recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated and used for transfection of Sf21 insect cells using CellFectin liposome. After incubation at 27 °C for 72 h, the virus was amplified to a titer of 2 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. Expression of rabbit brain TPH was then conducted by infecting Sf21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 72 h in the presence of 0.1 mm FeSO4. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.85% NaCl, and stored at −80 °C. All purification steps were carried out in a cold room. The cell pellets (∼2.5 g) were suspended in 15 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 4 mg of pepstatin, 4 mg of leupeptin, 4 mg of aprotinin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.05 mm FeSO4). Differential sonications were carried out four times, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column (1 × 5 cm) previously equilibrated with 10 volumes of Buffer A (without protease inhibitors) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20) and finally eluted with 5 volumes of Buffer C (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 150 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20). Fractions were pooled based on TPH activity, and the purity of the active fractions of TPH was determined by 8–16% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The six-histidine tag was removed using recombinant TEV protease according to the manufacturer's protocol. 14-3-3 proteins were purified according to a previously described protocol (31Wu Y.N. Vu N.-D. Wagner P.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Fresh bovine calf brain (200 g) was homogenized in 100 ml of Buffer D (40 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 151,000 × g for 1.5 h. The 70-ml supernatant was concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration, loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (2 × 80 cm) equilibrated with Buffer E (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmDTT), and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Pooled fractions containing 14-3-3 proteins were loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 45 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer E. After washing with 2 volumes of Buffer E, a linear gradient of 0.2–0.4m NaCl in Buffer E was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Pooled fractions containing 14-3-3 proteins were concentrated to 2 ml, loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 100 cm) equilibrated with Buffer E, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Pooled 14-3-3 proteins from the Sephacryl S-200 column were fractionated on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. The gradient used was 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. SDS-PAGE showed that the 14-3-3 proteins were ∼95% pure. All experiments on the effects of 14-3-3 on the catalytic activity of TPH were carried out with histidine-tagged enzyme. TPH activity was measured by the fluorometric determination of the product 5-HTP as described (32Tong J.H. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4152-4158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.5, 125 μml-tryptophan, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NADH, 0.39 unit/ml dihydropteridine reductase, 10 mmd-glucose 6-phosphate, 5 milliunits/mld-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, and 0.25 mm cofactor ((6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of TPH, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, terminated with 0.1 ml of 10.5 m HCl and 1.3 m HClO4, chilled on ice for 5 min, and finally centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min. Upon excitation at 295 nm, the fluorescence of the supernatant at 538 nm was measured on an LS-3B fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer) using 5-HTP as the standard. One unit of TPH activity is defined as the amount of TPH that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of 5-HTP/15 min at 37 °C. Phosphorylation of TPH (0.7 μg) was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 μg of TPH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μg of PKA catalytic subunit and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation reaction was quenched by the addition of a 1 mm concentration of the PKA inhibitor isoquinolinesulfonamide. TPH (1 μg) was phosphorylated with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence and absence of 14-3-3 proteins (10 μg) at 30 °C for 30 min in 0.1 ml. The phosphorylation reaction was quenched with a 1 mmconcentration of the PKA inhibitor isoquinolinesulfonamide. The dephosphorylation reaction was carried out at 37 °C by the addition of 50 ng of protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction was quenched at different time points by the addition of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid using bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein for precipitation. After thorough washing, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity of the precipitated protein was measured. TPH was dialyzed in Buffer F (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm FeSO4, 0.05 mml-tryptophan, and 0.05% Tween 20). Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated TPHs (3.5 μg) were immobilized on Ni2+-NTA resins, and then 2.2 μg of 14-3-3 proteins were added. After washing, the whole complex was eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 150 mmimidazole, and bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE. The interaction of phosphorylated TPH with immobilized 14-3-3 was monitored by surface plasmon resonance detection using BIAcore 2000 (Biocore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The basic principles and detection methods have been reviewed previously (33Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 34Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Bio/Technology. 1991; 11: 620-627Google Scholar). All binding experiments were performed with recombinant TEV protease-digested TPH at 25 °C. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia). The 14-3-3 proteins (50–100 μg/ml) were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix on a CM5 sensor chip (Biocore, Inc.) using an amine coupling kit following the manufacturer's directions. The data were analyzed using the software BIAevaluation 2.1 (Pharmacia). The concentration of the complex can be measured directly as the steady-state resonance (R eq) when performing equilibrium binding experiments with BIAcore (35Anton van der Merwe P. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas the concentration of free analyte (C) can be considered equal to the bulk analyte concentration since it is continuously replenished during sample injection. The concentration of free ligand on the surface of the sensor chip is then derived from the concentration of the complex (R eq) and the total binding capacity of the surface (R max) as follows: K a =R eq/C(R max− R eq). Rearranging, we obtain the following:R eq/C =K a R max −K a R eq. Thus, the association constant (K a ) was determined from the plot ofR eq/C versus R eq at different analyte concentrations by Scatchard analysis, after correction for nonspecific binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) was also determined from the rate of dissociation/rate of association by biomolecular interaction analysis simulation. Phosphate incorporation mediated by PKA was determined by published procedures (37Phillips R.S. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph Ultrafit computer software. To achieve high level expression and to permit affinity purification of active TPH, a His6-tagged fusion protein expression and purification system was used by means of site-specific transposition of an expression cassette into a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) propagated in E. coli (38Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fusion enzyme contains a six-histidine affinity tag, a 7-amino acid spacer arm, and the TEV protease recognition site for cleavage of the six-histidine tag from the protein. The infection of insect cells with recombinant baculovirus was optimized using different multiplicities of infection and also by variation of the time course of infection at a constant multiplicity of infection. Assays indicated that a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 at 72–84 h post-infection in a 27 °C shaker gave a high expression of soluble active TPH. The specific activity of TPH in the crude extract was 4 nmol/min/mg of protein. Because of the inherent instability of TPH (39Hasegawa H. Ichiyama A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 0.1 mmFeSO4 was included in the lysis buffer to stabilize the enzyme. Fig. 1 shows the expressed His6-tagged TPH (lane 3) and the purified TPH after TEV protease digestion (lane 4); the molecular mass of the fusion enzyme was ∼54 kDa and ∼2.5 kDa (23 amino acids were removed) after recombinant TEV protease digestion. The activities of the purified fusion enzyme and the digested TPH were the same (80 nmol of 5-HTP/min/mg of enzyme). This value is comparable to that found for human TPH fused with maltose-binding protein (9Yang X.-J. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The yield was 30%, and the purification was ∼40-fold. The 14-3-3 proteins were prepared from bovine brain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” They had molecular characteristics very similar to those described (40Moore B.W. Perez V.J. Carlston F.D. Physiological and Biochemical Aspects of Nervous Integration. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1967: 343-359Google Scholar, 41Boston P.F. Jackson P. Thompson R.J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins isolated from tissues are heterogeneous, containing two or more molecular species (42Boston P.F. Jackson P. Kynoch P.A.M. Thompson R.J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1466-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, our 14-3-3 preparation was separated by SDS-PAGE into two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 30 and 27 kDa in a respective ratio of 4:1. TPH was phosphorylated by PKA using [γ-32P]ATP. A maximum of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of TPH subunit was incorporated after a 30-min incubation at 30 °C. Half-maximum phosphorylation took ∼10 min. The rate and extent of TPH phosphorylation by PKA were not affected by 14-3-3 proteins. The value of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of TPH is twice the value obtained by another group (24Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference could be due to a different source of TPH used in the two studies. In an initial experiment, the ability of different concentrations of 14-3-3 to activate phosphorylated TPH was studied. As shown in Fig.2, under the experimental conditions used, 14-3-3 activated phosphorylated TPH ∼30%, with maximum stimulation observed at ∼15 μg/ml 14-3-3 proteins (half-maximum stimulation at 2.5 μg/ml). There was no effect of 14-3-3 on the activity of unphosphorylated TPH, as can be seen in the controls in which PKA was replaced by bovine serum albumin. The stimulation of our recombinant TPH preparation by 14-3-3 proteins is somewhat less than the 70% stimulation observed with partially purified TPH from rat brainstem (43Makita Y. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The formation of 5-HTP by TPH under different conditions is shown in Fig.3. TPH was phosphorylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unphosphorylated TPH in the presence of bovine serum albumin was treated in the same way as phosphorylated TPH, but without added kinase. During the first 5 min of incubation, 14-3-3 stimulated the activity of phosphorylated TPH by ∼45% (Fig. 3, ⋄ versus □). Under the conditions of this experiment, even in the absence of 14-3-3, incubation of TPH under phosphorylation conditions caused a small but reproducible increase in hydroxylase activity (Fig. 3, ○ versus ⋄). The combination of phosphorylation and 14-3-3 proteins resulted in a 70% stimulation of TPH activity (Fig. 3, ○ versus □). The results also indicate that during the subsequent 5-min incubation (i.e. in the 5–10-min period), there was no further increase in TPH activity due to either phosphorylation or 14-3-3 proteins. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, 14-3-3 proteins were present during the phosphorylation reaction. A nearly identical result was obtained when 14-3-3 proteins were added after the phosphorylation reaction. To determine whether 14-3-3 proteins affect the stability of phosphorylated TPH, we first phosphorylated the enzyme and then quenched the reaction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This phosphorylated enzyme was then incubated at 30 °C for varying periods of time in the presence and absence of 14-3-3 proteins. After a 45-min incubation in the presence of 14-3-3 proteins, there was a 6% loss of activity, whereas in the absence of 14-3-3 proteins, there was a 17% loss of activity. These results are the first indication that at least part of the activation of TPH due to 14-3-3 may be due to a stabilizing effect of 14-3-3. This stabilizing effect of 14-3-3 is similar to the effect of 14-3-3 proteins on human tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (44Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Bourdelles B. Mallet J. Havvik J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The previous results suggested that 14-3-3 proteins might stabilize phosphorylated TPH from inactivation by preventing its dephosphorylation. To examine this possibility, we measured the effect of 14-3-3 on the dephosphorylation of32P-labeled TPH catalyzed by protein phosphatase-1. Phosphorylated TPH (1 μg) was incubated with protein phosphatase-1 in the presence or absence of 14-3-3 proteins (10 μg) at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 4, 14-3-3 proteins completely protected the phosphorylated enzyme against phosphatase-catalyzed dephosphorylation. In contrast, ∼90% dephosphorylation took place in the absence of 14-3-3. This inhibition of TPH dephosphorylation by 14-3-3 does not result from 14-3-3 proteins directly inhibiting protein phosphatase-1 as the dephosphorylation of other proteins by protein phosphatase-1 is not inhibited by 14-3-3 proteins (26Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 62Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We next examined whether 14-3-3 proteins can interact with TPH in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig.5). TPH under phosphorylating or nonphosphorylating conditions was immobilized on Ni2+-NTA resin via its six-histidine tag and incubated with 14-3-3 proteins. In a control experiment, the resin without added TPH was incubated with 14-3-3 proteins. The immobilized enzyme and control resins were washed with equilibration buffer to remove unbound 14-3-3 (lanes 1–3) and then with 150 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, to elute TPH and any bound 14-3-3 proteins (lanes 4–6). No 14-3-3 proteins bound to the control resins (lanes 1 and 4). 14-3-3 appeared to bind to both unphosphorylated TPH (lane 5) and phosphorylated TPH (lane 6), but much more 14-3-3 bound to phosphorylated TPH than to unphosphorylated TPH. From the scanning of the stained gels, we calculated that 1 mol of phosphorylated TPH monomer bound 0.9 mol of 14-3-3 dimer and that 1 mol of unphosphorylated TPH monomer bound 0.2 mol of 14-3-3 dimer. The binding of phosphorylated TPH to 14-3-3 was also examined using SPR spectroscopy. The BIAcore 2000 biosensor (33Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) uses an optical method to detect changes in the refractive index within a thin dextran matrix. The binding of protein to the matrix alters the refractive index within the matrix, and it is this refractive index change that is detected and quantified in arbitrary resonance units (RU). This method detects binding in real time and allows the rates of association (k on) and dissociation (k off) to be determined directly. The 14-3-3 proteins were attached to the sensor surface and tested for their ability to bind phosphorylated TPH. The upper trace in Fig.6 A shows the interaction of phosphorylated TPH with immobilized 14-3-3 proteins. Unphosphorylated TPH (lower trace) gave a much smaller increase in RU. The association rate (k on) was calculated by the increase in RU observed after TPH injection, and the dissociation rate (k off) was calculated from the decrease in RU observed after completion of the TPH injection while the sensor surface was washed with buffer. Using the BIAcore curve-fitting program,k o"

To study this relationship, heparan sulfate was isolated from liver and spleen of patients with AA amyloidosis and from normal organs and subjected to structural analysis. The polysaccharides were deaminated with nitrous acid, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4 to yield labeled oligosaccharides. Disaccharides obtained by selective deamination of intact orN-deacetylated polysaccharides were separated and quantified by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and thus defined the composition of N-sulfated block regions or the entire heparan sulfate chains, respectively. The heparan sulfate samples derived from liver or spleen with AA-type amyloidosis were all similar in composition, regardless of tissue source, but differed from either control material. These findings suggest that secondary amyloidosis is associated with the deposition in the affected tissues of a heparan sulfate with a specifically modified structure.

These findings suggest that secondary amyloidosis is associated with the deposition in the affected tissues of a heparan sulfate with a specifically modified structure. The deposition of proteins as insoluble amyloid fibrils in various organs is characteristic of a diverse set of medical disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, a polypeptide of 40–42 amino acid residues, the Aβ protein, is the main constituent of amyloid in the cerebral parenchyma and vasculature (1Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). AA amyloidosis, related to chronic infections and some malignant tumors, is characterized by the accumulation of the AA polypeptide, which is derived from SAA, a normal acute phase protein (3Sipe J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Skinner M. J. Intern. Med. 1992; 232: 513-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Kisilevsky R. J. Intern.

Kisilevsky R. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar, 8Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Stephens C. Anastassiades T. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar, 9Linker A. Carney H.C. Lab.

J. 1994; 303: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HS chains that usually occur covalently bound to proteins in proteoglycan structures are composed of alternating units of hexuronic acids, d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) orl-iduronic acid (IdceA), and d-glucosamine (GlcN). The GlcN residues are either N-acetylated orN-sulfated, and in addition O-sulfate groups occur at various positions. The substitution pattern of the polysaccharide chain is highly variable and thus accounts for the expression of HSs of different structure in different tissues (12Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem.

It is generally assumed that HSs exert their biological effects largely through interactions with proteins and that these interactions are strongly dependent on the structural properties of the HS ligand (for review see Ref. 17Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). HS was previously implicated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease through the demonstration of the polysaccharide in the characteristic amyloid plaques of cerebral cortex (18Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the amounts of HS in diseased cortex were found to be only marginally increased over those in control tissue. Furthermore, analysis of HS isolated from normal and diseased cerebral cortex failed to demonstrate any significant structural difference (13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Contrary to Alzheimer's disease, secondary amyloidosis shows dramatically increased amounts of HS in afflicted organs, such as kidney, liver, and spleen (9Linker A. Carney H.C. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 297-305PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bitter T. Muir H. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study we compared theO-sulfation patterns of HS from liver and spleen of patients with AA amyloidosis with those of HS from the corresponding healthy organs. Unexpectedly, all amyloid HS samples, regardless of tissue source, showed highly similar composition, which differed from that of any of the control polysaccharides. These findings point to the generation of a novel HS species that is associated with the amyloidotic disease. Tissue samples from amyloidotic liver and spleen were obtained at autopsy from two patients with secondary amyloidosis. The first patient (designated A1) died at the age of 12 from AA amyloidosis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The second patient (designated A2) died at the age of 13 from AA amyloidosis secondary to mesothelioma. Control samples of normal liver and spleen were derived from a 3-year-old (C1) and a 35-year-old (C2; spleen only), both dead by accident. HS was isolated from the tissues essentially as reported (13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Tissue samples of ∼5 g (wet weight) were homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone with a Turrax homogenizer and were then subjected to lipid extraction and proteolytic digestion with Pronase and papain. The sulfated polysaccharides were recovered by anion-exchange chromatography as described (13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), except that the column was eluted in one step, with 2m LiCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, after having been washed with 0.2 m LiCl in the same buffer. The material recovered in the high-salt fraction was digested with chondroitinase ABC and with nuclease, and enzyme-resistant polysaccharide (HS) was isolated by gel chromatography (13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The recovered HS was quantified by carbazole analysis for hexuronic acid (20Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). The isolated HS samples were subjected to compositional analysis, following degradation by either one of two different procedures (see also Ref. 14Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In one approach, the polysaccharide was cleaved at N-sulfated GlcN units by treatment with HNO2 at pH 1.5, and the resultant deamination products were reduced with NaB3H4. The recovered 3H-labeled disaccharides representN-sulfated block structures in the intact polymer. A polysaccharide sample of ∼20 μg was initially treated with 5 μmol (unlabeled) of NaBH4 for 3 h to block any reducible group associated with the intact polymer. The product was recovered by gel chromatography (Sephadex G-25 (PD-10 column; Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3), and the excluded polysaccharide was quantified by the carbazole reaction. A sample of ∼5 μg of reduced HS was deaminated with 200 μl of HNO2 reagent at pH 1.5, and the reaction products were reduced with 0.5 mCi of NaB3H4 (20–30 Ci/mmol; Amersham International) (21Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The resultant 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were recovered by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 170 cm) of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2 mNH4HCO3. They were then combined for high resolution separation by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 150 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 fine, eluted with 0.5 mNH4HCO3. The disaccharide fraction was recovered for further separation by anion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column connected to a radioactive flow detector (22Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the reduced HS was first N-deacetylated before deaminative cleavage under conditions resulting in complete degradation of the polysaccharide to disaccharides. Reduced HS (∼20 μg) was N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis at 96 °C for 4 h in 200 μl of hydrazine hydrate (Fluka) containing 1% (w/v) hydrazine sulfate. The samples were repeatedly evaporated to dryness following addition of water and were finally desalted by passage through PD-10 columns in 0.2 mNH4HCO3. After lyophilization the recovered polysaccharide was degraded, essentially to disaccharides, by consecutive treatments with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and 3.9 (14Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Riesenfeld J. Höök M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 421-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the products were reduced with 0.5 mCi of NaB3H4. The resultant labeled disaccharides were finally analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans were isolated from tissue specimens of liver and spleen by a procedure involving proteolysis of tissue and anion-exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Galactosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate) were eliminated by digestion with chondroitinase ABC, followed by gel chromatography. Quantitative analysis of the residual HS, using the carbazole reaction for hexuronic acid, showed 20–30-fold increased amounts of the polysaccharide in amyloidotic liver compared with control tissue (Table I). Similar although less marked changes were found in spleen tissue.Table IYields of heparan sulfate from normal and amyloid-laden human liver and spleenPreparation1-aC, control; A, amyloidosis.

Open table in a new tab The isolated HS samples were cleaved at N-sulfated GlcN units by treatment with HNO2 at pH 1.5, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4. Gel chromatography of the resultant labeled oligosaccharides on Bio-Gel P-10 showed prominent peaks of disaccharides (derived from consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units in the intact polysaccharide) and tetrasaccharides (alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharide units) and in addition smaller amounts of 6- to ∼18-mers (increasing numbers of consecutive N-acetylated disaccharide units) (Fig. 1). Quantitation ofN-sulfate/N-acetyl ratios, based on peak areas, showed a slightly higher degree of N-sulfation for spleen HS (∼59% of total disaccharide units) than for liver HS (∼56% of total disaccharide units). No apparent difference was seen between HS samples derived from amyloidotic and normal tissues of the same type (data not shown). The same HS samples were analyzed with regard to distribution ofO-sulfate groups in N-sulfated block structures as well as in the total polysaccharide chains. The composition ofN-sulfated sequences was determined by anion-exchange HPLC of the labeled disaccharides isolated after deamination at pH 1.5 and NaB3H4 reduction (illustrated in Fig.2, A and C). The procedure showed excellent reproducibility, the proportions of each disaccharide generally varying by <2% in analysis of different HS preparations from the same tissue specimens (data not shown). The overall disaccharide composition, including alsoN-acetylated disaccharide units outside theN-sulfated block structures, was obtained by similar analysis of products generated by N-deacetylation followed by deaminative cleavage of all glucosaminidic linkages (Fig. 2,B and D). The disaccharides obtained by total deamination were consistently enriched in the mono-6-O-sulfated species, GlcA-aManR(6-OSO3) and IdceA-aManR(6-OSO3) (Fig.3, A and B), confirming previous findings that 6-O-sulfate groups occur to a large extent outside the N-sulfated blocks (14Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Together, the disaccharide distribution profiles generated by the two procedures provide an O-sulfation “fingerprint” pattern for each HS sample, which reflects the total distribution ofO-sulfate groups as well as their relation toN-sulfated contiguous domains (Fig. 3).Figure 3Composition of heparan sulfate samples.Samples of HS isolated from human spleen or liver were deaminated, either (A) directly at pH 1.5 or (B) at pH 1.5 and 3.9 following N-deacetylation, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4. Labeled disaccharides were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and the composition of each sample with regard to O-sulfated disaccharide units was calculated. The designation of the various disaccharides is as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The data for each type of sample, except control liver HS, are derived from two different individuals. The corresponding separate analyses (open circles) are averaged as indicated by the bars; the values for control liver represent a single individual. Abbreviations are defined in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Remarkably, analysis of HS derived from normal spleen indicated that whereas the various O-sulfated disaccharide units occurred in highly different proportions, the amounts of a given disaccharide varied by only a few percent between samples from two individuals. This agreement applied both to the N-sulfated block structures (Fig. 3 A) and to the total chains (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, samples of HS from amyloidotic spleen, derived from two different individuals, were almost identical in composition (Fig. 3). However, the O-sulfation profiles of the amyloid HS samples differed clearly from those of the control polysaccharides. Thus, one of the deamination disaccharide products derived fromN-sulfated blocks, GlcA-aManR(6-OSO3) (designated GMSin Fig. 3 A; this component corresponds to a -GlcA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- sequence in the intact polysaccharide), was about twice as abundant as in control material, whereas the most frequent disaccharide component, IdceA(2-OSO3)-aManR (ISM in Fig.3 A), was decreased by ∼15%. The total compositional analysis revealed more striking differences (Fig. 3 B) that involved primarily the two mono-6-O-sulfated disaccharides. The IdceA-aManR(6-OSO3)/GlcA-aManR(6-OSO3) ratio, based on average values from analyses of HS preparations from two healthy and two diseased spleens, thus decreased from 3.2 to 1.0. The O-sulfation profiles of two samples of amyloidotic liver HS, derived from different individuals, were not only mutually similar but were virtually indistinguishable from the corresponding patterns relating to amyloidotic spleen HS (Fig. 3). By contrast, these patterns differed markedly from that of control liver HS in which some of the constituent disaccharide units were less abundant and others more abundant. The differences were apparent within as well as outside theN-sulfated block regions (Fig. 3, A andB). It is concluded that the HS species accumulated in the two diseased organs are similar but differ from those normally occurring in liver and spleen. Increased deposition of glycosaminoglycans, in particular HS and to a lesser extent dermatan sulfate, is commonly seen in organs affected by amyloidosis (see the Introduction) and was confirmed in the present study. A previous survey of polysaccharides from amyloid-laden liver and spleen, involving oligosaccharide mapping in gradient polyacrylamide gels following partial digestion with specific glycosidases, suggested similar structures for the HSs from the two different organs (24Nelson S.R. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Johnson E.A. Pepys M.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, the results of the present, more detailed, structural investigation point to the formation of a “novel,” amyloid-specific HS with a composition different from those of the corresponding polysaccharides in control organs. Analysis of the four samples of HS isolated from amyloid-laden organs, two each from liver and spleen from two different individuals, thus gave strikingly similar compositional data (Fig. 3). These deviated from those relating to all control polysaccharides regardless of tissue source. Notably, the structural properties of the amyloid-associated HS appear unrelated to the underlying primary disease as one of the patients suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and the other from mesothelioma. There are few previous reports of any clinical condition being associated with a change in HS structure, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous implication of any HS species of defined composition. An overall decrease in sulfation was observed for HS in experimental diabetes in rats (25Kjellén L. Bielefeld D. Höök M. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Further, HS preparations obtained from transformed cells in vitro were found to differ in O-sulfation from the corresponding control polysaccharides (26Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Nakanishi H. Oguri K. Yoshida K. Itano N. Takenaga K. Kazama T. Yoshida A. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previous compositional analysis of HS from human organs pointed to the occurrence of organ-specific structural patterns (13Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present characterization of HS from normal spleen conformed to these previous findings, as the two samples were highly similar in composition (but differed from spleen amyloid HS; see above). The spleen specimens were obtained from 3- and 35-year-old individuals, suggesting that there was no significant age-related change in HS structure within this age range. The O-sulfation pattern of the HS preparation derived from normal liver deviated markedly from that of any of the other samples investigated from control or amyloidotic tissue (Fig. 3). Since only a single specimen of normal liver tissue was available we cannot draw any conclusion as to the general applicability of this pattern to other individuals. However, it seems reasonable to infer that the same unique amyloid-specific HS occurs not only in spleen but also in liver. The mechanism behind the selective pathological accumulation of apparently specific HS is unclear. Current information, including immunohistochemical observations (15van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22802-22809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggests that the HS isolated from composite tissues represents a mixture of proteoglycan pools, presumably involving several different core proteins (29David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In healthy tissues these pools would seem to occur in essentially constant proportions. Conceivably, the amyloid deposition may lead to selective expansion of one such pool, with HS chains of a particular structure. It is thus notable that perlecan mRNA levels were found to increase significantly during the early stages of experimental murine AA amyloidogenesis (10Ailles L. Kisilevsky R. Young I.D. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 443-448PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the biosynthetic machinery for HS chains in the tissue may be generally perturbed toward the production of a novel polysaccharide species. Yet another possibility is that the amyloid protein(s) may selectively bind to a particular HS structure and thus withdraw this species from normal turnover. The sequestered HS would escape degradation and hence accumulate. Finally, we cannot disregard the possibility that the HS is produced elsewhere in the body and is transported to the site of deposition with the blood. Further studies of the phenomenon will hopefully promote our understanding of the amyloidotic condition as well as of the intricate mechanisms in control of HS metabolism. We thank Dr. Gunnar Husby and Dr. Jeanette Magnus for generous gifts of tissue samples used in this investigation. We are also indebted to Jeanette Magnus for valuable discussions."

Prior to acquisition of native conformation, the nascent proteins are retained in the ER, where they associate with molecular chaperones (1Helenius A. Marquardt T. Braakman I. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Two of the better recognized ER chaperones are family members of the hsp90 (GRP94) (2Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hsp70 classes (BiP) (3Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar,4Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), which are abundant proteins in the normal ER (5Marquardt T. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are further induced under stress conditions (6Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). One physiologically relevant example of such stress occurs in endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases, which include a large group of hereditary illnesses originating from mutations in secretory proteins or other exportable proteins that interfere with protein folding and exit from the ER (7Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Hossain S.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) . In both normal secretory protein export and in ER storage diseases, the functions of ER chaperones remain poorly understood. BiP, perhaps the most studied ER chaperone, interacts transiently with certain wild-type exportable proteins and exhibits more prolonged interactions with certain mutant or unassembled exportable proteins (8Dorner A.J.

Nevertheless, it has been difficult to clearly define a single post-translational role of BiP in the export of secretory proteins (see Introduction of Hendershot et al. (19Hendershot L. Wei J. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). Even less is known about the role played by GRP94 in protein export, although its demonstrated ability to bind certain secretory proteins is also well established (20Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Virology. 1991; 184: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21303-21306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, although it has been concluded that, in conjunction with its chaperone function in the ER, GRP94 is a molecule capable of ATP binding (22Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), hydrolysis (23Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and autophorphorylation activity (24Csermely P. Miyata Y. Schnaider T. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6381-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these conclusions have recently been called into question by new experiments which suggest that peptide interaction with GPR94 is ATPindependent (25Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have been interested to know more about the effects of binding of GRP94 on the folding and export of thyroglobulin (Tg), the secretory protein precursor for thyroid hormone synthesis, and one of the reported “substrates” for GRP94 association in thyroid epithelial cells (18Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3057-3063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Tg is a large (∼330 kDa) glycoprotein that undergoes substantial initial folding, including the formation of nearly 60 intrachain disulfide bonds, before homodimerization, which normally occurs in the ER. Remarkably, even when great precaution is taken to prevent formation of artifactual disulfide bonds at the time of cell lysis, immediately after translation in primary thyrocytes, newly synthesized nonmutant Tg is found in high molecular mass complexes, many containing improper interchain disulfide bonds (27Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3057-3063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol.

Subsequently the disulfide-linked Tg complexes become undetectable while Tg is observed to advance toward more folded forms of individual monomers (14Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During early folding, nonmutant Tg dissociates from GRP94 with kinetics superimposable upon those of BiP (18Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These kinetics precede Tg homodimerization and its vesicular egress from the ER (14Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In thyrocytes as in other cell types, GRP94 levels are physiologically regulated (30Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4873-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in humans suffering from congenital goiter with mutant Tg, thyrocytes can achieve levels of GRP94 that are elevated by ≥1 order of magnitude, which represents a greater increase than that observed for BiP (31Medeiros-Neto G. Kim P.S. Yoo S.E. Vono J. Targovnik H. Camargo R. Hossain S.A. Arvan P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the cog/cog mouse (32Beamer W.G. Maltais L.J. DeBaets M.H. Eicher E.M. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 838-840Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Taylor B.A. Rowe L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1986-1990Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Mayerhofer A. Amador A.G. Beamer W.G. Bartke A. J. Hered. 1988; 79: 200-203Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), an animal model of this illness in which thyroid tissue is available for pulse-chase analysis, the fraction of Tg molecules that exits the ER is much lower than normal, while an increased fraction of Tg interacts with GPR94 in a prolonged manner (18Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, congenital hypothyroid goiter is not a suitable model in which to independently examine the role of GRP94 binding in Tg maturation, because it is difficult to resolve the consequences of increased GRP94 binding from those related to intrinsic alterations in the biophysical properties of mutant Tg. For this reason, in the present report we have examined the conformational maturation and export of nonmutant Tg as a consequence of manipulating the probability of GRP94 binding to recombinant Tg in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells engineered for wild-type or increased levels of GRP94 expression. Our results indicate that a major increase in the ER residence time and expansion of the ER pool of Tg occurs when the availability of GRP94 is increased, and this retention occurs as a direct consequence of complex formation between an apparent Tg folding intermediate and this ER chaperone. The following vectors were employed: pCB6, a mammalian expression vector carrying a neomycin resistance cassette and cytomegalovirus promoter-driven insert (originally from Dr. M. Stinsky, University of Iowa); pBAT14, used as a shuttle vector, was from Dr. M. German (University of California, San Francisco); pBR322 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Co-vidarabine (pentostatin, inhibitor of adenosine deaminase) was from Parke-Davis. l-Alanosine was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI) as distributed by Ogden BioServices Corporation. Dithiobis(succinimdyl propionate) (DSP) was purchased from Pierce. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and recombinant endoglycosidase H were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against denatured Tg as described previously (35Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Antibody to ribophorin II was the kind gift of Dr. D. Meyer (University of California, Los Angeles). An immunoprecipitating polyclonal antiserum to GRP94 (36Maki R.G. Old L.J. Srivastava P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5658-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Srivastava (Fordham University, Bronx, NY). A polyclonal antiserum to BiP was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). Polyclonal antibodies to protein disulfide isomerase and ER60 were from Dr. T. Wileman (Pirbright Laboratories, Surrey, UK), and polyclonal antibodies to GRP94, calnexin, ERp72, and calreticulin (18Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were also provided by Dr. P. Kim (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA). A rhodamine-conjugated, affinity isolated, goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Tago, Inc. (Burlingame, CA), and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Life Technologies, Inc. The serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). 125I-labeled protein A was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Zysorbin was from Zymed Labs (San Francisco, CA). [35S]Cysteine/methionine (Expre35S35S) and pure [35S]methionine were from NEN. Other tissue culture reagents, protease inhibitors, and stock chemicals were either from Life Sciences or Sigma. Until now, no full-length Tg cDNA has ever been successfully prepared. For this reason, our strategy involved subcloning four contiguous partial cDNAs (37Mercken L. Simons M.-J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. G. Vassart (University Libre, Brussels, Belgium), to create a cDNA corresponding to base pairs 519–8430 (i.e. from a conserved NcoI site to the 3′-end) of the bovine Tg coding sequence (Fig.1). Using the rat Tg-2 cDNA (38Graves P.N. Davies T.F. Mol. Endocinol. 1990; 4: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) obtained from Dr. P. Graves (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York), the remaining Tg coding sequence (i.e. from the extreme 5′-end to the conserved NcoI site) was provided. Thus, the final full-length cDNA we employed encodes for a polypeptide that exhibits overall 99.1% identity to normal bovine Tg, with the remaining 0.9% being conservative bovine → rat Tg substitutions contained within the first 155 amino acids. For stepwise construction, a fragment of the rat Tg-2 cDNA extending from an EcoRI site (17 bases upstream from the translational start site) to NcoI (Fig. 1) was ligated into the shuttle vector pBAT14 along with a partial bovine Tg cDNA extending from the conserved NcoI site to aHindIII site at position 2826. The ligated insert was excised from pBAT14 using BamHI from the polylinker andHindIII, and then subcloned into the BglII andHindIII sites in the polylinker of pCB6, destroying the former site. The resulting plasmid was then digested withHindIII and the sole downstream BamHI site, and a partial Tg cDNA encoding the 3′-end (position 7446–8430) was directionally ligated (Fig. 1). Independently,HindIII-HindIII cDNA fragments extending from positions 2826–4764 and 4764–7446, respectively, were ligated together at the HindIII site of pBR322, and appropriately oriented subclones were selected from DNA minipreps. From this, the correctly ligated 4.6-kilobase pair insert was excised from pBR322 by partial digestion with HindIII, and this gel-purified insert was ligated into the HindIII-digested pCB6 which contained the rest of the Tg cDNA. The size and orientation of the final full-length clone (Fig. 1) was confirmed by identity to the known bovine Tg restriction map (37Mercken L. Simons M.-J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Two lines of CHO cells were graciously provided by Dr. A. Dorner (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) for use in the present studies. The parental (“CHO-P” cell) line, containing endogenous levels of ER chaperones, is a dihydrofolate reductase-deficient line, previously called DUKX-B11 (39Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The GRP94-overexpressing (“CHO-G” cell) line was prepared as pooled transfectants overexpressing murine GRP94 (2Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a consequence of selection by co-amplification of adenosine deaminase (40Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained in media based on α-minimum essential medium containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The medium for CHO-P cells also contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mg/liter each of adenosine, deoxyadenosine, and thymidine, whereas CHO-G cell medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm uridine, 1.1 mm adenosine, 10 mg/liter each of deoxyadenosine and thymidine, 1 μm pentostatin, and 0.05 mml-alanosine. Depending upon confluence, cells were fed every 2nd or 3rd day. For Tg transfection, subconfluent cell cultures were rinsed with PBS and detached with trypsin-EDTA. A 0.25-ml suspension of 2 × 106 cells was transfected with the full-length Tg cDNA in pCB6 (20 μg) in a 0.4-cm pass electroporation cuvette at 330 V and 250 μF (time constant ∼14 ms); cells were then diluted 400-fold and plated. After 2 days in culture, selection was started by addition of 0.8 mg/ml geneticin. Colonies were picked and screened for Tg expression by immunofluorescence; media and cell lysates from positive clones were then analyzed by immunoblotting. At least two Tg-expressing clones of each type were further studied; by initial characterization, the results obtained with replicate clones were essentially identical (e.g. see Fig. 4), thus the data presented in this report all derive from representative clones. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS, fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubation with primary antibody was carried out for 1 h at room temperature in the permeabilization buffer. Cells were then rinsed with this buffer and incubated for another hour with a 1:400 dilution of a rhodamine-conjugated, affinity-isolated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The rinsed and mounted specimens were examined with a Zeiss microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. CHO cells were washed twice with Cys-free, Met-free medium, prior to pulse-labeling for either 10 or 20 min at 37 °C in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine and methionine. At the conclusion of the pulse labeling, the cells were washed and chased in normal growth medium. For long term labeling to approach steady state, the medium was not deficient (i.e. the medium contained unlabeled cysteine and methionine, plus serum, at half the usual concentration of that in complete growth medium), and labeling was for 20–24 h. In preliminary experiments (not shown), results from experiments analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (like those shown in Figs. 7 and 8) were not significantly affected by continuous labeling times ranging from 8 to 24 h, although labeled amino acid incorporation was proportional to the length of the labeling period. For the experiment shown in Fig.10, the continuous labeling employed 400 μCi/ml pure [35S]methionine.Figure 8In CHO-G cells, disulfide-linked Tg complexes include bound GRP94. After labeling with radioactive [35S]cysteine and methionine as in Fig. 7, Tg-expressing CHO cells (right-sided panels) and control cells not expressing Tg (upper left panel) were exposed to the membrane-permeant cross-linker, DSP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tg immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE as in Fig. 7. In the second dimension, discrete bands of ∼94 and ∼78 kDa can be seen to underlie disulfide-linked Tg complexes. In the single dimension lane (bottom left panel), the migration of immunoprecipitable GRP94 by reducing 6.5% SDS-PAGE is shown, as well as a second band of 78 kDa, which could either represent a cross-reaction with BiP or recovery of protein complexes that include both proteins. Secondary immunodetection, described in Fig. 10, confirmed the identity of the 94-kDa protein as GRP94, while the 78-kDa protein co-migrates with authentic immunoprecipitable BiP from CHO-G cells (see Fig. 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 10Composition of Tg·GRP94 complexes.Tg-expressing CHO-P and CHO-G cells were metabolically labeled for 22 h with [35S]methionine.

Note that Tg is very poor (<1% abundance) in methionine but contains 122 cysteine residues, while GRP94 has only 3 Cys residues but contains 18 methionines. Thus, unlike Fig. 8 in which most of the Tg signal is derived from labeling with [35S]cysteine, the ratio of GRP94 to Tg in Tg·GRP94 complexes appears much higher after labeling with pure [35S]methionine, which is used to precisely calculate a GRP94·Tg stoichiometry in the isolated complexes (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For chemical cross-linking, cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 200 μm DSP in PBS diluted from a solution in Me2SO (0.05% final concentration). Uncross-linked controls were incubated in parallel with PBS containing the carrier only. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by lysis of cells in 3% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mg/ml EDTA, and 0.4 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride) ± 50 mm iodoacetamide. No difference in results were obtained in either the presence or absence of the alkylating agent during lysis (indeed, previous detailed investigations of Tg folding have established that detection of high molecular mass disulfide-bonded Tg complexes, as shown in this report, is not due to the presence or absence of alkylating agent during cell lysis) (28Kim P.S.

The cell lysate was boiled for 3 min, passed 15 times through a 25-gauge needle, and then spun in a Microfuge for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. An aliquot from this supernatant was diluted ≥20-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). 1 ml of the diluted cell lysate was preabsorbed for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μl of a 10% suspension of fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Zysorbin). The suspension was pelleted in a Microfuge for 2 min at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-Tg. 50 μl of a 10% suspension of Zysorbin was then added, and immune complexes were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets of this suspension were washed once in immunoprecipitation buffer, once in 0.5% Tween-20 in TBS (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), once in TBS, and finally in water, before boiling for 5 min in 20–40 μl of 2 × sample buffer in the presence or absence of 10% β-mercaptoethanol. For quantitative determination of Tg by immunoprecipitation, the amount of cell lysate obtained from different clones was quantitated by DNA assay using bisbenzimide fluorescence with a Hoefer (San Francisco, CA) Mini-Fluorometer, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For sequential immunoprecipitation, cell lines labeled to approach steady state and cross-linked with DSP, were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg as described above. These immunoprecipitates were eluted from Zysorbin for 1 h at 60 °C in 50 μl of 1% SDS plus 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The supernatant was then diluted to 1 ml in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 mg/ml unlabeled bovine Tg (Sigma) and mixed with 2 μl of anti-GRP94. Final immunoprecipitates adsorbed to Zysorbin were eluted by boiling for 4 min in 30 μl of sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates prepared in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, plus protease inhibitors were boiled for 5 min and then either digested or mock digested for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (35Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The samples were then diluted to 1 ml and immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg. For immunoblot analysis, samples resolved on SDS-gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 3% gelatin in TBS plus 0.5% Tween-20, incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in the same solution, and then washed three times. The blot was then incubated for 1 h with a 1:3,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, rinsed several times, and then reacted with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. In the immunoblots of Fig. 2, the lanes were loaded based on total cellular protein, and the secondary reagent employed was radioiodinated protein A; in this case, bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging. It is theoretically possible that normalizing to total cellular protein could unintentionally introduce small quantitative differences from that which might be obtained upon normalizing samples to cellular DNA, but we can estimate that any such error, if it existed, would be ≤10% and would affect neither the outcome nor the conclusions obtained from these experiments. Tg immunoprecipitates were separated in the first dimension under nonreducing conditions by 4% SDS-PAGE. For the second dimension, the samples were reduced with 10% β-mercaptoethanol in sample buffer and resolved by 6.5% SDS-PAGE. Single dimensional gels used acrylamide concentrations that varied depending upon the particular experiment. To evaluate potential effects of GRP94 on Tg maturation and intracellular transport, we set out to examine CHO cells that maintain either wild-type levels of ER chaperones (parental CHO-P cells), or pooled transformants achieving elevated levels of GRP94 (CHO-G). Using the adenosine deaminase co-amplification system (40Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), GRP94 expression in CHO-G cells detected by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A) was increased ∼13-fold, on average (see Fig. 2 B). Since increased abundance of GRP94 might indirectly affect Tg trafficking by displacing other ER resident proteins (56Booth C. Koch G.L.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 66Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the levels of several other ER proteins by specific immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Importantly, increased expression of GRP94 had no significant effect on the steady state level of BiP (Fig. 2,A and B). Further, compared with CHO-P cells, there was no appreciable change in the total amount of rough ER in CHO-G cells, based on the levels of ribophorin II and calnexin (Fig.2 C), which are a"

To explore how type I cells differ in gene expression from their progenitor alveolar type II cells, we analyzed transcriptional regulation of T1α, a gene expressed by adult type I but not type II cells. In vivodevelopmental patterns of T1α expression in lung and brain suggest active gene regulation. We cloned and sequenced 1.25 kilobase pairs of the T1α promoter that can drive reporter expression in lung epithelial cell lines. Deletion analyses identified regions important for lung cell expression. The base pair (bp) −100 to −170 fragment conferred differential regulation in lung epithelial cells compared with fibroblasts. Sequence alignment of this fragment with type II-specific surfactant protein B and C promoters shows similar consensus elements arranged in a different order. Gel retardation studies with alveolar epithelial cell line nuclear extracts, thyroid transcription factor I (TTF-1) homeodomain, hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-3β, or Sp1 proteins, and supershift assays were used to characterize TTF-1, HNF-3 (TGT3), and Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. The TGT3 site binds factors with binding properties similar to HNF-3/Fkh (hepatic nuclear factor-3/forkhead) proteins but different from HNF-3α or HNF-3β. Co-transfection with a TTF-1 expression vector moderately transactivated the −170 bp-reporter construct. Mutational analysis of these three binding sites showed reduced transcriptional activity of the −170 bp promoter. Therefore, several regulatory sequences involved in type II cell gene regulation are also present in the T1α promoter, suggesting that genes of the peripheral lung epithelium may be regulated by similar factors.

Therefore, several regulatory sequences involved in type II cell gene regulation are also present in the T1α promoter, suggesting that genes of the peripheral lung epithelium may be regulated by similar factors. The alveolar type I epithelial cell forms the major cellular surface (∼70 m2, human) for gas exchange in the mammalian lung. Despite this important function, very little is known about its molecular phenotype or regulation of expression of its cell-specific genes (1Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Gehr P. Bachofen M. Weibel E.R. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1982; 125: 332-337Google Scholar). We have recently cloned, sequenced, and characterized a gene, T1α, that we believe is the first definitive marker for this cell type in the adult rat lung (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Williams M.C. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Rishi A.K. Wetterwald A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The gene encodes an apical transmembrane protein that is expressed by type I cells but not by adjacent alveolar epithelial type II cells. Characterizing the regulation of this new marker for the type I cell phenotype is likely to be important for understanding the general processes by which type I cells differ in gene regulation, structure, and biology from other lung epithelial cells, particularly alveolar type II cells. Expression of T1α is developmentally regulated (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Williams M.C. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Rishi A.K. Wetterwald A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both mRNA and protein are expressed in many fore- and midgut derivatives as early as embryonic day 10.5 (rat) including the primitive lung (day 12.5) and the anterior pituitary anlage (Rathke's pouch), in the early embryonic brain, spinal cord, other neural structures, and several other organs. In most of these tissues, however, expression is rapidly repressed during fetal development (brain) or postnatally (bronchiolar epithelium). In the adult rat, T1α mRNA and protein expression can be detected at high levels only in the alveolar type I cell, in choroid plexus epithelium, in ciliary body of the eye, and in a subset of osteoblasts (4Nose K. Saito H. Kuroki T. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wetterwald A. Hofstetter W. Cecchini M.G. Lanske B. Wagner C. Fleisch H. Atkinson M. Bone. 1996; 18: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These complex developmental temporal-spatial patterns suggest that active mechanisms of gene regulation determine the highly specific pattern of T1α expression in the adult. In situ hybridization, immunocytochemical, biochemical, and molecular analyses (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Gonzalez R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 970: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) show that adult alveolar type II cells do not express T1α in vivo, although these cells reside in the alveolar epithelium and act as stem cells to generate new type I cells in normal and injured lung (7Evans M.J. Cabral L.J. Stephens R.J. Freeman G. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1975; 22: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, when type II cells from normal lung are cultured under conditions where they do not proliferate, they rapidly (within <24 h) express both T1α mRNA and protein, while down-regulating type II cell genes (8Borok Z. Hami A. Danto S.I. Zabski S.M. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These and other similar findings suggest that type II and type I cell genes share certain common regulatory elements and transactivating molecules but not others, allowing for expression of their cell-specific phenotypes. There is now considerable information about the regulation of type II cell genes because of an interest in defining the molecular control of synthesis of pulmonary surfactant, a complex lipid-protein material secreted by type II cells.

We report here our initial studies on the regulation ofT1α using the 1.25-kb promoter that we cloned and sequenced. Using promoter deletion analyses, electrophoretic mobility assays, and mutational analysis, we have identified the minimal promoter and regions that account for differential expression between epithelial cells and fibroblasts. These studies demonstrate thatcis-elements known to be involved in type II cell gene expression are also present in the proximal promoter ofT1α. Activation of these elements is unlikely to differentiate between type I and type II phenotypes. A rat genomic library (NIH; HaeIII-partially cut DNA ligated into λ gt10 vector) was amplified into 10 fractions that were tested by PCR for the T1α cDNA 5′-end using oligos P1 (5′-CCACTAGCTGCTGAGGCTCCAA-3′) and P2 (5′-GAGTCCCAGAACCAAACG-3′) (2Rishi A.K.

Fractions showing the expected 87-bp PCR fragment were plated at different dilutions and screened on filters with probe P3 spanning the coding region of the cDNA (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Eleven clones were analyzed by PCR using oligos P1 and P2; five yielded an amplicon of the expected size. For secondary screening, the clones were amplified and analyzed for P3 hybridization. Two clones from each positive plate were selected, replated, and reprobed. DNA from five different clones, uncut orEcoRI-cut, was analyzed on Southern blots using P4 (a probe made by PCR using oligos P1 and P2). DNA from a positive clone was digested with BamHI, and fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transformed bacterial colonies were screened with P4. Inserts from six positive clones were analyzed by restriction mapping with EcoRI, BamHI or both, and two clones were sequenced. They contained 60 bp of intron 1, the first exon, and ∼1.3 kb of 5′-flanking region. To verify the promoter sequence, genomic DNA from a rat SV40T immortalized type II cell line was amplified by PCR, cloned with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in a pCR vector, and sequenced. The 5′-end of the T1α cDNA was previously obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension (32Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The P5 oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides +82 to +115 (Fig. 1) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified through Nuc-Trap column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 15 μg of total RNA from SV40T type II (SV40TII) cells or IMR-90 fibroblasts were annealed to oligonucleotide P5 at 55 or 65 °C for 3 h under mineral oil. After extending the probe using 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison WI), the products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and electrophoresed on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel for analysis of extension products. The −1251bp-Bluescript plasmid was constructed by digestion of a genomic clone with SacI and partial digestion with EcoRI. The 1352-bp segment (−1251 to +101 bp) was cloned into pBluescript SK. −789-pBluescript was prepared by SacI and AvrII digestion of −1251bp-Bluescript and insertion of the −789 to +101 bp fragment into the SacI-XbaI site of pBluescript SK. This construct was further digested with PstI andBamHI for construction of plasmids containing progressive unidirectional deletions using the Erase-a-Base System (Promega). Deletion constructs containing −19 bp, −53 bp, −100 bp, −170 bp, −200 bp, −243 bp, −286 bp, −396 bp, −562 bp, and −661 bp of the promoter were sequenced to determine their exact lengths. All constructs were digested with KpnI-SacI prior to insertion of the fragments into pGL-3 Basic Luciferase reporter vector (Promega). All T1α promoter constructs contain +101 bp of the untranslated region. SV40TII cells were derived from neonatal rat alveolar type II cells immortalized in vitro with the viral oncogene SV40 large tumor antigen (33Clement A. Steele M.P. Brody J.S. Riedel N. Exp.

Cells were seeded onto 10-cm plates and used at about 60% confluency. 15 μg of total DNA, purified by Qiagen-tip 500, (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was mixed with 450 μg of DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and added to the plates. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DMEM, 10% FBS (4.5 ml) and 135 μl of 8 mm chloroquine (Sigma) were added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The transfection mixture was replaced by DMEM without FBS for 2 h followed by DMEM, 10% FBS for 48 h. Cells were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-lacZ construct to normalize data for transfection efficiency. For TTF1 cotransfection studies, 3 μg of CMV-TTF1 (provided by Dr. R. Di Lauro, Stazione Zoologica A. Dohrn, Napoli, Italy) or 3 μg of control pCMV (provided by Dr. Z. Xiao, Boston University, MA) was added to the transfection mixture. Cells were extracted and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described by Sambrook (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). IMR-90 cells were transfected with 15 μg of DNA by the calcium phosphate method as modified by Chen and Okayama (37Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean of at least three experiments (duplicate samples) ± S.E. Values are presented relative to the level of expression of promoterless construct 0bp-Luc. Data were analyzed by t test with differences p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Total RNA was purified using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blots were performed by the glyoxal/(CH3)2SO denaturation method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized by standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by the hexamer-random prime method (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). RatT1α probe was a 520-bp cDNA fragment containing the coding region, and SP-C probe was 574 bp from the rat coding region (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A 552-bp β-actin probe was used as a control for loading (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were done in 50% (v/v) formamide solution containing 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C, washed twice in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h and once in 0.2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and then exposed at −70 °C for 3–12 h. Western blots were done exactly as described previously (3Williams M.C. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Rishi A.K. Wetterwald A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For detection of TTF-1, nuclear proteins (20 μg/lane), purified as below, or rat lung total protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-TTF-1 monoclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Whitsett) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a miniextraction procedure (14Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Complementary oligonucleotides with three or four bases of protruding 5′-ends were synthesized and purified by 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Annealing was performed at oligonucleotide concentrations of 10 μm in 50 μl 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl. Mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in a dry block and cooled slowly to room temperature. Annealed oligonucleotides (20 pmol) were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and DNA polymerase large Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), purified on Nuc Trap columns (Stratagene), recovered in a final volume of 100 μl at ∼200,000 cpm/μl, and diluted 1:10 before use. Assays were performed as described by Bohinski et al. (14Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). All binding reactions were performed on ice. Nuclear protein extract (10 μg, unless otherwise stated) and 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Boehringer Mannheim) were incubated in 20 μl of buffer (12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. Labeled oligonucleotide (15–20 fmol, ∼20,000 cpm) was added prior to a 20-min incubation. For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were incubated with proteins for 10 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. For supershift analyses, mixtures were incubated with 1–2 μl of anti-TTF-1 monoclonal antibody, nonspecific monoclonal antibody (anti-cyclin B1, Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), or anti-Sp1, -Sp3, and -Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). TTF-1 homeodomain (TTF-1 HD) was produced in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (Pharmacia) using a construct from Dr. C. Mendelson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). After purification and cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase region with thrombin protease, the TTF-1 HD (∼1 ng) was used in EMSA. Incubation with TTF-1 HD was done for 1 h. HNF-3β protein was obtained byin vitro transcription-translation using a construct provided by Dr. R. Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and the TNT-Sp6 coupled kit (Promega); HNF-3β protein (∼3 ng) was incubated with oligonucleotides in the same conditions as for nuclear proteins. HNF-3α and HNF-3β polyclonal antibodies used in supershift assays (data not shown) were provided by Dr. R. Costa. Gels (5%) were dried and exposed at −70 °C for 16–36 h unless otherwise stated. Mutated TGT3, TTF-1 sites, and double mutant fragments were generated by PCR under standard conditions (annealing temperature 42 °C, 30 cycles) using −170Luc as template. The mutated fragments (from bp −170 to −89) were flanked by a 5′ KpnI and 3′ EcoRI restriction site. The 5′-primer used was a 36-mer containing the 5′ wild type sequence. The 3′-primers were mutated oligonucleotides complementary to the 3′-sequence. PCR fragments were purified and digested withKpnI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. −170Luc was digested with KpnI and EcoRI; wild type fragment was removed by agarose electrophoresis, and mutated fragments were inserted into those sites. For the mutated Sp1 site, the PCR fragment was generated from −104 to +101 flanked by a 5′ EcoRI and 3′ SacI site. The 5′-primer was a 30-mer mutated in the Sp1 site. The 3′-primer was complementary to the wild type sequence. −170Luc construct was digested with EcoRI andSacI, and the mutated fragment was inserted as described before. Mutated −170Luc constructs were sequenced and transfected in SV40TII cells as described above. A fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the T1α gene was isolated by PCR screening of a rat genomic library using two primers in the 5′ end of the cDNA (2Rishi A.K. Joyce-Brady M. Fisher J. Dobbs L.G. Floros J. VanderSpek J. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Positive clones, characterized by Southern blotting and restriction enzyme analysis (data not shown), were shown to contain ∼1.45 kb of the 5′-flanking region. The sequence of the proximal promoter is shown Fig.1. A major transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension using SV40TII cell mRNA as template (Fig. 2). The T1α5′-flanking region contains a 201-bp 5′-untranslated region and 1251-bp promoter. A TATA-like box (TAAATT) is located at position −25 bp (Fig.1). The sequence around the transcription initiation site (CCAGTTG) is characteristic of a transcriptional initiator identified in many TATA-less promoters (39Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 40Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). A number of putative binding sites for ubiquitous and lung-enriched transcription factors were identified by computer analysis comparing the 1.25-kb promoter sequence to known consensus sequences. 2R. Costa, unpublished data. SV40TII and IMR-90 cells and adult rat lung were analyzed for T1α and SP-C mRNAs and T1α protein expression. High levels of T1αmRNA and protein are detectable in adult lung and SV40TII cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Neither T1α mRNA nor protein is detectable in IMR-90 cells. SP-C mRNA is undetectable in both cell lines but abundant in lung. MLE-15 cells express SP-A, -B, and -C mRNA (34Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but they do not express T1α (data not shown). SV40TII cells therefore appear to be a good model for studying regulation of T1α, since they have high levels of its mRNA and do not express the type II SP-C (Fig. 3 A), SP-A, or SP-B genes (33Clement A. Steele M.P. Brody J.S. Riedel N. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IMR-90 cells, expressing neither T1α nor type II cell genes, were used as nonexpressing control cells. Twelve T1αpromoter-luciferase constructs were used in transient expression studies to define regulatory elements required for promoter activity (Fig. 4). In SV40TII cells, the bp −1251 to +101 promoter (−1251bp-Luc) drives luciferase expression about 85-fold over that from a promoterless control construct (0bp-Luc) (Fig.4). The expression of luciferase constructs in epithelial cells is about ∼1.5–4-fold higher than that in fibroblasts, although the expression patterns are similar in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. This indicates that the 1.25-kb promoter is sufficient to confer at least partial specificity between the two types of cells. The modest expression of luciferase driven by T1α promoter in IMR-90 cells is similar to recent findings that show low levels of reporter expression driven by the SP"

High performance liquid chromatography analysis of peptidyl vinyl sulfone-modified intactRhodococcus proteasome β-subunit and its tryptic peptides suggests that the peptidyl vinyl sulfone modifies a residue in the N-terminal 20 amino acids.

This modification is also blocked by prior treatment with β-lactone. The proteasome is a multi-proteinase complex which occurs in all eukaryotic cells. In 1989, the proteasome was also discovered to exist in prokaryotes, namely in the archaebacterium, Thermoplasma acidophilium (1Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of the proteasome is conserved between both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, having a barrel-shaped structure composed of four 7-subunit membered rings stacked on top of one another. However, the complexity of the subunit composition within this structure is different between eukaryotic proteasomes and their prokaryotic counterparts. The archaebacterial proteasome has a relatively simple structure, consisting of only two types of subunits, α and β. The α-subunits form the outer rings of the cylindrical stack, whereas the β-subunits form the two inner rings (2Pühler G. Weinkauf S. Bachmann L. Müller S. Engel A. Hergerl R. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1607-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All enzymatic activity has been shown to be associated with the β-subunits, the α-subunits having regulatory and targeting functions. Eukaryotic proteasomes, on the other hand, are much more complex. They consist of 14 different, although related types of subunits, which can be divided into seven α types and seven β types (3Heinemeyer W. Trondle N. Albrecht G. Wolf D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12229-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic proteasomes have three well characterized peptidase activities, namely, “chymotrypsin-like” (P1 residue is a Leu or Tyr in substrate), “trypsin-like” (Arg in P1 position), and “peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing” (Glu in P1 position) (4Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Other activities such as “branch-chain amino acid preferring” and “small neutral amino acid preferring” activities have also been identified (5Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies provide convincing evidence that some of these activities are catalyzed at different active sites but the exact correspondence of peptidase activities to active sites in eukaryotic proteasomes is unknown. Thermoplasma proteasomes which contain only one type of active site exhibit a much more limited ability to hydrolyze tri- and tetra-peptides (1Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, similar to eukaryotic proteasomes, the archaebacterial proteasome exhibits indiscriminate cleavage preference when presented with unfolded polypeptide substrates (6Wenzel T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Seemüller and co-workers (7Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) have identified the N-terminal threonine residue of the β-subunit of theT. acidophilium proteasome as the catalytic nucleophile, using site-directed mutagenesis techniques. The crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with a tripeptide aldehyde inhibitor lends support to this. The aldehyde function of the inhibitor was situated at Thr1 of the β-subunit (8Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Recently, the first characterization of a eubacterial proteasome was undertaken by Tamura and co-workers (9Tamura T. Nagy I. Lupas A. Lottspeich F. Cejka Z. Schoofs G. Tanaka K. De Mot R. Baumeister W. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 766-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The proteasome from the nocardioform actinomycete Rhodococcus erythropolis strain N186/21 was found to have two types of α (α1, 31 kDa and α2, 29 kDa) and two types of β-subunits (β1, 25 kDa and β2, 24 kDa), arranged in the same quaternary structure as proteasomes from eukaryotic sources. Similar to the Thermoplasma proteasome, the peptidase activity of the Rhodococcus proteasome is limited to tri- and tetrapeptides which are substrates for chymotrypsin-like activity. Proteasomes isolated from Rhodococcus are composed of these four subunit types, according to a α7β7β7α7stoichiometry (10Zühl F. Tamura T. Dolenc I. Cejka Z. Nagy I. DeMot R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the subunits take up random positions in their respective α or β rings or whether the subunits segregate into four homoligomeric rings. Nevertheless, coexpression of the genes for one of the α-type and one of the β-type subunits inEscherichia coli leads to the production of enzymatically functional proteasomes. Here we have employed these recombinant proteasomes in kinetics and biophysical studies to discern the mechanisms of four different chemical classes of inhibitors. These inhibitors include peptidyl aldehydes, peptidyl boronic acids, peptidyl vinyl sulfones, and the natural product,clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. The data suggest that a common mechanistic element for all of the inhibitors is their reaction with the proposed catalytic nucleophile, Oγ of Thr1 on the β-subunit. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone was prepared using the method of Uno et al. (11Uno H. Baldwin J.E. Russell A.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 2139-2140Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The structure of the synthesized material was confirmed by proton magnetic resonance spectrometry and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The purity of the material was assessed at >95% by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DFLB,N-dansyl-l-phenylalanine-l-leucine-boronic acid; MNLB,N-(4-morpholine)carbonyl-β-(1-naphthyl)-l-alanine-l-leucine boronic acid; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; TBTU, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium tetrafluoroborate; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; AMC, 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin; LC/MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. N-(4-Morpholine)carbonyl-β-(1-naphthyl)-l-alanine-l-leucine boronic acid (MNLB) was prepared by coupling (1R)-(S)-pinanediol 1-ammonium trifluoroacetate-3-methylbutane-1-boronate (12Shenvi A.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1286-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) toN-boc-β-(1-naphthyl)-l-alanine using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in anhydrousN,N-dimethylformamide. Removal of thet-butoxycarbonyl protecting group with HCl/1,4-dioxane, coupling of the primary amine with 4-morpholinecarbonyl chloride, and final removal of the pinanediol protecting group using 2-methylpropaneboronic acid afforded MNLB.N-Dansyl-l-phenylalanine-l-leucine boronic acid (DFLB) was prepared in a similar manner by coupling (1R)-(S)-pinanediol 1-ammonium trifluoroacetate 3-methylbutane-1-boronate to dansyl-l-phenylalanine using TBTU in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in anhydrousN,N-dimethylformamide followed by the deprotection of pinanediol using 2-methylpropaneboronic acid. The tripeptide aldehyde, Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-H was prepared by conventional methods, coupling the Weinreb amide of l-phenylalanine to the commercially available protected dipeptide Z-Leu-Leu-OH followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. Condensation of the anion of diethyl methylsulfonylmethylphosphonate generated with sodium hydride in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran andN-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-l-leucine-l-leucine-l-leucinal yielded the trans-α,β-ethylenic-methylsulfone ofN-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-l-leucine-l-leucine-l-leucinal (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-(CH)2SO2Me). 1 μg ofRhodococcus proteasome was incubated with 10 μm Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC in 2 ml of 20 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 37 °C, in a 3-ml fluorescence cuvette, and the cuvette placed in the jacketed cell holder of a Hitachi F-2000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, fitted with a magnetic stirring device to allow continuous stirring. The progress curves for hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC were measured by monitoring the production of AMC (λem = 440 nm, λex = 380 nm), and the enzyme activity was determined by a linear fit of the data, fluorescence (F) versus time (t). When the hydrolysis of substrate reached steady state, inhibitor was added at an appropriate concentration, and the fluorescence progress curve monitored. The fluorescenceversus time data were collected and processed using LAB CALC (Galactic) software. k obs values were determined by a non-linear least-squares fit of the data to the equation for time-dependent or slow binding inhibition (13Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar), Fluorescence=vst+[(vo−vs)/kobs][1−exp(−kobst)]Equation 1 where v o is the initial velocity which slowly decays to the final steady state velocity, v s, with a first-order rate constant, k obs. K i values for reversible inhibitors were calculated using the expression for competitive inhibition, Kiapp=[I]/(vo/vi−1)Equation 2 K i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor with the enzyme, [I] is the inhibitor concentration,v o is the rate of substrate hydrolysis by the enzyme, v i is the steady-state inhibited hydrolysis rate. In all cases, [S] ≪ K m, so thatKi app ≈ K i . 1.5 μg of Rhodococcus proteasome (β1α1)14 in 150 μl of 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, with a range of concentrations of the inhibitor, Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-H. Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC at 10 μm was added (in 3 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide), and the rate of substrate hydrolysis measured, as outlined previously. Microfluorescence cuvettes were used to cater for the small volumes used in this assay. A plot ofv i /v o versus [I] was fit to the equation for tight binding enzyme inhibition (14Greco W.R. Hakala M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12104-12109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vi/vo=(1/2[E])(([E]−[I]−Ki)+(([I]+Ki−[E])2+4Ki[E])1/2)Equation 3 where v o = substrate hydrolysis rate by enzyme, v i = substrate hydrolysis rate in the presence of inhibitor, [I] = inhibitor concentration, [E] = active site concentration, K i = dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Rhodococcus(β1α1)14 proteasome was concentrated using Centricon filters (M rcutoff = 10,000 Da) to a final protein concentration of 6.37 mg/ml (as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay). The stock enzyme was diluted 1:100 in 400 μl of 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6 (25.5 μg of proteasome particles). Dansyl-Phe-Leu-B(OH)2 was titrated into the enzyme solution (0.5-μl aliquots of 100 or 400 μm solutions) and the fluorescence was monitored on a Hitachi model F4500 at the peak fluorescence for the bound probe at 536 nm (λex = 329 nm) after each addition. The fluorescence at 536 nm was plotted against [DFLB]. The active site titrations with MNLB were performed in a similar manner, except that the fluorescence was monitored at 337 nm (λex = 293 nm). Approximately 375 μg/ml (β1α1)14 and (β2α2)14 in 20 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, were incubated with 40 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone for 30 min at 37 °C. Control enzyme samples were incubated with an equivalent volume of acetonitrile. Residual peptidase activity was determined to ensure complete modification of the proteasome active sites. β-Lactone modified and unmodified Rhodococcus(β2α2)14 proteasome (0.35 mg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was incubated with 50 μmZ-Leu-Leu-Leu-(CH)2SO2R for 10 min at 25 °C. Residual proteasome activity was measured to ensure complete modification. Control samples were incubated with equivalent volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. The α- and β-subunits of (β1α1)14and (β2α2)14 were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a 6 × 150-mm Shodex RSpak D4–613 column run on a Waters (Millipore Inc., Millford, MA) HPLC system. The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with 80% 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, 20% 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile at 40 °C. Following injection of 50 μg of total protein in a 100-μl volume, elution of the subunits was achieved, using a 1%/min linear gradient (20–50%) of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The elution of the subunits was monitored with an in-line UV absorbance detector at 214 nm, and the individual subunits collected manually in final volumes of approximately 1.5 ml. HPLC fractions collected as described (typically 20–25 μg of protein in 1.5 ml of acetonitrile/water) were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. 2 μl of 10% (w/v) Lubrol PX detergent (Calbiochem) was added prior to the evaporation to prevent adsorption of the polypeptide to the walls of the vessel. The dried samples were reconstituted with 100 μl of 1% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate. Trypsin (0.2 μg) was added to the polypeptide solution and digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. 10 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction following this 15–20-h incubation. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the resulting peptide digests was performed using a 2 × 150-mm Delta-Pak C-18 300 Å, 5 μm column, at 40 °C in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Elution was achieved with a 1%/min linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 470A sequencer with a Model 120A analyzer, using standard manufacturer's programming and chemicals. The molecular weights of the individual Rhodococcus subunits were determined by using a combination of liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The subunits were separated by HPLC and then introduced by loop injection into a VG 30–250 quadropole mass spectrometer (Micromass Inc., Altrincham, United Kingdom) and ionized by electrospray. The mass analyzer was scanned over the m/z range of 600–1,600 at a rate of 10 s/scan, and the data transformed automatically using the manufacturer's standard LAB-BASETM protocol. The molecular masses of the subunits were determined from the mass spectra. Incubation of the recombinantRhodococcus proteasomes (β1α1)14 and (β2α2)14, withclasto-lactacystin β-lactone, resulted in a time dependent loss in the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Try-AMC. As is readily apparent from the progress curve in Fig.1 panel A, the inactivation ofRhodococcus proteasome by β-lactone shows complex kinetics. The inactivation is partial and at longer times the progress curve bends upward indicating reactivation of inactive enzyme. As shown previously, the β-lactone hydrolyses to the inactive dihydroxy acid with a t½ of approximately 13 min under the assay conditions (15Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This would explain the partial nature of the inhibition in this experiment and in fact complete inhibition can be obtained with higher lactone concentrations (data not shown). The second phenomenon, reactivation of enzyme, is presumably due to hydrolysis of the covalent acyl-enzyme formed between the lactone and the active site nucleophile (see below). This reactivation phenomenon is also observed with the lactone modified rabbit skeletal muscle proteasome and it is a relatively slow process with at½ of approximately 20 h at pH 8 and 37 °C. 2L. R. Dick, unpublished observations. Fig. 1, panel B, shows the β-lactone concentration dependence of the apparent first-order rate constant for inactivation. Up to a β-lactone concentration of 10 μm, the rate of inactivation increased in proportion to lactone concentration giving no indication of saturable binding. k inact/[I] was estimated to be 1,700 m−1 s−1for both types of recombinant proteasomes. This rate of inactivation is approximately 10 times slower than that obtained for the chymotrypsin-like activity of rabbit psoas muscle 20 S proteasome-PA28 complex, under similar assay conditions. To probe the mechanism of inhibition by β-lactone, modified and unmodified Rhodococcus proteasome were subjected to LC/MS. Table I shows the masses of the individual subunits, α1, β1, α2, and β2 as determined using LC/MS and compares them with calculated values. The measured masses are identical to the calculated values within experimental error. Table I also shows the mass of control and β-lactone modified α- and β-subunits from both (β1α1)14 and (β2α2)14. The difference in the masses of the modified and unmodified β-subunits were 211 ± 7 atomic mass units for β1 and 215 ± 8 atomic mass units for the β2-subunit. These values are identical, within experimental error, to the mass increment of 213 that would result from a single site modification with β-lactone,i.e. one molecule of β-lactone reacts per β-subunit. No change in the mass of either α-subunit was observed, suggesting no modification of the α-subunits occurs.Table IMass spectral analysis of recombinant Rhodococcus proteasomes before and after modification with clasto-lactacystin β-lactoneSubunitMassCalculated1-aThe calculation was based on the amino acid sequences from Tamura et al.

Rhodococcus (β1α1)14proteasome was reacted with varying amounts of β-lactone and the residual peptidase activity was determined. Aliquots of the same samples were subjected to LC/MS to estimate the percentage modification of the β-subunits. Fig. 2 shows the percentage residual activity and the percentage of active sites modified as functions of the [β-lactone]. Residual activity and fractional modification mirror one another, suggesting a simple correlation between the number of β-subunits modified and loss of activity. Both β-lactone-modified and unmodified (β1α1)14 proteasome were subjected to reverse phase HPLC to separate the subunits and these individual subunits were subjected to digestion with trypsin. The resulting digestion products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C-18 column (Fig. 3). The peptide maps of the α-subunits from the modified and unmodified samples were identical (data not shown). In the tryptic peptide map of the unmodified β-subunit, there is a peak at a retention time (R t ) of 34.5 min. This peak was collected manually and subjected to mass spectrometry. The peptide was identified from its mass as the N-terminal tryptic fragment of the Rhodococcusβ-subunit, residues Thr1 through Arg19. The N-terminal tryptic fragment shifts to the longer retention time of 37.3 min post-treatment with β-lactone. These results suggested that the β-lactone modification of the β-subunit occurred in the N-terminal region of the polypeptide. Modified and unmodified Rhodococcus proteasomes (β1α1)14 and (β2α2)14 were then separated into their individual subunits by reverse-phase HPLC. The individual subunits were collected and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The results of four cycles of automated Edman degradation are shown in Table II. Both α-subunits, modified and unmodified, yielded similar quantities of the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative of Thr, 3The sequence of the Rhodococcusα-subunit published in Tamura et al.

Our sequence and LC/MS results are consistent with this. after the first cycle of Edman degradation, followed by the PTH-derivatives of Met, Pro, and Tyr. In the case of the β-subunits, however, the first cycle of Edman degradation of the modified β-subunit did not produce an identifiable PTH-derivative, whereas the unmodified β-subunit yielded the expected derivative of Thr. Further cycles yielded similar quantities of Thr (2nd cycle), Ile (3rd cycle), and Val (4th cycle) for both the modified and unmodified β-subunits. These results suggested that Thr1 had been modified by clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, thereby preventing it from forming an identifiable derivative. That the recoveries of the PTH-derivative in subsequent cycles were similar to controls further suggests that the Oγ residue of Thr1 was the site of modification. This is because the free α-amino group is required for progression of the Edman degradation.Table IIN-terminal sequencing of recombinant Rhodococcus proteasome α and β subunits before and after modification with clasto-lactacystin β-lactoneSubunit1st cycle2nd cycle3rd cycle4th cyclepmol found (AA residue)β115111612(control)β12121414(modified)(Thr)(Thr)(Ile)(Val)α213158—(control)α2109811(modified)(Thr)(Met)(Pro)(Tyr)β29887(control)β228109(modified)(Thr)(Thr)(Ile)(Val)The α and β subunits of control and β-lactone modified recombinant Rhodococcus proteasomes were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and individually subjected to four cycles of automated Edman degradation.

Quantitation of the PTH-derivatives appearing at each cycle was based on external standards (see “Experimental Procedures”). The N-terminal threonine of the β-subunit has also been identified as the catalytic nucleophile in the Thermoplasma proteasome and in the β-subunit, Subunit X, of eukaryotic proteasomes which are treated with β-lactone (17Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Seemüller and co-workers (7Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) used site-directed mutagenesis techniques to show that deletion or mutation of the N-terminal threonine of the β-subunit resulted in proteasomes that folded correctly but were completely inactive. One exception was the mutation of Thr1 → Ser, suggesting that the Thr1 functions in a manner analogous to active site serines in serine proteases (18Weber P.C. Lee S.-L. Lewandowski F.A. Schadt M.C. Chang C.-H. Kettner C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3750-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Lactacystin and the related β-lactone inactivates multiple eukaryotic proteasome hydrolyzing activities, chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing, but with different rates of inactivation. This observation supports the theory that the three activities arise from different active sites. Fenteany and co-workers (17Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) employed [3H]lactacystin to modify eukaryotic proteasomes and isolate the modified subunits by reverse-phase HPLC. One of the β-subunits was rapidly modified, and upon digestion with trypsin, two peptides within this subunit were found to be labeled with radioactivity. One of these peptides was identified as the N-terminal tryptic peptide, the Thr1 being the modified residue. It is assumed that this modification is the one that inactivates the enzyme, by analogy to Thermoplasma studies which suggest that this is the catalytic nucleophile (7Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Additionally, the structures of thermoplasma and yeast proteasome have been solved with bound β-lactone (19Ditzel L. Stock D. Löwe J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 239-247Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The structures show close proximity of the β-lactone to the N-terminal threonines of all the T. acidophilium β-subunits and to the two copies of the β5 subunits of the yeast enzyme. It was proposed that the carbonyl C4 of β-lactone and the Oγ of Thr1 form a covalent ester linkage. Our results support these conclusions since modification of this residue alone in Rhodococcus proteasome is necessary and sufficient to completely inactivate the enzyme. An active site titration of theRhodococcus recombinant proteasome was performed using the reversible peptide aldehyde inhibitor, Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-H. Fig.4 shows the fractional residual activity of the proteasome after incubation with varying amounts of Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-H. The data were fit to the equation for tight binding inhibition (see “Experimental Procedures”), using theK i value of 4.0 nm(β1α1)14 and 2.8 nm(β2α2)14 (determined independently). This fit gave an active site concentration of 26.7 pmol/1.5 μg of Rhodococcus proteasome (β1α1)14 and 26.1 pmol/1.5 μg of Rhodococcus proteasome (β2α2)14. Assuming there are equimolar amounts α- and β-subunits, from our LC/MS data we calculate that 47% of the proteasome mass is made up of β-subunits or each β-subunit corresponds to 28.2 pmol. Therefore, we have 0.97 and 0.95 active sites per β-subunit for the (β1α1)14 and (β2α2)14 proteasomes, respectively. Within the limits of experimental error, these values are in good agreement with the expected active site concentration of 1 per β-subunit. This also suggests that the enzyme is ≅100% active. The crystal structures of both thermoplasma and yeast proteasomes with bound peptidyl aldehydes have been solved (19Ditzel L. Stock D. Löwe J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 239-247Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). All of theThermoplasma β-subunits were shown to have inhibitor bound, whereas only the six β-subunits of the yeast proteasome, that is those containing an N-terminal threonine active site (β1, β2, and β5) were found to have inhibitor bound. In both cases the aldehyde function of the inhibitor was in close proximity to Thr1, and it was proposed that a reversible covalent hemiacetal forms between the Oγ of Thr1 and the aldehyde function. The quantum yield of the dansyl fluorophore is sensitive to its environment. In aqueous solution, its fluorescence intensity is strongly quenched, due to interactions with the environment causing decay of the excited state by non-radiative processes. However, in a non-polar or rigid environment, the fluorescence intensity of these molecules is enhanced (21Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980Google Scholar). We employed this property of the dansyl moiety in the proteasome inhibitor, dansyl-Phe-Leu-B(OH)2(Fig. 5) to perform a direct titration of the active sites in the recombinant Rhodococcus proteasome (β1α1)14. DFLB is a potent time-dependent inhibitor of the Rhodococcusproteasome (k obs/[I] = 56,000m−1 s−1) having aK i of <1 nm. Free in aqueous solution, the fluorescence of the inhibitor's dansyl moiety is highly quenched. However, upon binding to the active site of the enzyme, the fluorescence of the inhibitor is enhanced approximately 15-fold. Fig. 5shows the fluorescence intensity measured at 536 nm (exλ= 329 nm) versus the amount of DFLB added to 25.5 μg ofRhodococcus proteasome particles. A breakpoint is observed after the addition of 0.47 nmol of DFLB, so that addition of more DFLB results in a shallower slope for the increase in fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity up to the addition of 0.47 nmol of DFLB is due to inhibitor binding to the active sites of the proteasome. Beyond this point, the fluorescence increased in direct proportion to the free inhibitor. The intersection of the two slopes occurs at a DFLB concentration of 0.45 nmol. The data therefore suggest that there are 0.45 nmol of active sites per 25.5 μg of proteasome particle or 0.94 active sites per β-subunit. Within the limits of experimental error, the estimation of 0.94 active sites is close to the expected value of one active site per β-subunit. The experiment was repeated using thyroglobulin, a protein of similar molecular mass as the proteasome, but nonspecific for the inhibitor. No inhibitor binding was observed and the fluorescence intensity was proportional to the fluorescence of the free inhibitor. When the Rhodococcus proteasome was modified with β-lactone to an extent to inhibit all of the active sites, and then titrated with DFLB, no inhibitor binding was observed. In contrast to DFLB, the naphthyl fluorescence of another peptidyl boronic acid inhibitor of the proteasome, MNLB (Fig.6, panel A), is completely quenched upon binding to a Rhodococcus active site. The reason for this quenching is unclear. Presumably, the naphthyl moeity in the MNLB interacts with some “quencher” in theRhodococcus proteasome. There are no tryptophan residues present so the quencher is likely to be tyrosine or some ionic species (21Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980Google Scholar). The rate of association of MNLB with the Rhodococcusproteasome was determined to be 12,800 m−1s−1, measured directly from a fit of the data to the integrated rate expression for a second-order reaction (22Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. John Wiley and Sons, Chilchester, United Kingdom1975Google Scholar) (Fig. 6,panel B). This agrees with the k onestimated from the time-dependent inhibition data (k obs/[I] = 13,000m−1 s−1). Using an excess of a non-fluorescent potent competing inhibitor, the rate of fluorescence increase was monitored as MNLB dissociated from the active site of the proteasome and was replaced by this non-fluorescent inhibitor. This rate of dissociation, k off, was estimated to be 5.5 × 10−5m−1s−1 (t½ = 3.5 h). The dissociation constant calculated using these parameters is 4.3 nm, and agrees with the K i of 5.8 nm estimated from an enzyme inhibition assay (data not shown). Since there are no tryptophan residues in the Rhodococcusproteasome, observation of the naphthyl fluorescence was readily achieved (λex = 293 nm; λem = 337 nm). Incubation of 21.3 μg of Rhodococcus proteasome particles with increasing amounts of MNLB resulted in quenching of the naphthyl fluorescence until all the active sites were filled. Further additions of MNLB resulted in a fluorescence increase in proportion to the unbound inhibitor. The “breakpoint” was observed at 0.4 nmol of MNLB which is equivalent to 1.0 active sites per β-subunit. Again, when the proteasome's active sites were blocked with β-lactone, no quenching of the MNLB was observed upon titration with the inhibitor (Fig. 6, panel A). Complete inhibition of the proteasome with β-lactone completely abrogates binding of boronic acid-derived inhibitors, suggesting that both inhibitors bind to the same site. Boronic acid-derived inhibitors have been shown to covalently react with the Oγ residue of the active site serine of thrombin to yield a tetrahedral boron adduct mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate in substrate hydrolysis (18Weber P.C. Lee S.-L. Lewandowski F.A. Schadt M.C. Chang C.-H. Kettner C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3750-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By analogy we propose that boronic acid-based inhibitors interact in a similar manner with the Oγ on the N-terminal Thr of the β-subunit of the proteasome. By comparison to tripeptide aldehyde and peptidyl boronic acid inhibitors, β-lactone is a relatively small molecule. Abrogation of peptidyl inhibitor binding to the proteasomal active sites is therefore more likely to occur close to the active site rather that by disrupting interactions of the peptide portion of the inhibitor at the S1, S2, and S3 specificity pockets. Peptidyl vinyl sulfones based on substrate selectivity have been synthesized by Palmer and co-workers and are potent inhibitors of disease-associated cysteine proteases such as cathepsins B, L, and S (23Palmer J.T. Rasnick D. Klaus J.L. Brömme D. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This class of inhibitors have also been shown to be irreversible, active site-directed inhibitors of the proteasome (24Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A.

A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We found that the peptidyl vinyl sulfone, Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-(CH)2SO2Me inhibits theRhodococcus proteasome (k inact/K i of 150m−1 s−1). We reacted unmodified and β-lactone modified Rhodococcusproteasome with Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-(CH)2SO2Me and separated the α- and β-subunits by HPLC, as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 7). The β-subunit of peptidyl vinyl sulfone-modified enzyme has a longer retention time, suggesting the inhibitor covalently reacts with this subunit. Prior modification of the proteasome with β-lactone prevented the retention time shift indicating that β-lactone blocks reaction of the vinyl sulfone moiety of the inhibitor. No shift in the retention time of the α-subunits was observed, suggesting that it is not modified by the inhibitor. From peptide mapping of the tryptic digest of the vinyl sulfone-modified β-subunits, we found that the N-terminal tryptic peptide of the β-subunit was the modified peptide (data not shown). These two observations additionally suggest that the peptidyl vinyl sulfone may inhibit the proteasome by modification of the Oγ of Thr1. Scheme 1 summarizes our working hypothesis for the mechanisms of the inhibitors studied.Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, peptidyl mimetic aldehydes, boronic acids, and vinyl sulfones may all involve a common element for inhibition of the proteasome, that is reacting with the catalytic nucleophile, the Oγ on Thr1.

Either one of the isoforms is indispensable for the growth of yeast cells at higher temperatures (3Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.A. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of purified HSP90 indicates that HSP90α predominantly exists as a homodimer and HSP90β exists mainly as a monomer (4Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Miyata Y. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10099-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimer formation is mediated by the interaction at the C-terminal 191 amino acids in which the C-terminal region (Met628-Asp732) of one subunit associates with the adjacent region (Val542-Tyr627) of the other subunit (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions at 561–685 between α and β isoforms are responsible for the impeded dimerization of HSP90β (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).HSP90 is believed to have a chaperone-like activity for particular molecules that are involved in signal transduction, such as steroid receptors (6Joab I.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSP90 specifically binds to these proteins; and, in most cases, this interaction is essential for the function of the proteins (9Rose D.W. Wettenhall R.E.H. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6583-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Denis M. Gustafsson J.-Å.

However, a variety of evidence, i.e.the abundance of HSP90 in cells even under nonstressed conditions, the conserved amino acid sequences from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells (13Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5177-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the indispensability in yeast (3Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.A. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that HSP90 is involved in more fundamental functions of cells. In fact, several studies have recently shown that HSP90 functions as a general chaperone. That is, it interacts with various proteins less specifically and modulates their conformation. For instance, the refolding of citrate synthase is significantly enhanced by the co-presence of HSP90 (14Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The spontaneous refolding of denatured dihydrofolate reductase and irreversible denaturation of firefly luciferase are prevented by association with HSP90 (15Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The latter study further demonstrated that the chaperone-like activity of HSP90 is closely related to the oligomerization of HSP90 at temperatures higher than 46 °C. Although HSP90 possesses an ATPase activity (16Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this activity does not appear to be needed for the oligomerization of HSP90.Epitope mapping is a useful approach for investigating the structures of proteins of interest. Several anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been produced to date (6Joab I. Radanyi C. Renoir M. Buchou T. Catelli M.-G. Binart N. Mester J. Baulieu E.-E. Nature. 1984; 308: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 10Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Riehl R.M. Sullivan W.P. Vroman B.J. Bauer V.J. Pearson G.R. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6586-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the epitopes of several anti-HSP90 mAbs have been described (18Cadepond F. Jibard N. Binart N. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), systematic assignment of the immunogenicity of HSP90 has not been conducted. In this study, we developed a library of the mAbs that specifically recognize human HSP90 and with them demonstrated that the major immunogenic domains are located in two restricted regions. The domain structures of HSP90 were further analyzed by limited proteolysis. We finally proposed three domain structures of HSP90. In addition, this is the first report of developing isoform-specific mAbs against HSP90.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we developed 33 anti-HSP90 mAbs, including α and β isoform-specific ones (Table I), and determined the epitopes recognized by them (Table II and Figs. 3 and9). We confirmed that all mAbs specifically recognized HSP90 endogenously expressed in human salivary gland adenocarcinoma (22Kyakumoto S. Kurokawa R. Hoshino M. Ota M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and T47D cells, and we found that most of the mAbs cross-reacted with rat, mouse, and rabbit HSP90s. 2T. Nemoto, T. Matsusaka, and R. Roi, unpublished observations. This is not surprising in view of the evolutional conservation of HSP90. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the development of isoform-specific mAbs against HSP90. Since the epitopes for the mAbs have been characterized, these antibodies should be valuable to investigate the structure and function of HSP90 isoforms.We found that two regions (Regions I and II) confer most immunogenicity of HSP90. Only three mAbs (K3725A, K41016, and K41218) developed in this study and AC88 recognized respective regions different from Regions I and II (Table II). Region I was defined to amino acids 227–310 by ELISA with the octapeptide library. Notably, there is a charged region (223–289) containing six amino acid substitutions of opposite net charges at 241, 242, 247, 257, 271, and 273 (Fig. 9). These characteristics strongly suggest that amino acid substitutions are permissive only when charged properties are maintained. Among anti-HSP90 mAbs reported previously, BF4 (6Joab I. Radanyi C. Renoir M. Buchou T. Catelli M.-G. Binart N. Mester J. Baulieu E.-E. Nature. 1984; 308: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) also recognizes the charged region (18Cadepond F. Jibard N. Binart N. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This charged region is proposed to form an α-helical structure that the polyglutamic acids of which are stabilized by ionic interactions with lysines (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In HSP90, there is another charged region at amino acids 534–585 (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting its exposure to the outer surface. However, only K3725A recognized this region among all mAbs developed (Table II), indicating that this region does not possess a strong immunogenicity.The existence of three immunogenic sites (Sites Ia–Ic) in Region I was demonstrated. The characteristics of Sites Ia and Ib are substantially different from those of Site Ic: the amino acid sequences of the former two are highly charged, and substituted between HSP90α and HSP90β; and hence, the mAbs recognizing these two sites are specific or highly preferential to HSP90α. We could not define the epitopes of K3701 and K3716, mAbs recognizing Region I and specific or highly preferential to HSP90β. However, it seems reasonable to postulate that their recognition sites are also located at Site Ia or Ib. In contrast, the amino acid sequence of Site Ic is less charged and is completely conserved between the isoforms. Hence, the mAbs bound to Site Ic equivalently recognize the two isoforms (Fig. 3). Prediction of the secondary structures indicates that the charged region (223–289) carrying Sites Ia and Ib, and the region of amino acids 321–345 form α-helical structures and that their intermediate region (290–320) carrying Site Ic (291–304) may form a β-turn or coiled structure (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The strong immunogenicity of the α-helical structure composed of the charged amino acids and the adjacent β-turn or coiled structure strongly suggests the protruding of these conformations into the aqueous environment.We found a second immunogenic site (Region II) at the C-terminal region. The C-terminal region (amino acids 699–732) has hydrophilic characteristics although the degree is less than that of Region I (Fig.9). This difference is mainly due to the absence of basic amino acids except Arg727 and the presence of several hydrophobic amino acids. Nevertheless, it is important to note that acidity of the five amino acid residues at 702, 706, 707, 714, and 723 is conserved in the replacements between the isoforms. Considering the isoform-specific properties of the mAbs recognizing Region II, the highly substituted amino acids at 702–716 are the most probable recognition site of the mAbs. In fact, we selected a heptapeptide with an affinity for an HSP90α-specific mAb (K41007). The sequence (WVADTSY) was similar to amino acids 705–709 of HSP90α (Fig. 9). Thus, Region II is ascribed to amino acids 702–716 (Fig. 9). HtpG, an E. coli homolog of mammalian HSP90, has 37% amino acid homology with human HSP90α (13Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5177-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Region I, except Site Ic, and Region II are highly substituted between HSP90 isoforms and are even deleted in HtpG. These facts strongly suggest that these regions are dispensable for the function of HSP90.We previously reported that bacterially expressed HSP90α1–47/290–732, i.e. HSP90α with Sites Ia and Ib deleted tends to form a self-oligomer and is able to form a heteromeric complex with the estrogen receptor (24Nemoto T. Matsuzaka T. Ota M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Horigome T. Inano K. Steroid Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1995; 14: 59-67Google Scholar). In contrast, HSP90α possessing Sites Ia and Ib (HSP90α1–312) neither forms an oligomer nor interacts with the receptor (24Nemoto T. Matsuzaka T. Ota M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Horigome T. Inano K. Steroid Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1995; 14: 59-67Google Scholar). These results indicate that HSP90α, with the major part of Region I deleted, acquired enhanced activity for associating with the estrogen receptor as well as its self-oligomerizing activity. A recent study indicates that the oligomerization of HSP90 is closely related to its chaperone activity (15Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspect that one possible role of Region I is to suppress the oligomerization activity of HSP90 under nonstressed conditions.We further analyzed the domain structures of HSP90 by means of limited proteolysis. The N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that cleavages occurred only at a few susceptible sites at Arg400-Glu401 and Lys615-Ala616/Arg620-Asp621at lower protease concentrations. The former site had not been recognized before because our previous study focused on the C-terminal dimer-forming region (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We found that, even at higher enzyme concentrations, trypsin attacted several particular sites. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that Region I was localized in the protease-sensitive region.Based on the present results, we finally propose a model for the domain structures of HSP90 (Fig. 8). HSP90 is composed of three domains, Domains A–C, corresponding to amino acids 1–400, 401–615, and 621–732, respectively. Further, the division of each domain into two subdomains is suspected from the differences in proteolytic susceptibility and immunogenicity. The subdomain structures of Domains B and C are also suggested from our previous study, demonstrating that chymotrypsin cleaves at Leu541-Val542, Tyr627-Met628, and Met628-Ala629 bonds (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The deletion in HtpG corresponding to amino acids 696–732 further suggests the structural and functional differences between amino acids 604–700 and 701–732. The characteristics of each region are as follows: subdomain A-I is protease-resistant; subdomain A-II is protease-sensitive, is abundant in charged amino acids, and carries the most immunogenic region of HSP90 (Region I), which may be exposed to the outer surface of the molecule; subdomain B-I is resistant to proteolysis; subdomain B-II interacts with subdomain C-I of another HSP90 subunit, and this interaction mediates the dimerization of HSP90; and subdomain C-II carries the second immunogenic region (Region II) and is not involved in dimer formation. Although the validity of this model, especially as to the subdomain structures, should be tested by functional and chemical studies, we believe that this provides an appropriate working model for investigating the structure and function of HSP90.

There are at least two HSP90 genes, and two HSP90 isoform proteins, α and β, are expressed in the cytosolic compartment (1Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, the amino acid sequence of Site Ic is less charged and is completely conserved between the isoforms. Hence, the mAbs bound to Site Ic equivalently recognize the two isoforms (Fig. 3). Prediction of the secondary structures indicates that the charged region (223–289) carrying Sites Ia and Ib, and the region of amino acids 321–345 form α-helical structures and that their intermediate region (290–320) carrying Site Ic (291–304) may form a β-turn or coiled structure (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The strong immunogenicity of the α-helical structure composed of the charged amino acids and the adjacent β-turn or coiled structure strongly suggests the protruding of these conformations into the aqueous environment.We found a second immunogenic site (Region II) at the C-terminal region. The C-terminal region (amino acids 699–732) has hydrophilic characteristics although the degree is less than that of Region I (Fig.9). This difference is mainly due to the absence of basic amino acids except Arg727 and the presence of several hydrophobic amino acids. Nevertheless, it is important to note that acidity of the five amino acid residues at 702, 706, 707, 714, and 723 is conserved in the replacements between the isoforms. Considering the isoform-specific properties of the mAbs recognizing Region II, the highly substituted amino acids at 702–716 are the most probable recognition site of the mAbs. In fact, we selected a heptapeptide with an affinity for an HSP90α-specific mAb (K41007). The sequence (WVADTSY) was similar to amino acids 705–709 of HSP90α (Fig. 9). Thus, Region II is ascribed to amino acids 702–716 (Fig. 9). HtpG, an E. coli homolog of mammalian HSP90, has 37% amino acid homology with human HSP90α (13Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5177-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Region I, except Site Ic, and Region II are highly substituted between HSP90 isoforms and are even deleted in HtpG. These facts strongly suggest that these regions are dispensable for the function of HSP90.We previously reported that bacterially expressed HSP90α1–47/290–732, i.e. HSP90α with Sites Ia and Ib deleted tends to form a self-oligomer and is able to form a heteromeric complex with the estrogen receptor (24Nemoto T. Matsuzaka T. Ota M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Horigome T. Inano K. Steroid Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1995; 14: 59-67Google Scholar). In contrast, HSP90α possessing Sites Ia and Ib (HSP90α1–312) neither forms an oligomer nor interacts with the receptor (24Nemoto T. Matsuzaka T. Ota M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Horigome T. Inano K. Steroid Biochem. (Life Sci. Adv.). 1995; 14: 59-67Google Scholar). These results indicate that HSP90α, with the major part of Region I deleted, acquired enhanced activity for associating with the estrogen receptor as well as its self-oligomerizing activity. A recent study indicates that the oligomerization of HSP90 is closely related to its chaperone activity (15Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspect that one possible role of Region I is to suppress the oligomerization activity of HSP90 under nonstressed conditions.We further analyzed the domain structures of HSP90 by means of limited proteolysis. The N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that cleavages occurred only at a few susceptible sites at Arg400-Glu401 and Lys615-Ala616/Arg620-Asp621at lower protease concentrations. The former site had not been recognized before because our previous study focused on the C-terminal dimer-forming region (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We found that, even at higher enzyme concentrations, trypsin attacted several particular sites. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that Region I was localized in the protease-sensitive region.Based on the present results, we finally propose a model for the domain structures of HSP90 (Fig. 8). HSP90 is composed of three domains, Domains A–C, corresponding to amino acids 1–400, 401–615, and 621–732, respectively. Further, the division of each domain into two subdomains is suspected from the differences in proteolytic susceptibility and immunogenicity. The subdomain structures of Domains B and C are also suggested from our previous study, demonstrating that chymotrypsin cleaves at Leu541-Val542, Tyr627-Met628, and Met628-Ala629 bonds (5Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The deletion in HtpG corresponding to amino acids 696–732 further suggests the structural and functional differences between amino acids 604–700 and 701–732. The characteristics of each region are as follows: subdomain A-I is protease-resistant; subdomain A-II is protease-sensitive, is abundant in charged amino acids, and carries the most immunogenic region of HSP90 (Region I), which may be exposed to the outer surface of the molecule; subdomain B-I is resistant to proteolysis; subdomain B-II interacts with subdomain C-I of another HSP90 subunit, and this interaction mediates the dimerization of HSP90; and subdomain C-II carries the second immunogenic region (Region II) and is not involved in dimer formation. Although the validity of this model, especially as to the subdomain structures, should be tested by functional and chemical studies, we believe that this provides an appropriate working model for investigating the structure and function of HSP90. In this study, we developed 33 anti-HSP90 mAbs, including α and β isoform-specific ones (Table I), and determined the epitopes recognized by them (Table II and Figs. 3 and9). We confirmed that all mAbs specifically recognized HSP90 endogenously expressed in human salivary gland adenocarcinoma (22Kyakumoto S. Kurokawa R. Hoshino M. Ota M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and T47D cells, and we found that most of the mAbs cross-reacted with rat, mouse, and rabbit HSP90s. 2T. Nemoto, T. Matsusaka, and R. Roi, unpublished observations. This is not surprising in view of the evolutional conservation of HSP90. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the development of isoform-specific mAbs against HSP90. Since the epitopes for the mAbs have been characterized, these antibodies should be valuable to investigate the structure and function of HSP90 isoforms. We found that two regions (Regions I and II) confer most immunogenicity of HSP90. Only three mAbs (K3725A, K41016, and K41218) developed in this study and AC88 recognized respective regions different from Regions I and II (Table II). Region I was defined to amino acids 227–310 by ELISA with the octapeptide library. Notably, there is a charged region (223–289) containing six amino acid substitutions of opposite net charges at 241, 242, 247, 257, 271, and 273 (Fig. 9). These characteristics strongly suggest that amino acid substitutions are permissive only when charged properties are maintained. Among anti-HSP90 mAbs reported previously, BF4 (6Joab I. Radanyi C. Renoir M. Buchou T. Catelli M.-G. Binart N. Mester J. Baulieu E.-E. Nature. 1984; 308: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) also recognizes the charged region (18Cadepond F. Jibard N. Binart N. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This charged region is proposed to form an α-helical structure that the polyglutamic acids of which are stabilized by ionic interactions with lysines (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In HSP90, there is another charged region at amino acids 534–585 (23Binart N. Chambraud B. Levin J.M. Garnier J. Baulieu E.-E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting its exposure to the outer surface. However, only K3725A recognized this region among all mAbs developed (Table II), indicating that this region does not possess a strong immunogenicity. The existence of three immunogenic sites (Sites Ia–Ic) in Region I was demonstrated. The characteristics of Sites Ia and Ib are substantially different from those of Site Ic: the amino acid sequences of the former two are highly charged, and substituted between HSP90α and HSP90β; and hence, the mAbs recognizing these two sites are specific or highly preferential to HSP90α. We could not define the epitopes of K3701 and K3716, mAbs recognizing Region I and specific or highly preferential to HSP90β. However, it seems reasonable to postulate that their recognition sites are also located at Site Ia or Ib. In contrast, the amino acid sequence of Site Ic is less charged and is completely conserved between the isoforms. Hence, the mAbs bound to Site Ic equivalently recognize the two isoforms (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2031518757,"We present a strategy for simultaneous assessment of the relative contributions of anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation, pyruvate decarboxylation, and fatty acid oxidation to citrate formation in the perfused rat heart. This requires perfusing with a mix of13C-substrates and determining the 13C labeling pattern of a single metabolite, citrate, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mass isotopomer distributions of the oxaloacetate and acetyl moieties of citrate allow calculation of the flux ratios: (pyruvate carboxylation)/(pyruvate decarboxylation), (pyruvate carboxylation)/(citrate synthesis), (pyruvate decarboxylation)/(citrate synthesis) (pyruvate carboxylation)/(fatty acid oxidation), and (pyruvate decarboxylation)/(fatty acid oxidation). Calculations, based on precursor-product relationship, are independent of pool size. The utility of our method was demonstrated for hearts perfused under normoxia with [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) and [1-13C]octanoate under steady-state conditions. Under these conditions, effluent and tissue citrate were similarly enriched in all 13C mass isotopomers. The use of effluent citrate instead of tissue citrate allows probing substrate fluxes through the various reactions non-invasively in the intact heart. The methodology should also be applicable to hearts perfused with other 13C-substrates, such as 1-13C-labeled long chain fatty acid, and under various conditions, provided that assumptions on which equations are developed are valid.

The use of 13C-enriched labeled substrate(s) and measurements of 13C labeling of CAC intermediates or related metabolites by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) offers several advantages over classical 14C methods. Also, these two techniques are complementary. One advantage of GCMS over NMR is its sensitivity. Thus, the 13C labeling of the actual CAC intermediates can be determined. Investigations on the cardioprotective effects of pyruvate have emphasized the concerted regulation of pyruvate decarboxylation and fatty acid oxidation (14Chance E.M. Seeholzer S.H. Kobayashi K.

However, in these studies, the partitioning of pyruvate between carboxylation and decarboxylation could not be directly quantitated. Such measurements could help clarify the relative importance of these two pathways in the cardioprotective effect of pyruvate (23McVeigh J.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J.

In the present paper, we present a strategy for the direct and simultaneous assessment of the relative contributions of anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation, pyruvate decarboxylation, and fatty acid oxidation to citrate formation in the intact perfused rat heart. This is accomplished using a combination of 13C-substrates and requires determination of the 13C mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) of the acetyl and oxaloacetate (OAA) moieties of a single metabolite, effluent citrate, by GCMS. Part of this work was presented in abstract form (33Comte B. Jetté M. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-770Google Scholar, 34Vincent G. Comte B. Des Rosiers C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 269Google Scholar, 35Comte B Des Rosiers C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 268Google Scholar). The relative contributions of pathways feeding OAA and acetyl-CoA for citrate synthesis were determined in hearts perfused with a mix of13C-substrates under steady-state conditions. [U-13C3]Lactate and [U-13C3]pyruvate were supplied at physiological concentrations and in a ratio to clamp the redox state. Also a source of acetyl-CoA other than pyruvate, was provided, namely a 1-13C-labeled fatty acid, octanoate. Calculation of the various substrate flux ratios requires GCMS determination of the MIDs of (i) the acetyl and OAA moieties of citrate and of (ii) pyruvate. [1-13C]Octanoate and [U-13C3]pyruvate are metabolized to different citrate mass isotopomers. [U-13C3]Lactate, a M3 isotopomer, is converted to [U-13C3]pyruvate which is (i) decarboxylated to [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA (M2) by pyruvate dehydrogenase and/or (ii) carboxylated to [1,2,3-13C3]OAA (M3) by pyruvate carboxylase, or to [1,2,3-13C3]malate (M3) by NADP-linked malic enzyme. Because of the reversibility of the fumarase reaction, [2,3,4-13C3]OAA is also formed. [1-13C]Octanoate is β-oxidized to [1-13C]acetyl-CoA (M1). Through the citrate synthase reaction, [1-13C]- and [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA label citrate on carbon 5 (M1), and on carbons 4 + 5 (M2), respectively. Similarly, [1,2,3-13C3]- or [2,3,4-13C3]OAA label citrate on carbons 6 + 3 + 2 and 3 + 2 + 1, respectively. When there is negligible condensation between labeled acetyl-CoA and labeled OAA, citrate thus becomes enriched in M3, M2, and M1 isotopomers. Upon further metabolism in the CAC, these citrate isotopomers form a mixture of M2 and M1 positional isotopomers of OAA. Condensation between M1 and/or M2 acetyl-CoA and M3 OAA forms M4 and M5 citrate isotopomers, which upon further metabolism in the CAC form a mixture of M4, M3, M2, and M1 positional isotopomers of OAA. Theoretically, up to 64 possible citrate isotopomers can be formed, labeled in their acetyl (carbons 4 + 5) and/or OAA (carbons 1 + 2 + 3 + 6) moieties. In hearts perfused with [U-13C3]lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, and [1-13C]octanoate, this number is reduced to 48, because there is no formation of citrate isotopomers labeled in their acetyl moiety with only one 13C atom on carbon 4. The following notations are used in developing the equations: Metabolites: AC, acetyl-CoA; CIT, citrate; OAA, oxaloacetate; OCT, octanoate; PYRi and PYRe, intracellular and extracellular pyruvate; ACCIT, the acetyl moiety of citrate, equivalent to carbons 4 and 5 of citrate (C-4 + 5); OAACIT, the OAA moiety of citrate equivalent to C-1 + 2 + 3 + 6. Isotopomer specifications: OAAMi, mass isotopomer of a given metabolite, for example OAA, labeled with i atoms of 13C; MF, mol fraction in a given mass isotopomer (Mi) of a metabolite, calculated as MF (M i ) =A M i /(ΣA M i ) where A represents the peak area of each fragmentogram, determined by computer integration and corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes (6Des Rosiers C.

Briefly, we first assume, for simplicity, that carboxylation of M3 pyruvate is the only pathway forming M3 OAA. Then, we consider the possible formation of M3 OAA through the metabolism in the CAC of some citrate isotopomers. The balance of M3 isotopomers of OAA and adjacent metabolites yields Equation 1, (FCPYRi→OAA)=(OAAM3)/(PYRiM3)Equation 1 where FCPYRi→OAA is the fractional contribution of pyruvate to OAA via pyruvate carboxylation, and OAAM3 and PYRiM3 are the MF in M3 of intracellular OAA and pyruvate, respectively. Since for a given reaction, the sum of all FC terms equals 1, then (1 − FCPYRi→OAA) represents the OAA molecules coming from all other sources, namely from the CAC and from aspartate transamination. Note that FCPYRi→OAA represents the carboxylation of pyruvate derived from both exogenous and endogenous sources. The fractional contribution of extracellular pyruvate and/or lactate to tissue pyruvate (FCPYRe→PYRi) is obtained from Equation 2, (FCPYRe→PYRi)=(PYRiM3)/(PYReM3)Equation 2 where PYReM3 is the MF in M3 of the incoming pyruvate tracer. The contribution of unlabeled pyruvate arising from glucose or glycogen through glycolysis is (1 − FCPYRe→PYRi). Since M3 OAA is the only source of M3 citrate labeled in its OAA moiety (OAACIT), the balance of M3 isotopomers of OAA moiety of citrate and adjacent metabolites yields Equation 3, (FCOAA→CIT)=(OAAM3CIT)/(OAAM3)Equation 3 where FCOAA→CIT is the fractional contribution of OAA to citrate via citrate synthase, and OAAM3CIT is the MF in M3 of the OAA moiety of citrate. Multiplying Equation 1 by Equation 3 yields the fractional contribution of pyruvate to citrate via the carboxylation of pyruvate (FCPYRi→CIT(OAA)). The latter expression is equivalent to the flux ratio (pyruvate carboxylation)/(citrate synthesis), also named factor “y” (2Lee W.-N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13002-13004Google Scholar, 3Lee W.-N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25522-25526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Des Rosiers C. Di Donato L. Comte B. Laplante A.

The factor 4 in Equation 6 takes into account that octanoate is oxidized to 4 acetyl-CoA; only one of which is labeled. The sum of Equations 5 and 6 (FCPYRi→CIT + FCOCT→CIT) reflects the relative combined contributions of pyruvate decarboxylation and octanoate oxidation to the acetyl moiety of citrate; the contribution of other substrates (FCOS→AC(CIT)), such as endogenous fatty acids and/or leucine, is given by Equation 7. FCOS→AC(CIT)=[1−(FCPYRi→AC(CIT)+FCOCT→AC(CIT))]Equation 7 In developing Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, we assumed that carboxylation of M3 pyruvate was the only reaction forming M3 OAA molecules. Such assumptions are likely to prevail in hearts perfused with a low enrichment of [U-13C3]lactate and [U-13C3]pyruvate. However, in hearts perfused simultaneously with a mix of 13C-substrates, the probability of condensation between labeled acetyl-CoA and labeled OAA is increased. Some citrate molecules labeled in both their acetyl and OAA moieties could be metabolized to M3 OAA in the CAC. Therefore, to assess the validity of our initial assumption, we evaluated the proportion of the M3 OAA molecules formed through the recycling of some citrate isotopomers in the CAC and subsequently corrected the measured MF M3 of the OAA moiety of citrate (OAAM3CIT). This was done using Equation8 and requires estimating the (i) MPE of citrate isotopomer precursor of M3 OAA (OAAM3PR) and (ii) the13C dilution in the CAC (DF). Values for (i) MPE OAAM3PR and (ii) DF, obtained using Equations 9 and 10 (see below), are approximations. More precise estimation of these values would require extensive modeling of the metabolism of our mix of 13C-substrates in the CAC, OAAM3−CIT*=OAAM3CIT−(OAAM3PR×DF)Equation 8 where (i) OAAM3PR is the enrichment of citrate isotopomer precursor of M3 OAA and (ii) DF is the correction factor for the 13C dilution in the CAC. The enrichment of citrate isotopomer precursor of M3 OAA was estimated as follows. We identified which of the 48 possible citrate isotopomers are precursors (PR) of M3 OAA (OAAM3PR), assuming steady-state conditions. For example, there are four citrate isotopomers formed from the condensation of M2 acetyl-CoA and M1 OAA molecules: (A) [1,4,5-13C3]citrate; (B) [2,4,5-13C3]citrate; (C) [3,4,5-13C3]citrate; and (D) [4,5,6-13C3]citrate. Upon metabolism in the CAC, citrate isotopomers B and C form M3 OAA, whereas isotopomers A and D form M2 OAA. For simplicity, it is assumed that citrate isotopomers A to D are similarly enriched, although this is an approximation of the actual situation (see “Discussion” for details). Assessing the validity of this assumption requires more extensive modeling of the metabolism of our mix of 13C-substrates in the CAC. Then, the enrichment of citrate isotopomers B and C is estimated from ((ACM2CIT) × (OAAM1CIT) × 0.5) where ACM2CIT and OAAM1CIT are experimentally determined enrichments of the acetyl and OAA moieties of citrate, and the number 0.5 takes into account that only half of citrate isotopomers formed through the condensation of M2 acetyl-CoA and M1 OAA are metabolized to M3 OAA. This constitutes the first term of Equation 9. Note that for clarity, the superscript CIT was omitted. A similar reasoning was applied for each term of this equation. OAAM3PR=[1/2×(ACM2×OAAM1)]+[2/3×(ACM2×OAAM2)] +[1/2×(ACM2×OAAM3)]+[1/2×(ACM1×OAAM3)]Equation 9 +[(ACM1×OAAM4)]The 13C dilution in the CAC due to entry of unlabeled molecules was estimated from the total enrichment in tissue citrate (CITΣM i ) and succinate (SUCΣM i ) using Equation 10, DF=[CITΣMi−(Σfi×OAAM1CIT)]/[SUCΣMi]Equation 10 where the factor f takes into account that a fraction of all citrate molecules enriched with one 13C in any one carbon of its OAA moiety are converted to unlabeled succinate. Note that the magnitude of f depends on the nature of the13C-substrate. For example, f equals 1 for13C-substrates forming [5-13C] citrate, such as 1-13C-labeled fatty acid or acetate. However,f equals 0.5 for 13C-substrates forming [4,5-13C2]citrate, such as [U-13C3]pyruvate or [U-13C2]acetate. With a mix of13C-substrates, the relative contribution of each substrate to the M1 enrichment of the OAA moiety of citrate needs to be considered. 2Under our perfusion conditions, the percentage contributions of [1-13C]octanoate and [U-13C3](lactate + pyruvate) to M1 OAA enrichment are evaluated to be 78.9 ± 0.6 and 21.2 ± 0.4%, respectively, from experiments where hearts were perfused with a single13C-substrate (MPE M1 OAA (citrate); Table II; Conditions A and B). Therefore, Σf i equals ((0.79 × 1) + (0.21 × 0.5)) or 0.895. Alternatively, the relative contributions of these 13C-substrates can be estimated from the M1 and M2 enrichments of the acetyl moiety of citrate, 88.0 ± 0.3 and 12.0 ± 0.7%, respectively (Table IIIC). Chemicals, organic solvents, enzymes, and coenzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval, Quebec), Fisher (Montreal, Quebec), Sigma, and Anachemia (Dorval, Quebec). [U-13C3]Lactate, [U-13C3]pyruvate, [1-13C]octanoate, [U13C2]acetate, and [U-13C5]glutamate (all 99%) were obtained from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH) and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The derivatization agentN-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide was supplied by Regis Chemical (Morton Glove, IL). All aqueous solutions were made with water purified by the “Milli-Q” system (Millipore, St-Laurent, Quebec). Fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Quebec) weighing 120–220 g were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg). After opening the chest and insertion of a cannula into the aorta, hearts were excised and transferred to a Langendorff set up as described previously (38Laplante A. Vincent G. Poirier M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E74-E82PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brunet J. Boily M.J. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 19: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts (wet weight 1.1–1.3 g) were perfused for up to 60 min retrogradely through the aorta at a constant pressure of 80 mmHg with a non-recirculating Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 1.3 mm calcium, 11 mm glucose, 1 or 0.5 mm lactate, 0.2 or 0.05 mm pyruvate, 0.2 mm octanoate, with or without 0.5 mm glutamate or 0.1 mm acetate. The buffer was gassed with 95% O2:5% CO2 (pH 7.4) at 38 °C. The following parameters were continuously monitored through instruments linked to a microcomputer: (i) coronary flow, using an electromagnetic flow probe (model FM501, Carolina Medical Electronics, King, NC) installed above the aortic cannula; (ii) temperature using a thermocouple (Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH) attached to the surface of the heart; and (iii) contractile function using a latex balloon filled with fluid inserted into the left ventricular cavity and connected to a pressure transducer (Digi-Med Heart Performance Analyzer, Micro-Med, Louisville, KY). Hearts that did not show an increase in coronary flow on release of a 20–25-s period of in-flow occlusion were discarded. Under our conditions, hearts were beating spontaneously at 280 ± 19 beats/min and maintained a contractile function (dP/dT) of 2099 ± 152 mmHg/s and a coronary flow rate of 9.3 ± 0.6 ml/min. After a 15–20-min equilibration period, one or more unlabeled substrate(s) were replaced by the corresponding labeled substrates either (i) [1-13C]octanoate, (ii) [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate, (iii) [1-13C]octanoate + [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate, (iv) [U-13C5]glutamate, or (v) [U-13C2]acetate. Starting 10 min before the labeling period, samples of effluent perfusate (20 ml) were collected every 5 min and processed as follows: (i) 7 ml was immediately made 10 mm hydroxylamine-hydrochloride and sonicated for 1 min to convert α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to its oxime derivative (43Laplante A. Comte B. Des Rosiers C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 580-587Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar); (ii) 10 ml was made 1% sulfosalicylic acid; and (iii) 1 ml was left untreated. Samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis. After perfusing for 40 min with 13C-substrate(s), hearts were freeze-clamped and stored in liquid nitrogen. The MID of tissue and effluent perfusate citrate and other CAC metabolites (αKG, OAA, succinate, fumarate, malate) was determined by published GCMS methods (6Des Rosiers C. Di Donato L. Comte B.

The parasitic protozoan, Plasmodium falciparum, is the causative agent of malaria throughout the world and is responsible for an annual death toll of nearly 3 million, the majority of which are children and pregnant mothers (1Oaks S.C. Mitchell V.S. Pearson G.W. Carpenter C.C. Malaria Obstacles and Opportunities. National Academy of Sciences Press, Washington, D. C.1991Google Scholar). However, tools available to control malaria are inadequate, and drug-resistant strains are widespread; moreover, the immediate prospect of a useful vaccine is uncertain. Thus, there is an urgent need to obtain fundamental knowledge about the various cellular processes of P. falciparum at the molecular level, so that susceptible targets can be identified. With this long-term goal in mind, we have initiated studies of the signal transduction system in P. falciparum. Since reversible protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation constitute a major mechanism of signal transduction (2Barik S. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 115-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), one of our immediate goals has been to characterize the various protein kinases in P. falciparum. In this paper, we report the characterization, expression, stage-specific regulation, and mutational analysis ofP. falciparum casein kinase 1 (PfCK1). 1The abbreviations used are: PfCK1, P. falciparum casein kinase 1; CK1 and CK2, casein kinase-1 and -2, respectively; kb, kilobase pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: PfCK1, P. falciparum casein kinase 1; CK1 and CK2, casein kinase-1 and -2, respectively; kb, kilobase pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Casein kinase-1 and -2 (CK1 and CK2) are multipotential Ser/Thr protein kinases, originally purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates using casein as substrate (reviewed in Refs. 3Tuazon P.T.

In the subsequent years, both enzymes were shown to phosphorylate, and thus regulate, a wide variety of cellular proteins. The sequence alignment of CK1 genes of various organisms and deletion analysis of recombinant yeast CK1 have recently resulted in the delineation of the following domains in the prototype 45-kDa yeast enzyme (summarized in Refs. 5Carmel G.

The crystal structure of the 298-residue catalytic core of the Schizosaccharomyces pombeCK1 in complex with MgATP has recently been elucidated at 2.0-Å resolution (6Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The structure suggested the roles of a number of conserved residues in various catalytic functions of the enzyme, such as binding of ATP, Mg2+, and the phosphate groups of the substrate. To confirm the identity of the malarial CK1 (PfCK1) cDNA, we have studied the biochemical properties of the recombinant malarial enzyme in detail and compared them with the native enzyme activity. In addition, preliminary mutational analysis of the enzyme was carried out to ascertain the essential nature of some of the invariant residues and their effect on the enzymatic parameters. Studies of stage-specific expression of the PfCK1 gene suggested transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional regulations. Our results constitute the first report of a CK1 enzyme in an eukaryotic protozoan parasite. P. falciparumstrain Dd2 was maintained in a modified erythrocyte culture (7Trager W. Jensen J.B.

Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). 1 liter of a synchronousP. falciparum culture of appropriate stage and at a parasitemia of 15–20% was treated with saponin (0.1% final concentration) to lyse erythrocytes. The parasite pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% (v/v) aprotinin), homogenized, and briefly sonicated at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (S100) was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (0–60%) followed by resuspension and dialysis of the pellet fraction in the above buffer. Isolation of P. falciparum genomic DNA and RNA from Saponin-lysed P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and cloning of the cDNA into pBlueScript have been described (10Chakrabarti D. Schuster S.M. Chakrabarti R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12020-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The putative PfCK1 gene open reading frame (975 base pairs) was subcloned from pBlueScript-SK± to the T7-based bacterial expression plasmid pET3a as follows. The gene was amplified by the following primers (corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively): 5′-GGAGTTGCATATGGAAATTAGAGTGGCA-3′ and 5′-GAGGATCCATCAATTATTTCGTTGATCTC-3′ (theNdeI and BamHI sites are underlined). The PCR product was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the same two sites of pET3a or pET15b as described (11Mazumder B. Adhikary G. Barik S. Virology. 1994; 205: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resulting clones, designated pET3a-PfCK1 or pET15b-PfCK1, were confirmed by DNA sequencing and introduced into E. coliBL21(DE3). Growth of the transformant, induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and lysis with lysozyme-EDTA were carried out essentially as described previously (11Mazumder B. Adhikary G. Barik S. Virology. 1994; 205: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE were performed according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 270: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206989) Google Scholar), using a 14% acrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 30:0.4) gel for proteins and a 40% gel for peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion of the cloned CK1 gene was performed by the PCR-based “megaprimer” method as described previously (13Barik S. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 26: 309-323Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The total extract of 1 g of induced BL21(DE3) cells containing the pET3a-PfCK1 plasmid was prepared as above and sonicated to shear the chromosomal DNA and reduce viscosity (5Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 120,000 ×g, and the supernatant (S100) containing soluble recombinant CK1 was loaded on an 8-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 mm NaCl. Using a NaCl gradient in buffer A, the enzyme was subsequently eluted at an NaCl concentration of about 80 mm. The pooled fractions were directly applied to a 5-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated with buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl and then eluted at about 0.5 m NaCl in a salt gradient. The phosphocellulose fraction, already highly pure (Fig. 8, lane 1), was concentrated by filtration through a Centricon-10 cartridge and further purified by a gel filtration chromatography through Sephadex G-50 (Fig. 8, lane 2), from which it eluted as an apparent monomer (data not shown). Polyhistidine-tagged CK1 and its mutants (from the pET15b-PfCK1 clone) were purified essentially as described (5Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison, purified recombinant CK1δ subunit, expressed in Escherichia coli(14Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was purchased from New England Biolabs (Bedford, MA). Sepharose coupled to the isoquinolinesulfonamide compound CK1–7 (Seikagaku America, Ijaxville, MD), a specific CK1 inhibitor, was generated by reacting 5 mg of CK1–7 with 0.5 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B following standard procedures. Affinity chromatography of CK1 enzyme on this column was performed essentially as suggested (15Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications as follows. 0.1 ml (1.0 mg of protein) of malarial S100 extract was passed four times through the CK1–7 column. The column was washed first with 1 ml of buffer B containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and then with 0.5 ml of 0.2 m arginine. The bound CK1 was eluted with 0.3 ml of 0.8 m arginine (15Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluate was dialyzed overnight against buffer B containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and stored frozen at −80 °C. Unless otherwise mentioned, standard protein kinase assay reactions (10 μl) contained the following: 20 μg α-casein (not dephosphorylated; from Sigma) or 1 mmof the synthetic peptide KRRRALpSVASLPGL (where pS represents phosphoserine) (New England Biolabs), 15 μm (10 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP (or [γ-32P]GTP of same specific activity, where mentioned), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50–100 ng of purified kinase in buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol). Where indicated, heparin or CK1–7 was also included in the reaction. 10 mm stock solutions of CK1–7 were made in Me2SO, from which appropriate dilutions were made in water immediately before use. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the kinase and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. When the synthetic peptide was the substrate, 2–4 μl of the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 40% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (16Ansai T. Dupuy L. Barik S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24401-24407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography. Where needed, the autoradiographs were scanned densitometrically. When casein was used as substrate,32P incorporation was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on Whatman 31-ET paper (17Graves P.R. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One unit of casein kinase was defined as the activity capable of incorporating 1 nmol of phosphate to casein in 1 h at 37 °C. The catalytic parameters (V max, K cat, andK m ) were measured under standard assay conditions and calculated by the Eadie-Hofstee method (18Eadie G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 146: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 19Hofstee B.H.J. Nature. 1959; 184: 1296-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).K m of casein was calculated on the basis of its assumed molecular mass of 24 kDa. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) reactions were performed under identical conditions using recombinant CK2 (11Mazumder B. Adhikary G. Barik S. Virology. 1994; 205: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequencing of random clones from a P. falciparum cDNA library in the Malaria Parasite Gene Sequencing Project (20Chakrabarti D. Reddy G.R. Dame J.B. Almira E.C. Ferl R.J. Rowe T.C. Schuster S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) identified a clone with a 1.3-kb insert, which displayed significant homology to CK1 sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base. This putative CK1 gene, designated the PfCK1 gene, contained a 975-nucleotide-long open reading frame with the potential to code for a polypeptide of 324 amino acids. The 3′-untranslated sequence of PfCK1 was 190 nucleotides long, followed by a poly(A) tail. The deduced sequence of PfCK1 polypeptide showed extensive similarity with the N-terminal catalytic region of known CK1 polypeptides. A representative comparison with human and yeast CK1 is shown in Fig. 1. PfCK1 protein was found to be 59% similar to the human sequence; the similarity increased to 69% if conservative replacements were also included. Of particular significance was the finding that PfCK1 contained essentially all of the amino acid residues that were completely invariant in all known CK1 proteins (Fig. 1,asterisks). The seven PfCK1 residues that were exceptions to this are indicated by dots above them (Fig. 1); three of these were nonconservative replacements, viz. Thr78, Tyr165, and Ser245, the corresponding invariant residues in all other CK1s being Asn, Ile, and Pro, respectively. Since the malarial CK1 was catalytically active (see below), we can conclude that these three residues may not be important in catalysis. To gather a preliminary knowledge of the PfCK1 gene organization, we carried out a Southern blot analysis of restriction endonuclease-digested P. falciparum genomic DNA using 32P-labeled PfCK1 cDNA insert as probe. As shown in Fig.2 A, the majority of the restriction enzymes produced a single band, suggesting the existence of a single CK1 gene. RNA blot (Northern) analysis (Fig. 2 B) revealed the existence of two size classes of transcripts,viz. 2.4 and 3.2 kb. Since the combined length of the PfCK1 coding sequence and the 3′-untranslated sequence is 1.17 kb, the 5′-untranslated sequence appears to be at least 1.2 kb in length. This rather long 5′-untranslated sequence is typical of many malaria parasite transcripts (10Chakrabarti D. Schuster S.M. Chakrabarti R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12020-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the two transcripts are due to different transcription events or are products of alternate splicing. To identify CK1 activity in P. falciparum, we subjected its S100 extract to affinity chromatography using the isoquinolinesulfonamide compound, CK1–7 (15Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A malarial protein fraction obtained in this manner exhibited a potent casein kinase activity (Fig. 3) that was resistant to heparin (90% activity with 25 μg/ml heparin) but sensitive to CK1–7 (66 and 85% inhibition with 10 μm and 20 μm CK1–7, respectively). The native malarial CK1 fraction also efficiently phosphorylated the CK1-specific peptide substrate, KRRRALpSVASLPGL, where the underlined Ser is the CK1 phosphorylation site (Fig.4). 40 μm CK1–7 inhibited phosphorylation by nearly 80% at an ATP concentration of 15 μm (lane 4). The recombinant CK1δ isoform of rat testis expressed in E. coli (22Kearney P.H. Ebert M. Kuret J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) exhibited an essentially similar inhibition by CK1–7 (lane 2). Interestingly, heparin (10 μg/ml) stimulated the activity about 2-fold. As discussed later, the unique stimulatory effect of heparin, observed only when a small peptide was used as substrate, was also demonstrated with the CK1δ isoform (17Graves P.R. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The enzyme demonstrated a marked preference for ATP; GTP was used much less efficiently (Fig. 4,lane 6). Together, these results demonstrate that P. falciparum contains a protein kinase activity essentially identical to CK1. The malaria parasite undergoes distinct morphological changes during the progression through its intraerythrocytic life cycle: rings (initial maturation stage following invasion), trophozoites (larger mononucleated metabolically active cells containing hemozoin pigment), and schizonts (multinucleated cells). To address whether the PfCK1 gene is expressed in a stage-specific manner through this intricate life cycle, RNA samples were isolated from synchronized cultures every 6 h. As shown by Fig. 5, the expression of PfCK1 transcripts is indeed cell cycle-regulated. Both size classes of transcript showed a peak expression in the early ring stage and were barely detectable in trophozoite and schizont stages. Interestingly, when we determined the specific activity of CK1 in the S100 extracts of the various stages of the parasite, a different picture emerged. Using the specific phosphopeptide substrate, the highest CK1 activity was found in trophozoites, followed by rings, while the activity in the schizonts was barely detectable (Fig.6). The relative activities in the three stages, determined by densitometric scanning, were in the ratio 100:42:3. The authenticity of the CK1 activity was further verified by its sensitivity to the inhibitor CK1–7 and by comparison to CK1δ (Fig. 6). At 20 μm CK1–7, for example, activities of all stages were inhibited by 85–90%. In an attempt to obtain a preliminary estimate of the natural substrates of the malarial CK1, we subjected the S100 extracts of the three major stages of the parasite to self-phosphorylation, whereby equal amounts of the S100 proteins were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and increasing concentrations of CK1–7. Analysis of the reaction products on SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 7, led to a number of findings, summarized as follows. (a) A number of malarial polypeptides appeared to serve as substrates for endogenous kinases. The major phosphoprotein species common in both rings and trophozoites exhibited molecular masses of 66, 60, 33, and 27 kDa in addition to a number of high molecular weight species, whereas the 42- and 36-kDa species were predominant in rings only. The schizonts, on the other hand, exhibited a pattern that is very different from either rings or trophozoites and consisted of two major species of about 98 and 75 kDa. In all three extracts, most of the phosphoproteins appeared to be minor Plasmodium S100 proteins, as judged by comparing the bands in the autoradiogram with those in the corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained gel (panel A). (b) With increasing concentrations of CK1–7, phosphorylated bands of both ring and trophozoites started to disappear much earlier than those of the schizont. At 50 μm CK1–7, for example, phosphorylation of ring and trophozoite extracts was almost completely inhibited, whereas that of schizonts remained substantially unaffected. Together, these results suggest that CK1 may be a major protein kinase in the ring and trophozoite stages, while the schizont stage may have a different kinase make-up. (c) In an effort to assess whether the stage-specific phosphoprotein pattern was due to a difference in the level of substrates or enzymes, purified recombinant malarial CK1 was added to extracts of all three stages (Fig. 7, lanes with plus sign). Interestingly, this restored the schizont pattern to resemble those of ring and trophozoite, while the patterns of the latter two stages remained virtually unaltered. As expected, only those bands in the schizont extracts that were due to the exogenously added CK1 exhibited sensitivity to CK1–7. These results strongly suggest that schizonts are substantially devoid of CK1 activity rather than CK1 substrates. Upon induction of BL21(DE3) containing pET3a-PfCK1 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, a polypeptide ofM r ∼37,000 was produced (Fig.8), which is in reasonable agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 37,807 for the CK1 open reading frame polypeptide, considering the slight overall basicity of the predicted polypeptide (42 Asp and Glu residues; 55 Lys and Arg residues). The 37-kDa protein was purified by chromatography through DEAE and phosphocellulose and then by gel filtration using Sephadex G50. During purification, the casein kinase activity always co-chromatographed with the 37-kDa polypeptide. The final preparation (Fig. 8, lane 2) was at least 90% pure, with no single contaminant constituting more than 5% of the 37-kDa polypeptide. In vitro, the purified recombinant enzyme efficiently phosphorylated casein (Fig.9) with a specific activity of ∼1020 units/μg of protein. The activity was resistant to heparin (25 μg/ml) but was inhibited by about 70 and 80% in the presence of 10 and 20 μm CK1–7, respectively (Fig. 9). Under the same reaction conditions, purified CK2 was inhibited by heparin but retained about 90 and 70% activity in the presence of 10 and 20 μm CK1–7, respectively (3Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 14Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the recombinant malarial CK1 fraction exhibited properties characteristic of the authentic CK1 class of enzymes. The catalytic parameters, measured in the presence of 15 μm ATP and 2 μg casein per μl were as follows: V max, 17.5 ± 1.5 μmol of casein/mg of enzyme/min; K cat, 15.5 ± 1.2 s−1; K m (casein), 110 ± 10 μm, producing aK cat:K m ratio of 8.45 μm−1 min−1. In an attempt to simplify the purification procedure and to be able to rapidly screen various mutants of CK1 in the future, we have also cloned PfCK1 into pET15b. This resulted in the fusion of the 2-kDa histidine-rich peptide MGSS(H)6SSGLVPRGSH to CK1, which increased theM r of the recombinant protein to about 39 kDa. The fusion protein could be purified to near homogeneity in a single step using a nickel column (Fig. 8, lane 3), and exhibited a specific activity essentially identical to that of the nonfusion recombinant (data not shown). The peptide stretch GXGXXG (residues 16–21), followed by a Lys38 16 residues downstream, is conserved in all CK1 catalytic cores and is considered to be involved in ATP binding (23Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have suggested that the triphosphate moiety of ATP interacts with three charged residues of CK1, viz., Lys38, Lys130, and Asp151 and with the amide backbone of Gly21 (6Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, Asn133 has been implicated in the coordination of the single Mg+2 ion in CK1. However, no detailed mutational studies to validate these predictions have been performed. In an earlier report, the K38N mutant was reported to be “kinase-dead,” although the exact mechanism of the defect was not studied (14Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the malarial recombinant CK1 was enzymatically active, it gave us an opportunity to analyze the roles of specific residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Our initial studies employed His fusion PfCK1 mutants G21A and K38L expressed in pET-15b (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and5). In standard casein kinase assays, both mutants were found to be highly defective. For detailed kinetic studies, however, we expressed these and other mutants in the pET-3a vector, free of any exogenous sequences. Kinetic data presented in TableI revealed that the K38L, K130L, and D151N mutants all had a highly elevated K m for ATP and similarly defective K cat. Interestingly, these mutants also exhibited a higher K m for Mg2+, which supports the notion that Mg2+ binds ATP, and that the Mg2+-ATP complex is coordinated to the relevant residues of CK1. This is further confirmed by the reciprocal mutation N133A, which not only increased the K m for Mg2+ as expected but also had a severe effect on theK m for ATP. Substitution of Gly21 with alanine had the least effect on enzymatic parameters, probably because the two amino acids are very similar and the peptide bond of Gly21 rather than its side chain is postulated to interact with ATP (6Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X.

ΔC18 had near normal activity and, therefore, was not studied in detail. S.D. values were calculated from three independent measurements. The minimal length of a functional CK1 enzyme remains undefined. Truncation of the C-terminal 148 amino acids of the recombinant CKi1 ofS. pombe (product of the cki1 gene) generated a 298-residue core that contained only 3 residues beyond the invariant DW dipeptide (5Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This “catalytic core” was enzymatically active and, as mentioned earlier, led to the only crystal structure of CK1 available to date (6Xu R. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, larger deletions of this or any other isoform of CK1 have not been reported. To delineate the minimal length of the CK1 catalytic core, we have carried out terminal deletions of the malarial enzyme in the recombinant pET-3a clone. The truncated mutants were expressed in bacteria, purified, and assayed using casein as substrate. Deletion of 18 amino acid residues from the C terminus (ΔC18) of PfCK1 was found to retain 80% of the wild type activity. Essentially similar results were obtained when the ΔC18 mutant (Fig.8, lane 6) had a His fusion at the N terminus. However, deletion of 36 residues from the C terminus, which resulted in the loss of the invariant DW, produced an essentially inactive enzyme. Deletion of only 8 residu"

The human pathogen Mycoplasma fermentans PG18 was isolated from the urogenital tract several decades ago (1Wise K.S. Kim M.F. Theiss P.M. Lo S.-C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3327-3333Crossref Google Scholar). Because of reports indicating its possible role as a cofactor accelerating the progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease, its significance as a pathogen in other immunocompromised patients (2Blanchard A. Montagnier L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 687-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, interest in M. fermentans has recently increased (3Slomiany B.L.

Although little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying M. fermentanspathogenicity (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol.

It is reasonable to assume that Mycoplasma membrane components are involved in the attachment and fusion of the microbe with eukaryotic host cells. Salman et al. (6Salman M. Deutsch J. Tarshis M.

Matsuda et al. (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) isolated two glycoglycerolipids (GGPL-I 1The abbreviations used are: GGPL, glycoglycerophospholipid; MfGL, M. fermentans glycolipid; GLC-MS, gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MALDI-LIN-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight recorded in the linear mode; EI-MS, electron impact-mass spectrometry; CI-MS, chemical ionization-mass spectrometry; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence; Gro, glycerol; Glc, glucose; AP, 2-amino-1,3-propanediol; Cho, choline; HF, hydrofluoric acid. and GGPL-III) fromM. fermentans. GGPL-I structure was shown to be 6′-O-phosphocholine-α-d-glucopyranosyl-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (7Matsuda K. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Taki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33123-33128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as elucidated by mass and NMR spectroscopy. It was later shown (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that the structure of a more polar glycolipid (GGPL-III) isolated from the same strain of M. fermentans was very similar to that of GGPL-I. The chemical structure of GGPL-III, however, has so far remained obscure. The only distinguishing structural feature known is that it differs from GGPL-I in having an additional amino residue (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both GGPLs were shown to be species-specific major lipid antigens ofM. fermentans (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we describe the structural analysis of a new type of polar lipid isolated from M. fermentans, and we present the complete structural analysis of MfGL-II. 2Unfortunately there exists a confusing terminology in the literature concerning these biologically significant polar glycolipids. We propose replacing the equivalent terms GGPL-I (also called lipid v (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar)) with MfGL-I and replacing the equivalent terms GGPL-III = lipid vi (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) = compound X (6Salman M. Deutsch J. Tarshis M. Naot Y. Rottem S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with MfGL-II. The Roman numerals indicate the sequence of their discovery and structural description. Furthermore, we show that both glycolipids of M. fermentans, GGPL-I and GGPL-III, share the basic structure of 6′-O-phospho-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1′→3)-1,2-diacyl-glycerol (7Matsuda K. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Taki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33123-33128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but differ in their polar head groups. Cultures of M. fermentansstrain PG18 and strain Incognitus (provided by S.-C. Lo, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D.C.) were grown in a modified Channock medium (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar) inoculated with a 48-h culture at an inoculum level of 2% and incubated statically at 37 °C. After 68 h the cells were harvested, washed twice, and freeze-dried as described previously (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar) with yields ranging from 130 to 160 mg dry weight per liter of medium. Freeze-dried cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25m NaCl to a final concentration of 25 mg of cells per ml. Lipids were extracted from cell suspensions by the method of Bligh and Dyer (9Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43103) Google Scholar) and concentrated to near dryness on a rotary evaporator. Quantitative separation of MfGL-II was achieved by silica gel column chromatography. Total lipid was redissolved in 2 ml of chloroform and loaded onto a silica gel column (1.5 × 3 cm; Kieselgel 60, 230–400 mesh, Merck), equilibrated with chloroform and sequentially eluted with four bed volumes of chloroform (fraction 1), chloroform/methanol, 1:4 (v/v, fraction 2), chloroform/methanol/water, 1:4:0.7 (fraction 3), chloroform/methanol/water, 1:4:1 (fraction 4), chloroform/methanol/water, 1:4:1.5 (fraction 5), chloroform/methanol/water, 1:8:3 (fraction 6), methanol (fraction 7), methanol/water, 7:3 (fraction 8), and methanol/water, 6:4 (fraction 9). Fractions were vacuum evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 0.5 ml of elution solution, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Since fractions 4–7 contained pure MfGL-II they were combined and dialyzed in 10 mm EDTA against water for 4 days at 4 °C. MfGL-II (370 μg) was dissolved in 0.5m HCl/MeOH and incubated at 85 °C for 40 min. The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the liberated fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by GLC and GLC-MS. Following mild methanolysis, samples were dissolved in 2 m HCl/MeOH, incubated at 85 °C for 16 h, and peracetylated with acetanhydride/pyridine (1:2, v/v) for 60 min at 85 °C. Carbohydrates and other components of MfGL-II were analyzed as their peracetylated derivatives by GLC and GLC-MS. MfGL-II (290 μg) and derived phosphomethyl ester were dephosphorylated by treatment with 48% aqueous HF at 4 °C for 36 h. Following solvent removal in vacuo over KOH, the product was peracetylated and analyzed as described earlier. d-Serine (Sigma) was methylated by acidic methanolysis (0.5 mHCl/MeOH, 85 °C, 40 min), and the resulting methyl ester was reduced with NaBH4 in methanol/water (1:1, v/v) to the corresponding 2-amino-1,3-propanediol which was then peracetylated and analyzed by GLC-MS. MfGL-II (1.3 mg, 1.2 μmol) was per-N,O-acetylated with acetanhydride/pyridine (1:2, v/v) at room temperature for 16 h in the dark followed byO-deacylation with 0.3 ml of 0.25 mNaOCH3 (75 μmol) in absolute methanol at 37 °C for 3 h prior to methylation analysis. The pH was adjusted to 4 with 0.1 m HCl/MeOH, and the phosphates were transformed to methyl esters with ethereal diazomethane (CH2N2) treatment at room temperature for 15 min. The solvents were removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the product was washed three times with ether/n-hexane (10:90, v/v) to remove liberated fatty acids. The sample was dried in vacuo and methylated (10Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The permethylated sample was extracted with water/chloroform (7 ml, 6:1, v/v); the aqueous layer was washed twice with 1 ml of chloroform, and the combined organic phases were washed again with 100 ml of water and taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. After methylation the product was dephosphorylated as described earlier, and an aliquot was directly peracetylated (see above) and analyzed by GLC-MS. The phosphate position in the glucose moiety was determined with another aliquot. MfGL-II was hydrolyzed (4 mtrifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 4 h), and the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. The product was redissolved in water/methanol (10:1, v/v), and the pH was adjusted to neutral with NaOH. The sample was then reduced (NaBD4) at room temperature overnight in the dark. The resulting product was peracetylated and analyzed by GLC-MS. MfGL-II (12.4 mg, 11.8 μmol) wasO-deacylated with 0.33 ml of 0.25 mNaOCH3 (82.5 μmol) in absolute methanol at 40 °C. The reaction course was followed by TLC (chloroform/methanol/water, 100:100:30, v/v). After 1 h no MfGL-II (R F = 0.38) and no lysoforms (R F = 0.16) were found, and a single spot remained at the origin. The solvent was reduced to near dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and 2 ml of chloroform/water (1:1, v/v) were added. The organic layer was washed twice with 2 ml of water, and the combined aqueous phases were loaded onto a Sephadex G-10 column (2 × 112 cm) and eluted with water. The fractions were analyzed by the anthrone test (11Shields R. Burnett W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 885-886Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and positive fractions were combined, freeze-dried (yield 6.7 mg, quantitative), and analyzed by NMR. For TLC aluminum sheets of pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 thickness 0.2 mm (Merck) were used. The plates were developed at room temperature with chloroform/methanol/water, 100:100:30 (v/v). Glycolipid spots were detected by dipping the plates into a solution of 15% sulfuric acid in ethanol and heating to 110 °C for 2 min. Phospholipid spots were detected by the Dittmer-Lester reagent (12Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) diluted with acetone (1:20, v/v). Amino groups containing lipids were detected by dipping the plates into a solution of 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone followed by heating to 60 °C for 15 min. GLC was performed with a Varian model 3700 chromatograph equipped with a capillary column of SPB-5 using a temperature gradient from 150 to 320 °C with a temperature rise of 5 °C/min. GLC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5989 equipped with a capillary column (HP-5) under the same conditions as GLC. The ion source temperature was 200 °C. EI-mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV and CI-mass spectra were obtained with ammonia as reactant gas. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of positive ions were recorded with a Reflex II, Bruker-Franzen (Bremen, Germany) spectrometer in the linear mode (MALDI-LIN-TOF) at 28.5 kV acceleration voltage using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. The spectra were obtained from 0.5 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of aqueous matrix solution (25 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 500 μl) and native MfGL-II (1 μg/μl in chloroform/methanol, 1:1, v/v). NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AM-360 spectrometer. Spectra of native MfGL-II (20 mg) were recorded in 10:10:3 (CDCl3:MeOD:D2O, v/v, 0.5 ml) and referenced to δH = 7.26 ppm (CDCl3) and δC = 77.0 ppm (CDCl3), respectively. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 360 MHz (13C NMR, 90.5 MHz);31P NMR spectra were measured over a spectral range of 20,000 Hz with both 1H broad band coupling and decoupling. The spectrometer frequency was 145.78 MHz. 31P NMR signals were referenced to an 80% (mass/volume) solution of H3PO4 as an external standard. The spectra ofO-deacylated MfGL-II (6.7 mg) were recorded in 0.5 ml of D2O and referenced to δH = 2.225 ppm and δC = 31.45 ppm (external acetone). One- and two-dimensional homonuclear (1H,1H COSY, ROESY, and relayed COSY) and two-dimensional H-detected1H,13C HMQC and 1H,31P HMQC experiments were performed using standard Bruker (Rheinstetten, Germany) software (XWINNMR, version 1.1). The coupled and decoupled31P NMR spectra and the 1H,31P HMQC spectrum were recorded with O-deacylated MfGL-II in D2O at room temperature. The MfGL-II of M. fermentans(Incognitus strain) was obtained from 1.2 g of dry cells after Bligh and Dyer extraction. It was purified to homogeneity by silica gel column (1.5 × 3 cm, Kieselgel 60, Merck) eluted stepwise with mixtures of chloroform/methanol/water and methanol/water with increasing polarity (fractions 4–7). The yield of MfGL-II from 134 mg of total lipids was 21 mg of MfGL-II (15.7%) and, thus, the MfGL-II is a major lipid in the membrane ofM. fermentans. High levels of MfGL-II were also found with the PG18 strain. As the yields of biomass from the PG18 strain were much higher, all subsequent experiments were performed with this strain. The MfGL-II was found to be degraded by mild acidic methanolysis indicating that the fatty acids were ester-linked. Methyl palmitate (16:0) and methyl stearate (18:0) were identified as the major fatty acids in a molar ratio of 3.6:1 similar to that described previously (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar). Strong methanolysis (2 m HCl/MeOH, 85 °C, 16 h), dephosphorylation (48% HF), and peracetylation revealed, upon GLC-MS analysis, methyl hexose with the same retention time and fragmentation pattern (EI-MS) as peracetylated methyl α-d-glucose. In addition to the glucose, anN-containing substance as deduced from its odd-number molecular mass, M r = 217, in CI-MS ([M + H]+ = 218, [M + NH4]+ = 235) expressed a retention time and molecular weight being compatible with 1,3-di-O-acetyl-2-acetamido-propanediol. Since 2-amino-1,3-propanediol was not yet identified inMycoplasma, we tried to corroborate this analysis by a simple chemical synthesis for reference material starting fromd-serine which was methylated, reduced, and per-O-acetylated (see “Materials and Methods”). With GLC-MS analysis the resulting compound showed identical retention time and fragmentation pattern (EI-MS (Fig. 1) as well as CI-MS (spectra not shown)), thus substantiating the original assignment. GLC-MS analysis after dephosphorylation and peracetylation revealed a structure with a molecular weight of 506 (CI-MS) corresponding to glucose with glycosidically linked glycerol, thus indicating that glucose is directly bound to glycerol. The 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety was found as 1,3-di-O-acetyl-2-acetamido-propanediol derivative identical to that of the synthetic 2-amino-1,3-propanediol described above, thus indicating that 2-amino-1,3-propanediol is involved in the structure of MfGL-II as a phosphoester. Methylation analysis of native MfGL-II (N-acetylation, deacylation, methylation (10Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation (48% HF), hydrolysis (trifluoroacetic acid), and reduction (NaBD4)) was done in two steps. First, after methylation and dephosphorylation an aliquot of the sample was peracetylated and subjected to GLC-MS analysis. The EI-MS spectra revealed a fragmentation pattern corresponding to 1,2-di-O-methyl-3-O-(O-acetyl-tri-O-methyl-glucopyranosyl)glycerol (peaks at m/z 247 assigned to the glucopyranoside moiety and at m/z 103 assigned to the glycerol moiety with the typical McLafferty rearrangement atm/z 163 (spectra not shown)) indicating that glucose was substituted with one phosphate. In addition, 1,3-di-O-acetyl-2-(N-methylacetamido)propanediol was detected suggesting that the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety was symmetrically substituted with two phosphates (spectra not shown). To identify the position of the phosphate residue on the glucopyranosyl moiety, the sample was hydrolyzed and reduced yielding 1,5,6-tri-O-acetyl-2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-glucitol (spectra not shown), indicating the presence of a 6-phosphate on the glucopyranosyl moiety. These findings suggested a linear structure of diacyl-glyceryl-glucopyranoside with 6′-O-(2“-amino-1”,3“-diphospho-1”,3“-propanediol)-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1′→3)-glycerol as the hydrophilic backbone (Fig. 2). Because the phosphocholine moiety in native MfGL-II was not accessible by methylation analysis and GLC-MS spectrometry other analytical procedures were used. The molecular size of underivatized MfGL-II was investigated by MALDI-LIN-TOF mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. Native MfGL-II showed two major pseudomolecular ions (m/z 1049.5 [MI + H]+ and m/z 1077.3 [MII + H]+) (Fig. 3) with various pseudomolecular ions having Na+ and K+ attached to MI and MII, respectively. The difference between the molecular weights (Δm/z = 28) suggested the presence of two molecular species expressing variability in the fatty acid components, representing a dipalmitoyl derivative of MfGL-II as the major component and a palmitoyl-stearoyl derivative as a minor component, respectively. The molecular weight of MI([MI + H]+ = 1049.5) is consistent with the formula C49H99O17N2P2and also with the structure shown in Fig. 8.Figure 8Structure of the main fraction of native MfGL-II.6′-O-[(3“-Phosphocholine-2”-amino-1“,3”-propanediol)-αd-glucopyranosyl](1′→3)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of different fatty acid residues in the glycerol moiety was further supported by detecting methyl palmitate and methyl stearate in the GLC-MS analysis (see above). These findings were in good agreement with previous reports on fatty acid composition of MfGL-II (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of the MfGL-II was further elucidated by different NMR experiments on native as well as onO-deacylated MfGL-II. The results are summarized in TableI for 1H signals and in TableII for 13C signals. The assignment of various signals produced by one- and two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (Fig.4, Fig. 5) were in good agreement with those of the diacyl-(glycosyl-6-phosphate)glycerol moiety recently identified inM. fermentans by Matsuda et al.

In the O-deacylated MfGL-II, the resonances of H-1aGro, H-1bGro, and H-2Gro were shifted upfield (Table I), whereas the positions of resonances of the other glycerol proton signals (H-3aGro and H-3bGro) were unchanged. These findings indicated that the glycosyl moiety is linked to O-3Gro as is found in an aminophosphoglycolipid of Clostridium innocuum (13Fischer W. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The α-anomeric configuration of the hexose was inferred by the coupling constant J 1,2 of 3.4 Hz. The other coupling constants of the hexose (J 2,3,J 3,4, and J 4,5) were larger than 8 Hz, indicating an α-glucopyranoside configuration. The chemical shifts of C-2Glc, C-3Glc, C-4Glc, C-5Glc, and C-6Glc as well as the coupling constant J 6a,6b were similar to those of α-glucose 6-phosphate (14Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1462) Google Scholar), providing evidence that a phosphate group was bonded to the O-6 hydroxyl of glucose. A ROESY experiment with O-deacylated MfGL-II showed nuclear Overhauser effects between H-1Glc and both H-3aGro and H-3bGro indicating a close proximity of these protons consistent with an α-(1′→3) linkage (Fig. 6). The assignment of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR signals was done by 1H,1H COSY and1H,13C COSY experiments in which the assignment of C-1AP and C-3AP may be interchanged because it was not possible to distinguish clearly between these carbon signals. The C-2AP signal in the native MfGL-II was a doublet of doublet with two similar heteronuclear coupling constants ofJ C-2,P 7.1 Hz and J C-2,P′ 7.7 Hz, respectively, indicating that the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol is symmetrically substituted by two phosphate residues. The chemical shifts, except those for C-3AP and H-3a,bAP, approximated the values reported for a phosphoglycolipid isolated from the taxonomically closely related C. innocuum, which contained a 1-phosphate-2-amino-1,3-propanediol at O-6 of α-galactopyranosyl moiety (13Fischer W. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The differences for C-3APand H-3a,bAP indicated that in the MfGL-II the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety is substituted at O-3, whereas in the phosphoglycolipid of C. innocuum it was not. The H-1Cho signal at 4.21 ppm coupled with the H-2Cho signal appeared as a superposition with other signals. The -N+(CH3)3 group was assigned to an intense signal (integral 9H) at 3.12 ppm. The chemical shifts were very close to the values reported for GGPL-I containing a choline phosphate group at O-6 of α-glucosyl moiety (7Matsuda K. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Taki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33123-33128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1H and 13C NMR signals of the ester-linked fatty acids, summarized in Tables I and II, were in the expected range (13Fischer W. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also present in the 1H NMR spectrum were signals of olefinic protons (5.25–5.26 ppm) corresponding to unsaturated fatty acids. This finding agrees well with data from GLC and GLC-MS indicating trace amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (18:1). Different experiments were performed to determine the position of the phosphate groups in MfGL-II. Various one-dimensional and two-dimensional 31P NMR experiments of native MfGL-II measured in 100:100:30 (CDCl3:MeOD:D2O, v/v) gave no satisfactory resolution for the 31P signals. Therefore, the phosphate linkages were determined withO-deacylated MfGL-II. The broad band-decoupled31P NMR spectrum of the O-deacylated MfGL-II showed two singlets at 1.09 and 0.08 ppm, respectively (spectrum not shown). However, in the proton-coupled gated 31P NMR spectrum, the two phosphate groups gave identical multiplets due to the coupling with two structurally related methylene protons (O-CH2Glc and O-CH2AP versus O-CH2AP and O-CH2Cho). The signal intensities upon integration matched precisely the theoretically expected binomial coefficient of 1:4:6:4:1 (found, 1.0:4.3:6.4:4.4:1.3). This splitting is typical for phosphate groups symmetrically substituted with two methylene groups. From these data it was concluded that in MfGL-II four methylene groups are attached to two phosphate residues: one from choline, two from the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol, and one from the Glc residue. The 1H,31P HMQC spectrum (Fig.7) revealed unambiguously the linkage of the phosphate groups. Both 31P signals (P-1 and P-2) showed highly complex cross-peaks. The 31P signal at 1.09 ppm (P-1) correlated with a multiplet of H-1a,bAP (∼3.96 ppm) and with the H-6aGlc and H-6bGlc signals (∼4.08 and ∼4.12 ppm, respectively). The other 31P signal (P-2) at 0.08 ppm showed cross-peaks with a multiplet of H-3a,bAP (∼3.96 ppm) and with the H-1a,bChosignal (4.33 ppm). Taken together these findings confirmed the structure of the MfGL-II as 6′-O-(3“-phosphocholine-2”-amino-1“-phospho1”,3“-propanediol)-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1′→3)-1,2-diacyl-glycerol. The results of the chemical analyses, GLC-MS analyses with synthetic reference compounds, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and various NMR experiments, described above were identical with those obtained by analyzing the MfGL-II of M. fermentans incognitus strain. The best structure suggested by these results is shown in Fig.8. The role of AIDS-associated M. fermentans in the pathogenesis of the disease has not been yet defined. An interesting hypothesis is based on the ability of M. fermentans to fuse with lymphocytes (5Franzoso G. Dimitrov D.S. Blumenthal R. Barile M.F. Rottem S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Mycoplasmacomponents released to the lymphocyte uponMycoplasma-lymphocyte fusion adversely affected lymphocyte function (6Salman M. Deutsch J. Tarshis M. Naot Y. Rottem S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fusogenicity of M. fermentans cells is correlated with a membrane-associated MfGL-II (6Salman M. Deutsch J. Tarshis M. Naot Y. Rottem S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); although several studies have investigated the chemical nature of this lipid, there is presently no consensus on the chemical structure. We have addressed this issue with the aim to establish unequivocally the primary structure of the MfGL-II previously designated as compound X (6Salman M. Deutsch J. Tarshis M. Naot Y. Rottem S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar) or GGPL-III (7Matsuda K. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Taki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33123-33128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MfGL-II was isolated from dried cells of M. fermentans PG18 using the extraction protocol described previously (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar). Using various analytical procedures (GLC, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and NMR spectrometry), we showed that while both compounds were isolated by identical procedures, the structure proposed (8Deutsch J. Salman M. Rottem S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 897-902Crossref Google Scholar) has to be revised. We have unequivocally identified the structure of the major polar membrane lipid of M. fermentans PG18 as 6′-O-(3“-phosphocholine-2”-amino1“,3”-propanediol)-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1′→3)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-glycerol (MfGL-II). MfGL-II shows high structural homology to GGPL-I (MfGL-I), a phosphocholine-containing glyceroglycolipid from M. fermentans (7Matsuda K. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Taki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33123-33128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main difference between GGPL-I and MfGL-II is the presence of a 2-amino-1,3-propanediol moiety and an additional phosphate residue. Matsuda et al. (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) described another phosphocholine-containing glycoglycerolipid which they termed GGPL-III and postulated to possess a structure very similar to GGPL-I but harboring an additional amino group (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our data and those presented by Matsuda et al. (4Matsuda K. Harasawa R. Li J.-L. Kasama T. Taki T. Handa S. Yamamoto N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 307-313Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) show that GGPL-III and the MfGL-II could be structurally identical compounds. It is of great interest that in both MfGL-I and MfGL-II the phosphocholine moiety is the terminal, exposed structural motif. As the two glycoglycerolipids constitute the major lipid fraction of theM. fermentans PG18 membrane, it appears likely that phosphocholine is a key structure in cellular adhesion of M. fermentans to host cells. Phosphocholine has recently been reported to be a constituent of the glycosphingolipid of the annelid Pheretima hilgendorfi(15Sugita M. Fujii H. Inagaki F. Suzuki M. Hayata C. Hori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22595-22598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of lipoteichoic acid (16Behr T. Fischer W. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and of the cell wall associated teichoic acid of Streptococcus pneumoniae (17Fischer W. Behr T. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). InHaemophilus influenzae phosphocholine was also identified on the surface and was found to be attached to the lipopolysaccharide (18Weiser J.N. Shchepetov M. Chong S.T.H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 943-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Risberg A. Schweda E.K.H. Jansson P.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 701-707Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All bacteria having phosphocholine as part of their surface structures colonize the human nasopharynx. This observation supports the assumption that phosphocholine plays a key role in potentiating microorganism-host interaction. There are reports that the human C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein, has the ability to bind to phosphocholine-containing pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (20Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This complex activates the complement system. Thus, bacteria-associated choline appears to play an important role not only in cellular adhesion but also in subsequent inflammatory reactions. The 2-aminol-1,3-diphosphate-1,3-propanedio group has so far not been identified in nature. Fischer et al. (13Fischer W. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) described a 2-amino-1,3-propanediol-3-phosphate-carrying diradylglyceroglycolipid as a major membrane lipid of C. innocuum. Interestingly,Clostridia are taxonomically closely related toMycoplasma (21Johnston N.C. Goldfine H. Fischer W. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 105-111Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that in both organisms the 2-amino-1,3-propanediol is formed by transamination of dihydroxyacetone, a known intermediate of glycolysis (13Fischer W. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This indicates that in M. fermentans glucose has at least two possible fates as follows: catabolic, for energy metabolism, and anabolic, for the biosynthesis of structural molecules. Recently 2-amino-1,3-propanediol has been detected as anO-antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide ofVibrio cholerae H11. Here, however, this moiety is linked by an amide bond to the carboxyl group of d-galacturonosyl residues (22Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). While studies are needed to elucidate the molecular basis for mycoplasmal adhesion to host cells, the finding of phosphocholine as a terminal structure represents an important step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of the pathogenicity of M. fermentans.

https://openalex.org/W2075165227,"Platelet basic protein (PBP) is a chemokine family member that is only found in platelets and their precursors megakaryocytes. The PBP gene is physically linked to the gene for another platelet-specific chemokine, platelet factor 4. While the biological basis of platelet factor 4 expression has been pursued by others, the regulatory features controlling the platelet-specific expression of PBP have not been investigated. In this article, we examined the molecular basis by which this megakaryocyte-specific gene is regulated. Transient expression studies of truncated reporter constructs containing from 4.5 to 0.1 kilobases of the functional PBP gene 5′-flanking region, demonstrated that the proximal 0.1 kilobases of the promoter was sufficient for high levels of expression in human erythroleukemia and CHRF-288 cells, two megakaryocytic cell lines. However, none of these constructs was expressed above background levels in HeLa and 293 cells, two non-megakaryocytic cell lines. Further truncation of this promoter suggested that there was an important regulatory element(s) within a pyrimidine-rich tract. Mobility shift analysis of the pyrimidine-rich tract defined a region between −85 and −64 which bound to a nuclear factor(s). This region contains sequences matching the consensus Ets-binding site from −78 to −75 base pairs. In particular, we noted that this site matched a PU.1 consensus sequence known as a PU box. Mobility shift and supershift studies with nuclear extracts as well as recombinant PU.1 protein and anti-PU.1 antibody further confirmed that PU.1 was the specific Ets family factor that bound to this site. Transient expression assays using reporter constructs which contained point mutations that abrogated PU.1 binding also significantly reduced PBP promoter activity in human erythroleukemia and CHRF cells. In addition, while all reporter gene constructs containing PBP promoters were completely inactive in HeLa cells, transactivation experiments using a PU.1 expression construct demonstrated that exogenous expression of PU.1 could increase reporter gene expression up to 8-fold in these cells. Finally, the role of PU.1 in PBP gene expression was compared between wild-type and PU.1-null embryonic stem (ES) cells that were differentiated in vitrointo cells that resembled megakaryocytes both morphologically and immunologically. We found that PBP gene expression in the differentiated PU.1−/− null ES cells (as determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) was more than four times lower than that in the wild-type ES cells, while other platelet-specific genes were expressed equally or similarly in the two ES cell lines. Previous reports have shown that PU.1 is expressed in several hematopoietic lineages, including megakaryocytes. However, the functional role of PU.1 has only been previously demonstrated in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages.

However, the functional role of PU.1 has only been previously demonstrated in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Therefore, our studies are the first to show the biological importance of this nuclear factor in the regulated expression of a megakaryocyte-specific gene. Circulating platelets play a major role in thrombus formation at the site of tissue injury. These anucleate cellular fragments arise from precursor cells called megakaryocytes which are characterized by their large size, polyploid nucleus, and rarity in the bone marrow (1Biggs R. Human Blood Coagulation, Haemostasis and Thrombosis. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1976Google Scholar). These cells, in turn, arise from self-regenerating pluripotent stem cells which also lead to all other hematopoietic lineages. Megakaryocyte differentiation involves a series of steps of increasing lineage commitment. The end result of this process is the diploid megakaryoblast, which in its continued development, undergoes nuclear endoreduplication, growth in cytoplasmic size, development of α-granules and other granules, and expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes (2Worthington R.E. Nakeff A. Micko S. Cytometry. 1984; 5: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature megakaryocytes then release platelets into the peripheral bloodstream (4Mazur E.M. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 340-350PubMed Google Scholar).When platelets are activated by agonist such as thrombin, the α-granules release their contents into the surrounding medium. Platelet basic protein (PBP) 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, platelet basic protein; β-TG, β-thromboglobulin; PF4, platelet factor-4; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; EBs, embryoid bodies; HEL, human erythroleukemia; CHRF, Children's Hospital Research Foundation. 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, platelet basic protein; β-TG, β-thromboglobulin; PF4, platelet factor-4; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; EBs, embryoid bodies; HEL, human erythroleukemia; CHRF, Children's Hospital Research Foundation.is one of several proteins released during this process and belongs to the chemokine family of inflammatory mediators. PBP is only present in megakaryocytes and platelets, and represents ∼2% of the total platelet protein on a molar basis (5Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Sem. Hematol. 1985; 22: 151-163PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of this protein is not completely clear. PBP has been reported to undergo post-translational modifications giving rise to two N-terminally cleaved products, connective tissue-activating peptide III and β-thromboglobulin (β-TG). Additionally, β-TG can undergo further N-terminal cleavage to form neutrophil-activating peptide-2, which is a potent activator of neutrophils (6Wenger R.H. Wicki A.N. Walz A. Kieffer K. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Begg G.S. Pepper D.S. Chesterman C.N. Morgan F.J.

PBP shares 60% homology to platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is another megakaryocyte-specific protein. These two proteins are expressed at similar times during megakaryocyte development. And while it appears clear that PBP has a role in inflammation, the biological role(s) of PF4 is currently less well defined (9Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 10Stoeckle M.Y. Barker K.A. The New Biologist. 1990; 2: 313-323PubMed Google Scholar, 11Majerus P.W. Miletich J.P. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1991; 198: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).The gene for the human PBP protein was first cloned in our laboratory. We have demonstrated that this gene is divided into three exons and proceeded 30 bp upstream by a canonical TATA box (13Majumdar S. Gonder D. Koutsis B. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5785-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of the physical organization of the PBP gene locus showed that the human PBP gene is immediately upstream of the PF4 gene, facing in the same 5′ → 3′ direction and forming a gene pair occupying <7 kb. In addition, these two genes are linked within ∼1 megabase pairs with other CXC chemokine genes on the long arm of chromosome 4 (14Griffin C.A. Emanuel B.S. Larocco P. Schwartz E. Poncz M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1987; 45: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Wenger R.H. Hameister H. Clemetson K.J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PBP and PF4 gene pair is duplicated, and pulsed-field gel analysis suggests that the two pairs of these two genes lie within a region of ≤250 kb (16Tunnacliffe A. Majumdar S. Yan B. Poncz M. Blood. 1992; 79: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the duplicated PF4 expresses a mutant PF4 protein called PF4alt. Northern blot analysis showed that the PF4alt gene is expressed at ∼1% of the level of wild-type PF4 (17Eisman R. Surrey S. Ramachandran B. Schwartz E. Poncz M. Blood. 1990; 76: 336-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The duplicated PBP gene has not been previously characterized.The molecular basis of megakaryocyte-specific gene expression has been pursued for a number of genes. These studies have defined important regulatory elements and begun to provide insights into how megakaryocytopoiesis is achieved. For example, studies of regulation of megakaryocytic-specific integrin gene αIIb using cell lines and primary cells have localized important GATA and Ets-binding sites in the immediate 5′-flanking region (18Uzan G. Prenanat M. Prandini M.H. Martin F. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8932-8939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Block K.L. Ravid K. Phung Q.H. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fong A.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18441-18447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies showed that GATA-1 was the particular GATA family member that directly regulated αIIb expression (21Prandini M.H. Uzan G. Martin F. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10370-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the rat PF4 promoter using a primary bone marrow expression system have also suggested that a core promoter contains a GATA-binding element at −31 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (22Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A GATA-1-binding site has also been defined as being important for the regulated expression of the glycoprotein Ib gene. Mutations of this site leads to absence of expression of this protein in a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (23Ludlow L.B. Schick B.P. Budarf M.L. Driscoll D.A. Zackai E.H. Cohen A. Konkle B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22076-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Bastian L.S. Yagi M. Chan C. Roth G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additional positive and negative regulatory domains have been defined for these genes, but the nature of trans-acting nuclear factors that bind to these sites are not well studied.Given the fact that only a few megakaryocytic genes have been studied, we decided to examine the molecular basis underlying the expression of the PBP gene to provide another example of how megakaryocyte-specific genes are regulated. In addition, considering the close linkage between PBP and PF4 genes and their coordinated high level expression in developing megakaryocytes, our analysis of PBP gene expression may complement and extend the knowledge already obtained about the regulated expression of the PF4 gene. In this paper, we first demonstrated that the duplicated PBP gene is a non-expressing pseudogene. Next using megakaryocyte-like cell lines, we localized a pyrimidine-rich region in the upstream region of the functional PBP gene which contained a critical positive regulatory element(s) for PBP gene expression. Within this domain, we showed that an Ets-binding element is indispensable for PBP promoter activity. By mobility shift and expression studies, we demonstrated that the protein that bound to this Ets element was the hematopoietic-specific Ets family factor PU.1. Finally, to extend our studies with megakaryocytic cell lines, we also studied PBP gene expression within wild-type or PU.1−/−null embryonic stem (ES) cells which were differentiated into megakaryocytes in vitro. We found that the mouse PBP gene expression level dropped more than 4-fold in PU.1 knockout ES cells compared with wild-type. In contrast to this, the absence of PU.1 expression had little effect on the expression of two other platelet-specific genes, αIIb and PF4.DISCUSSIONTissue-specific expression of a gene often occurs at the transcriptional level and may simply require the binding of a tissue specifically expressed factor to the regulatory element of the gene or may need a unique combination of several factors (49Tjian R. Sci. Am. 1995; 272: 55-61Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 50Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Megakaryocytopoiesis is the process by which the multipotential stem cells in bone marrow differentiate into mature megakaryocytes. It is characterized by significant morphological changes as well as the expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes (51Mazur E.M. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 340-350PubMed Google Scholar, 52Avraham H. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 53Gewirtz A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Given the fact that this process is not completely understood and only a few megakaryocytic genes have been studied in detail, our studies on the regulation of PBP gene, which is exclusively expressed in megakaryocytes should contribute to the understanding of mechanisms controlling gene expression in this hematopoietic lineage.In this paper, we examined the 5′-flanking region of the megakaryocyte-specific PBP gene initially using an in vitrotransient expression system. We found that a minimum of 109 bp of upstream sequences was enough for promoter activity in megakaryocytic cell lines. Within this region we identified a putative binding site for the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. By conducting mobility shift analysis and expression studies, we confirmed that PU.1 bound to its cognate site in this region and was necessary for PBP promoter activity.The biological role of PU.1 in PBP regulation was further confirmed by our analysis of its expression level in PU.1+/+ wild-type and PU.1−/− null ES cells which were differentiated in the presence of thrombopoietin along with other growth factors. These cells resembled megakaryocytes both morphologically and immunologically. Furthermore, these cells express several megakaryocyte-specific genes. Results from these studies showed that PBP expression decreased significantly in cells not expressing PU.1. This corroborates the results from our in vitro studies using megakaryocytic cell lines.PU.1 was first discovered as an oncogene leading to the development of several virus-induced tumors (54Paul R. Schuetze S. Kozak S.L. Kozak C.A. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 464-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Ray D. Culine S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 663-668PubMed Google Scholar). This Ets family member has been shown to be normally expressed only in hematopoietic tissues, predominantly in B lymphocytic, granulocytic, and monocytic cells (42Hromas R. Orazi A. Neiman R.S. Maki R. Beveran C.V. Moore J. Klemsz M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In accordance with its specific expression pattern, it has been shown to function as a major transcription activator in the expression of lineage-specific genes within these cells (56Moreau-Gachelin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163PubMed Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that PU.1 is able to recruit and interact with another nuclear factor NF-EM5 at the immunoglobulin κ 3′-enhancer region, thereby promoting expression (35Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The myeloid cell-specific c-fes promoter is regulated by Sp1, PU.1, and an unidentified transcription factor. Furthermore, PU.1 can transactivate the c-fes promoter in non-myeloid cell lines (57Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor is expressed exclusively in myeloid cells and placenta (58Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1990; 61: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 59Tweardy D.J. Anderson K. Cannizzaro L.A. Steinman R.A. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Blood. 1992; 79: 1148-1154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression studies show that the 1391-bp fragment of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter is both active in myeloid cell lines and tissue-specific. Two PU.1-binding sites are localized at +36 and +43 of 5′-untranslated region and are shown to be important for the promoter activity since mutation of them reduces promoter activity to 75% (60Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Targeted disruption of the PU.1 gene in mice produces a late gestation lethal mutation that appears to result in a major disruption of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages (61Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that some of the genes regulated by PU.1, such as CD11b, CD18, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor have been shown to play important roles in development, survival, and function of these lineages. However, the megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages appear to be morphologically intact, despite observations by others that both lineages normally express PU.1 (42Hromas R. Orazi A. Neiman R.S. Maki R. Beveran C.V. Moore J. Klemsz M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no platelet counts were determined in these animals, and whether the megakaryocytes in these PU.1−/− null mice have any subtle abnormalities has not been examined. Our data using differentiated ES cells are consistent with the observations with the PU.1−/− null mice. All three megakaryocyte-specific genes continued to be expressed, although PBP gene expression is significantly reduced. Thus, we anticipate that the PU.1−/− null mice may have morphologically intact megakaryocytes, but may have significant qualitative abnormalities in the expression of some of the megakaryocyte-specific genes.An interesting parallel can be made with the analysis of the targeted disruption of the gene for another hematopoietic-restricted nuclear factor, GATA-1 (62Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). It has been shown that GATA-1 is expressed in megakaryocytes (63Martin D.I. Zon L.I. Mutter G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 64Romeo P.H. Prandini M.H. Joulin V. Mignotte V. Prenant M. Vainchenker W. Marguerie G. Uzan G. Nature. 1990; 344: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and is critical for significant expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes αIIb in transient expression systems (21Prandini M.H. Uzan G. Martin F. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10370-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of this factor in the myeloid cell line 416B induces the expression of megakaryocytic markers, and treatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine induces megakaryocytic differentiation with concurrent up-regulation of endogenous GATA-1 (65Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 66Visvader J. Adams J.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GATA-1− null ES cells contribute to megakaryocytes in chimeric mice, and megakaryocytes are present in GATA-1− multilineage hematopoietic colonies obtained from chimeric yolk sac or fetal liver. Furthermore, circulating platelets derived from GATA-1− embryonic stem cells are present in chimeric mice (67Pevny L. Chyuan-Sheng L. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that megakaryocytopoiesis occurs in these mice despite an important role of GATA-1 in the regulated expression of a number of megakaryocyte-specific genes. Whether the GATA-1 knockout cells that undergo megakaryocytopoiesis have quantitative differences in the expression of megakaryocytic-specific genes as described here for the PBP gene in PU.1−/− null ES cells remains unknown.At the moment, the explanation of how normal megakaryocytopoiesis can proceed with the absence of important nuclear factors such as GATA-1 and PU.1 is unclear. One possibility is that while GATA-1 and PU.1 are important for certain megakaryocytic genes to be expressed, they are not necessary for the survival and development of the megakaryocyte precursor. Alternatively, redundancy and overlapping function of transcription factors within a family may explain the continued megakaryocytopoiesis. For GATA-1, it may be that the coincident expression of another GATA family member, GATA-2, can substitute for GATA-1, allowing megakaryocytopoiesis to occur (68Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 69Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, increased GATA-2 expression was detected in erythroid cells cultured from GATA-1-null ES cells (70Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). If this model is right, it would suggest that there is another Ets family member in the developing megakaryocytes that may be able to substitute for PU.1 and that this redundancy protects megakaryocytopoiesis in the PU.1 knockout animal. Therefore, the possibility exists that other megakaryocyte-specific genes depend on PU.1 binding for their megakaryocyte-specific expression, and further studies of other megakaryocyte-specific genes and the role of PU.1 in their regulated expression need to be examined. Circulating platelets play a major role in thrombus formation at the site of tissue injury. These anucleate cellular fragments arise from precursor cells called megakaryocytes which are characterized by their large size, polyploid nucleus, and rarity in the bone marrow (1Biggs R. Human Blood Coagulation, Haemostasis and Thrombosis. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1976Google Scholar). These cells, in turn, arise from self-regenerating pluripotent stem cells which also lead to all other hematopoietic lineages. Megakaryocyte differentiation involves a series of steps of increasing lineage commitment. The end result of this process is the diploid megakaryoblast, which in its continued development, undergoes nuclear endoreduplication, growth in cytoplasmic size, development of α-granules and other granules, and expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes (2Worthington R.E. Nakeff A. Micko S. Cytometry. 1984; 5: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature megakaryocytes then release platelets into the peripheral bloodstream (4Mazur E.M. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 340-350PubMed Google Scholar). When platelets are activated by agonist such as thrombin, the α-granules release their contents into the surrounding medium. Platelet basic protein (PBP) 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, platelet basic protein; β-TG, β-thromboglobulin; PF4, platelet factor-4; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; EBs, embryoid bodies; HEL, human erythroleukemia; CHRF, Children's Hospital Research Foundation. 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, platelet basic protein; β-TG, β-thromboglobulin; PF4, platelet factor-4; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ES, embryonic stem; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; EBs, embryoid bodies; HEL, human erythroleukemia; CHRF, Children's Hospital Research Foundation.is one of several proteins released during this process and belongs to the chemokine family of inflammatory mediators. PBP is only present in megakaryocytes and platelets, and represents ∼2% of the total platelet protein on a molar basis (5Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Sem. Hematol. 1985; 22: 151-163PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of this protein is not completely clear. PBP has been reported to undergo post-translational modifications giving rise to two N-terminally cleaved products, connective tissue-activating peptide III and β-thromboglobulin (β-TG). Additionally, β-TG can undergo further N-terminal cleavage to form neutrophil-activating peptide-2, which is a potent activator of neutrophils (6Wenger R.H. Wicki A.N. Walz A. Kieffer K. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1498-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Begg G.S. Pepper D.S. Chesterman C.N. Morgan F.J.

PBP shares 60% homology to platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is another megakaryocyte-specific protein. These two proteins are expressed at similar times during megakaryocyte development. And while it appears clear that PBP has a role in inflammation, the biological role(s) of PF4 is currently less well defined (9Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 10Stoeckle M.Y. Barker K.A. The New Biologist. 1990; 2: 313-323PubMed Google Scholar, 11Majerus P.W. Miletich J.P. Annu. Rev.

The gene for the human PBP protein was first cloned in our laboratory. We have demonstrated that this gene is divided into three exons and proceeded 30 bp upstream by a canonical TATA box (13Majumdar S. Gonder D. Koutsis B. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5785-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of the physical organization of the PBP gene locus showed that the human PBP gene is immediately upstream of the PF4 gene, facing in the same 5′ → 3′ direction and forming a gene pair occupying <7 kb. In addition, these two genes are linked within ∼1 megabase pairs with other CXC chemokine genes on the long arm of chromosome 4 (14Griffin C.A. Emanuel B.S. Larocco P. Schwartz E. Poncz M. Cytogenet.

To address the functional role of this domain, we have constructed a Cdc42Hs/Ras chimera in which loop 8 from Ha-Ras was substituted for the region in Cdc42Hs that contains the 13-amino acid insert region. Our data indicate that the insert region of Cdc42Hs is not essential for its interactions with various target/effector molecules or for interactions with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Dbl, or the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (GAP). However, the regulation of GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis on Cdc42Hs by the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) is extremely sensitive to changes in the insert region, such that a Cdc42Hs/Ha-Ras chimera that lacks this insert is no longer susceptible to a GDI-induced inhibition of GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis. The insensitivity to GDI activity is not due to the inability of the GDI molecule to bind to the Cdc42Hs/Ha-Ras chimera, and in fact, the GDI is fully capable of stimulating the release of this chimera from membranes.

A variety of biological signaling events are mediated through a number of GTP-binding proteins, which serve as molecular switches that transduce incoming signals to downstream targets. In particular, the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins (which includes Cdc42Hs, Rac, and Rho) has received a great deal of attention in the past few years. These proteins were shown to be implicated in the signal transduction pathways of various external stimuli (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor, phorbol esters, bradykinin (1Hawkins P. Eguinoa A.

At present, two distinct types of signaling cascades, which are initiated by the activation of Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins, have been delineated. One involves the stimulation of soluble serine/threonine kinases, designated the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GMP-PNP, β:γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). A second and seemingly independent class of signaling events translates the activation of Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins into cytoskeletal rearrangements (10Hall A. Science. 1990; 249: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). These events may involve both direct interactions between the GTP-binding proteins and cytoskeletal elements (e.g. the interaction between Rac1 and tubulin (11Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) and interactions between the GTP-binding proteins and target molecules that serve to mediate effects on actin and myosin (e.g. WASP (12Aspenström P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), IQGAP (13Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and Rho kinase (15Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J.

Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar)). Activation and deactivation processes of signaling through Rho-like GTP-binding proteins are similar to those observed for other small GTP-binding proteins as well as for heterotrimeric G proteins. Thus, activation is achieved via GTP → GDP exchange (mediated by external factors, termed GEFs), and deactivation is mediated through GTP hydrolysis and further accelerated by interactions with regulators termed GAPs (17Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Unique to the Rho (and Rab) family members is the existence of a third type of regulator, called a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). These proteins inhibit GDP dissociation as well as GTP hydrolysis (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, they were shown to facilitate the release of the GTP-binding proteins from membranes (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that it is felt that virtually all of the cytosolic Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins are complexed to GDIs (20Regazzi R. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While considerable advances have recently been made in the identification of the different biological activities mediated by Rho-like GTP-binding proteins, the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses are still largely unknown. Rho family members share significant homology with other GTP-binding proteins both in amino acid sequence and in structural motifs (21Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Thus, all GTP- binding proteins seem to share a common structural unit (exemplified by the structure of Ras), which is responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, accompanied by regions of specific effector/regulator interactions. For example, the switch 1 and 2 regions (residues 32–45 and 60–70, respectively), which show dramatic changes upon the transitions between the GTP- and GDP-bound states, are highly conserved among all of the small GTP-binding proteins, thus pointing to common mechanisms for target/effector and regulatory protein interactions that are supplemented by residues that ensure specificity. However, one clear deviation from the common folding motifs of small GTP-binding proteins is a 13-amino acid insertion, unique to the Rho subfamily proteins. In this report, we study the functional role of this insert region in Cdc42Hs and show that it is essential for the regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange by the RhoGDI. The ΔL8-Cdc42Hs mutant contains a short sequence of loop 8 of Ha-Ras (121AARTVES127) in place of the insert region of Cdc42Hs (residues 120–139); its construction was described earlier (14McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The activated (GTPase-defective) version of this mutant was produced by an otherwise identical procedure, except for the template DNA, which was Cdc42Hs (Q61L) in pET15b. CAAX-Ras is a replacement mutation of c-Ha-Ras in which the COOH-terminal 19 residues (171LNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS189) of Ras are replaced by the eight COOH-terminal residues of Cdc42Hs, (184KSRRCVLL191). The CAAX-Ras construct was prepared by the polymerase chain reaction using a pET15b upstream primer (sense, 5′-CTA TAG GGG AAT TGT GAG CGG-3′), c-Ha-Ras in pET15b as a template, and a downstream primer encoding the eight COOH-terminal amino acids of Cdc42Hs (antisense, 5′-GTC GAC GAA TTC TCA TAG CAG CAC ACA CCT GCG GCT CTT TTT CCG CAG TTT ATG CTG CCG-3′). FC-Ras is a replacement mutation in c-Ha-Ras in which the carboxyl terminus is replaced with that of Cdc42Hs (identical to CAAX-Ras described above) and loop 8 of Ras (residues 121–127) is replaced with the Rho insert region (residues 120–139 from Cdc42Hs). This construct was generated using an overlapping polymerase chain reaction, with CAAX-Ras (see above) as a template, external pET15b vector primers (sense 5′-CTA TAG GGG AAT TGT GAG CGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCC ACC TGA CTT CTA AGA AAC C-3′), and two internal primers (sense, 5′-GAG AAG CTT GCC AAG AAC AAA CAG AAG CCT ATC ACT CCA CGG CAG GCC CAG GAC CTT GCT-3′; antisense 5′-GTT CTT GGC AAG CTT CTC AAT AGT AGA GGG GTC ATC TCT CAG GTC ACA CTT GTT GCC CAC-3′). All polymerase chain reaction-derived constructs were sequenced in the final expression vector (pET15b). Histidine-tagged Cdc42Hs (and its mutants) were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2+affinity chromatography followed by thrombin proteolysis of the tag and further purification on Q Sepharose (27Leonard D.A. Sartoskar R. Wu J.W. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cloning of wild type and ΔL8 Cdc42Hs into the insect cell baculovirus vector was achieved using the restriction sites XbaI and BamHI in pET15b, purification of the ∼800-kilobase pair fragment (which includes the hexahistidine tag), and ligation into the insect cell transfer vector pVL1392 digested with the same enzymes. Cloning of CAAX-Ras and FC-Ras into pVL1392 was achieved similarly using the enzymes BglII and EcoRI. Recombinant virus was produced and used for infection of Sf21 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Frozen insect cells pellets were lysed by Dounce homogenization in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm NaN3, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml (each) of leupeptin and aprotonin, followed by low speed centrifugation (10 min, 1, 500 rpm, 4 °C, IEC CRU-5000 centrifuge) to remove cell debris. The membrane fraction was then pelleted (12,000 rpm, Beckman JA20 rotor, 20 min), washed twice in resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaN3, 100 mm NaCl, 3.75 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GDP, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotonin), and solubilized in the same buffer supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) CHAPS. The solubilized membranes were then cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a Ni2+-diaminoacetic acid-agarose column (1 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaN3, 1 μg/ml aprotonin and leupeptin, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm imidazole. After extensive washing with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% CHAPS, 40 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 μg/ml aprotonin and leupeptin, the protein was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 0.3m NaCl and 200 mm imidazole. GST-RhoGDI was expressed in E. coli and purified using glutathione-agarose as described earlier (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Mammalian cell culture, transient transfections, immunoprecipitations, and PAK activity assays were described earlier (7Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Dissociation and hydrolysis assays with radioactive nucleotides were done as described earlier (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Antibodies directed against IQGAP and also the recombinant (insect cell-produced) GRD domain of IQGAP were generous gifts of Dr. M. Hart (Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). Amino acid sequence alignment of the various Rho subtype proteins with Ha-Ras and other members of the Ras subfamily indicates the presence of an ∼20-amino acid “insert,” which is unique to Cdc42Hs, Rac, Rho, and other members of the Rho subfamily (24Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Sutcliff M. Feltham J. Cerione R. Oswald R. Protein Pept. Lett. 1995; 1: 84-91Google Scholar). In the recently described x-ray crystallographic structure of Rac1 bound to GMP-PNP, this insert region was shown to form a separate (mostly helical) structural element attached to a Ras-like GTPase core (26Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Since the biological activities and the molecular interactions of members of the Rho subfamily are significantly different from those of Ras and since the insert is unique to all Rho proteins, we have investigated the role of this region in Cdc42Hs by constructing a chimeric mutant (designated here as ΔL8) in which the “Rho insert” region of Cdc42Hs (residues 120–139) is replaced by a short sequence from loop 8 in Ha-Ras (residues 121–127). The amino acid sequence alignment of Ha-Ras and Cdc42Hs in this region as well as the corresponding region in the chimeric ΔL8 mutant are shown in Fig.1. The protein can be expressed inE. coli as well as in Sf21 insect cells as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and purified using minor alterations to our previously described protocols (23Leonard D.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly clear in the past few years that the activation of Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins leads to the stimulation of multiple target/effector molecules, resulting in divergent phenotypic responses. One established signaling cascade involves the direct interaction of GTP-bound Cdc42Hs (or Rac1) with members of the PAK family of soluble serine/threonine kinases (6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 7Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To test the role of the Rho insert in PAK activation, we have directly assayed the ability of the recombinant ΔL8 mutant of Cdc42Hs to activate the auto- and exophosphorylating activity of mPAK-3 in vitro. In these studies, mPAK-3 was first transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and then immunoprecipitated using a hemagglutinin tag (7Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and incubated with either the wild-type Cdc42Hs or the ΔL8 protein (complexed with either GTPγS or GDP) in the presence of MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylation substrate myelin basic protein. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualization of the phosphorylated products by autoradiography, it was evident that the activation of mPAK-3 by either wild-type Cdc42Hs or ΔL8 was essentially identical, thus ruling out the participation of the insert region of Cdc42Hs in the binding or activation of this target (Fig.2). It is now apparent that mPAK-3 is only one of a large number of proteins that represent putative targets for Cdc42Hs and Rac and possess a homologous domain that mediates their interaction with the GTP-binding proteins, designated the PBD (p21-binding domain; Ref. 6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) or CRIB motif (Cdc42- and Rac-interacting binding motif; Ref. 28Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have directly compared the binding of the wild-type GST-Cdc42Hs fusion protein and the GST-ΔL8 fusion protein with the CRIB domain-containing targets ACK (for activated-Cdc42 kinase; Ref.29Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and WASP (for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein; Ref. 30Symons M. Derry J. Karlak B.

Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) as assessed by their co-precipitation following the addition of glutathione-agarose. The results of these studies verified that the absence of the insert region in the ΔL8 mutant does not affect the association of Cdc42Hs with either of these putative target molecules (data not shown). Two recently identified targets for Cdc42Hs represent the two isoforms of IQGAP, a ubiquitous 190-kDa protein that shares homology with the RasGAP and contains a number of potential signaling motifs including the IQ/calmodulin-binding domain and a calponin homology domain (13Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,14McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the striking morphological changes associated with Cdc42Hs activation (3Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and the fact that the IQGAPs contain an actin-binding (i.e. calponin homology) domain and localize to the actin cytoskeleton (13Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the IQGAP proteins will play a critical role in translating Cdc42Hs signaling events into cytoskeletal rearrangements. To test whether the Rho insert region of Cdc42Hs participates in mediating this interaction, we have constructed a double mutant that contains both the Rho insert ΔL8 mutation and an activating mutation Q61L, which renders Cdc42Hs GTPase-defective (27Leonard D.A. Sartoskar R. Wu J.W. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This Cdc42Hs-Q61L/ΔL8 mutant was cloned into the mammalian hemagglutinin-tagged expression vector pKH3 and transiently transfected into cultured COS-7 cells. Anti-hemagglutinin (7Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) antibodies were then used to immunoprecipitate the expressed protein, and the association of endogenous IQGAP with the precipitated Cdc42Hs was assayed by Western blotting with an anti-IQGAP antibody. These experiments showed that the ΔL8 protein was capable of associating with IQGAP in vivo (data not shown). To further quantitate this interaction, we have compared the binding of wild-type Cdc42Hs and the Cdc42Hs-ΔL8 protein with the carboxyl-terminal (97-kDa) half of the IQGAP1 molecule that contains the Cdc42Hs-binding site (also termed GRD (13Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)) using a fluorescence spectroscopic assay that monitors the quenching of a reporter group attached to Cdc42Hs (32Nomanbhoy T. Leonard D.A. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4602-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We found that the Cdc42Hs-ΔL8 bound the GRD with a 2–3-fold weaker affinity, compared with the binding exhibited by wild-type Cdc42Hs. 2T. Nomanbhoy and R. Cerione, unpublished observation. These results were consistent with earlier reports of a weakened affinity between the ΔL8 protein and IQGAP1 based on competition experiments (14McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, while the insert region is not essential for IQGAP binding to Cdc42Hs, it may influence the overall binding affinity for the interaction as well as potentially influence Cdc42Hs-induced changes in IQGAP tertiary structure that may play an important role in signaling. Two different families of proteins have been identified that regulate the activation and deactivation of Cdc42Hs. One family of regulators are the GEFs, which promote the activation of GTP-binding proteins by stimulating GTP ↔ GDP exchange. Members of the Dbl family of oncoproteins have been shown to be the physiological activators of the Rho family GTP-binding proteins. The prototype for this family is the Dbl oncoprotein which was shown to act as a GEF for Cdc42Hs and RhoA in vitro (33Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 17Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A second class of regulators, the GAPs, stimulate the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Rho subfamily proteins (thereby accelerating their deactivation) and represent a relatively large family for which the Cdc42-GAP is a prototype (34Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of the insert region in the stimulation of GTP-GDP exchange by GEFs, we compared the abilities of the wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 protein to undergo Dbl-stimulated nucleotide exchange (33Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Cdc42Hs proteins were complexed with [3H]GDP and incubated in the presence of unlabeled GDP, and then the amount of protein-bound radioactivity was measured at various time points following the addition of the recombinant oncogenic Dbl protein. We found that the Dbl-induced nucleotide dissociation was essentially identical in both wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 protein, thereby eliminating the possibility of a critical role for the insert region in the functional interaction between Cdc42Hs and its GEF (see Table I).Table IGTP hydrolysis and guanine nucleotide exchange rates for wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 proteint 1/2 for Dbl-induced GDP exchange1-aHalf-life values for the nucleotide exchange reaction were obtained by measuring the protein-bound radioactivity remaining at different times after the Dbl addition and fitting those data to a single exponential process.Intrinsic GTPase1-bIntrinsic velocity represents the slope of the tryptophan fluorescence change in the first 20 s after the Mg2+addition [see Ref. 23].GAP sensitivity1-cFor GAP sensitivity experiments, the slope (for the tryptophan fluorescence change) was measured in the presence of five different GAP concentrations (5–40 nm), and a specific activity curve (velocity versus [GAP]) was constructed, the slope of which is reported here.mins −1s −1 nm GAP −1Wild type1.453.6 × 10−67.4 × 10−3ΔL81.381.07 × 10−68.2 × 10−3Hydrolysis rates were measured by monitoring the time-dependent increase in tryptophan fluorescence following EDTA loading with GTP as described by Leonard et al.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2, followed by the addition of catalytic amounts of the Cdc42GAP. Nucleotide exchange was measured by loading the protein with [3H]GDP and measuring protein-bound radioactivity using the nitrocellulose filtration assay. To determine whether the Rho insert region is required for GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs, we have utilized a fluorescence assay based on the nucleotide-sensitive fluorescence emission from the single tryptophan in the Cdc42Hs protein (Trp97; Ref. 21Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Also shown in Table I are the rates of GTP hydrolysis measured for wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 proteins, in the presence and absence of the Cdc42-GAP. These data show that the removal of the insert region from Cdc42Hs has no effect on either the intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity or the GAP-stimulated activity. The RhoGDI proteins were originally purified as an activity that inhibited GDP dissociation from the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42Hs proteins (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Yamamoto J. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9373-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, GDI proteins were shown to cause the release of post-translationally modified Rho subfamily proteins from their membrane location to the soluble fraction (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since RhoGDI does not exhibit any of these effects on E. coli-expressed GTP-binding proteins, it was assumed that the geranyl-geranylation of Cdc42Hs (or Rac or RhoA) at its carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif was required for interactions with the GDI. However, at present little is known regarding the specific mode of binding that occurs between the GDI and Cdc42 (or related GTP-binding proteins) and whether other regions, aside from the carboxyl-terminal domains of the GTP-binding proteins, are necessary for these interactions. In these studies, we have used insect cell baculovirus expression systems to obtain modified, membrane-bound wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 protein and compared their abilities to functionally couple to the RhoGDI. We first tested the ability of the RhoGDI to release the ΔL8 and wild-type Cdc42Hs proteins from insect cell membrane preparations. In this assay, isolated insect cell membranes, containing post-translationally modified Cdc42Hs, were incubated with the GST-RhoGDI fusion protein. Membrane-bound (pellet) and soluble (supernatant) fractions were then separated using high speed centrifugation, and the respective fractions were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, in the absence of RhoGDI, all of the Cdc42Hs protein remains associated with the membrane pellet, whereas in the presence of GDI, a significant portion of Cdc42Hs is extracted to the soluble supernatant. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the ΔL8 mutant behaves in an identical manner to wild-type Cdc42Hs in this assay. Thus, removal of the surface loop formed by residues 120–134 did not impair the ability of the GDI to mediate the release of Cdc42Hs from membrane fractions. These results then indicate that the GDI regulatory protein can both bind to the ΔL8 protein and induce the necessary conformational changes within the GTP-binding protein to cause its dissociation from membranes. We then tested whether the RhoGDI was able to influence guanine nucleotide binding to the ΔL8 protein. For this purpose, purified insect cell-expressed wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 protein were first complexed with 3H-labeled GDP and then diluted into a buffer containing 7 mm EDTA and excess unlabeled GDP (18Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Aliquots were then taken at different time points, and the amount of protein-bound radioactive nucleotide was measured by filtration and scintillation counting. As shown in Fig.4 A, in the absence of GDI, the bound (radioactive) nucleotide was rapidly replaced by unlabeled GDP (t½ = 1.6 min), whereas preincubation of Cdc42Hs with RhoGDI greatly inhibited GDP dissociation from the wild-type protein (t½ = 12.2 min). However, surprisingly, the GDI was not able to inhibit GDP dissociation from the ΔL8 protein. The [3H]GDP bound to ΔL8 was displaced rapidly (t½ < 1 min), even when the GTP-binding protein was incubated with a significant (20-fold) excess of RhoGDI. We have consistently found that EDTA-induced nucleotide dissociation is more rapid from the ΔL8 mutant protein then from wild-type Cdc42Hs (by ∼1.5-fold; see Fig. 4). Presumably, in the absence of Mg2+ ions, the insert region contributes to the binding of GDP, and therefore, nucleotide dissociation is more rapid upon deletion of this domain. During the initial characterization of RhoGDI, it was shown that the membrane-releasing activity was not influenced by the nature of the nucleotide bound to Cdc42Hs. On the other hand, inhibition of nucleotide dissociation was preferentially observed with GDP-bound Cdc42Hs. However, complex formation between Cdc42Hs·GTP and RhoGDI markedly inhibited GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42Hs (both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated activity). We have tested whether the presence of RhoGDI affects GTP hydrolysis by the ΔL8 protein. Purified, insect cell-expressed wild-type and ΔL8 proteins were complexed to [γ-32P]GTP, and the GTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 in the presence or absence of RhoGDI. As seen in Fig. 5 A, the GTPase activity of the wild-type Cdc42Hs protein was markedly inhibited by RhoGDI. With the ΔL8 protein (Fig. 5 B), however, no inhibition of the GTP hydrolytic reaction occurred, even when a large excess of RhoGDI was added. Given the marked effect of the ΔL8 mutation on the functional coupling of Cdc42Hs to RhoGDI, we were interested in assessing the contribution of the insert region to the overall binding interaction between the two proteins. Toward this end, we have estimated the relative efficiency of the wild-type and ΔL8 Cdc42Hs proteins in competing the functional assay shown in Fig. 4. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 6. Both wild-type Cdc42Hs and the ΔL8 protein show the same dose-dependent competition for RhoGDI (i.e. the concentration for 50% competition was ∼2 μm). Thus, we conclude that the Cdc42Hs(ΔL8) exhibits an essentially identical affinity toward the RhoGDI as the wild-type protein. Taken together, our results clearly show that the Rho insert region does not serve as an essential motif for binding a variety of Cdc42Hs targets, nor for the functional interactions of either the GEF (Dbl) or the Cdc42-GAP. However, it does play a critical role in the ability of the RhoGDI to influence nucleotide exchange and inhibit GDP dissociation. Thus, to our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a regulatory role for the Rho insert region. In the related Rac1 protein, substitution and deletion mutations within the insert region (residues 124–135) were shown to result in the loss of productive interactions between the GTP-binding protein and the Rac-specific target, the NADPH oxidase (24Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It was not reported whether these mutants of Rac were also defective in their interactions with GDI, but given the high degree of sequence homology between the two proteins in the insert region (70% identity), it is likely that GDI-induced inhibition of nucleotide exchange will occur in Rac (and RhoA) as well."
https://openalex.org/W2024039311,"Converting cysteine 543 to tyrosine in the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) introduces both a basolateral sorting signal and an internalization signal into the HA cytoplasmic domain. Another HA mutant, HA+8, contains eight additional amino acids at the end of the cytoplasmic domain that include a powerful internalization signal. HA+8 was also sorted efficiently to the basolateral surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The simplest explanation for the observation that multiple sorting phenotypes depend upon the same small amino acid sequence is that certain tyrosine-based internalization signals might also function as basolateral sorting signals. To test this hypothesis, second-site mutations were introduced into HA C543Y or HA+8 to determine if the internalization and basolateral sorting functions can be separated. For HA C543Y, the same sequence positions were important for both basolateral sorting and internalization, but the two functions responded differently to individual amino acid replacements, indicating that they were distinct. For HA+8, the basolateral sorting signal required the same tyrosine as the internalization signal, but did not share any other characteristics. Thus, even when basolateral sorting signals that depend on tyrosine overlap or are co-linear with internalizations signals, the two sorting processes are sensitive to different characteristics of the sequence.

The language of molecular recognition used to identify and segregate proteins to the locations where they must function is crucial to the organization of all cells. Some of the basic vocabulary of this process, the sorting signals used by the cell to classify proteins for transport, have recently been identified (1Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev.

However, this knowledge has not yet led to any unified hypothesis explaining how sorting is accomplished, and current understanding of the mechanisms controlling intracellular protein traffic is still poorly developed. For membrane proteins, the continuous line of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; LDL, low density lipoprotein. cells have been an extremely useful model for investigating the regulation of intracellular protein transport. MDCK cells form monolayers of columnar epithelial cells in culture in which adjacent cells are joined by junctional complexes that physically separate the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane into two separate membrane domains (4Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 5Nelson W.J. Science. 1992; 258: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The apical domain of MDCK cells contains different proteins and lipids from the basolateral domain and is also functionally distinct. Endocytosis is slower from the apical surface (6Bomsel M.

Cell adhesion proteins and extracellular matrix proteins are transported specifically to this surface. Proteins and lipids bound for both surface membrane domains have been observed together in the Golgi complex and trans Golgi network, suggesting that the trans Golgi network might be the site for sorting apical and basolateral proteins (4Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences have been identified in a number of proteins that are necessary and sufficient for delivery to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. These fall into two groups functionally, those that overlap internalization signals (9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Le Bivic A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and those that do not (11Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 13Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The sorting signals currently identified are sufficiently diverse in primary sequence and predicted secondary structure that one cannot exclude the possibility that there are several parallel mechanisms for recognizing basolateral proteins, each using a separate class of sorting signals. A similar situation exists for apical proteins. In addition to the possibility that parallel sorting mechanisms may operate to direct certain classes of proteins to the cell surface, there is good evidence that there is more than one pathway for travelling to certain membrane domains. Recently two reports have indicated that the sorting signals recognized during exocytosis are recognized again in endosomes after proteins are internalized (13Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Missorted proteins with defective basolateral sorting signals, or proteins with weak basolateral signals that were transported to the apical surface when overexpressed, were preferentially transcytosed to the correct surface domain rather than recycling back to the domain from which they were internalized. In contrast, proteins correctly targeted to the cell surface were recycled back to the correct membrane domain after internalization. The observation that sorting occurs in both the endocytic and exocytic pathways in MDCK cells raises the possibility that in this cell type, internalization signals function as a type of basolateral sorting signal, thus ensuring that endocytic receptors are efficiently localized to the basolateral domain. To investigate the nature of sorting signals controlling the traffic of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells, we have analyzed the sequence requirements for two basolateral signals that overlap internalization signals. These sequences were studied in the context of HA, which normally lacks basolateral sorting signals and is transported to the apical surface. The cytoplasmic domain of HA is quite small, predicted to contain only 12 amino acids (15Naim H.Y. Amarneh B. Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7585-7588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when we observed that a single, randomly selected amino acid change of cysteine to tyrosine at position 543 created both an internalization signal (16Lazarovits J. Roth M. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and a basolateral sorting signal (9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), one possible interpretation was that both sorting events might use a common signal in MDCK cells. A second explanation was that certain basolateral sorting signals containing tyrosine might only resemble internalization signals at the level of primary sequence, perhaps because one had evolved from the other. Both types of signal might be quite degenerate with respect to primary sequence, so that the number of sequences capable of functioning as each type of signal would be fairly large. Recently several proteins have been shown to contain basolateral sorting signals that overlap, but are distinct from, internalization signals (12Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas in Fc receptors the same residues appear necessary for both functions (17Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed possible that by chance we might have constructed in HA C543Y a sequence that, while suboptimal for both internalization and basolateral sorting, nevertheless functioned for both. To investigate this possibility, we have made lines of polarized MDCK cells that express proteins with a series of mutations in the cytoplasmic domains of two HAs with different internalization signals and have determined their sorting and internalization properties. All commercial chemicals were obtained from Sigma, except as noted. Polyclonal serum from a rabbit immunized with A/Japan/305 virus glycoproteins was used to immunoprecipitate HA. MDCK cells were routinely cultured in plastic dishes and were grown on Costar (Cambridge, MA) Transwell filter inserts for experiments, as described (9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mutant HA proteins were constructed by megaprimer polymerase chain reaction on 500-base pair DNA fragments encoding the carboxyl terminus of HA as described previously (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For each mutant, the region encoding HA was sequenced to verify the mutation and then the fragments were subcloned into the expression vector pCB6HA (20Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and transfected into the MDCK subline D5 (21Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 789-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to published protocols (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except where noted, cells were selected for resistance to G418 and used for experiments without subcloning, to control for possible effects of clonal variation. Expression levels in uncloned populations were similar to those of clonal lines derived from them (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments employing HA C543Y were performed on one of two permanently expressing transfected cell lines described in a previous study (9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 15 h prior to all experiments except for those measuring the effect of varying sodium butyrate on protein expression. Experiments on HA mutants produced during an alanine scan of the HA+8 sequence were performed with a minimum of three independently cloned cell lines. Although the expression level of the clones varied, none produced more protein under any condition that did the reference clonal cell lines expressing HA+8. The sorting of HA+8 to the basolateral surface (99%) did not change significantly when cells were treated with 10 mm sodium butyrate. Experiments investigating the effect of amino acid replacements at position 549 of HA+8 were performed on uncloned populations of transfected MDCK D5 cells that expressed similar levels of HA+8 as did clonal lines isolated during the alanine scan. Cells were washed four times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ + Mg2+ at room temperature to remove excess cysteine and methionine, then were prestarved for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) lacking these amino acids. Cells were labeled from the basal side with Trans35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Cosa Mesa, CA) at a concentration of 2.5 mCi/ml in the same medium by placing the Transwell insert on a drop of 0.15 ml of labeling medium on Parafilm, using 0.4 ml of the same medium without label to keep the apical side wet. For experiments that measured the polarity of surface expression, the filters were incubated at 20 °C for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium having one-third normal bicarbonate and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. At the end of this chase, the medium was replaced with medium at 37 °C, and cells were chased at 37 °C in a circulating water bath. Each measurement of delivery of a protein to the cell surface consisted of three filters, one chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, one in which trypsin was present at 10 μg/ml in the apical medium and soybean trypsin inhibitor at 10 μg/ml in the basolateral medium during the chase, and one chased with soybean trypsin inhibitor in the apical and trypsin in the basal compartment (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Matlin K.S. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were chased at 37 °C for 45 min, then were placed on ice. The medium containing trypsin was then replaced with medium containing 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the cells were incubated an additional 15–30 min on ice to inhibit any remaining trypsin activity. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fluorography, and densitometry were as described previously (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For HA C543Y and second-site mutants of that protein, internalization of the mutant proteins was measured at the basolateral surface of cells in monolayers grown on filter culture inserts as described previously (8Naim H.Y. Dodds D.T. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For mutants of HA+8, subconfluent MDCK cells on six-well culture dishes were pulse-labeled and chased for intervals between 20 and 120 min at 37 °C, and the fraction of each protein accessible to trypsin included in cell culture medium during this chase was compared with the fraction of each protein that was accessible to trypsin added only at 4 °C at the end of the chase. For all mutant HA+8 proteins the fraction of protein outside the cell did not change after 80 min of chase, indicating that all were exported at essentially the same rate. The possibility of overlapping, distinct sorting signals in a protein can be directly tested by site-directed mutagenesis. If one signal serves for both internalization and basolateral sorting, any second site mutations that change the activity of one of the two sorting events will have a similar effect on the other. If the signals are different, certain changes might increase activity for one sorting event and decrease activity for the other. Thus, we constructed a series of mutants designed to make the HA C543Y sequence more, or less, similar to that of a popular “consensus” for internalization signals, Y-X-X-large hydrophobic residue (2Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The DNAs encoding these proteins were subcloned into the expression vector pCB6 (20Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and lines of polarized MDCK cells that express HA wild-type (HA wt) or the HA mutants, HA C543Y, HA C543Y,C546F, HA C543Y,C546S, HA C543Y,C546R, tail-less HA (HAt−), or HA C543F, were made. These cells were grown on filters and the polarity of the cells, and the location of the HAs was determined by previously published assays (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are shown in Table I. Both HA wt and HAt− were sorted mainly to the apical cell surface. HA C543Y and HA C543Y,C546F mutants were sorted efficiently to the basolateral domain, whereas HA C543Y,C546S and HA C543Y,C546R mutants were delivered to both apical (about 35–45%) and basolateral (about 55–65%) sides. A phenylalanine at position 543 instead of tyrosine did not function for basolateral sorting (or internalization (24Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). When the results of basolateral sorting were compared with internalization rates measured for these mutants at the basolateral surface of MDCK cells (Fig. 1), it is apparent that changes in internalization and basolateral sorting did not occur in parallel. Although arginine at position 546 contributed to a significantly better internalization signal than cysteine at the same position, it decreased basolateral sorting. Phenylalanine at position 546 increased basolateral sorting approximately 10% but increased internalization by 6-fold in comparison with Cys546. Thus, the basolateral sorting and internalization signals in HA C543Y have different sequence requirements.Table IComparison of effects of cytoplasmic mutations of HA on exocytic sorting in MDCK cellsProteinCytoplasmic sequencePercent basolateralHA wtC S N G S L Q C R I C I25 ± 3n = 3HA tail−· · K28 ± 3n = 6HA C543F· · · · · · · F · · · ·32 ± 7n = 3HA C543Y,C546S· · · · · · · Y · · S ·62 ± 3n = 3HA C543Y,C546R· · · · · · · Y · · R ·65 ± 8n = 4HA C543Y· · · · · · · Y · · · ·84 ± 3n = 6HA C543Y,C546F· · · · · · · Y · · F ·90 ± 2n = 3The sequences shown are predicted to be the maximum length of the A/Japan HA cytoplasmic domain (15Naim H.Y.

Percent basolateral values are given with S.D. for the number of trials shown. Measurements were made on permanent lines of transfected cells that were not subcloned after transfection. In these experiments, the portion of the HA C543Y protein sorted to the basolateral surface was less than observed previously (9Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A difference in the two sets of experiments is that, in the current set, cells were treated with sodium butyrate to increase protein expression. Treatment of MDCK cells with butyrate has been reported to decrease the fidelity of basolateral sorting of LDL receptors with mutations in their basolateral sorting signals in a manner inversely correlated with their expression level (25Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Without butyrate, HA C543Y was 94 ± 3% basolateral (n = 4) and with butyrate, 84 ± 3% basolateral (n = 6; the probability that these values are not significantly different is less than 0.002, by Student's t test). Butyrate did not affect the overall polarity of the MDCK cells under the conditions of our experiments because basolateral expression of HA C543Y,C546F was more complete under any condition than was sorting of HA C543Y and was insensitive to the presence or absence of butyrate (data not shown). Using the same experimental conditions, we have observed that the sorting of another protein with very complete expression at the basolateral surface, the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, is also insensitive to treatment with butyrate (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA+8 is a mutant HA protein that contains eight amino acids added to the carboxyl terminus by a mutation at the normal translational stop codon that shifts the reading frame (19Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine if HA+8 would also be transported to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells, continuous, clonal MDCK cells expressing HA+8 were made, and the delivery of HA+8 to the cell surface of monolayers grown on filter inserts was measured by pulse-chase experiments. HA+8 was transported almost exclusively to the basolateral plasma membrane (Table II). Previously we had mapped the internalization signal in HA+8 to the sequence YKSF, in experiments in monkey fibroblasts (19Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine if the basolateral sorting information in HA+8 was co-linear with the internalization signal, as was the case for HA C543Y, we made a series of second-site mutants in which the amino acids from position 546 to 555 were changed to either alanine or serine. Polarized MDCK cell lines were made expressing these proteins, and the amount of each protein residing at the basolateral surface after a pulse and chase was compared with the amount of terminally glycosylated protein residing inside the cells (Fig. 2). After an 80-min chase at 37 °C with trypsin present in the culture medium, the ratio of surface to internal protein for each of the mutant HA+8 proteins had reached a maximum value and did not change during the next 40 min of chase. Rates of degradation for these proteins were similar, ranging from 0.1%/min for HA+8 Y550S to 0.5%/min for HA+8 Y548S, which is 10–20-fold slower than the rates of internalization or recycling we have measured previously for other HA mutants in MDCK cells (8Naim H.Y. Dodds D.T. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These observations were similar to measurements of the traffic of HA+8 that we had made previously in monkey fibroblasts, where HA+8 and several of its mutants were internalized in minutes and remained cycling through an early endosome compartment for several hours (19Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, in monkey fibroblasts and presumably in MDCK cells, the internalization rate is the principle determinant of the fraction of HA+8 that is internal at steady state.Table IISequences of HA+8 and second-site mutantsMutant proteinCytoplasmic sequence% BL5362-aNumbers above the residue indicate the amino acid position. 538 540 542 544 546 548 550 552 554HA wtC S N G S L Q C R I C I25HA + 8C S N G S L Q C R I C I Y D Y K S F Y N99HA+8-C546A. . . . . . . . . .

The percent of each protein at the basolateral (BL) surface is given, with S.D. where indicated. Values represent the means of a minimum of four experiments. Examination of the ratio of the surface population to the internal population of each mutant protein after an 80-min chase revealed two characteristics of the HA+8 internalization signal in MDCK cells (Fig.2). Change of any amino acid in the region from position 546 to 555 decreased the internal fraction of the protein. However, the effect of most mutations was consistent with a protein that was internalized as fast or faster than it was recycled back to the plasma membrane. Only mutations of Tyr550 or Phe553 appeared to block internalization, suggesting that the core of the internalization signal of HA+8 recognized in MDCK cells was Y-X-X-F. The delivery of HA+8 and second site mutants to the basolateral surface was measured by pulse-chase experiments. Mutations at only two positions had any significant effect on basolateral sorting (Fig. 3, TableII). Mutation D549A created a protein that was delivered equally to the apical and basolateral surfaces, and mutation Y550S produced a protein that was sorted to the apical surface almost as well as the HA protein. The observation that the F553A mutation that prevented significant internalization had no effect on basolateral sorting indicated that in HA+8, as HA C543Y, the two signals were different. To determine if the two signals in HA+8 were co-linear, as they were in HA C543Y, we determined the sorting pattern of a mutant, HA+4, in which the HA+8 sequence was truncated after position Lys551 (Table II). HA+4 was still sorted efficiently to the basolateral surface, but was essentially not internalized (Fig. 4). Thus, the basolateral sorting signal in HA+8 was not co-linear with the internalization signal, although both signals shared a requirement for Tyr550.Figure 4Truncating the HA+8 sequence after Lys551 abolishes internalization but has little effect on basolateral expression of the mutant HA+4. Internalization was measured as described for Fig. 2 and basolateral expression as described for Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A basolateral sorting signal having the pattern DY had not been previously reported. The HA+8 sequence has an isoleucine encoded by the wild type HA sequence at position 547. To investigate the possibility that the basolateral sorting signal in HA+8 might have the pattern Ile547-X-X-Tyr550, Ile547 was mutated to arginine. This mutation made very little effect on the basolateral sorting of HA+8 (Table II). To determine if some other nearby residue to the amino-terminal side of Tyr550 contributed to basolateral sorting, amino acids between position 541 and 545 were deleted, and the sorting of this mutant, HA+8 Δ541–545, was determined. HA+8 Δ541–545 was still predominately basolateral (77%), although it was not sorted as well as HA+8 (99%) or HA+4 (90%). To investigate the role of Asp549, this position was subjected to degenerate mutagenesis, and 13 mutant proteins were expressed in MDCK cells. The fraction of each protein sorted to the basolateral surface was determined (Fig.5). Replacement of Asp549with hydrophobic residues (Ala, Val, Leu, Phe, Cys) resulted in proteins that were delivered equally to apical and basolateral surfaces. Replacement of Asp549 with residues of opposite charge (Arg, His), polar residues (Asn, Ser, Tyr), or residues that promote turn formation (Gly, Pro) had no effect. Thus, the aspartic acid side chain at position 549 was not required for the functioning of the basolateral sorting signal that included Tyr550. For HA C543Y, as described previously for the LDL receptor (25Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and human lysosomal acid phosphatase (12Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the basolateral sorting signal overlaps an internalization signal but is distinct. The basolateral signal in the HA C543Y protein, tyrosine-X-X-cysteine, proved to be a degenerate form of a signal with the primary sequence pattern “tyrosine-X-X-large hydrophobic residue,” since substitution of cysteine by phenylalanine made a much better signal by the criteria that it was insensitive to a 10-fold increase in protein expression. In primary sequence, the HA C543Y basolateral sorting signal resembles those identified in rat lgp120 (28Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the vesicular stomatitis G protein (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern is observed in a large number of signals for different transport pathways (see Ref. 3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a list), suggesting that sorting of membrane proteins along many pathways may be controlled by distinct, but related, cytosolic sorting receptors that bind different subsets of related sorting signals. In principle, this recognition system would resemble the selectivity achieved by proteins containing SH2 domains that recognize different subsets of tetrapeptide sequences containing a phosphorylated tyrosine (29Stahl N.

Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, other basolateral sorting signals do not depend upon a Y-X-X-hydrophobic motif (12Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be parallel mechanisms for sorting different classes of proteins to the same membrane domain. Mutants of the LDL receptor containing only the membrane proximal of its two cytoplasmic basolateral sorting signals are sorted less completely to the basolateral surface when their expression level is raised. This basolateral signal overlaps the LDL receptor internalization signal. Mutants containing only the membrane-distal signal, which does not function for internalization, are sorted properly regardless of the level of expression, establishing a criteria for judging a sorting signal to be “weak” or “strong” (25Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The HA C543Y signal resembled the LDL proximal signal in that HA C543Y was expressed more apically when expression levels were elevated, although HA C543Y remained significantly more basolateral than its LDL counterpart at similar levels of high expression (1–2 × 105 molecules/cell). However, basolateral signals that are co-linear with internalization signals are not inherently weaker than those that are not. Mutation of cysteine 543 to phenylalanine created both a better internalization signal and a strong basolateral sorting signal. Although the HA+8 protein contains an internalization signal of the pattern Y-X-X-(large hydrophobic), this is not the basolateral sorting signal. The only amino acid absolutely required for basolateral sorting of HA+8 was Tyr550. Position 549 was important, but Asp549 was not essential, since it could be replaced by many different amino acids having different charges and sizes. Both Garnier-Robeson and Chou-Fasman algorithms predict that Tyr550 is located in a turn. Amino acids that functioned at position 549 had no effect on this prediction, whereas the nonfunctional class were all predicted to either prevent (Chou-Fasman) or change (Garnier-Robeson) the position of the turn so that it no longer contained Tyr550. A turn has also been proposed as an essential component of the basolateral sorting signal of the polyimmunoglobulin receptor, but does not appear to be the only essential characteristic (32Reich V. Mostov K. Aroeti B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that a key component of the HA+8 basolateral sorting signal is the presentation of the tyrosine by secondary structure. If the proposal is correct that tyrosine-based internalization signals contain tyrosine at the first position of a type 1 β-turn (2Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), then Tyr550 should be in such a turn, since it functions extremely well for internalization. However, the requirements for function of the basolateral sorting signal containing Tyr550 are different than those required for internalization. Thus, there is either additional information required for basolateral sorting compared with internalization (information which we have been unable to detect), or the polypeptide chain around Tyr550 may be flexible and capable of assuming more than one conformation. Binding to a sorting receptor might or might not require the chain to adopt a particular conformation before the initial interaction, but would presumably lock the chain into the proper conformation once it is bound. This idea of induced fit is attractive, as it explains how two distinct signals can co-exist in the same space without interfering with each other. Our work does not eliminate the possibility that there is a second amino acid side chain important for the functioning of the basolateral sorting signal in HA+8, that can be substituted by alanine, or in some cases, serine. However, if this residue lies beyond position 551, it contributes much less to the signal than does Tyr550, since truncation of the sequence at this position in HA+4 results in a protein that is still predominantly basolateral. This is a very different result than we observed for the vesicular stomatitis G protein, which also has a strong basolateral sorting signal that requires tyrosine, but does not function as an internalization signal. The basolateral sorting signal in G protein is Y-X-X-I, and alanine does not replace the isoleucine (3Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the basolateral sorting signal in HA+8 does not resemble any previously described basolateral sorting signal. Either there is more than one class of tyrosine-dependent basolateral sorting signal (implying that these signals do not interact with the same receptor binding site), or basolateral sorting signals such as the one in HA+8 and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein share a structural context around the tyrosine that is important, rather than primary sequence context. Resolution of this question will require identification of the protein(s) that bind these signals."

These results show that NH2Cl inhibits PKC-mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible PKC activity. Neutrophils play an important role in the defense against bacterial infections as well as other inflammatory responses. Many different stimuli activate neutrophils, which show a series of responses such as the respiratory burst, cell shape change, aggregation, degranulation, and phospholipid turnover (1Tauber A.I. Blood. 1987; 69: 711-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory burst is a rapid increase in non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, in which large amounts of superoxide anion (O·̄2) are produced by the electron transport complex NADPH oxidase (2Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar, 3Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the dismutation of O·̄2, and HOCl is formed from H2O2 and Cl− by myeloperoxidase (4Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Chloramines are another type of oxidant produced in significant quantities by activated neutrophils (6Test S.T. Lampert M.B. Ossanna P.J. Thoene J.G. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). They are formed by the non-enzymatic reaction (I) of HOCl with many endogenous amines such as taurine, ammonia, lysine, and the amino termini of polypeptides (6Test S.T. Lampert M.B. Ossanna P.J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 48: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). R­NH2+HOCl→R­NHCl+H2O REACTIONIChloramines are less reactive than HOCl, and membrane-impermeable chloramines are relatively long lived oxidants (9Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Chloramines react preferentially with sulfhydryls and thioethers (10Zgliczynski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Sbarra A.J. Strauss R.R. The Respiratory Burst and Its Physiological Significance. Plenum Press, New York1988: 315-347Crossref Google Scholar), and some chloramines such as monochloramine (NH2Cl) are membrane-permeable (11Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Neutrophils in concentrations found in blood (2–3 × 106/ml) may easily produce 100 μm chloramine in a short term culture (12Pero R.W. Sheng Y. Olsson A. Bryngelsson C. Lund-Pero M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, chloramines show distinct biological effects such as inhibition of DNA repair (12Pero R.W. Sheng Y. Olsson A. Bryngelsson C. Lund-Pero M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), inhibition of the generation of macrophage inflammatory mediators (13Marcinkiewicz J. Grabowska A. Bereta J. Stelmaszynska T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and detachment of cultured myocytes (14Nakamura T.Y. Yamamoto I. Nishitani H. Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Goshima K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that membrane-permeable chloramines derived from the respiratory burst are the primary cause of accelerated turnover of glutathione in activated neutrophils (15Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Considering these characteristics, chloramines may have signaling functions in inflammation (9Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). One of the key enzymes of the NADPH oxidase activation is protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; IL-2, interleukin-2; IL-2Rα, interleukin-2 receptor α chain; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (16Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). PKC was originally reported as a ubiquitous, Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase, which is activated transiently (17Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). To date, 12 isoforms of PKC have been reported, and they are classified into three groups, conventional, novel, and atypical, based on their primary structure and cofactor requirement (18Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Neutrophil activation by physiological stimuli such as formyl peptide or complement fragment C5a begins with interaction with their specific surface receptors (20Baggiolini M. Boulay F. Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This interaction leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which generates two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. These messengers together lead to the activation of PKC. Among the PKC isoforms, PKCβ is suggested to be responsible for the neutrophil respiratory burst activation (21Majumdar S. Rossi M.W. Fujiki T. Phillips W.A. Disa S. Queen C.F. Johnston Jr., R.B. Rosen O.M. Corkey B.E. Korchak H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9285-9294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Majumdar S.

Activated PKC phosphorylates one of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47 phox (23Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated p47 phox translocates and interacts with membrane component of NADPH oxidase (25Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. McCormick S. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which results in the assembly of the active enzyme. The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces a PKC-dependent respiratory burst (1Tauber A.I. Blood. 1987; 69: 711-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PMA has a structural similarity with the endogenous PKC agonist diacylglycerol and causes a direct and more prolonged activation of PKC (17Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). PMA effectively activates neutrophil NADPH oxidase, and the cells produce maximal amounts of superoxide (26Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, this PKC-mediated activation pathway is not the only way of NADPH oxidase activation. Some stimuli such as arachidonic acid (27Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. Karnovsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12640-12643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; 28Kakinuma K. Hatae T. Minakami S. J. Biochem. 1976; 79: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) also induce a respiratory burst without requiring PKC (29Cox J.A. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. Tauber A.I. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1884-1888PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid directly interacts with p47 phox, changes its conformation, and enables it to assemble active NADPH oxidase (30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, arachidonic acid-induced respiratory burst in a cell-free reconstituted system is independent of PKC-cofactors (Ca2+ and ATP) and is not inhibited by PKC inhibitor (29Cox J.A. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. Tauber A.I. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1884-1888PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, arachidonic acid is a PKC-independent inducer of respiratory burst. PKC also has a pivotal role in the activation of T cells. T cells are stimulated by the interaction of a specific antigen with T cell receptor-CD3 complex. This interaction activates the intracellular kinase cascade (31Szamel M. Resch K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), one of which is mediated by PKC. Activated kinase cascade activates transcription factors (31Szamel M. Resch K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which initiate transcription and expression of a variety of molecules including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the high affinity IL-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα). Because IL-2 is a major T cell growth factor, the coordinate production of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor is crucial for T cell proliferation and the immune response (32Smith K.A. Science. 1988; 240: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). T cell stimulation with PMA alone is enough for IL-2Rα expression (33Shackelford D.A. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCα is responsible for this effect (34Szamel M. Bartels F. Resch K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression of IL-2Rα is transcriptionally regulated (35Greene W.C. Robb R.J. Depper J.M. Leonard W.J. Drogula C. Svetlik P.B. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Waldmann T.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1042-1047PubMed Google Scholar) and involves nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB activation (36Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Siekevitz M. Ballard D.W. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation comprises the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein IκB (37Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The activated NF-κB translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus (38Bohnlein E. Ballard D.W. Bogerd H. Peffer N.J. Lowenthal J.W. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8475-8478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it binds to the κB consensus sequence of IL-2Rα gene promoter (36Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Siekevitz M. Ballard D.W. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This binding is essential for NF-κB-regulated gene expression (39Jamieson C. McCaffrey P.G. Rao A. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 416-420PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). In this study we show that PMA-induced PKC activity is inhibited by NH2Cl in neutrophils and Jurkat T cells. This inhibition of PKC activity results in distinct biological effects, notably inhibition of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and inhibition of IL-2Rα expression in Jurkat T cells. These results suggest that chloramines may have a physiological function in regions where the respiratory burst is activated. PMA, arachidonic acid, and PKCβ were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free, pH 7.4; PBS) and the PKC assay system were from Life Technologies, Inc. NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was from Promega (Madison, WI). T4 polynucleotide kinase and protein molecular weight markers were from Boehringer Mannheim. Phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human CD25 (IL-2Rα) antibody was from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). Calyculin A was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphoric acid were from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human p47 phox (raised against glutathioneS-transferase-p47 phox fusion protein) was a generous gift from Dr. Bernard M. Babior. All other reagents were of analytic grade or better. Rat elicited peritoneal neutrophils were prepared from Sprague-Dawley male rats (250–350 g, from Bantin and Kingman, Fremont, CA) as described previously (15Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Cunningham F.M. Smith M.J.H. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Walker J.R. J. Pathol. 1979; 128: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The collected cells contained about 80% neutrophils based on microscopic examination, and the cell viability was more than 95%, which was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test. Jurkat T cell is a cell line of human acute T cell leukemia and was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (clone E6-1, Bethesda, MD). The cell culture medium was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (w/v) penicillin-streptomycin, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 2 mml-glutamine (from University of California, San Francisco, cell culture facility), and cells were grown in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Taurine chloramine and monochloramine (NH2Cl) were prepared as described previously (15Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The chloramine concentration was determined by 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate assay (42Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were suspended in PBS (5 × 106cells/ml), and NH2Cl or taurine chloramine was added to get the final concentration of 10–70 μm. After the incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, neutrophils were separated from the PBS by centrifugation and used as described below. Jurkat T cells were suspended in the fresh cell culture medium (1 × 106cells/ml), and NH2Cl was added to 20–70 μm. In contrast to PBS, this medium alone consumed added NH2Cl. After the incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, Jurkat T cells were used without washing because the medium contained no more detectable chloramine. Neutrophils were resuspended in the assay mixture (1.25 × 106 cells/ml, 1.1 mm p-hydroxyphenylacetate, 50 μg/ml superoxide dismutase, 50 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, in PBS), and they were stimulated with either PMA (300 nm, final concentration) or arachidonic acid (100 μm), which was previously dissolved in ethanol at 300 μm and 100 mm, respectively. Preliminary study showed that these concentrations were optimal. The respiratory burst was monitored continuously at 37 °C by H2O2 formation as described previously (15Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,43Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PKC activity was measured just after the chloramine exposure using a PKC assay system from Life Technologies, Inc. Partial purification with an anion exchange column was omitted because a preliminary study using crude and partially purified samples showed similar results. Acetylated synthetic peptide from myelin basic protein 4–14 (Ac-Gln-Lys-Arg-Pro-Ser-Gln-Arg-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu) was used for the substrate, which is specific for conventional PKCs (44Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Specificity for PKC was established by running the control sample using PKC-specific inhibitor peptide PKC(19–36) (45House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) for each sample. PKC activity was expressed as pmol of 32P incorporated/min/106 cells. Phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein in neutrophils was studied as described previously (46Heyworth P.G. Badwey J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except for the following. Before NH2Cl treatment, neutrophils (1 × 108/ml) were incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (500 μCi/ml) at 30 °C for 30 min in 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 7.5 mmd-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.5. After the incubation, neutrophils (5 × 106/ml) were added to 30–70 μmNH2Cl in PBS and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were stimulated with 300 nm PMA for 90 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v), centrifuged, and the total precipitated protein was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The pH was adjusted to about 7 by NaOH. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% gel, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and dried, and autoradiography was performed. Phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was also studied in the cell-free system using exogenous PKCβ. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from NH2Cl (50 μm)-treated and control neutrophils as described previously (47Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Then p47 phox was partially purified by passing through a DE52 ion exchange column as described previously (48Pilloud-Dagher M.-C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that virtually all immunoreactive p47 phox was recovered from the pass-through fraction. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mg/ml partially purified protein, 5 units/ml PKCβ, 0.3%(w/v) Triton X-100 mixed micelles containing 10 μm PMA, and 0.28 mg/ml phosphatidylserine (prepared as described in Ref. 49Bell R.M. Hannun Y. Loomis C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ATP (containing 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP), and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), incubated at 30 °C for 7 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 μmstaurosporine and 1 mm ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoblot analysis of p47 phox was performed following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-p47 phox antibody. The optical density of the autoradiogram and immunoblot was measured by a Shimadzu CS-9301 PC densitometer and expressed as percent of positive control. After 30 min of NH2Cl incubation, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with PMA (100 nm) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Control cells were treated with the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1% v/v) without PMA. The cells were maintained in culture condition for 24 h after PMA treatment. Then the cells were washed with PBS and immunostained with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human IL-2Rα antibody and analyzed at excitation 488 nm and emission 575 nm using EPICS-Elite flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). Data were collected from gated viable cell populations. Nuclear protein extraction was performed 2 h after PMA stimulation as described previously (50Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). In some experiments, calyculin A (20 nm) was also used as a stimulant, and nuclear proteins were extracted 30 min after the stimulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (52Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 53Suzuki Y.J. Mizuno M. Packer L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar). Results were tabulated for the indicated number of experimental samples. Mean and standard deviations are presented. Group means were compared using Student's t test for unpaired samples with a two-tailed distribution using Microsoft Excel. Under resting conditions, rat peritoneal neutrophils showed no detectable respiratory burst, as measured by H2O2 production. When cells were stimulated with PMA, which is a potent PKC activator, they showed a marked respiratory burst, whose rate was maximal for several minutes (15Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PMA-induced respiratory burst was inhibited significantly at 30 μm NH2Cl pretreatment, and it was abolished at 50 μm NH2Cl pretreatment (Fig.1). In contrast, the neutrophils pretreated with 30–50 μm NH2Cl showed a complete respiratory burst when stimulated with arachidonic acid, which is a PKC-independent stimulant. In the control cells, the maximal rate of H2O2 production by arachidonic acid stimulation was lower than that which occurred by PMA stimulation (Fig.1). This is not surprising because different stimuli cause a different degree of respiratory burst even at optimal conditions (26Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Membrane-impermeable taurine chloramine at 50 μm had no inhibitory effects on the PMA-induced respiratory burst. At a higher NH2Cl concentration (70 μm) the arachidonic acid-induced respiratory burst was also inhibited (data not shown). To assess whether the respiratory burst suppression by NH2Cl was caused by neutrophil death, cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion (TableI). Control cells showed 96% viability. Neutrophils treated with up to 50 μm NH2Cl showed more than 95% viability, not significantly different from the controls. Therefore, the suppression of PMA-induced respiratory burst by NH2Cl was not caused by neutrophil death.Table ICell viability after NH2Cl treatmentNH2Cl concentrationCell viabilityNeutrophilsJurkat T cellsμm%096 ± 196 ± 22095 ± 297 ± 13096 ± 197 ± 15095 ± 196 ± 27092 ± 1*97 ± 1Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of NH2Cl for 10 min at 37 °C in PBS.

Cell viability was studied by the trypan blue exclusion test. Mean ± S.D. for four determinations are shown. *Significantly different from the 0 μm samples (p < 0.05). Because PMA induces a respiratory burst by a PKC-dependent mechanism, we measured the inducible PKC activity in the NH2Cl-pretreated neutrophils. The inducible PKC activity decreased in the NH2Cl-pretreated neutrophils (Fig. 2). Neutrophils treated with 50 μm NH2Cl resulted in the PKC activity being decreased to 47% of the control cells under maximal activation. Taurine chloramine at 50 μm showed no inhibition of the respiratory burst and no inhibitory effects on PKC. PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of p47 phox is essential for the PMA-induced respiratory burst (54Faust L.R. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation was assessed by detecting the 32P incorporation into 47-kDa protein in the whole cell system. Anti-human p47 phox antibody reacted with a protein at this position. Although resting neutrophils did not show an apparent 32P incorporation into 47-kDa protein, PMA stimulation of the control cells resulted in a distinct32P incorporation (Fig. 3), and this is consistent with similar studies with guinea pig neutrophils (46Heyworth P.G. Badwey J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Monochloramine-pretreated neutrophils showed a decrease in the phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein upon PMA stimulation. Pretreatment with 50 μm NH2Cl resulted in marked decrease in 32P incorporation (Fig. 3). Neutrophils pretreated with 30 μm NH2Cl showed a lower phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein than control cells (Fig. 3), despite the statistically insignificant decrease in PKC activity (Fig. 2). These results were consistent with the significant decrease in respiratory burst activity in these cells (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was also studied in a cell-free system using exogenous PKCβ, to study if NH2Cl damaged p47 phox so that it could not be phosphorylated by PKC. The 47-kDa protein from NH2Cl (50 μm)-treated and the control cells were equally well phosphorylated by exogenous PKCβ (Fig.4 A). Immunoblot analysis showed that these two samples contained comparable amounts of immunoreactive p47 phox (Fig. 4 B). To study whether the effect of NH2Cl on PKC is limited to neutrophils or whether it is a more general phenomenon involving other cell types, we studied the effect of NH2Cl on the PMA-induced IL-2Rα expression in Jurkat T cells. Unstimulated Jurkat T cells showed almost no IL-2Rα expression, but 24 h after PMA stimulation IL-2Rα expression was markedly enhanced. Monochloramine pretreatment (20–70 μm) decreased the PMA-induced IL-2Rα expression (Fig.5). The NH2Cl pretreatment did not alter cell viability even 24 h after PMA stimulation (data not shown). To correlate the IL-2Rα expression with the inhibition of PKC activation, we measured the inducible PKC activity in NH2Cl-treated Jurkat T cells. Fig.6 demonstrates that 20–70 μm NH2Cl inhibited inducible PKC activity in Jurkat T cells. Because the cell viability did not change (Table I), this inhibition of PKC activation was not the result of cell death. The PMA-induced IL-2Rα expression is a multistep response involving kinase cascade activation, NF-κB activation, mRNA synthesis, and protein synthesis (35Greene W.C. Robb R.J. Depper J.M.

Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8475-8478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We studied NF-κB activation to see if the inhibited PKC activity fails to activate the step after PKC activation. NF-κB activation precedes IL-2Rα expression in Jurkat T cells (36Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Siekevitz M. Ballard D.W. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (40Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 55Suzuki Y.J. Aggarwal B.B. Packer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), PMA induced marked activation of NF-κB in Jurkat T cells. Pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with NH2Cl inhibited PMA-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 7). The inhibition of IL-2Rα expression, NF-κB activation, and PKC activation by NH2Cl all occurred at similar (20–70 μm) NH2Cl concentrations (Figs. 5, 6, 7). To study if NH2Cl directly damaged NF-κB protein in a way that NF-κB cannot be activated, the NH2Cl (50 μm)-pretreated Jurkat T cells were stimulated with calyculin A, another inducer of NF-κB. Calyculin A treatment efficiently induced NF-κB activation in both the NH2Cl-pretreated and the control cells (data not shown). When neutrophils were pretreated with 50 μmNH2Cl, the PKC-dependent stimulant PMA could not induce respiratory burst, yet the PKC-independent stimulant arachidonic acid induced a complete respiratory burst. This finding strongly suggests that the target of NH2Cl was PKC and not NADPH oxidase. Indeed, NH2Cl treatment resulted in a decrease in the inducible PKC activity in neutrophils. Membrane-impermeable taurine chloramine at 50 μm had no inhibitory effect on either the respiratory burst or the PKC activity. This suggests that the target for chloramine was not located on the outer cell membrane. PKC activity is one of the rate-limiting factors of the respiratory burst activity. It has been reported that the neutrophil respiratory burst correlates directly with the intracellular level of PKC (56Salamino F. Sparatore B. De Tullio R. Mengotti P. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine and H-7 inhibit both phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein and superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner (57Levy R. Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of inducible PKC activity appears to be the cause of inhibition of PMA-induced respiratory burst in NH2Cl-pretreated cells. Neutrophils pretreated with 50 μm NH2Cl showed virtually no respiratory burst upon PMA stimulation but still possessed 47% of their PKC activity. Phosphorylation of p47 phox is a requirement of PMA-stimulated respiratory burst activation (54Faust L.R. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We measured the phosphorylation of protein of 47-kDa molecular mass. Antibodies against human p47 phox reacted with a protein at this position. After a 50 μm NH2Cl pretreatment, neutrophils showed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein, despite the remaining PKC activity. This result suggests that the phosphorylation of p47 phox was decreased in the NH2Cl-treated neutrophils, which results in the inhibition of the respiratory burst. We further studied if NH2Cl directly damaged p47 phox so that it could not be phosphorylated by PKC. In a cell-free system, exogenously added PKCβ phosphorylated equally well the 47-kDa protein from the control and NH2Cl-treated neutrophils. Both samples contained comparable amounts of immunoreactive p47 phox . This result suggests that even after NH2Cl (50 μm) treatment, p47 phox can be phosphorylated when catalyzed by intact PKCβ. Therefore, the decrease in the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein appears to be caused by the decrease in the PKC activity in NH2Cl-treated neutrophils. One explanation for the discrepancy between the 47-kDa protein phosphorylation and the remaining PKC activity is that neutrophils contain phosphoprotein phosphatases that reverse the action of PKC (58Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,59Ding J. Badwey J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). During the PMA-stimulated respiratory burst, p47 phox undergoes a continual cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (60Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6442-6448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under optimally stimulated conditions the phosphorylation reaction by PKC predominates, which maintains the p47 phox in a phosphorylated state (60Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6442-6448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and keeps the NADPH oxidase in the active state. Therefore, if PKC activity decreases, the dephosphorylation reaction by phosphatase may predominate, and p47 phox cannot be maintained in a sufficiently phosphorylated state. Another possible explanation is that NH2Cl may alter the substrate specificity of PKC. In this case, the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of p47 phox may be impaired more severely than that of myelin basic protein peptide. This possibility should be studied further. In any case, it is likely that the remaining PKC activity was insufficient to keep the p47 phox phosphorylated enough to allow assembly of an active NADPH oxidase. This would result in the observed substantial inhibition of the respiratory burst activity. Monochloramine-induced suppression of inducible PKC activity was not restricted to neutrophils. At 20 μm, NH2Cl inhibited the PMA-induced IL-2Rα expression, PKC activation, and the NF-κB activation in Jurkat T cells. Although there are many steps that could result in the inhibition of IL-2Rα expression, we measured NF-κB activation because NF-κB is activated by the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein IκB (37Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), and NF-κB activation precedes IL-2Rα gene expression in Jurkat T cells (38Bohnlein E. Ballard D.W. Bogerd H. Peffer N.J. Lowenthal J.W. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8475-8478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of PKC activation and NF-κB activation occurred at similar concentrations of NH2Cl, which suggests that the inhibited PKC activity failed to activate NF-κB. We studied further if the decrease in NF-κB activation was the result of direct damage of NF-κB protein caused by NH2Cl. Calyculin A is a potent inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatase types 1 and 2A, and it activates NF-κB through IκB phosphorylation and degradation in Jurkat T cells (61Sun S.-C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18347-18351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Monochloramine treatment (50 μm) did not affect the calyculin A-induced NF-κB activation. This result showed that NF-κB in NH2Cl-treated Jurkat T cells was still inducible and suggests that NF-κB protein was not a direct target of NH2Cl. Because the NF-κB activation is reported to regulate IL-2Rα gene expression in Jurkat T cells (38Bohnlein E. Ballard D.W. Bogerd H. Peffer N.J. Lowenthal J.W. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8475-8478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of PKC activation by NH2Cl seems to be the primary cause of the inhibition of IL-2Rα expression. Among the PKC isoforms, at least conventional types of PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are likely to be the target of NH2Cl. In the neutrophils, PKCβ appears to be responsible for NADPH oxidase activation because PKCβ migrates to the membrane fraction upon stimulation (21Majumdar S. Rossi M.W. Fujiki T. Phillips W.A. Disa S. Queen C.F. Johnston Jr., R.B. Rosen O.M. Corkey B.E. Korchak H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9285-9294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is able to phosphorylate p47 phox (22Majumdar S. Kane L.H. Rossi M.W. Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Korchak H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although T cells contain both PKCα and PKCβ as well as other PKCs (31Szamel M. Resch K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), PKCα has been suggested to be responsible for IL-2Rα expression (34Szamel M. Bartels F. Resch K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used a synthetic myelin basic protein peptide as a substrate for the measurement of PKC activity. This peptide is a good substrate for conventional PKCs but not for novel or atypical PKCs (44Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, it is yet to be resolved whether chloramines also affect novel and/or atypical PKCs. During the respiratory burst, a variety of chloramine derivatives are detected in the extracellular medium (7Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These chloramines are mostly hydrophilic, low molecular weight, mono-N-chloramine derivatives (7Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and not likely to be membrane-permeable. However, membrane-permeable chloramines are also likely to be produced because normal human plasma contains 20–40 μmNH4+(62Howanitz J.H. Howanitz P.J. Skrodzki C.A. Iwanski J.A. Clin. Chem. 1984; 30: 906-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When 2–3 × 106/ml of neutrophils, which is comparable to the concentration in blood, are activated with PMA, the chloramine concentration reaches as high as 100 μm in a short term culture (12Pero R.W. Sheng Y. Olsson A. Bryngelsson C. Lund-Pero M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As the neutrophil concentration can be much higher in inflammatory sites, our chloramine concentration (20–70 μm) may well be physiologically attainable. Membrane-impermeable chloramines are long lived with an apparent half-life of about 18 h in vitro (9Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These chloramines can migrate from their origin to the adjacent or even distant tissues. Moreover, these chloramines react with NH4+ to yield the membrane-permeable NH2Cl (7Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma NH4+concentration increases substantially in some human conditions such as liver failure (63Butterworth R.F. Giguere J.F. Michaud J. Lavoie J. Layrargues G.P. Neurochem. Pathol. 1987; 6: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Such conditions may be favorable for NH2Cl production. We showed in this work that NH2Cl inhibited PKC-dependent activation both in neutrophils and Jurkat T cells. PKC, functionally impaired by chloramine, was not sufficiently activated upon PMA stimulation, resulting in suppression of PKC-mediated cellular responses. Considering the central importance of PKC in cellular signaling pathways, respiratory burst-derived chloramines may function as signal modulating molecules in regions where neutrophils exhibit respiratory burst."

The principal physiological action of PTH is on the regulation of Ca2+/Pi homeostasis, which is mediated by the PTHR in kidney and bone. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms of the receptor-mediated actions of PTH are not completely understood. PTH stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption indirectly via the activation of the PTHR on osteoblasts (2Aurbach G.D. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W.

Additionally, PTH has an anabolic effect on bone when administered intermittently (3Whitfield J.F. Morley P. Trends Pharmacol.

It has been proposed that the diverse actions of PTH may be a consequence of activation of both the cAMP/PKA and inositol lipid/Ca2+/PKC signaling pathways by the PTHR in osteoblasts (4Bidwell J.P.

Microphysiometry is a novel method for monitoring cellular metabolism (16Parce J.W. Owicki J.C. Kercso K.M. Sigal G.B. Wada H.G. Muir V.C. Bousse L.J. Ross K.L. Sikic B.I. McConnell H.M.

Because local pH homeostasis is physiologically important in mineral ion metabolism, and PTH-stimulated bone resorption has been linked to acid production by osteoclasts (13Vaes G. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 39: 676-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we utilized microphysiometry to monitor the effect of PTH on extracellular acidification in osteoblasts, the primary target cell for PTH in bone. The Cytosensor microphysiometer utilizes silicon-based, light-addressable potentiometric sensors to make rapid, precise determinations of extracellular pH. The Cytosensor monitors the rate at which cells secrete the acidic byproducts of metabolism, the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Cells acidify the environment via ion exchangers and pumps such as the Na+/H+antiporter and the H+-ATPase and by transporting metabolites such as lactic acid across the plasma membrane (19Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1992; 7: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Several seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors such as adrenergic, dopamine, and muscarinic receptors elicit concentration-dependent increases in ECAR in response to agonist binding (17Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Kercso K.M. Sigal G.B. Muir V.C. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4007-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18McConnell H.M.

In contrast, acidification of the bone microenvironment is known to be functionally important in skeletal metabolism and Ca2+/Pi homeostasis (13Vaes G. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 39: 676-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption depends on the accumulation of acid at the site of resorption (13Vaes G. J.

Cell Biol. 1968; 39: 676-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this action of the hormone are unknown. For these reasons, we utilized microphysiometry to demonstrate that agonist activation of the PTHR stimulates a large, acute, dose-dependent increase in ECAR, which we have utilized for a new analysis of PTHR signaling and regulation in osteoblastic cells.

Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were subcultured 1:5 every fifth day or as necessary for experiments. Experiments were performed as detailed previously (17Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Kercso K.M. Sigal G.B. Muir V.C. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, 12–24 h before an experiment, cells were subcultured onto the polycarbonate membranes of transwell capsule cups (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) in the following manner. Cells were detached from the plastic culture dish with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin and then suspended in MEM+, and the concentration of cells in suspension was determined. The cell suspension was diluted to a concentration of 5 × 105cells/ml (1 × 106 cells/ml for GH4C1 cells), and 1 ml of the suspension was seeded into each transwell capsule cup placed in a 12-well culture plate. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C until the beginning of the experiment. Immediately preceding an experiment, the low buffered MEM running buffer (MEM lacking NaHCO3 (to minimize buffering capacity), supplemented with 30 μmH3CCO2H (the PTH vehicle) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin or 5% horse serum (carrier proteins)) was prepared. The Cytosensor system was warmed to 37 °C and flushed with running buffer. The transwell capsule cups containing the cells were fitted with a spacer gasket and capsule cup insert to create a microvolume flow chamber containing the cells. The assembled capsule cups were then placed on the sterile silicon sensors and mounted on the Cytosensor. The Cytosensor was programmed to perfuse the cells with running buffer at a rate of approximately 100 μl/min for periods of 68 s interrupted by 22-s periods of no flow. The pH of the extracellular media was measured at 1-s intervals, and the rate of acidification was determined by calculating the least squares fit to the slope of the pH profile while the flow of buffer was stopped. After being loaded into the Cytosensor, cells were allowed to equilibrate until a stable base-line ECAR was reached, and then they were exposed to pharmacological and agonist agents as described under “Results.” The low buffered, balanced salt solutions (BSS) used in experiments to control Na+/H+ exchange consisted of 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mmKCl, 5 mmd-glucose, and 130 mmeither C5H14ClNO or NaCl. For the purpose of comparing ECARs from many different experiments, microphysiometer data were normalized utilizing Cytosoft software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A minimum of five consecutive data points from the base-line ECAR of each cell population were selected and averaged, and then all other data points were expressed as a percentage of this basal average. SaOS-2 cells were prepared for analysis of pH i and [Ca2+] i as described previously (32Monroe J.J. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1277-C1283Crossref Google Scholar, 33Boland C.J. Fried R.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 980-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells in the monolayer were detached from the culture dish using Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mmd-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. The cells were then washed three times and resuspended in HBSS containing 1 mmCaCl2 at a concentration of approximately 2 × 106 cells/ml. Fura-2/AM or BCECF/AM was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 1 or 5 μm, respectively. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C in the dark with gentle shaking for 60 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times in HBSS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and then two times with low buffered BSS and resuspended in the low buffered BSS at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. The suspension was loaded in a UV grade acrylic cuvette (Spectrocell, Oreland, PA) in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer (Rye, NH) warmed to 37 °C and stirred constantly. [Ca2+] i was determined using the ratio of Fura-2 emission fluorescence at 510 nm at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm as described previously (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pH i was determined by monitoring the fluorescence emission of BCECF at 535 nm at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm. Each spectrofluorometric experiment shown was repeated at least three times with qualitatively and quantitatively similar findings. Basal ECAR in serum-free, low buffered MEM was 47 ± 15 μV/s (mean ± S.D., n = 55) when 5 × 105 cells were seeded in each transwell capsule cup. Human PTH-(1–34) elicited an acute increase in ECAR (Fig. 1). The maximum PTH-stimulated increase in ECAR was 68 ± 24 μV/s (mean ± S.D., n = 55) above basal, a 2.4-fold increase above the resting acidification rate, and the EC50was about 2 nm (Fig. 2). The peak in ECAR occurred within 45 s of agonist addition and usually returned to basal levels within 5 min even in the persistent presence of PTH (Fig. 1). In some experiments, the ECAR dropped below the original basal level or remained slightly above it following a PTH exposure. Such modest variations in the pattern of ECAR responses to agonists have been reported in analogous studies in other cell types (18McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Similar, acute responses were also elicited by bPTHrP-(1–34)NH2 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PTH elicited large, acute, dose-dependent increases in ECAR in SaOS-2 cells. The specificity of the ECAR response was investigated in the following experiments.Figure 2Dose response to PTH in SaOS-2 cells as measured by ECAR. Cells were equilibrated in low buffered MEM supplemented with 5% horse serum (to prevent nonspecific adsorption of PTH) and sequentially exposed to increasing concentrations of hPTH-(1–34) (0.01–500 nm) as denoted at thetop for 2-min intervals marked by the arrows at the bottom of the figure. Between treatments, cells were perfused with hormone-free buffer for a minimum of 25 min, allowing the ECAR to return to basal levels and the cells to recover responsiveness (see Fig. 6). The basal ECAR was elevated to the level seen in this experiment by the presence of 5% horse serum. The ECAR response of the SaOS-2 cells to PTH was dose-dependent with an EC50 of about 2 nm. The trace depicted is the composite of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells, which endogenously express the PTHR, and rat pituitary F4C1 and GH4C1 cells, which do not express the PTHR, 2M. G. Barrett, G. S. Belinsky, and A. H. Tashjian, Jr., unpublished data. were examined. Each cell type was incubated with 100 nm hPTH-(1–34) for 2 min, and ECAR was monitored (Fig. 3). PTH induced an increase in ECAR in SaOS-2 cells, but no response was observed in the two PTHR-deficient cell strains. F4C1 and GH4C1 cells were responsive to an appropriate peptide hormone in the Cytosensor system, because thyrotropin-releasing hormone, for which these cells express the receptor, induced large increases in ECAR in these two cell types (data not shown). In addition, hPTH-(1–34) stimulated rapid increases in ECAR in rat osteoblast-like UMR-106 cells, which also express the PTHR (data not shown). These results suggest that the PTH-induced increase in ECAR is mediated by the PTHR. Additional evidence to support this conclusion is given below. SaOS-2 cells were incubated with the PTHR antagonist [Nle8,18,d-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7–34)NH2(35Dresner-Pollak R. Yang Q.-M. Behar V. Nakamoto C. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A 25-min pretreatment of cells with 200 nm[Nle8,18,d-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7–34)NH2elicited no increase in ECAR, and it reduced the ECAR response elicited by 20 nm hPTH-(1–34) to about 25% of the control value, while the response of the cells to 20 nm VIP was unaffected (Fig. 4). The inhibition of the PTH-induced increase in ECAR by [Nle8,18,d-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7–34) was reversed by washing the cells with buffer for 90 min (data not shown). A 25-min preincubation of SaOS-2 cells with 100 nm[Nle8,18,d-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7–34)NH2caused a shift in the ECAR dose-response curve for hPTH-(1–34) about 10-fold to the right, increasing the EC50 to about 10 nm (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the PTH-induced ECAR response is mediated by the PTHR in SaOS-2 cells. The following experiments were designed to investigate the response of osteoblast-like cells to repeated exposures to PTH.Figure 5Competitive inhibition of the PTH-stimulated increase in ECAR by a PTHR antagonist. SaOS-2 cells were equilibrated in running buffer containing 5% horse serum. The cells were then incubated with either control running buffer (▪) or running buffer supplemented with 100 nm[Nle8,18,d-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH-(7–34)NH2(○) for 25 min and then sequentially exposed to increasing concentrations of hPTH-(1–34) (0.01–500 nm) for 2-min intervals, and ECAR was monitored. Between agonist treatments, cells were perfused with agonist-free buffer for a minimum of 25 min to allow the ECAR to return to basal levels and to allow cells to recover responsiveness. Each point gives the mean value of four independent measurements, and the brackets give the S.E. Theasterisk indicates significant differences, atp < 0.05, between control and antagonist-pretreated cells. In the presence of the antagonist, the dose-response curve to hPTH-(1–34) was shifted to the right about 10-fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Microphysiometry was used to analyze desensitization of the receptor-mediated, PTH-induced ECAR response. Because the increase in ECAR induced by PTH was acute in nature and the acidification rates of the cells returned rapidly to the basal level, it was possible to monitor repeated sequential responses to PTH in real time. An initial response to a 2-min challenge with 100 nm hPTH-(1–34) was followed by a refractory period of approximately 15 min during which the response of the same cells to a second challenge with 100 nm hPTH-(1–34) was reduced relative to the first response. When two 2-min agonist treatments were separated by a 2.5-min wash, the second PTH-induced response was reduced to about 13% of the first (Fig. 6). As the wash time between treatments was increased, the magnitude of the second response to PTH increased, with nearly full recovery after 14.5 min of hormone-free perfusion (Fig. 6). Interestingly, decreased responsiveness after the initial exposure to PTH was not progressive. In cells treated with 100 nm hPTH-(1–34) for 2-min intervals separated by 7-min washes, the first response to hPTH-(1–34) was the largest, and the second response was reduced to about 50% of the first response; however, no further reduction in responsiveness was observed in up to nine subsequent, sequential agonist exposures (data not shown). The effect of continuous long term agonist exposure on the acute PTH-induced ECAR response was also investigated. In preparation for these experiments, SaOS-2 cells were subcultured into capsule cups as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and for 13 h prior to the experiment, the media covering the cells was changed to MEM+ supplemented with 100 nm hPTH-(1–34) or to control MEM+. Immediately before the experiments, the cells were quickly washed three times and then placed on the Cytosensor and perfused with hormone-free running buffer for about 45 min, until a stable basal acidification rate was achieved. The cells were then sequentially exposed to increasing concentrations of hPTH-(1–34) over the course of 3 h. The acute maximal response of PTH-pretreated cells to fresh agonist exposure was reduced to about 50% of the maximal response of control cells; however, the response of the control and pretreated cells to 100 nm VIP treatment was the same (data not shown). The 3–4-h lag between the washout of the PTH pretreatment and the completion of the measurement of ECAR dose-response could have allowed the preincubated cells to recover some responsiveness to PTH; nevertheless, a significant (p< 0.05) reduction in responsiveness to hormone exposure was measured. The mechanism of the PTH-stimulated increase in ECAR was then examined. When SaOS-2 cells were incubated for 30 min with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, there was no large, acute increase in ECAR such as that elicited by PTH in the same cells; only a transient 5–20% increase in ECAR was observed (Fig. 7). When UMR-106 cells were exposed to 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, a persistent increase in ECAR resulted (data not shown). The increase in ECAR in UMR-106 cells stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP peaked at 1.7-fold above basal levels and returned to basal levels only after a 50-min wash, indicating that this cAMP analog was active in the Cytosensor system. The effect of a high concentration of exogenous cAMP on the PTH-induced increase in ECAR was then examined in SaOS-2 cells. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with either 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, clamping the intracellular cAMP concentration at supramaximal levels above those generated by PTH exposure, or control running buffer, and then the cells were exposed to 10 nm hPTH-(1–34) for 2 min. The PTH-induced ECAR response in SaOS-2 cells was not affected by the simultaneous presence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 7). SaOS-2 cells were also incubated with 100 nm forskolin to stimulate endogenous cAMP production, but no acute increase in ECAR was observed (data not shown). Finally,"
https://openalex.org/W2051964914,"Phosphorylase b kinase (PbK) from skeletal muscle is a highly regulated oligomer consisting of four copies of four distinct subunits (αβγ)δ4. The γ subunit is catalytic, and the remaining subunits are regulatory. To characterize effector-induced changes in the quaternary structure of the enzyme, we utilized the ortho-, meta, andpara-isomers of phenylenedimaleimide (PDM), which in addition to having different geometries, also vary 2.5-fold in their cross-linking spans. Even at concentrations equivalent to the αβγδ protomers of PbK, all three isomers caused specific, rapid, and extensive cross-linking of the holoenzyme to form primarily αβ dimers, plus smaller amounts of βγγ and αγγ trimers. The formation of these three conjugates was nearly totally inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess over PDM of N-(o- andp-tolyl)succinimide, which are chemically inert structural analogs of PDM. This inhibition suggests that PbK has binding sites for PDM and that PDM acts as an affinity cross-linker in binding to these sites prior to forming cross-linked conjugates. The largest effect on cross-linking in progressing from o- to p-PDM was on the αγγ trimer, which is preferentially formed by thep-isomer. Activation of the enzyme by either phosphorylation or the allosteric activators ADP and GDP resulted in large increases in the amount of αγγ formed, small increases in βγγ, and little change in αβ. When cross-linked in the presence of the reversibly activating nucleoside diphosphates, PbK remained activated after their removal, indicating that cross-linking had locked it in the active conformation. Our results provide direct evidence for perturbations in the interactions of the catalytic γ subunit with the regulatory α and β subunits upon activation of PbK. Phosphorylase b kinase (PbK) from skeletal muscle is a highly regulated oligomer consisting of four copies of four distinct subunits (αβγ)δ4. The γ subunit is catalytic, and the remaining subunits are regulatory. To characterize effector-induced changes in the quaternary structure of the enzyme, we utilized the ortho-, meta, andpara-isomers of phenylenedimaleimide (PDM), which in addition to having different geometries, also vary 2.5-fold in their cross-linking spans. Even at concentrations equivalent to the αβγδ protomers of PbK, all three isomers caused specific, rapid, and extensive cross-linking of the holoenzyme to form primarily αβ dimers, plus smaller amounts of βγγ and αγγ trimers. The formation of these three conjugates was nearly totally inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess over PDM of N-(o- andp-tolyl)succinimide, which are chemically inert structural analogs of PDM. This inhibition suggests that PbK has binding sites for PDM and that PDM acts as an affinity cross-linker in binding to these sites prior to forming cross-linked conjugates. The largest effect on cross-linking in progressing from o- to p-PDM was on the αγγ trimer, which is preferentially formed by thep-isomer. Activation of the enzyme by either phosphorylation or the allosteric activators ADP and GDP resulted in large increases in the amount of αγγ formed, small increases in βγγ, and little change in αβ. When cross-linked in the presence of the reversibly activating nucleoside diphosphates, PbK remained activated after their removal, indicating that cross-linking had locked it in the active conformation. Our results provide direct evidence for perturbations in the interactions of the catalytic γ subunit with the regulatory α and β subunits upon activation of PbK. Through allosteric and covalent modification sites on its three regulatory subunits, phosphorylase b kinase (PbK) 1The abbreviations used are: PbK, phosphorylaseb kinase; PDM, phenylenedimaleimide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TNB−, free thiol of DTNB; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTS, N-(o- orp-tolyl)succinimide. integrates neural, hormonal, and metabolic signals to modulate glycogenolytic flux in skeletal muscle (for review, see Refs. 1Pickett-Gies C.R.

Although the α, β, and δ (calmodulin) regulatory subunits clearly control the activity of the catalytic γ subunit, little is known concerning the mechanisms through which they exert this control, including the extent to which their regulatory influence on γ is direct versus indirect; this is especially the case for the larger regulatory subunits, α and β.

Likewise, multiple means of activating the holoenzyme cause common conformational changes in the β subunit (5Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3266-3274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Trempe M.R. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4333-4340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cheng A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 5534-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); but again, no evidence for alteration of a direct β-γ interaction has been observed. In two previous studies, cross-linking was used successfully to detect changes in the cross-linking patterns of both the α (8Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β (5Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3266-3274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) subunits upon activation of the holoenzyme; but with the cross-linkers used, the observed changes involved only a second α or β subunit to form homodimers and did not involve the catalytic γ subunit. Even though cross-linking has been shown to be a potentially promising approach to probing structural changes associated with activation of the hexadecameric PbK holoenzyme, it has not been exploited widely because of the intrinsic difficulty in identifying unambiguously the subunit composition of cross-linked complexes (techniques used previously with PbK to analyze such complexes have been limited to approximate mass, relative susceptibility to proteolysis, and specific radioactivity of individual subunits (5Fitzgerald T.J.

The recent availability of a panel of subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies against PbK's four different subunits (11Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Landenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn, has encouraged us to evaluate additional cross-linkers, seeking to discover one capable of detecting changes in the interaction of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PbK upon its activation. The geometric isomers (ortho, meta, andpara) of the homobifunctional cross-linker phenylenedimaleimide (PDM) were evaluated with the rationale that any effector-induced perturbations in their cross-linking of PbK could be interpreted solely on the basis of geometry and span (4.8 Å foro-PDM to 12 Å for p-PDM (14Chang F.N. Flacks J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). In addition to forming an αβ dimer, each isomer cross-linked two γ subunits with an α and with a β subunit; moreover, this cross-linking was differential, in two senses. First, αγγ and βγγ were preferentially formed with activated conformers of the kinase; and second, in progressing from o-, to m-, top-PDM, there was a reversal in the relative amounts of αγγ and βγγ conjugates formed with the activated conformers (from predominantly βγγ to predominantly αγγ). The three isomers also behaved as affinity cross-linkers, i.e. binding to PbK prior to cross-linking. Based on relative efficiencies of cross-linking, two major sets of binding sites for PDM were observed, with cross-linking at the lower efficacy sites reflecting the extent of the enzyme activation. PbK was isolated from fast-twitch skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits (15King M.M. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11058-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed against a solution of Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8), sucrose (10%), EDTA (0.2 mm), and either used immediately or stored frozen at −60 °C. All experiments described in this study were repeated a minimum of three times using three different PbK preparations. When autophosphorylated PbK was required for cross-linking studies, the phosphorylation was carried out at pH 8.2 in Hepes buffer for 1 min using the methodology of King et al. (16King M.M. Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9925-9930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of phosphate incorporation with different kinase preparations ranged from 1.2 to 2.1 mol/α subunit and 0.8–1.0/β subunit. The enzyme was also phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, as described previously (12Wilkinson D.A. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Norcum M.T. Hainfeld J.F. Seyer J.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), to the extent of 1 mol of phosphate each per α and β subunit. Prior to cross-linking, PbK phosphorylated through either mechanism was purified by gel filtration over a Sepharose 6B column (1.5 × 112 cm) developed with Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 10% sucrose. Fractions that eluted at the position of native holoenzyme were collected, buffer was exchanged, and the enzyme was concentrated to 4.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon). Nonphosphorylated enzyme used as the control to determine the effects of phosphorylation was subjected to the same incubation, gel filtration, and concentration protocols. Phosphorylase b was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle (17Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 65-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and residual AMP was adsorbed with activated charcoal (Sigma, C-4386). The concentrations of PbK and phosphorylase b were determined spectrophotometrically using their respective absorbance indices (18Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar,19Kastenschmidt L.L. Kastenschmidt J. Helmreich E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3590-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (A-9647) was from Sigma, and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was from Promega. Melittin was from Sigma, with its concentration determined as described previously (20Maulet Y. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5680-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the α, β, and γ subunits of phosphorylase kinase were generated in mice against the holoenzyme as antigen (12Wilkinson D.A. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Norcum M.T. Hainfeld J.F. Seyer J.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Wilkinson D.A. Norcum M.T. Fitzgerald T.J. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The anti-calmodulin mAb was generated in mice against a peptide antigen corresponding to residues 107–148 in the COOH-terminal region of calmodulin (11Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Landenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Detection conjugates for immunoblots were from Southern Biotechnology. The concentrations of the PDM cross-linkers (Aldrich) were determined from their absorbance in dry acetone at 332 nm, the absorption maximum characteristic of the maleimido functionality. The extinction coefficient at this wavelength was determined for each isomer through its alkylation of a known excess of the free thiolate (TNB−) of DTNB, with this and all related reactions carried out in capped quartz cuvettes. The TNB− was generated by thiol exchange of DTNB (441 μm) and dithiothreitol (59 μm) in acetone (21Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The release of TNB− was monitored at 412 nm and reached a plateau after 12 min. Solutions of known TNB−concentrations (εTNB = 14,150m−1 cm−1 (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21438) Google Scholar)) were then alkylated at room temperature with limiting amounts of each PDM isomer. The absorbance of TNB− stopped decreasing after 1 h, and final measurements were made after 3 h of alkylation. The concentration of PDM in the reaction was taken to be equal to half the final decrease in the concentration of TNB−. The ε332 values for o-, m-, andp-PDM determined in this manner were 0.42, 0.59, and 0.66m−1 cm−1, respectively. Concentrations of PDM solutions determined spectrophotometrically using these extinction coefficients agreed well with concentrations based on triplicate dry weight measurements and the manufacturer's stated purity for the cross-linkers. Cross-linking was carried out at 30 °C at the indicated time intervals with o-, m-, orp-PDM. Final concentrations of protein and reagents in the standard reaction were: PbK, 1.73 μm αβγδ protomer, which is the concentration used in generating Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Hepes, 50 mm, pH 8.2; EDTA, 1.0 mm; and cross-linker, 17.3 μm, unless otherwise indicated. Prior to the cross-linking of PbK in the presence or absence of effectors, the enzyme was incubated for 2 min at 0 °C with the indicated concentrations of GDP, ADP, heparin, and melittin. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of PDM dissolved in dry acetone, with the final amount of acetone in the cross-linking reactions never exceeding 1% (v/v); in control experiments, this concentration of acetone was found to have no influence on enzymatic activity. Cross-linking was quenched by dilution of an aliquot of the reaction mixture into an equal volume of SDS buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS) followed by brief mixing. After heating at 80 °C for 10 min, the samples (14 μg/lane) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (4–15%) (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. All gels were destained in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid (2 h) and 7% acetic acid, 4% methanol (15 h). All conclusions regarding the relative amounts of cross-linked species formed were based on the integrated optical density of the protein bands determined using a BioImage whole band analyzer.Figure 2Western blots of nonactivated PbK cross-linked by o- and p-PDM.

This protocol is described in more detail under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-(tolyl)succinimides used as inhibitors of cross-linking were obtained from Aldrich and were used without further purification. Apparent molecular masses of the cross-linked species were determined from comparison with the migration of protein standards: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine plasma albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) (all from Sigma) on 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE. The heaviest independent mass standard was the αβ dimer (264 kDa) of PbK prepared by cross-linking the holoenzyme with transglutaminase (8Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunit composition of the cross-linked species was determined by Western blotting as described previously using subunit-specific antibodies (8Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the effects of cross-linking on the phosphorylase conversion activity of PbK, cross-linking (at pH 8.2) was first arrested by an 80-fold dilution in cold Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8) containing 3.0 mm dithiothreitol. Control experiments showed that inclusion of this concentration of dithiothreitol in the dilution buffer did not influence the activity of PbK in subsequent activity assays. An aliquot of the diluent was then measured for activity at pH 6.8 by following the incorporation for 5 min at 30 °C of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphorylase b using phosphocellulose strips (24Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the assay mixture were: PbK, 0.7 μg/ml; buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 6.8); phosphorylase b, 6.0 mg/ml; EGTA, 0.1 mm; CaCl2, 0.2 mm; β-mercaptoethanol, 13 mm; [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 1.5 mm, 0.17 Ci/mol; Mg(CH3CO2)2, 10 mm; and sucrose, 2–3%. The subunits of nonactivated PbK were rapidly cross-linked by o-,m-, and p-PDM (Fig.1). As judged by coelution of cross-linked and native enzyme on Sepharose 6B (data not shown), this cross-linking was intramolecular, i.e. within hexadecamers, as opposed to between. Based on their mobilities in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, three general sets of conjugates (a high, intermediate, and low mass set) were formed by cross-linking the enzyme with each PDM isomer. The formation of these sets was dependent upon the time of cross-linking and concentration of cross-linker used, as is discussed in the following sections. When nonactivated enzyme was incubated either with very small amounts of any of the three PDM isomers (1 PDM:2 αβγδ) or with an excess of the cross-linkers (10 PDM:1 αβγδ) for very short times (0.5 min) (Fig. 1), the predominant cross-linked conjugate formed was a doublet with an average mass of 258 kDa, which corresponds to an αβ dimer by mass (masstheor = 264 kDa) and by cross-reactivity with subunit-specific mAbs (Fig. 2). Two additional high mass conjugates with apparent molecular masses corresponding to a ββ dimer (masstheor = 250 kDa; −3.0% error) and an αβγ trimer (masstheor = 308 kDa; −1.7% error) were also observed in trace and minor amounts, respectively, in Western blots of the cross-linked enzyme (Fig. 2). Because the mass of the latter fell outside of the range of our mass standards (29–264 kDa), it was not considered further in this study. When cross-linking was carried out at pH 6.8, but under otherwise standard conditions (2 min at 30 °C with a 10-fold molar excesss of cross-linker over αβγδ protomer), the only significant product was the pair of αβ dimers (data not shown). Because the reaction of sulfhydryls with maleimides is approximately 1,000-fold faster than with amines at pH values below 7.0 (25Smyth D.G. Blumenfeld O.O. Konigsberg W. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), cysteine residues on α and β may be the primary nucleophiles for PDM that result in αβ formation. The presence of two αβ dimers with slightly different mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels presumably arises either from the cross-linking of different regions on α and β or from intrasubunit cross-linking of one or both of the individual subunits (26Wold F. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Either possibility indicates more than one region of cross-linking by PDM on the α and/or β subunits. Similarly, the cross-linking of β subunits to form ββ dimers with different migrations has been observed previously when activated forms of the kinase are treated with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (5Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3266-3274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that more than one region of the β subunit is also subject to chemical modification by this bifunctional aryl reagent. Based on the densities of the bands in Fig. 1, greater than 90% of the α and β subunits lost formed αβ dimers when the nonactivated holoenzyme was treated with the three PDM isomers under those conditions (low concentrations of cross-linkers or short incubation times). Not only was αβ formation relatively specific, it was also an efficient process, given that 15% of the α and β subunits were cross-linked during a short period of cross-linking (2 min) at the low ratio of 1 PDM:2αβγδ (Fig. 1 A). This high yield of cross-linking under these conditions indicates minimal competition from monosubstitution reactions or hydrolysis of the active maleimide, a significant reaction at pH 8.2 (27Ishi Y. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our standard pH of cross-linking. The specificity, rapidity, and extent of cross-linking are consistent with the presence of binding sites for PDM on the α and/or β subunits, which have significant sequence similarity (28Kilimann M.W. Zander N.F. Kuhn C.C. Crabb J.W. Meyer H.E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9381-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Increasing the concentration of PDM or the time of cross-linking resulted in increased formation of two additional conjugates with apparent masses of 225 and 205 kDa, corresponding to the masses of αγγ (masstheor = 228 kDa; −1.3% error) and βγγ trimers (masstheor = 215 kDa; −4.7% error), respectively (Fig.1). The subunit composition of these new heteromers was verified further by cross-reactivity with subunit-specific mAbs (Fig. 2). As was the case with the αβ dimer, the βγγ trimer was also present as a doublet. In contrast, however, to the αβ dimer, the rate of formation of the trimers, especially of αγγ, varied with the cross-linker used: the p-isomer caused the greatest formation of αγγ, although the amount of it formed using this isomer and nonactivated enzyme was still less than that of βγγ (Fig. 1). Also, the extent of αγγ and βγγ formation increased over a 10-min period at excess PDM concentrations (10 PDM:1 αβγδ) (Fig. 1 B), whereas the amount of discrete αβ dimer reached a maximum within 0.5 min and then slowly decreased upon further cross-linking. Because only αβ dimers are observed when the enzyme is cross-linked below pH 7.5 (data not shown), the formation at higher pH values of αγγ and βγγ trimers presumably results either from the cross-linking of different types of side chains or from a conformational change induced by alkaline pH, which is known to stimulate the activity of phosphorylase kinase greatly and to induce a conformational change (13Wilkinson D.A. Norcum M.T. Fitzgerald T.J. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A minor cross-linked species corresponding to the known mass of an αδ dimer (masstheor = 155 kDa, 0.6% error) was observed under conditions identical to those under which αγγ and βγγ trimers formed (Fig. 1). As was observed for αγγ, the rate of formation of this putative αδ dimer increased in order of cross-linking by o-, m-, and p-PDM. In blots of enzyme cross-linked by either o- orp-PDM, the conjugate interacted with the anti-α mAb but not with the anti-calmodulin mAb (the δ subunit is endogenous calmodulin) (Fig. 2, ♦). Although the anti-calmodulin mAb, which targets the COOH-terminal region of calmodulin (11Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Landenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), has been used successfully with other cross-linkers of PbK to detect trace amounts of calmodulin-containing conjugates (29Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26202-26209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it is possible that the calmodulin epitope in this particular conjugate is masked as a result of the cross-linking by PDM. The rapid and relatively specific cross-linking with concentrations of PDM below PbK suggested that these reagents might be functioning as affinity cross-linkers,i.e. that they bind to the enzyme prior to covalently cross-linking its subunits. To test this possibility, we asked whether nonfunctional structural analogs of PDM could competitively inhibit cross-linking. The first PDM analogs tested were their corresponding disuccinimides, produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the three PDM isomers; however, none of these disuccinimides was sufficiently soluble under our standard cross-linking conditions to evaluate as an inhibitor. We turned, therefore, to the more soluble monosuccinimide structural analogs o-NTS and p-NTS, both of which were found to be potent inhibitors of cross-linking by o- and p-PDM (Fig. 3). Based on the residual amounts of the α, β, γ, and δ subunits that were protected from cross-linking, a 10-fold excess of o-NTS (the more potent inhibitor) over PDM inhibited cross-linking byo- and p-PDM (10 PDM:1 αβγδ) by 95 and 91%, respectively; under identical conditions p-NTS inhibited cross-linking by the respective PDM isomers by 86 and 87%.

The importance of conserved residues in loop 8/9 was previously investigated (Pazdernik, N. J., Jessen-Marshall, A. E., and Brooker, R. J. (1997)J. Bacteriol. 179, 735–741). Although this loop was tolerant of many substitutions, a few mutations in the first position of the motif were shown to dramatically decrease lactose transport. In the current study, a mutant at the first position in the motif having very low lactose transport, Leu280, was used as a parental strain to isolate second-site revertants that restore function. A total of 23 independent mutants were sequenced and found to have a second amino acid substitution at several locations (G46C, G46S, F49L, A50T, L212Q, L216Q, S233P, C333G, F354C, G370C, G370S, and G370V). A kinetic analysis revealed that the first-site mutation, Leu280, had a slightly better affinity for lactose compared with the wild-type strain, but its V max for lactose transport was over 30-fold lower. The primary effect of the second-site mutations was to increase the V max for lactose transport, in some cases, to levels that were near the wild-type value.When comparing this study to second-site mutations obtained from loop 2/3 defective strains, a striking observation was made. Mutations in three regions of the protein, codons 45–50, 234–241, and 366–370, were able to restore functionality to both loop 2/3 and loop 8/9 defects. These results are discussed within the context of a C1/C2 alternating conformation model in which lactose translocation occurs by a conformational change at the interface between the two halves of the protein.

These results are discussed within the context of a C1/C2 alternating conformation model in which lactose translocation occurs by a conformational change at the interface between the two halves of the protein. The lactose permease is a model protein for the study of sugar transport and cation/solute symport. The protein is encoded by thelacY gene of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. The gene has been cloned and sequenced revealing an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 417 amino acids (1Teather R.M. Müller-Hill B. Abrutsch U. Aichele G. Overath P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 159: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Büchel D.E. Gronenborn B. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1980; 283: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The sequence of the lacY gene product is predicted to traverse the lipid bilayer 12 times by hydropathicity analysis (3Foster D.L. Boublik M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model has been confirmed by the analysis of genetic fusions with the genes for alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase (4Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 5Calamia J. Manoil C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, antibody binding studies have corroborated this evidence and shown that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments are located in the cytoplasm (6Carrasco N. Tahara S.M. Patel L. Goldkorn T. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6894-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Herzlinger D. Viitanen P. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R.

The protein is predicted to be approximately 80% α-helical in structure by circular dichroism, indicating that the transmembrane segments are mostly α-helical in nature (3Foster D.L. Boublik M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evolutionarily, the lactose permease is a member of a very large superfamily of solute transporters (9Henderson P.J.F. Maiden M.C.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Griffith J.K. Baker M.E. Rouch D.A. Page M.G.P. Skurray R.A. Paulsen I.T. Chater K.F. Baldwin S.A. Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The superfamily members transport a variety of solutes including sugars, amino acids, Kreb's cycle intermediates, and antibiotics. In general, most members are predicted to contain 12 transmembrane segments with a large cytoplasmic loop between helices 6 and 7, although a few exceptions to this pattern have been noted (12Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 537-543Google Scholar). Among members of the superfamily, a general homology exists between the first and second halves of the proteins, consistent with the hypothesis that the superfamily arose by a gene duplication/fusion event of a primordial gene encoding a protein of 6 transmembrane segments (13Maiden M.C.J. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C.M. Henderson P.J.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A model for the tertiary structure of the lactose permease has been proposed by examining the superfamily with regard to its pattern of structural features as well as specific data on particular transporters (12Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 537-543Google Scholar). The tertiary structure is predicted to have 8 transmembrane segments forming the channel lining regions and 4 segments that are embedded in the membrane to form scaffolding regions. A striking feature of the superfamily is the identification of a conserved motif, GXXX(D/E)(R/K)XG[X](R/K)(R/K), located in hydrophilic loop 2/3 and repeated again at the analogous region in the second half of the protein in loop 8/9. Its conservation within such a large superfamily suggests that it may play a general role in protein structure or function. The importance of conserved residues in this motif has been extensively studied in the lactose permease and tetracycline antiporter (14Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Pazdernik N.J. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With regard to transport function, the residues at the first position in both loops, and the fifth position in loop 2/3 appear to be the most important. The other sites in the motif tend to be tolerant of amino acid substitutions to varying degrees. The basic residues may be important for structural stability, a feature that is consistent with the positive inside rule (19von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). A useful approach to investigate the functional role of important amino acids within a protein is to isolate second-site revertants that restore activity to mutant strains having a first-site mutation that alters a critical amino acid. For example, previous suppressor mutations of the lactose permease identified potential salt-bridge interactions of TM 1The abbreviation used is: TM, transmembrane. -7/TM-10, TM-7/TM-11, TM-8/TM-10, and TM-9/TM-10 (20King S.C.

More recently, this approach has been used by us, and by Yamaguchi and colleagues (24Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1400-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Jessen-Marshall A.E. Parker N. Brooker R.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11800-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), to study the functional roles of mutations in the loop 2/3 motif. In the tetracycline antiporter, two second-site revertants have been characterized (26Yamaguchi A. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11800-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One altered protein production by mutating the promoter/operator region, and the other was a structural mutation, A40D, which adds a negative charge to loop 1/2. In the lactose permease, we have isolated many second-site revertants, starting with parental strains that have defective mutations in loop 2/3. The locations of these second-site substitutions has led to the proposal that the functional role of loop 2/3 is to facilitate conformational changes between the two halves of the protein (24Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1400-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Jessen-Marshall A.E. Parker N. Brooker R.J. J.

Open table in a new tab HS4006/F′IQZ+Y−cells containing plasmids carrying the wild-type or mutant permeases were grown at 37 °C with shaking to mid-log phase in YT media supplemented with 0.005 mg/ml tetracycline and 0.25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 60 mmK2HPO4 and 40 mmKH2PO4, then resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 0.5 mg of protein/ml. The cells were equilibrated at 30 °C for 5–10 min before [14C]lactose (2.5 μCi/ml) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Aliquots of 200 μl were removed at the appropriate time points and the cells were captured on 0.45-μm Metricel membranes (Gelman Sciences, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). The cells were then washed with 5–10 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer by rapid filtration. The filter with the cells was then placed in liquid scintillation fluid and counted using a Beckman LS1801 liquid scintillation counter. The HS4006/F′IQZ+Y− carrying the pACYC184 vector with no lacY insert was used to determine the background level of lactose transport. This background value was subtracted from the experimental values to determine the nanomoles [14C]lactose/mg of total protein. The K m andV max for lactose transport were determined by plotting 1/V verses 1/[S] in a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot (29Segal I. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Following identification of suppressor strains with a red phenotype on 1% melibiose MacConkey plates, double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced according to Kraft et al. (30Kraft R. Tardiff J. Drauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-547PubMed Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of each gene was sequenced. Ten ml of mid-log cells were grown as described for the transport assays, then harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). The pellet was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, then resuspended in 400 μl of MTPBS (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4). The suspension was quickly frozen two more times in liquid nitrogen. The cell suspension was then sonicated three times for 20 s each. Forty μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added, and the membrane fraction was harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of MTPBS, and subjected to a modified Lowry protein assay (Sigma). One hundred μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% acrylamide gel. The proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose and Western blot analysis was performed according to Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primary antibody was a polyclonal antibody recognizing the lactose permease COOH-terminal 10 amino acids. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit, was purchased from Sigma. The Western blot was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium colorimetric reaction. The Western blot was then scanned using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer and analyzed by comparison to wild-type values for the same preparation and Western blot. Values are reported as a percentage of wild-type for three separate preparations. A conserved motif, GXXX(D/E)(R/K)XG(R/K)(R/K), is found within hydrophilic loop 2/3 and repeated again in loop 8/9 among members of the superfamily that includes the lactose permease (9Henderson P.J.F. Maiden M.C.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Griffith J.K. Baker M.E. Rouch D.A. Page M.G.P. Skurray R.A. Paulsen I.T.

Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In loop 8/9, the first three or four residues within the motif are predicted to lie within the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 8. A glycine is commonly found in the first position although the lactose permease and some other members of the superfamily have a proline at this position. In the lactose permease, this corresponds to Pro280. Both glycine and proline are strong α-helix breakers, and this property has been previously suggested to be important at the first position in the motif (16Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study with the lactose permease, bulky residues that are strong α-helical formers were inhibitory when substituted at this position. Less bulky residues such as cysteine, aspartate, glutamine, and asparagine were tolerated at this position as were bulky residues that are not strong α-helical formers such as tyrosine and phenylalanine. A Leu280 substitution showed downhill lactose transport that was less than 5% of the wild-type value even though the amount of permease protein in the membrane was normal (15Pazdernik N.J. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 735-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its low level of lactose uptake, the uphill accumulation of the Leu280strain was also lower than wild-type (i.e. 13%), but not completely defective. In the current study, this Leu280strain was used as a parental strain to isolate suppressors (i.e. second-site revertants). These are termed suppressors because they suppress the inhibitory effects of the first-site mutation. To identify suppressor mutations, the Leu280 strain was streaked on 1% melibiose MacConkey plates. Melibiose is an α-galactoside that is transported very well by the wild-type lactose permease but poorly by the Leu280 parental strain. Therefore, the Leu280 parent forms white colonies due to its low level of sugar transport. After a few days, however, suppressor mutations were identified as red flecks in the primary streak. These red flecks were restreaked to isolate individual red colonies and to confirm that the mutation suppressed the white phenotype of the parental strain. A total of 28 independent suppressors were saved, and then subjected to DNA sequencing across codon 280. Five of the 28 suppressors contained first-site reversions which altered the Leu280 to another residue. The remaining 23 suppressors retained a leucine residue at codon 280. These were saved for further study. It should be noted that melibiose MacConkey plates were used instead of lactose MacConkey plates because the Leu280mutation had a pink phenotype on lactose MacConkey plates which made it more difficult to identify red revertants. In addition to the Leu280 mutation, all of the 23 second-site suppressor strains had a single nucleotide substitution at various locations throughout the lacY gene. TableII describes the nature of these mutations, and their predicted locations within the secondary topology of the lactose permease is shown in Fig.1. Overall, the suppressors were loosely grouped into 3 regions: the periplasmic side of TM-2 and loop 1/2; TM-7 and loop 6/7; and the periplasmic side of TM-11 and loop 11/12 (Fig. 1,rectangles). Only one suppressor, pP280L/C333G, is not located in these three regions. It is found on the cytoplasmic side of TM-10.Table IICodon changes and location of suppressor mutantsStrainNumber of isolatesSecond-site codon changeLocation in secondary structurepLAC184pP280LCytoplasmic side of TM-8pP280L/G46C3GGT to TGTPeriplasmic loop 1–2pP280L/G46S5GGT to AGTPeriplasmic loop 1–2pP280L/F49L3TTT to TTGPeriplasmic side of TM-2pP280L/A50T1GCC to ACCPeriplasmic side of TM-2pP280L/L212Q2CTG to CAGCytoplasmic loop 6–7pP280L/L216Q1CTG to CAGCytoplasmic loop 6–7pP280L/S233P2TCC to CCCMiddle of TM-7pP280L/C333G1TGC to GGCCytoplasmic side of TM-10pP280L/F354C1TTC to TGCMiddle of TM-11pP280L/G370C1GGC to TGCPeriplasmic loop 11–12pP280L/G370S2GGC to AGCPeriplasmic loop 11–12pP280L/G370V1GGC to GTCPeriplasmic loop 11–12 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effects of the second-site mutations, the wild-type, parent, and suppressor strains were initially screened for their ability to transport sugars based on their phenotype on MacConkey indicator plates. These plates contained lactose (a β-galactoside), melibiose (α-galactoside), or maltose (a α-glucoside) at three different concentrations: 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0%. A strain exhibiting good transport of these sugars will have a red phenotype. Strains having intermediate levels of transport will show a red center or pink phenotype, while a white phenotype indicates very low transport activity. As shown in TableIII, the wild-type is red on lactose and melibiose plates while the Leu280 strain is white, except for a pink phenotype at high lactose concentrations. The suppressors have a red or red center phenotype on 1% melibiose MacConkey plates. This is expected since they were originally isolated on these types of plates. There were three suppressors with pink phenotypes at lower melibiose concentrations: pP280L/C333G, pP280L/L212Q, and pP280L/G46S. However, these three strains and all of the remaining suppressors had a red phenotype at all the lactose concentrations tested.Table IIIPhenotype on MacConkey platesStrain0.2% Mel0.4% Mel1% Mel0.2% Lac0.4% Lac1% Lac0.2% Malt0.4% Malt1% MaltpP280LWhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhitePinkWhiteWhiteWhitepLac184RedRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhitePinkpACYC184WhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhiteWhitepP280L/G46SPinkRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhiteWhitepP280L/G46CRedRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhiteWhitepP280L/A50TRedRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhiteWhitepP280L/F49LRedRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhitePinkpP280L/F354CPinkRedRedRedRedRedWhiteWhiteWhitepP280L/G370SR.

Open table in a new tab The phenotype of E. coli strains on maltose MacConkey can provide an indication of an alteration of sugar specificity since the lactose permease normally does not recognize this sugar very well. To carry out this analysis, the wild-type and mutant plasmids were transformed into a strain that is malB − andlacY − to determine if the mutations have an enhanced recognition of maltose. Only one suppressor, pP280L/L216Q, showed a slight enhancement in its ability to recognize maltose as evidenced by a red center phenotype on 1% maltose MacConkey plates. This mutation is only 4 amino acids away from another suppressor pP280L/L212Q which did not have an enhanced recognition of maltose. In general, the results of this plating suggest that the suppressor mutations are not usually altering the sugar recognition properties of the lactose permease in a major way. To examine lactose transport quantitatively, the wild-type and mutant strains were assayed for their ability to transport [14C]lactose. As shown in Fig.2, the suppressor strains have a fairly large range of transport levels. In general, most of the suppressor strains showed downhill lactose transport that was significantly higher than the Leu280 parent. However, two strains that had a pink phenotype at low melibiose concentrations (i.e.pP280L/C333G and pP280L/S233P) had transport values that were similar to the Leu280 parent. This result initially seemed contradictory to the plating results for lactose in which these strains had a red phenotype. However, as described later, the results can be explained by the differences in sugar concentrations between the two experiments. The lactose concentration in the plates is much higher (5.6 mm at 0.2% to 11.1 mm at 0.4%) than the transport assay (0.1 mm). Suppressors with higherK m and higher V max values may have relatively low rates of transport at low lactose concentrations but substantially higher rates of transport at saturating concentrations. To obtain a better understanding of the effects of the suppressor mutations, a selected number of suppressor strains were subjected to a kinetic analysis. The apparent K m andV max values are described in TableIV. The parent mutation has a dramatically lower V max, and a slightly higher affinity compared with the wild-type (15Pazdernik N.J. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 735-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A general trend was observed among the suppressor strains. They tended to restore the kinetic parameters back to values that were similar to the wild-type strain; the more dramatic effect was an elevation of theV max for lactose transport. The G370V suppressor, for example, raised the V max to values that were similar to the wild-type strain. Several other suppressors (G46C, F49L, L216Q, S233P, and F354C) raised theV max from 6- to 15-fold while theK m values were only affected 3–5-fold. Two mutations that showed a low value for lactose transport in Fig. 2, pP280L/C333G and pP280L/S233P, have K m values of 0.4 and 1.3, respectively. The decreased affinity for lactose is coupled with an enhanced V max and explains why these strains showed low [14C]lactose transport at 0.1 mm but were red on MacConkey plates that have saturating lactose concentrations.Table IVTable of apparent Km and Vmax valuesMutation/revertantK m ± S.E.V max ± S.E.mmnmol lactose/min·mg proteinpLAC1840.5 ± 0.1197.0 ± 37.6pP280L4-aThe single mutants having a lowV max were tested for their protein levels in the membrane as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative to the wild-type strain, the protein levels in the three single mutants, P280L, A50T, and G370V were 92% ± 5, 70% ± 3.7, and 96% ± 23, respectively.0.1 ± 0.16.1 ± 3.1pP280L/G46C0.3 ± 0.0451.2 ± 5.3pP280L/F49L0.4 ± 0.147.2 ± 9.7pP280L/A50T0.9 ± 0.466.2 ± 23.6pP280L/L212Q0.1 ± 0.18.2 ± 2.5pP280L/L216Q0.4 ± 0.189.6 ± 24.1pP280L/S233P1.3 ± 0.653.8 ± 25.9pP280L/C333G0.4 ± 0.114.1 ± 4.1pP280L/F354C0.5 ± 0.137.7 ± 5.0pP280L/G370V1.1 ± 0.2199.9 ± 34.7pA50T1.1 ± 0.215.2 ± 4.9pG370V2.4 ± 0.450.7 ± 14.74-a The single mutants having a lowV max were tested for their protein levels in the membrane as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative to the wild-type strain, the protein levels in the three single mutants, P280L, A50T, and G370V were 92% ± 5, 70% ± 3.7, and 96% ± 23, respectively. Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the kinetic effects of the suppressor mutations, two of them, A50T and G370V, were separated from the P280L parent mutation by restriction digestion. As shown at the bottom of Table IV, both of the single suppressor mutations had V maxvalues that were substantially lower than the corresponding double mutant strain with a P280L mutation (66.2 versus 15.2 and 199.9 versus 50.7). These results suggest the first-site mutation alone and the suppressor mutations alone tend to perturb the structure of the permease in a way that inhibits conformational changes associated with lactose transport. However, when they are coupled together, the two mutations compensate for each other's structural perturbations and substantially restore the ability to translocate lactose. In the current study, we have isolated and characterized suppressor mutations that restore a significant amount of lactose permease function to a protein that has a defective mutation in the first position of the conserved motif in cytoplasmic loop 8/9.

The γ subunit, with a mass of 44.7 kDa (4Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) that is undoubtedly responsible for the Ca2+ dependence of the enzyme activity, given that complexes containing the δ subunit (γδ, αγδ, and PbK) are stimulated by Ca2+ (9Chan K.-F.J. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5948-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the free γ subunit is not (10Kee S.M. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4732-4737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct, high affinity binding domains for CaM/Ca2+ have been identified near the COOH terminus of the γ subunit (11Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the δ subunit has been shown to interact with γ in the holoenzyme (12Picton C. Klee C.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); and, CaM/Ca2+ stimulates the activity of free isolated γ subunit (10Kee S.M. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4732-4737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the primary site of interaction for the δ subunit within the holoenzyme is presumed to be on the catalytic γ subunit. PbK can be activated through a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation (13Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Brostrom C.O. Ho E.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1968-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteolysis (14Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and allosterically by ADP (15Cheng A. Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2535-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but none of the variously activated forms of the enzyme loses the capacity to be stimulated by Ca2+ions. Although there have been a large number of studies on the relationship of Ca2+ to activity, little is known about the effect of Ca2+ ions on the structure of the holoenzyme, either activated or nonactivated. A recent communication has suggested that Ca2+ increases the accessibility of specific loci within the COOH-terminal region of the γ subunit of nonactivated enzyme (16Wangsgard W.P. Dasgupta M. Blumenthal D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In addition to the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ mediated by the endogenous CaM (δ subunit), which is essentially bound irreversibly to PbK, Ca2+ is also required for the reversible binding of exogenous CaM to a different site on the holoenzyme (17Shenolikar S. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Nairn A.C. Perry S.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18DePaoli-Roach A.A. Gibbs J.B. Roach P.J.

Chem. 1980; 255: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This exogenous CaM is termed δ′, and it binds in a stoichiometry of one δ′ molecule/each αβγδ protomer (12Picton C. Klee C.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,20Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Gerschinski A.M. Meyer H.E. Jennissen H.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 19-30Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This binding of δ′/Ca2+ further stimulates activity past that obtained with Ca2+ alone, especially for nonactivated PbK (19Walsh K.X. Millikin D.M. Schlender K.K. Reimann E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on cross-linking and peptide binding studies (12Picton C. Klee C.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Gerschinski A.M. Meyer H.E. Jennissen H.P. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7087-7091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both the α and β subunits apparently contribute to the binding site for δ′/Ca2+, although it is again the γ subunit that is ultimately stimulated. Even though the binding sites for δ and δ′ are distinct and on different subunits, skeletal muscle troponin C can substitute for both δ in activating isolated γ subunit (23Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7285-7289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and δ′ in activating the holoenzyme (21Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,24Cohen P. Picton C. Klee C.B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Yoshikawa K. Usui H. Imazu M. Takeda M. Ebashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 413-419Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structural effects induced by the binding of δ′/Ca2+ to PbK are only slightly more fully characterized than the effects of Ca2+ alone. This laboratory has found that δ′/Ca2+ increases the binding to nonactivated PbK (26.Wilkinson, D. A. (1993) Immunochemical Studies of the Structure and Function of Phosphorylase Kinase. Ph.D. dissertation, pp. 107–108, University of Tennessee, Memphis.Google Scholar) of a monoclonal antibody specific for an epitope (27Wilkinson D.A. Norcum M.T. Fitzgerald T.J. Marion T.N. Tillman D.M. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that occurs at the base of the peptide binding lobe of the γ subunit (28Owen D.J. Noble M.E.M. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and also increases the incorporation of putrescine into that subunit by transglutaminase (29Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in the case of the structural influence of Ca2+ alone cited above (16Wangsgard W.P. Dasgupta M. Blumenthal D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), both of these effects were interpreted as manifestations of increased accessibility of particular regions of the γ subunit induced by the binding of δ′/Ca2+ (26.Wilkinson, D. A. (1993) Immunochemical Studies of the Structure and Function of Phosphorylase Kinase. Ph.D. dissertation, pp. 107–108, University of Tennessee, Memphis.Google Scholar, 29Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the transglutaminase used in that study required Ca2+, the effect of δ′/Ca2+ on the structure of γ that it detected was necessarily greater than that caused by Ca2+ alone. The incorporation of putrescine into the α and β subunits was also influenced by δ′/Ca2+, with modification of α decreased and β increased (29Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect on α could be due to direct steric inhibition caused by the specific binding of δ′/Ca2+, the stimulatory effect on modification of β indicates a conformational change in that subunit induced by δ′/Ca2+. In this study, we have used mono- and bifunctional modifying agents as conformational probes to compare the effects of Ca2+ aloneversus δ′/Ca2+ on the structure of PbK. Using the monofunctional reagents, we have further addressed the issue of relative changes in the conformation of the γ subunit induced by the two activators. The bifunctional reagents have allowed a screening for relative changes in the interactions of all subunits (as detected by cross-linking) initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to the δ subunit or of δ′/Ca2+ to the α/β subunits. These conformational probes have also been used to evaluate whether activation of the enzyme through other mechanisms alters the structural changes induced by Ca2+ and δ′/Ca2+. The results obtained indicate that, although Ca2+ has structural effects characteristic of other activators, it also has distinct effects, and these are observed with both nonactivated and activated enzyme; δ′/Ca2+ appears, for the most part, to amplify the structural changes brought about by Ca2+ alone. A preliminary account of this work has been published (30Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (abstr.): 1304Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nonactivated and autophosphorylated PbK used in this study were described in the accompanying report (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All experiments described herein were repeated a minimum of three times using three different PbK preparations. Phosphorylase b and bovine serum albumin were obtained as described (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as were the four mAbs and their detection conjugates. Bovine brain CaM was isolated as described previously (32Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CaM (at Lys-94) was prepared by treatment with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin at pH 6.0 and purified over DEAE-Spherogel by the procedure of Mann and Vanaman (33Mann D.M. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2373-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of PbK, phosphorylase b, bovine brain CaM, and BtCaM were determined as described (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Mann D.M. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2373-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reductive methylation of PbK was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C essentially as described (34Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the reaction were: 1.73 μm PbK αβγδ protomers, 50 mm Hepes, pH 6.8 or 8.2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmNaCNBH3, and 2.92 mm[3H]CH2O (1.28 Ci/mol, American Radiochemicals, St. Louis). The enzyme was also modified under identical conditions, but in the presence of 1.25 mmCaCl2 ± 1.73 μm CaM. Carboxymethylation of PbK with [3H]iodoacetic acid was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. Final concentrations in the reaction were: 1.73 μm PbK protomers, 50 mmHepes, pH 6.8 or 8.2, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm[3H]iodoacetic acid (28.6 Ci/mol, American Radiochemicals). Concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM identical to those used in the reductive methylation were also used, where indicated, in the alkylation reaction. Methylation and carboxymethylation of the kinase subunits were quenched by dilution of an aliquot of the assay mixture into an equivalent volume of SDS buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS), followed by brief mixing. After heating at 80 °C for 10 min, the samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient (4–20%) gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. All gels were destained in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid (2 h) and 7% acetic acid, 4% methanol (15 h). The integrated optical density of the protein bands was determined on a BioImage whole band analyzer. Each band was then excised, solubilized, and decolorized by heating in 250 μl of 30% H2O2 for 2 h at 80 °C. The samples and blanks, which contained equivalent amounts of polyacrylamide and H2O2, were diluted with 7 ml of Ecoscint scintillation mixture (ICN), and the3H content was determined. Standard conditions for cross-linking were developed by optimizing time and cross-linker concentration to allow formation of sufficient amounts of intermediate sized complexes of interest for convenient quantification, while the amounts formed were still capable of increasing or decreasing in a linear manner in response to effectors. With o-phenylenedimaleimide (o-PDM, 17.3 μm),m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS, 8.6 μm), and 1,1′-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene)bismaleimide (mdPDM, 17.3 μm), the cross-linking was carried out at 30 °C for 2 min with the indicated final concentrations of cross-linkers. In the case of the photocross-linkerN-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide (ANB·NOS, 86.0 μm), it was first incubated with PbK for 30 min in the dark, and cross-linking was then initiated by irradiation with UV light (360 nm) for 1 min at 4 °C. Besides cross-linkers, the final concentrations of the other components in the reactions were: 1.73 μm PbK αβγδ protomer, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.2, and 1.0 mm EDTA. These same conditions were used to test the effects of Ca2+ (1.25 mmCaCl2, i.e. 250 μm in excess of chelator), Ca2+/CaM (1.25 mm/1.73 μm), and Ca2+/BtCaM (1.25 mm/1.73 μm), except for the experiment shown in Fig. 2, where CaM was used at the indicated concentrations. Cross-linking was quenched with SDS buffer, and the subunits were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. As was observed previously with PDM (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), cross-linking of PbK by MBS and ANB·NOS was intramolecular, as judged by coelution of the indicated conjugates with native enzyme on Sepharose 6B (data not shown); mdPDM was not evaluated in this aspect. Subunit composition of cross-linked species was analyzed by Western blotting using subunit-specific mAbs as described previously (29Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The extent of cross-linking for individual bands was determined using transmissive and reflective densitometry to measure bands stained with Coomassie Blue in SDS-PAGE and alkaline phosphatase in Western blots, respectively. The electroblotting conditions used to achieve quantitative transfer of the various conjugates onto nitrocellulose resulted in a relatively low recovery of monomeric CaM, presumably because of its low molecular weight. For the detection of BtCaM, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology) was exposed to blots and assayed with an alkaline phosphatase kit from Bio-Rad, following the supplier's suggested protocol. Apparent molecular masses of cross-linked species were determined from comparison with the migration of commercial protein standards (29–250 kDa) on 4–20% linear gradient PAGE (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in identifying αβ dimers formed by the chemical cross-linkers and as the maximum molecular mass standard (no attempt was made to estimate the masses of oligomers with apparent molecular masses greater than that of the αβ dimer). The assays at pH 6.8 for the phosphorylase conversion activity of PbK, with and without cross-linking, were performed exactly as described in the previous report (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To screen for perturbation of the catalytic γ subunit induced by the binding of Ca2+ to endogenous CaM (δ) or by the binding of exogenous CaM/Ca2+ (δ′) to the (αβγδ)4holoenzyme, PbK was incubated with radioactive, general chemical modifiers as conformational probes either alone (control), with Ca2+, or with δ′/Ca2+ (equimolar to αβγδ protomers), and the incorporation of label into the γ subunit was followed. Carboxymethylation by iodoacetate ([3H]ICH2CO2−), which is selective for thiols, and reductive methylation by formaldehyde ([3H]CH2O), which is selective for amines, were used for the modifications, which were performed at both pH 6.8, where the nonactivated enyzme has little activity, and pH 8.2, where it is nearly fully active. At either pH, there was a linear carboxymethylation of the γ subunit for 20 min (data not shown), which was enhanced by Ca2+ and δ′/Ca2+, respectively, by 2.1 × and 2.8 × at pH 6.8 and by 1.8 × and 2.4 × at pH 8.2 (Fig.1 A). Similarly, under conditions where reductive methylation of the γ subunit increased linearly with time, Ca2+ enhanced its modification by 1.5 × at pH 6.8 and by 2.0 × at pH 8.2; however, for this particular conformational probe, δ′/Ca2+ had little effect over that of Ca2+ alone at either pH (Fig.1 B). These data suggest that regardless of the activity state of the enzyme as defined by pH, Ca2+ increases the accessibility of at least one thiol group and multiple amine groups on the γ subunit (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the fact that catalytic activity is Ca2+-dependent at both pH values. Chemical cross-linkers with different chemistries and spans were evaluated for their ability to detect changes in subunit interactions (in addition to those described above) that were induced by Ca2+ and δ′/Ca2+. Because the effects of δ′/Ca2+ seemed to be overlaid on those of Ca2+ alone (Fig. 1), our initial screening was with δ′/Ca2+, where the excess Ca2+ would simultaneously saturate the δ subunit. Cross-linking of control enzyme by o-PDM, MBS, ANB·NOS, and mdPDM (Fig.2) resulted in the formation of low and intermediate molecular mass cross-linked species of known subunit composition, of αβ dimers, and of high molecular mass oligomers containing all four subunits, but in indeterminate amounts (denoted asa and b in Figs. 2, 3 and 6). As before (29Nadeau O.W. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29670-29676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the subunit composition and stoichiometry of cross-linked conjugates were determined by their masses and cross-reactivities against subunit-specific mAbs. The δ′/Ca2+ promoted significant changes in the rates of subunit cross-linking of PbK by all of the cross-linkers. With o-PDM and mdPDM, the cross-linking of α, β, and γ was increased (i.e. their rates of disappearance increased), with this effect more pronounced at higher concentrations of δ′ and with the longer cross-linker (Fig. 2,B and E). In contrast, with ANB·NOS or MBS, δ′/Ca2+ protected the β subunit from cross-linking, with higher concentrations of δ′ being more effective (Fig. 2,C and D).Figure 6Effect of Ca2+ and δ′/Ca2+ on the cross-linking of autophosphorylated phosphorylase kinase. Under the standard cross-linking conditions, autophosphorylated PbK (control, lane 1) was cross-linked with o-PDM (panel A) or MBS (panel B) in the absence of effectors (lane 2) or in the presence of Ca2+ (lane 3) or δ′/Ca2+(lane 4) or BtCaM/Ca2+ (lane 5), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained for protein to determine the extent of cross-linking or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with the anti-CaM mAb or with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Avidin-AP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to altering the rates of cross-linking, δ′/Ca2+ also changed the patterns of subunit cross-linking, with new cross-linked species formed that contained CaM: αγδδ with o-PDM and βCaM with MBS (Fig. 2, B and C, and Figs. 3 and4). In all such complexes, the CaM could, of course, represent either δ or δ′; in many cases, as is described in a later section, we were able to distinguish between the two alternatives by utilizing derivatized CaM (BtCaM) as δ′. As a result, whenever possible throughout this report, conjugates are specifically denoted as containing either δ or δ′ (e.g. αγδδ above); if δ could be present with δ′ or if the two are alternatively present in a conjugate (depending on cross-linking conditions), then the conjugate is simply denoted as containing CaM (e.g. βCaM above). In figures, for the labeling of a given band that might contain δ under one condition (one gel lane) but not another (a different gel lane), the “CaM” nomenclature is also used. The complication regarding the presence in conjugates of δversus δ′ is relevant, of course, only for cross-linking carried out in the presence of δ′/Ca2+, not Ca2+ alone, where only the δ subunit is present. Because cross-linking by o-PDM and MBS demonstrated the most significant changes in response to δ′/Ca2+, we focused primarily on these cross-linkers as probes for targeting interactions in the holoenzyme mediated by δ and δ′. To establish reference data against which to determine the effects of Ca2+ and δ′/Ca2+ on subunit interactions, we characterized as fully as possible the cross-linking of nonactivated, control PbK by o-PDM and MBS. For o-PDM (4.8 Å cross-linking span), the conditions for cross-linking were as described previously (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and correspondingly, the cross-linked species formed by a 10-fold molar excess of the cross-linker over protomers were as before, namely predominant doublets of αβ dimers and βγγ trimers, plus small amounts of an αγγ trimer and a doublet with the mass of an αδ dimer, but which cross-reacted only with anti-α mAb (Fig. 3, lane 2). As was discussed previously (31Nadeau O.W. Sacks D.B. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26196-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3266-3274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of doublets most likely results from intramolecular cross-linking within the large α and β subunits. In addition to the cross-linked complexes, the degradation product of α (αfrag) that commonly occurs in small amounts in purified preparations of the enzyme (14Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) also showed the ability to cross-react with more than one mAb; its predominant interaction was, as expected, with the anti-α mAb, but it also showed highly variable cross-reactivity with the anti-CaM mAb (Fig. 3, lane 2). Because of this cross-reactivity, any species that, based on mass and cross-reactivity with the different mAbs, could have possibly contained the αfrag was eliminated from further analysis. The variability in the cross-reactivity may be related to epitope presentation in the blotting process itself because in all cases there was no cross-reactivity by the anti-CaM mAb with the intact α subunit, only with the αfrag. When nonactivated, control enzyme was cross-linked with MBS (9.9 Å cross-linking span), the majority of the cross-linked complexes contained the β subunit (Fig. 4, lane 2). The predominant species formed were a βγγ trimer (5.0% error) and an αβ dimer (2.3% error) and in smaller amounts, a ββ dimer (masstheor = 250 kDa; 3.0% error) and an only partially classified conjugate termed βX225 that contained β and δ and migrated with a mass of 225 kDa, slightly slower than βγγ. The mass and cross-reactivity of this last complex do not correspond to any straightforward combination of subunits. Several other complexes containing the β subunit that were present in only small amounts had masses that most closely corresponded to a βδ dimer (masstheor = 142 kDa) but did not cross-react with the anti-CaM"
https://openalex.org/W2146018581,"Previous kinetic studies have shown that protease nexin-2 is a potent, reversible, and competitive inhibitor of factor XIa. Here we show that high molecular weight heparin potentiates the ability of protease nexin-2 to inhibit factor XIa with a parabolic concentration dependence, predominantly because of an increase of the association rate constant with little perturbation of the dissociation rate constant. No effect on factor XIa inhibition by protease nexin-2 was observed with heparin preparations of 6–22 saccharide units (0.1 nm–10 μm), whereas heparin preparations with 32–64 saccharide units potentiated factor XIa inhibition by protease nexin-2 in a size- and concentration-dependent manner. We propose a model wherein heparin exerts this effect by providing a template for the assembly of factor XIa-protease nexin-2 complexes, and only heparin polymers consisting of greater than 32 saccharide units (M r ∼10,000) are sufficiently long to provide a template to which factor XIa and protease nexin-2 molecules can bind simultaneously. Heparin-mediated enhancement of factor XIa inhibition by protease nexin-2 was partially abrogated by high molecular weight kininogen, suggesting that high molecular weight kininogen may play a role in regulating factor XIa activity.

We have previously conducted detailed kinetic analyses to characterize the inhibition of FXIa by PN-2 using a fluorogenic substrate that is ∼1,000-fold more sensitive for FXIa than the most sensitive and specific chromogenic substrates (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism of FXIa inhibition by PN-2 is best described as a simple, one-step binding interaction during which PN-2 reversibly inhibits FXIa. Our studies have shown that PN-2 is a slow, tight binding inhibitor of FXIa, with an association rate constant (k on) of 2.1 ± 0.2 × 106m−1 s−1, a dissociation rate constant (k off) of 8.5 ± 0.8 × 10−4 s−1, and aK i of 400 pm, a value in good agreement with previous reports (6Smith R.P.

Further, we found that high molecular weight kininogen (HK) protects FXIa from inhibition by PN-2 with a saturable concentration dependence (the EC50 for HK was essentially identical to theK d for the binding interaction between FXIa and HK) and that this protection results from the decreased ability of PN-2 to inhibit the FXIa·HK complex (8Scandura J.M.

Several studies have shown that the capacity of PN-2 to inhibit FXIa is potentiated by heparin (6Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J.

Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we were prompted to investigate the effects of HK and Zn2+ ions on the heparin-potentiated inhibition of FXIa by PN-2. PN-2 was purified from fibroblast culture media using techniques of heparin affinity chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (7Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Human FXIa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human HK was from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Fluorescein mono-p-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride, fluorescein, and unfractionated heparin from bovine lung (averageM r = 10,000) were purchased from Sigma. Purified heparin fractions consisting of 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 32, 48 and 64 saccharide units (1.74, 2.97, 4.2, 5.43, 7, 10, 15, and 20 kDa, respectively) were purified and kindly donated by Dr. Steven T.

The chromogenic substrate S-2366 was purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). All other reagents were analytical grade or the best quality commercially available. The active site concentration of purified FXIa was titrated with the sensitive burst titrant fluorescein mono-p-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (16Melhado L.L. Peltz S.W. Leytus S.P. Mangel W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7299-7306Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as described previously (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concentration of PN-2 reactive sites was determined by titration with active site-titrated trypsin or FXIa as described (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that in the absence of heparin PN-2 inhibits FXIa via a “one-step” mechanism as follows, E+S⇆KmE·S→kcatE+P+Ikon⇵koffE·I MECHANISM1where E represents the enzyme FXIa, I represents the inhibitor PN-2, and k on andk off are the forward and the reverse rate constants for the inhibition, respectively. We assumed that in the presence of heparin, this mechanism was also valid, and we show evidence to support this assumption (see “Results”). Progress curve measurements were performed both in the absence and the presence of unfractionated heparin or purified heparin fractions. Cleavage of the fluorescent substrate Boc-EAR-AMC (17Kawabata S. Miura T. Morita T. Kato H. Fujikawa K. Iwanaga S. Takada K. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Eur. J.

Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 2 ml of Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (126 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 0.4 mmNaH2 PO4·H2O, 5.6 mmdextrose, 15 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) and underwent continuous gentle stirring throughout the measurement period. Hydrolysis of the fluorescent substrate Boc-EAR-AMC (25 μm final) by FXIa (20 pm final active site concentration) was recorded at 15-s intervals for 10 min before and up to 1 h after the addition (<20 μl) of PN-2 (0–2 nm final). Alternatively, FXIa and PN-2 were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C before being diluted 100-fold into substrate-containing buffer. The change in relative fluorescence after dilution was monitored for 1 h at 15-s intervals. Data recorded after the addition of PN-2 to FXIa represent association progress curves, whereas data monitored after the dilution of preformed FXIa·PN-2 complexes represent dissociation progress curves. The rate constants (k on andk off) were obtained by nonlinear, least squares fits to Equation 2 of the association and dissociation progress curve data measured at multiple PN-2 concentrations. Equation 2 results from the solution of the nonlinear, separable differential equation, Equation 1, and is valid for reactions proceeding according to a one-step mechanism (described below) even when the concentration of inhibitor changes dramatically during the experimental time course (i.e. under true second-order conditions). In some cases, when data were collected under pseudo first-order conditions, the progress curve data were analyzed with the equations of Cha (18Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) as described previously (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N.

The K i was either calculated as the ratio of the reverse and forward rate constants determined from progress curve analysis or obtained from equilibrium measurements as described below. In the equilibrium method, increasing amounts of PN-2 (0–10 nm in the absence of heparin and 0–1 nm in the presence of heparin) were incubated with a constant amount of FXIa (125 pm) at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the establishment of an equilibrium between the inhibitor and enzyme. After this preincubation step, a small volume of substrate S-2366 (0.5 mm) was added, and the residual FXIa activity was determined by measuring the initial velocity of substrate cleavage for 10 min. This time period was sufficiently short, and the substrate concentration was sufficiently low to ensure that the equilibrium was not perturbed during the measurement period. Measurements were made in the presence of varying concentrations of unfractionated heparin or purified heparin fractions. The measurements were also made in the presence of HK (50–500 nm) or ZnCl2 (25 μm) with and without unfractionated heparin (0.1 μg/ml) or the 64 saccharide heparin fraction (100 nm). After equilibration, the inhibition constant, K i, was obtained by the least squares fit to Equation 8 of the ratio of the velocity of substrate cleavage measured at varying inhibitor concentrations, V I, to the velocity measured in the absence of inhibitor, V 0 (3Kitaguchi N.

We found that high molecular weight heparin (fractions containing 32–64 saccharide units) potentiated FXIa inhibition by PN-2 with a parabolic concentration dependence, whereas heparin fractions with a shorter length (fractions containing 6–22 saccharide units) were unable to affect the PN-2/FXIa interaction (Fig.1). Each of the active heparin subfractions possessed a broad optimal concentration range occurring between 0.01 and 1 μm. Moreover, the extent to which each active heparin species was able to potentiate the ability of PN-2 to inhibit FXIa was directly related to its strand length. Our previous studies (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the absence of heparin the kinetics of FXIa inhibition by PN-2 conforms to a one-step second-order reaction mechanism. Heparin does not appear to affect this mechanism. We analyzed pseudo first-order data obtained in the presence of an optimal concentration of fractionated heparin (100 nm, 64 saccharide units) using methods described previously (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and equations developed by Cha (18Cha S. Biochem.

Consistent with the reaction proceeding via a simple one-step mechanism, the pseudo first-order rate constant observed,k obs, was linearly dependent upon the inhibitor concentration (Fig. 2). We also found that the stoichiometry of the FXIa/PN-2 interaction is not changed by the presence of heparin (data not shown). To investigate the mechanism by which heparin increases the affinity of the interaction between PN-2 and FXIa, progress curve measurements were performed and the kinetic rate constants ascertained. The forward (k on) and reverse (k off) rate constants were obtained by fitting families of association (e.g. Fig. 3) or dissociation (e.g. Fig. 4) progress curves simultaneously to the appropriate form of Equation 2. Rate constants derived from the data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the increased potency with which PN-2 inhibits FXIa in the presence of an optimal concentration (100 nm) of long chain heparin molecules (64 saccharide units) is the result of an increased forward rate constant (k on increased from 3.2 to 43 × 106m−1 s−1 in the presence of heparin); the reverse rate constant,k off, was not significantly perturbed (k off was 0.0013 s−1 in the absence of and 0.0014 s−1 in the presence of heparin). The rate constants derived from analysis of dissociation progress curves were very similar to those obtained from the association progress curves and confirm that heparin, when sufficiently long, brings about an increase in the second-order association rate constant (k on increased from 2.0 to 27 × 106m−1 s−1) but has little discernible effect on the reverse rate constant (k off = 8.5 and 7.8 × 10−4 in the absence and presence of heparin, respectively) (see TableI for average values).Figure 4Dissociation progress curves of the inhibition of FXIa by PN-2 in the presence and absence of heparin.Equal volumes of FXIa and PN-2 were preincubated in the absence (panel A) or presence (panel B) of heparin fractions containing 64 saccharide units (100 nm) at 37 °C for 1 h.

Open table in a new tab We conducted experiments similar to those presented in Fig. 3 to ascertain the effect of increasing concentrations of each heparin subfraction (containing 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 32, 40, and 64 saccharide units) on the kinetics of FXIa inhibition by PN-2 (see Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5, heparin strands affect the forward rate constant in a manner that is both concentration- and chain length-dependent but do not significantly affect the reverse rate constant at any concentration. As would be expected from the results presented in Fig. 1, only the heparin fractions greater than 32 saccharide units in length bring about an increase in the forward rate constant. This effect is maximal for the longest heparin molecules (64 saccharide units) and has a distinctive parabolic concentration dependence. In the absence of heparin, HK and Zn2+ ions affect the inhibition of FXIa by PN-2 in opposite ways (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): HK partially protects FXIa from PN-2, whereas Zn2+ ions enhance the ability of PN-2 to inhibit it. We also found (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6) that only the effect on Zn2+ is seen when both HK and Zn2+are present: Zn2+ completely abrogates the effect of HK in the absence of heparin. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of HK and Zn2+ in both the absence and presence of heparin using the same kinetic approach used in their absence (TableI). Determination of association and dissociation rate constants (TableI) shows that Zn2+ ions, like heparin, enhance the inhibitory effect of PN-2 on FXIa (i.e. decrease theK i ) by increasing the association rate constant without affecting the dissociation rate constant. Similarly, the protective effect of HK is caused by its capacity to decrease the association rate constant without affecting the dissociation rate constant, and as predicted from previous studies (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Zn2+completely abrogates the protective effect of HK when both are present. Contrary to what was seen in the absence of heparin, in its presence, zinc ions have very little effect on the rate constants with which FXIa is inhibited by PN-2; the effect of heparin predominates (Table I). Nonetheless, even in the presence of heparin, HK induces a saturable but partial reversal of the effect of heparin onk on. This effect of HK is saturated at its plasma concentration (HK ∼640 nm in plasma) where the ability of heparin to potentiate PN-2 is approximately halved (see Fig.6 and Table I). Because HK also binds to heparin, a plausible mechanism by which HK could reverse the effect of heparin would be by displacing FXIa and PN-2 from their heparin binding sites. As shown in Fig.7, it is unlikely that this mechanism pertains because the optimal heparin concentration is not shifted to a higher value when HK is present. In any event, the protective effect of HK is canceled when Zn2+ is added to the reaction mixture even in the presence of heparin (Fig. 6 and Table I). The goal of this study was to determine the effect of heparin on the kinetics of FXIa inhibition by PN-2. Using computational methods to analyze progress curve data, we obtained reliable estimates of the individual rate constants governing the reaction between FXIa and PN-2 in the presence of heparin. We found that 1) the overall reaction mechanism can be well described by a simple second-order model; 2) the increased inhibitory potency of PN-2 in the presence of heparin results entirely from an increase in the forward rate constant and not from a decrease in the reverse rate constant; 3) the heparin effect is concentration-dependent, showing little effect at both low and high heparin concentrations and possessing an optimal concentration at which maximum potentiation is observed; and 4) only heparin preparations at least 32 saccharide units in length are able to affect the kinetics of FXIa inhibition by PN-2. We believe that heparin brings about its effect by providing a template sufficiently long (at least 32 saccharide units) to facilitate the rapid assembly of a high affinity protease-inhibitor complex. Our “template model,” similar to that of the antithrombin III/thrombin interaction in the presence of heparin (21Griffith M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Danielsson Å. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol.

Kurachi K. Söderstrom G. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggests that a heparin-bound FXIa molecule can rapidly and efficiently react with PN-2 molecules bound to the same heparin strand. This model provides a qualitative explanation for all of the observed effects of heparin on the interaction between FXIa and its most potent inhibitor, PN-2. 1) Our data show that high affinity interactions of FXIa and PN-2 with heparin occur more rapidly than the interaction between FXIa and PN-2, as evidenced by an increased second-order rate constant (k on) without any change in the first-order dissociation rate constant. 2) The parabolic concentration profile observed for heparin is also consistent with the template model. At low heparin concentrations, there are not enough heparin strands to saturate all protein binding sites, and the rate of FXIa inhibition is determined mainly by the interaction between the free proteins, whereas excessively high concentrations of heparin saturate FXIa and PN-2 molecules individually, thus decreasing the likelihood of their binding to the same heparin strand. Only at the optimal heparin concentration is there the highest probability of FXIa and PN-2 molecules being bound to the same heparin strand. 3) This model can also explain why only heparin strands longer than a discrete threshold are able to potentiate the ability of PN-2 to inhibit FXIa. Preparations less than 32 saccharide units in length are too short to provide a template to bind both FXIa and PN-2 molecules simultaneously (Figs. 1 and 5). We have observed, as predicted by the model, that as the length of the heparin strand increases, so does its ability to potentiate PN-2. The fact that both the concentration and size of heparin molecules are critical to the degree to which it can enhance the inhibitory capacity of PN-2 supports the view that one heparin strand interacts with both FXIa and PN-2 molecules. Both heparin and Zn2+ ions have been found to bind to PN-2 molecules, to enhance the ability of PN-2 to inhibit FXIa, and to regulate several functions of PN-2 (6Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Bush A.I. Multhaup G. Moir R.D. Williamson T.G. Small D.H. Rumble B. Pollwein P. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16109-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin and Zn2+ bind to different regions of PN-2, thereby permitting complementary effects (9Van Nostrand W.E. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, this was not observed in our present studies. Although Zn2+ alone induced an ∼3-fold increase in k on and heparin alone increasedk on ∼10-fold (Table I), there was little additional effect when both Zn2+ and heparin were present together. Our recent (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and present studies show that HK also regulates the inhibition of FXIa by PN-2. HK alone protects FXIa from inactivation by PN-2 (Fig. 6). In the presence of heparin, HK can also partially protect FXIa from PN-2 (Fig. 6), but this protective effect is superimposed upon the more significant potentiation of PN-2 by heparin. Both in the presence and absence of heparin, the effect of HK is saturable and likely results from the binding of HK to FXIa (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Zn2+ both potentiates PN-2 and reduces the ability of HK to protect FXIa from inhibition by PN-2. In the presence of both Zn2+ ions and heparin, the protective effect of HK is abrogated. Because there are high affinity heparin binding sites on all three proteins, PN-2 (6Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), HK (26Björk I. Olson S.T. Sheffer R.G. Shore J.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and HK (27Thompson R.E. Mandle R. Kaplan A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is possible that HK itself or a binary complex formed between FXIa and HK on a heparin template could compete with FXIa and PN-2 on a heparin strand. The results presented in Fig. 7 strongly argue against such a hypothesis: if HK protected FXIa from PN-2 in the presence of heparin by displacing FXIa or PN-2 from heparin binding sites, the optimal heparin concentration would have to be shifted rightward, and this was not the case (Fig. 7). Certain comparisons can be made between the PN-2/FXIa interaction and the antithrombin III/thrombin interaction (21Griffith M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7360-7365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Danielsson Å. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol.

Kurachi K. Söderstrom G. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The antithrombin III/thrombin reaction is accelerated dramatically by heparin, which provides a template for the antithrombin III·thrombin·heparin ternary complex to form. A change in antithrombin III conformation has an added effect on rate enhancement. In contrast to antithrombin III, PN-2 is an excellent FXIa inhibitor even in the absence of heparin (k on = 3.2 × 106m−1 s−1,k off = 1.3 × 10−3s−1). Our kinetic analysis of the heparin-enhanced PN-2/FXIa interaction showed only a 10-fold increase in rate, in contrast to the 2,000–4,000-fold increase in the rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III brought about by heparin. At least 18 saccharide units are required for heparin to promote rate enhancements for inhibition of thrombin, FXIa, or FIXa by antithrombin III (22Danielsson Å. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15467-15473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Holmer E. Kurachi K. Söderstrom G. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For the PN-2/FXIa interaction, a heparin strand containing at least 32 saccharide units was both necessary and sufficient to provide this template. This size template may be required to accommodate both the FXIa molecule (160 kDa) and the PN-2 molecule (120 kDa), whereas a smaller heparin template may be sufficient to accommodate the smaller antithrombin III molecule (58 kDa). Because PN-2 is secreted from activated platelets (5Bush A.I. Martins R.N. Rumble B. Moir R. Fuller S. Milward E. Currie J. Ames D. Weidemann A. Fischer P. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J.

Science. 1990; 248: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) at the site (i.e. platelet membranes) of assembly of the protease-cofactor-substrate complexes that lead to the generation of thrombin and hemostatic thrombi, it is ideally situated to regulate FXIa activity in the vicinity of platelet thrombi. Platelet activation and the secretion of PN-2 from platelets limit the lifetime of FXIa within the locus of activated platelets (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the presence of platelets, as in the purified system, HK protects FXIa from inactivation by PN-2, and Zn2+ ions potentiate FXIa inhibition by PN-2 (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, when both HK and Zn2+ are present together with platelets, it is the protective effect of HK which predominates and prolongs the lifetime of FXIa after platelet activation (8Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our present study, we found that exogenous heparin does not promote FXIa inhibition by PN-2 secreted from activated platelets (data not shown), probably as a consequence of the neutralization of heparin by platelet factor 4, which is also secreted, along with PN-2, from the α-granules of activated platelets (28Broekman M.J. Handin R.I. Cohen P. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 31: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Handin R.I. Cohen H.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 3980-3986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the major regulator of FXIa within the vicinity of activated platelet thrombi is PN-2, a potent, slow, tight binding, reversible inhibitor of FXIa which is much less effective in inhibiting FXIa bound to the platelet surface in the presence of HK (8Scandura J.M.

Nonetheless, PN-2 may be much more effective in inhibiting FXIa bound to heparin-like molecules such as heparan sulfate on the surface of nonthrombogenic cells such as endothelial cells. The relative contributions of other dominant FXIa inhibitory serine protease inhibitors found in plasma such as antithrombin III (32Beeler D. Marcum J.A. Schiffman S. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1986; 67: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α1-protease inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, and C1 esterase inhibitor (33Scott C.F. Schapira M. James H.L. Cohen A.B. Colman R.W. J. Clin.

This underlines the compactness of the yeast genome carrying virtually no intergenic regions between adjacent genes. The sequencing of the genome of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed the remarkable compactness of its genome. This results from the short size of regions between the open reading frames. Open reading frames of divergent promoters on average are only 618 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phospate; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); MOPS, morpholinopropanesulfonic acid. apart. Open reading frames of convergent terminators are separated by 326 bp on average. Arrangements with a terminator-promoter combination are spaced by 517 bp. Assuming nonoverlapping units this leads to a deduced and calculated average size of 309 bp for a promoter and 163 bp for a terminator (1Dujon B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For the regulated expression of the yeast genome, it is important that transcription of an upstream located gene does not interfere with the initiation of transcription of an immediately downstream located gene. The goal of this study was to test for a concrete terminator-promoter combination in yeast the size of the terminator and the promoter. In addition, we wanted to know whether both units are overlapping or whether there is an intergenic spacer region between the terminator and the promoter. In eukaryotes, the process of transcriptional termination is poorly understood. A number of different assays have been developed to measure termination in RNAP II genes, including poly(A) site competition, transcriptional interference (2Ashfield R. Enriquez-Harris P. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4197-41207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using these methods, termination sequences in mammalians have been identified between two closely spaced genes, human complement genes C2 and factor B. A binding site has been identified in the termination signal that binds the protein MAZ. It seems plausible that the proven ability of MAZ to bend DNA may relate to the RNAP II termination process (3Ashfield R. Patel A.J. Bossone S.A. Brown H. Campbell R.D. Marcu K.D. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5656-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, in vitro studies with the ADH2 and GAL7 genes lead to the hypothesis that the coupling of a RNAP II pause site to a functional polyadenylation signal results in transcription termination (4Hyman L.E. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In yeast, as in all eukaryotes, the 3′ ends of mRNAs are generated by a processing reaction that takes place in the cell nucleus (for review see Refs. 5Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys.

The mRNA precursors first lose a 3′-terminal noncoding fragment by endonucleolytic cleavage and then receive a poly(A) tail by polymerization of AMP. In higher eukaryotes two sequence elements define a poly(A) site. One is the almost invariant AAUAAA hexanucleotide, about 15 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) addition site. The second signal, located downstream of the poly(A) site, is either a run of Us or a poorly defined GU-rich sequence (6Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, however, the situation seems to be more complex. A highly conserved consensus sequence as found in higher eukaryotes is lacking. Sequences that have been identified to play an important role in mRNA 3′ end formation of one gene are often absent or nonfunctional in other genes. In general, the yeast mRNA 3′ end formation signals seem to be more degenerate, redundant, and disperse (8Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 247-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In yeast, the 3′ processing signal has been proposed to consist of three elements (9Guo Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5983-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The far upstream element directs the efficiency of the processing site, whereas the near upstream element is required for the positioning of the poly(A) site. The third element is the poly(A) site itself. Two classes of far upstream elements have been discussed (10Irniger S. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An efficient, unidirectional class contains the T5TA sequence motif proposed by Henikoff and Cohen (11Henikoff S. Cohen E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or derivatives thereof. A less efficient class functions in both orientations and is defined by the tripartite TAG … TA(T)GTA … TTT motif and its derivatives originally proposed by Zaret and Sherman (12Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). For positioning elements a TTAAGAAC motif, an A8 stretch or the canonical AATAAA element have been discussed (9Guo Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5983-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Little is known about the exact sequence requirement for the poly(A) site, but CAn or TAn sequences within the permissive distance appear to be preferred (13Heidmann S. Schindewolf S.C. Stumpf G. Domday H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 14: 4633-4642Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been performed in yeast where either individual promoters or individual mRNA 3′ end formation signals have been analyzed in various test systems. It is hardly known how different mRNA 3′ end formation signals affect different promoters in a single test system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate effects on a mRNA 3′ end formation signal and a promoter simultaneously. The ARO4 gene encodes the tyrosine-regulated 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase catalyzing the first step in the Shikimate pathway (14Künzler M. Paravicini G. Egli C.M. Irniger S. Braus G.H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Its poly(A) site contains the tripartite TAG … TATGTA … TTT motif proposed by Zaret and Sherman (12Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and belongs to the class of bidirectionally functional poly(A) sites (10Irniger S. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The HIS7 gene is located just downstream of the ARO4 gene on yeast chromosome II. It encodes the bifunctional glutamine amidotransferase:cyclase catalyzing the fifth and sixth step in thede novo histidine biosynthesis (15Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal transcription ofHIS7 requires the global factor Abf1p, and it is activated under conditions of amino acid starvation and adenine starvation conditions by Gcn4p and Bas1/2p, respectively (16Springer C. Künzler M. Balmelli T Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 29637-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The two genes are transcribed in the same direction with a normal spacing of 417 bp between the open reading frames. We show that the ARO4 terminator and the HIS7promoter are nonoverlapping, spatially separated units. The signals directing proper ARO4 3′ end formation are spread over 84 bp of the ARO4 3′-untranslated region. Various point mutations have no effect on the ability of ARO4 3′ end formation, suggesting the presence of multiple redundant signals. Deletion of the complete ARO4 3′ end processing signal reduces but does not completely shut down ARO4 expression. Replacement of the housekeeping ARO4 promoter by the efficiently transcribingACT1 promoter leads to reduced HIS7 expression due to transcriptional interference between these two genes. Because 280 bp are required for the HIS7 promoter, there are only about 40 bp between these two genes where the actual poly(A) addition sites are located. All yeast strains were derivatives of standard laboratory strains S. cerevisiaeX2180–1A (MAT a gal2 SUC2 mal CUP1) and X2180–1B (MAT α gal2 SUC2 mal CUP1). S. cerevisiae strain RH1631 (MAT a ura3-52) was used for transformation of all the constructed integrative test gene plasmids. All mutant ARO4/HIS7 alleles were integrated into the yeast strain RH1548 (MAT α aro3-2 gcn4-101 ura3-52 aro4 his7::URA3). Escherichia colistrain DH5α (17Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) was used for the propagation of plasmid DNA. Enzymatic manipulations and cloning of DNA were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultivated in YEPD complete medium (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) or MV minimal medium (20Miozzari G. Niederberger P. Hütter R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). Yeast transformation (21Ito H. Jukuda Y Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DNA isolation (22Braus G. Furter R. Prantl F. Niederberger P. Hütter R. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 142: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Southern analysis (23Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar) were previously described. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The various internal deletion mutations of theARO4/HIS7 intergenic region were constructed byBal31 exonuclease treatment of the linearized plasmid pME947. Plasmid pME947 was constructed based on the pGEM-7Zf (+) plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) by insertion of the 1.9-kilobaseSphI/BamHI fragment of theARO4/HIS7 locus with a created ClaI site at position −405 relative to the translational start codon of theHIS7 gene. The plasmid was linearized either withClaI or EcoRV and subsequently treated withBal31 exonuclease to obtain 5′ and 3′ deletions of the region, respectively. After cloning of aClaI/HindIII/EcoRV adapter, appropriate 5′ and 3′ deletion fragments were combined to obtain the internal deletions of the HIS7 promoter. This resulted in the plasmids pME951 to pME956 (3′ deletions), pME966 to pME971 (5′ deletions), and pME991 to pME995, pME997, pME999, and pME1001 (internal deletions). The respective integrative HIS7-lacZ fusion constructs based on the plasmids pME951 to pME956 (3′ deletions), pME966 to pME971 (5′ deletions), and pME991 to pME995, pME997, pME999, and pME1001 (internal deletions) were constructed on the basis of the pME947 derivatives, carrying the respective HIS7 promoter mutations, as described previously for pME696 (15Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AllHIS7-lacZ fusion constructs were integrated as single copy into the yeast genome at the ARO4/HIS7 locus of yeast strain RH1548 (MATα aro3-2 gcn4-101 ura3-52 aro4 his7::URA3). The procedure was described previously for the wild type HIS7-lacZ construct pME696 resulting in strain RH1616 (15Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pME800 was constructed on the basis of pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI) to obtain an integrative vector. Vector pSP64 was modified by cloning the 1.1-kilobase HindIII fragment of URA3 into theXhoI site, by inserting the 1.1-kilobase BamHI fragment of pME729 (24Irniger S. Sanfaçon H. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of the polylinker and by introducing a multiple cloning site (double-stranded OLCE1-OLCE2) into the ClaI site of the 1.1-kilobaseBamHI fragment. The different mutated alleles of theARO4/HIS7 intergenic region were amplified by using OLCS26 and OLCS27 as primers and the plasmids pME951 to pME956 (3′ deletions), pME966 to pME971 (5′ deletions) and pME991 to pME995, pME997, pME999 and pME1001 (internal deletions) as templates in a PCR reaction and cloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pME800 after restriction with KpnI and BglII. Site-directed mutations in the ARO4/HIS7intergenic region were introduced using the PCR technique (25Giebel L.B. Spitz R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides carrying specific mutations were OLCS36 to OLCS40. These oligonucleotides were used in a PCR reaction together with OLCS27 as second primers and pME947-DNA as template. The final PCR products were cut with KpnI and BglII and cloned into plasmid pME800. β-Galactosidase activities were determined by using permeabilized yeast cells and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside as described earlier (15Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, yeast cells were cultivated in MV minimal medium overnight, diluted to an optical density of approximately 0.5 at 546 nm and cultivated for another 6 h before assay. One unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as 1 nmol 4-methyl-umbelliferone h−1 ml−1 A 546−1. The given values are the means of at least four independent cultures. The standard errors of the means were less than 20%. 3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phospate synthase activities were determined as described in Takahashi and Chan (26Takahashi M. Chan W.W. Can. J. Biochem. 1971; 49: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Routinely, yeast was cultivated in MV minimal medium to an optical density of approximately 2 at A 546, harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were resuspended in 5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, disrupted in a French press (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Finally, the supernatant was applied to a PD 10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Uppsala, Sweden). 50 μl of crude cell extract was incubated for 10 min in 50 μl of erythrose-4-phosphate (8 mm), 40 μl of phosphoenolepyroat (10 mm), 50 μl of 0.4 m potassium phosphate buffer, and 60 μl of H2O. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of trichloroacetic acid (20%). 100 μl of the reaction solution was added to 100 μl of 20 mm NaIO4 in 0.25m H2SO4 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. This reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of NaAsO2 (2% in 0.5 m HCl). After the solution turned colorless, 800 μl thiobarbituric acid (0.3%) was added, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min. The absorption of the product was measured at 550 nm. Yeast cells were grown overnight in a 100-ml culture to an optical density at 546 nm of about 2. The cells were spun at 6000 × g for 5 min on one-fifth volume of ice and resuspended in 6 ml of PLE buffer (100 mm PIPES, 100 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold PLE buffer and 100 μl of ice-cold dichloromethane-saturated phenol equilibrated with PLE buffer. Diethylpyrocarbonate (1%, v/v) was added to inactivate RNases. Sterilized glass beads 0.45 mm in diameter were added, and the cells were disrupted by vigorous shaking for six 15 s periods with cooling on ice in between. Nucleic acids were extracted once with 1 volume of dichloromethane-saturated phenol equilibrated with PLE buffer, 0.05 g of bentonite, and 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and twice with 1 volume of dichloromethane-saturated phenol equilibrated with PLE buffer. Total RNA was precipitated by 1.5 volumes of ice-cold isopropanol, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. The precipitated RNA was stored at −20 °C. For Northern (RNA) hybridization experiments, approximately 10 μg of total RNA was precipitated, resuspended, and denatured in 30 μl of sample buffer (50%, v/v, deionized formamide, 6% v/v formaldehyde, 1 × loading buffer, 10% [v/v] 10 mm Tris-1 mm EDTA [TE] buffer) for 15 min at 65 °C and put on ice. The RNA was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel. The 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel (3%, v/v, formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA) was run for 3 h at 60 V in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was soaked twice in 25 mm Na phosphate buffer for 20 min each time, and the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) by electroblotting (2 A, 50 V) for 3 h in 25 mm Na phosphate buffer. After washing in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.15 m sodium citrate), drying on 3MM paper, and cross-linking under UV light (254 nm) for 5 min, the membrane with the bound RNA was hybridized at 42 °C with a labeled fragment for 24 h in 50 ml of a hybridization mixture (50%, v/v, formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5), 800 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 150 μg of calf thymus DNA per ml, 500 μg of torula yeast RNA/ml). The fragment, representing the 440-bpMluI/XhoI DNA element of the ACT1 5′ region, was randomly radiolabeled as described previously (27Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). The RNA was visualized by autoradiography. Band intensities from autoradiographs were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The spacing between the open reading frames of the ARO4 gene and the HIS7 gene consists of 417 bp. We wanted to know whether deletions within this region result in interference between ARO4 transcription and the initiation of transcription of the HIS7 promoter. Therefore a deletion analysis of the ARO4/HIS7 intergenic region was performed. ARO4 expression was determined by measuring DAHP synthase activity, which is the gene product.HIS7 transcription was monitored by determining β-galactosidase activities of strains carrying respective translational HIS7-LacZ fusions integrated in single copies at the ARO4/HIS7 locus (Fig.1). All strains had a gcn4-101genetic background to avoid interference with the general control of amino acid biosynthesis in yeast. Deletion of large parts of the ARO4 3′-untranslated region in the yeast strains RH1768 (Δ −405/−245 relative to theHIS7 AUG start codon) and RH1769 (Δ −405/−280) (Fig. 1) including the mapped poly(A) sites (14Künzler M. Paravicini G. Egli C.M. Irniger S. Braus G.H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the tripartite Zaret/Sherman sequence element (12Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 10Irniger S. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reduced ARO4activity to 37 and 41%, respectively, compared with wild type activity. Smaller deletions of 52 bp in RH1833, 28 bp in RH1834, 12 bp in RH1835, or 20 bp in RH1836 moderately reduced ARO4expression leading to between 55 and 75% of wild type activity. All these deletions were within the first 140 bp of the ARO43′-untranslated region and had no effect on HIS7 expression. The four strains RH1837, RH1839, RH1840, and RH1842 carry various deletions between 13 and 42 bp in length, all located more than 140 bp downstream of the end of the ARO4 open reading frame within the HIS7 promoter. None of these four deletions affectedARO4 expression, but all of them reduced HIS7expression. In summary, any deletion within the first 140 bp of the ARO43′-untranslated region had a significant effect on ARO4expression but did not affect HIS7 transcription. By contrast, all deletions within the next 280 bp affected HIS7transcription, but none of them had any effect on ARO4expression. These results strongly suggest that the ARO4termination sequences are located within the first 140 bp of the untranslated region between the ARO4 and the HIS7genes and do not overlap with the HIS7 promoter. Therefore, the ARO4 termination sequences and the HIS7promoter sequences are located within spatially clearly separated units. To define whether there is any intergenic spacer region between ARO4 and HIS7, the sequences required forARO4 mRNA 3′ end formation were analyzed more precisely. We tested ARO4 3′ end modifications in an artificial test system that we had established earlier (28Egli C.M. Springer C. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ARO4polyadenylation element represents the class of yeast 3′ processing sites which function in both orientations in an in vivo test system (10Irniger S. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of the ARO4 gene contains the tripartite sequence motif TAG … TATGTA … TTT, which was proposed to represent a processing consensus element in yeast (Fig. 2) (12Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Modifications of theARO4 3′-untranslated region included 3′ and 5′ end, internal deletions, and specific point mutations inserted into the complete element (Fig. 3). The modifiedARO4 3′ end elements were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the test gene consisting of the ACT1 promoter and the ADH1 terminator (Fig. 2) (28Egli C.M. Springer C. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The test gene was integrated into the chromosome at the URA3 locus, thereby avoiding multicopy effects. The effects of all modifications were analyzed at the transcript level by performing Northern blot analysis. Functional 3′ processing elements resulted in short truncated transcripts, whereas nonfunctional elements resulted in long readthrough transcripts as schematically drawn in Fig. 2.Figure 3Schematic representation of the mutations constructed in the ARO4/HIS7 intergenic region. The numbers indicated above the constructs represent the boundaries of the deletions relative to the A nucleotide of the HIS7 ATG start codon. The nucleotide exchange in the point mutations are indicated with lowercase boldface letters, whereas a caretindicates deletion of a single nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 3′ deletion up to position −321 relative to the A residue of the translational start codon ATG of the HIS7 gene (deletion Δ −321/−104 in Fig. 4) resulted in a 3′ processing efficiency (86% truncated transcript) similar to that of the complete wild type ARO4/HIS7 intergenic region (83–86% truncated transcripts). Further deletion to position −337 completely abolished 3′ end formation (deletion Δ −337/−104 in Fig. 4). Therefore the downstream boundary for a completely functionalARO4 3′ processing element in the test system was located in the −337 to −321 region. The mapped 3′ ends (positions −311, −306, and −283) (14Künzler M. Paravicini G. Egli C.M. Irniger S. Braus G.H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are located downstream of this boundary suggesting that they are not important for the efficiency of mRNA 3′ end formation in the test gene. 5′ deletion of the part containing the ARO4 open reading frame including 12 bp of the 3′-untranslated region had no effect on 3′ end processing (deletion Δ −440/−405 in Fig. 4). In this construct the TAG part of the tripartite TAG … TATGTA … TTT Zaret/Sherman sequence element was deleted. Any further 5′ deletion (deletions Δ −405/−340 to Δ −405/−211 in Fig. 4) resulted in the complete loss of ARO4 3′ end formation. We therefore conclude that no parts of the ARO4 open reading frame are involved in 3′ end formation and the 5′ boundary of the 3′ processing element must be located somewhere downstream of position −405. This finding was confirmed by analyzing internal deletion constructs of this region. In the deletions Δ −392/−340 and Δ −337/−309 3′ processing activity was reduced to below 10% (Fig. 4), whereas in the deletion Δ −321/−309 the ability to process 3′ ends was restored to almost wild type level (77% truncated transcript), substantiating the 3′ boundary between positions −337 and −321. None of the internal deletions downstream of position −300 affected 3′ end formation. Therefore the ARO4 3′ end processing element could be delimited to the 84 bp between positions −405 and −321. Any internal deletion within this part leads to a complete loss of proper 3′ end generation. Interestingly, neither the TAG part of the tripartite Zaret/Sherman sequence element nor the mapped poly(A) sites are within the boundaries of this element. In a set of point mutations, the involvement of the tripartite TAG … TATGTA … TTT Zaret/Sherman sequence inARO4 3′ end formation was further analyzed. The first TAG part of the element is identical with the ARO4 stop codon. In mutations mut(TAa) and mut(Tga) (Fig. 4) this element was replaced by one of the alternative stop codons TAA or TGA, respectively. In the mutations mut(agcGT) and mut(ΔTATGT) the middle part was either changed to the sequence AGCGT or deleted, whereas in mutation mut(gTa) the third part was exchanged for the sequence GTA. In mutation mut(agcGT-gTa) both the middle and the third element were mutated. None of these point mutations or small deletions had any effect onARO4 3′ end formation in the in vivo test system. We therefore conclude that several redundant 3′ processing signals must be spread over a maximum of 84 bp between position −405 (which is 12 bp downstream of the ARO4 stop codon) and position −321 relative to the HIS7 AUG start codon. Taking into account that the HIS7 promoter reaches approximately to position −280 relative to the HIS7 start codon (Fig. 1), the intergenic region between the ARO4 and the HIS7genes consists of 40 bp at most. This region carries all mRNA 3′ ends that were mapped in vitro (positions −311, −306, and −283). Thus, virtually no intergenic region exists betweenARO4 and HIS7 underlining the compactness of the yeast genome. In the deletion (Δ −405/−280) all the sequences required forARO4 3′ end formation in the artificial test system were removed. Strain RH1769 carrying this deletion in the untranslated region between the ARO4 and the HIS7 genes showed a decreased ARO4 expression level. ARO4expression in this strain was about 40% when compared with wild type expression levels (Fig. 1). In contrast, deletion of theARO4 3′ end processing signals did not affect the expression of the HIS7 gene located downstream (Fig. 1). We therefore concluded that deletion of the 3′ processing signals reducesARO4 expression to about 40% compared with its wild type expression level, indicating the existence of cryptic 3′ end forming signals. TheARO4 terminator and the HIS7 promoter are separate elements, and deletion of the whole ARO4 terminator does not influence HIS7 expression (Fig. 1). This seemed surprising to us, because theoretically we expected that the role of a terminator is not only to correctly process mRNA 3′ ends but also to avoid transcriptional interference between two adjacent genes. Thus, we further investigated the role of the ARO4 terminator for its ability to prevent interference between the transcription of theARO4 and the HIS7 genes. Replacement of the ARO4 promoter by the ACT1promoter increased its expression 4-fold and caused a reduction ofHIS7 expression to 50% of the wild type expression (Fig.5). This effect was even more pronounced using the yeast strain RH1815 carrying a 52-bp deletion within theARO4 3′ end processing signal reducing ARO4expression to 70%. In this strain HIS7 activity was slightly reduced to 95% compared with wild type activity. Here, replacement of the ARO4 promoter by the strongACT1 promoter leading to the yeast strain RH2172 reducedHIS7 activity to 30% of wild type activity. These results indicated that expression of the ARO4 gene under the control of the strong ACT1 promoter at its original chromosomal locus interfered with the initiation of transcription at the downstream located HIS7 promoter and therefore caused a reduction ofHIS7 expression. This effect is even more pronounced when simultaneously the ARO4 terminator is lacking. In the ACT1-ARO4 3′ end formation test gene where theACT1 promoter is fused to the ARO4/HIS7intergenic region with only 90 bp of the open reading frame in between, no transcript initiated at the HIS7 promoter could be detected (Fig. 6). Therefore, we tested whether this is due to the strong initiation at the ACT1promoter and the incomplete 3′ end formation at the ARO4polyadenylation site in the ACT1-ARO4 hybrid gene. Two constructs served as controls. In the first construct theACT1 promoter was destroyed by Bal31 digestion. With no transcript initiated at the strong ACT1 promoter, no interference was expected between the ACT1-ARO4 hybrid transcript and the initiation at the HIS7 promoter. Therefore a short transcript initiated at the HIS7 promoter was expected. In the second construct the strong polyadenylation signal of the GCN4 gene (28Egli C.M. Springer C. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was cloned between the ACT1promoter and the ARO4/HIS7 intergenic region. In this construct the discrepancy between the strong ACT1 promoter and the weak ARO4 terminator should be abolished, and therefore a transcript initiated at the HIS7 promoter was expected. In a Northern blot experiment with RNA isolated from the yeast strains RH2169 (with inserted GCN4 terminator) and RH2171 (with destroyed ACT1 promoter), a short transcript initiated at the HIS7 promoter could be detected by hybridization with a radiolabeled, 215-bp ADH1 probe. No such transcript was detected using RNA isolated from the yeast strain RH2160 with an intactACT1 promoter and no inserted GCN4 terminator (Fig. 6). Hybridization of RNA isolated from the yeast strain RH2169 (with inserted GCN4 terminator) with the radiolabeled 524 bpACT1 probe led to a great amount of ACT1-GCN4hybrid transcript. The strong ACT1 promoter directed high levels of initiation of transcription and the downstream inserted strong GCN4 terminator resulted in complete termination of transcription. In the strain RH2171 the ACT1 promoter was completely destroyed, because no transcript could be visualized by hybridization of RNA from this strain with the ACT1 probe. In the strain RH2160 (wild type ARO4/HIS7 intergenic region) both truncated and readthrough transcripts were present, indicating incomplete processing of the ACT1-ARO4 hybrid mRNA. These results demonstrated that expression of the ACT1-ARO4hybrid mRNA abolished initiation of transcription at theHIS7 promoter located downstream due to transcriptional interference between these two genes. In summary, deletion of the ARO4 terminator has no effect onHIS7 transcription. Overexpression of the ARO4gene by the ACT1 promoter reduces HIS7 expression by a factor of two. Simultaneous overexpression of ARO4 and deletion of its terminator reduces HIS7 expression to 30% of wild type level. Finally, as shown in Fig. 6 B(first lane), a shortened distance between theACT1 promoter and the ARO4 terminator with just a little part of the ARO4 open reading frame in theACT1-ARO4 hybrid gene completely shuts down HIS7expression. Therefore strain RH2160, where the ACT1 promoter is fused to the ARO4-HIS7 intergenic region with only 90 bp of the ARO4 open reading frame in between and integrated into the yeast genome, raises no HIS7 transcript. This study had three major results. (a) We wanted to know whether the authentic 3′ end of a gene is indispensable for its expression at its natural chromosomal locus. We found that we can delete the ARO4 3′ end signal. Therefore, theARO4 3′ end signal is not essential but required for efficient ARO4 gene expression. (b) We wanted to know whether the ARO4 3′ end formation signals can generally block transcriptional interference and guarantee efficientHIS7 expression. We found that 4-fold increasedARO4 expression reduces HIS7 expression by a factor of two. (c) We wanted to know whether in yeast a terminator and an adjacent promoter are overlapping or whether there is intergenic space between two adjacent genes. Our results suggest two independent nonoverlapping units and no intergenic region betweenARO4 and HIS7. Part of our analysis concerns the question of how essential the 3′ end of a gene is for its expression in the natural chromosomal environment. The ARO4 3′ processing signal includes several redundant elements that are located within 84 bp starting about 12 bp downstream of the ARO4 stop codon. Any deletion within this region reduced ARO4 expression to between 35 and 75% when compared with the wild type activity. Interestingly, deletion of the completeARO4 3′ end signal reduces ARO4 expression to 41% when compared with wild type but does not completely shut down its expression. Thus, the complete 3′ end of ARO4 is only important for the efficiency of gene expression but is not essential for gene expression per se. The cell seems to be able to cope with the lack of the ARO4 3′ end by using cryptic signals within theHIS7 promoter for ARO4 mRNA 3′ end formation. Furthermore, the effect of enhanced ARO4 transcription on the initiation of the downstream located HIS7 gene was investigated. Small deletions within the 3′ processing and termination region of the ARO4 gene reduced its expression but had no effect on HIS7 transcription. Even a 52-bp deletion only hardly reduced HIS7 expression compared with the wild type expression level. By contrast, a shortened ACT1-ARO4 hybrid gene, where the ACT1 promoter was directly linked to the 3′-untranslated region of the ARO4 gene, with only 90 bp of the open reading frame in between caused total HIS7 promoter occlusion with no detectable transcript initiated at the downstream located HIS7 promoter. Expression of the completeARO4 gene under the control of the ACT1promoter resulted in 4-fold increased ARO4 expression, and simultaneous HIS7 expression was reduced by a factor of two. This effect was even more pronounced when parts of the ARO4poly(A) signal were deleted. In conclusion the 3′ end of a gene is adjusted to its own promoter. Deletion of a poly(A) signal affects the expression of a downstream located gene only if the activity of the upstream promoter is simultaneously increased. The adjustment of the 3′ end formation signal for a mRNA is necessary to prevent transcriptional interference with the adjacent gene. In some further studies, the mechanism should be investigated in more detail, by which transcriptional interference between neighboring genes is prevented. One remarkable feature of the yeast genome is its compact architecture, resulting from short intergenic regions. Some statistical calculations with the yeast genome revealed an average of 309 bp for a promoter (1Dujon B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This theoretical value fits well with the observed 280 bp for theHIS7 promoter. The calculated size of an average yeast terminator consists of 163 bp. In this study we mapped theARO4 poly(A) signals within a region of 84 bp starting 12 bp downstream of the ARO4 stop codon. Adding these 12 bp to the poly(A) signal and taking into account that the actual poly(A) addition sites were mapped within 40 bp downstream of the poly(A) signal, theARO4 terminator consists of 136 bp. Therefore, the theoretically calculated sizes for yeast promoters and terminators fit well with the concrete situation between the open reading frames of theARO4 and HIS7 genes. Within the 40 bp between theARO4 3′ end processing signals and the HIS7promoter, the actual ARO4 3′ ends are located. In conclusion, there is virtually no intergenic region between theARO4 and HIS7 genes underlining the compact architecture of the yeast genome. We are grateful to Hans-Ulrich Mösch, Sven Krappmann, and Stefan Irniger for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1555412294,"The dynamic and functional properties of mutant deoxyhemoglobins in which either the β-globin Val67(E11) or the α-globin Val62(E11) is replaced by threonine have been investigated through the thermal evolution of the Soret absorption band in the temperature range 300 to 20 K and through the kinetics of CO rebinding after flash photolysis at room temperature. The conformational properties of the modified α chain and β chain distal heme pockets were also studied through x-ray crystallography and molecular modeling. The data obtained with the various techniques consistently indicate that the polar isosteric mutation in the distal side of the α chain heme pocket has a larger effect on the investigated properties than the analogous mutation on the β chain. We attribute the observed differences to the presence of a water molecule in the distal heme pocket of the modified α chains, interacting with the hydroxyl of the threonine side chain. This is indicated by molecular modeling which showed that the water molecule present in the α chain distal heme pocket can bridge by H bonding between Thr62(E11) and His58(E7) without introducing any unfavorable steric interactions. Consistent with the dynamic and functional data, the presence of a water molecule in the distal heme pocket of the modified β chains is not observed by x-ray crystallography.

Consistent with the dynamic and functional data, the presence of a water molecule in the distal heme pocket of the modified β chains is not observed by x-ray crystallography. The mechanism of hemoglobin cooperativity requires the concerted action of the constituent α and β subunits. The presence of conformational differences between the α and β heme pockets is well recognized (1Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 159-174Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 3Fronticelli C. Pechik I. Brinigar W.S. Kowalczyk J. Gilliland G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23965-23969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is reflected in different functional characteristics of the α and β subunits, as higher oxygen affinity of the α subunits with respect to β subunits (4Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and increased affinity of the α heme pocket for the heme (5Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An approach to a better understanding of the factors regulating the functional properties of the heme pockets is to investigate the effect of the same mutation on the dynamics and ligand accessibility of the α and β pockets of mutant hemoglobins carrying the same amino acid substitution and to relate these effects with the conformational properties of the heme pockets. The latter can be characterized by techniques such as crystallographic analysis or molecular modeling. This approach is now feasible owing to the recent development of recombinant techniques for the expression and production of mutant hemoglobins (6Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J.

Access of ligand to the heme group is hindered by the presence of the polypeptide chain which buries the heme in a hydrophobic crevice in the protein interior. Iron-ligand combination must therefore be accompanied by conformational fluctuations in the protein which create a pathway for ligand entry. It has been proposed that such a pathway involves concerted movements of the side chains of His(E7) and Val(E11) (9Case D.A. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 353-358Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Kottalam J. Case D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7690-7697Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several mutant hemoglobins carrying the same mutation in the α and β heme pocket have been obtained, and the association and dissociation rate constants for O2 and CO binding to R state derivatives have been measured (11Mathews A.J. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Tame J. Renaud J.-P. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of His(E7) with Gly and Gln affected the kinetic parameters of O2 and CO binding to the α heme but did not affect the kinetic parameters for the binding of these ligands to the β heme. Similarly, replacement of Val(E11) with Ala and Leu affected the kinetic parameters of O2 and CO binding to the α heme but not to the β heme; conversely, replacement of Val(E11) with Ile produced smaller changes in the rate of ligands binding to α than to β heme pocket mutants. These data point to a different role of His(E7) and Val(E11) in the α and β pockets of R state hemoglobin. The α and β heme pockets are hydrophobic, as the only two polar residues present are the proximal and distal histidines. In our laboratory we have extensively investigated the effect of increased polarity of the β heme pocket on a mutant hemoglobin, βV(E11)T, in which Val67(E11) was replaced by the isosteric, polar threonine (12Fronticelli C. Brinigar W.S. Olson J.S. Bucci E. Gryczynski Z. O'Donnell J.K. Kowalczyk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography indicated that the quaternary assembly of the molecule and the stereochemistry of the β heme pocket is not modified by the substitution. The introduction of a polar threonine at position E11 introduces the possibility of an H bond between the hydrogen atom of the threonine OH and the carbonyl backbone of His(E7) (13Pechik I. Ji X. Fidelis K. Karavitis M. Moult J. Brinigar W.S. Fronticelli C. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements on photolyzed samples indicated that the heme pocket accessibility to CO was not modified by the mutation (12Fronticelli C. Brinigar W.S. Olson J.S. Bucci E. Gryczynski Z. O'Donnell J.K. Kowalczyk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The dynamics of the carbon monoxy derivative of βV(E11)T was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy (14Militello V. Cupane A. Leone M. Brinigar W.S. Lu A.L. Fronticelli C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the conformation of bound CO was studied by infrared spectroscopy (13Pechik I. Ji X. Fidelis K. Karavitis M. Moult J. Brinigar W.S. Fronticelli C. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The data suggested the presence of a dipolar interaction between the bound CO molecule and the hydroxyl of Thr; thus, modification of the heme pocket polarity alters the dynamics and ligand stereochemistry of the β pocket of ligand-bound hemoglobin. The recent availability of the α-globin expression system allows the introduction of the above same mutation in the heme pocket of the α subunits (8Sanna M.T. Razynska A. Karavitis M. Koley A.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3478-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and therefore provides the possibility of investigating the factors regulating the dynamics and functionality of the α pocket. In this paper we present comparative studies of the heme pocket deoxy derivatives of the βV(E11)T 1The abbreviations used are: βV(E11)T, human hemoglobin with a Thr at position E11 in the recombinant β chains; αV(E11)T, human hemoglobin with a Thr at position E11 in the recombinant α chains; HbA, native human hemoglobin; αrHbA, human hemoglobin with recombinant α chains; βrHbA, human hemoglobin with recombinant β chains; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: βV(E11)T, human hemoglobin with a Thr at position E11 in the recombinant β chains; αV(E11)T, human hemoglobin with a Thr at position E11 in the recombinant α chains; HbA, native human hemoglobin; αrHbA, human hemoglobin with recombinant α chains; βrHbA, human hemoglobin with recombinant β chains; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. and αV(E11)T mutants using low temperature optical absorption spectroscopy, kinetics of CO rebinding, and molecular modeling. In a forthcoming paper the same parameters will be compared for the carbon monoxy derivatives. The results indicate that in deoxyhemoglobin the dynamics and heme accessibility of the heme pocket in the α chains are modified, as a result of the mutation, more than in the β heme pocket. Molecular modeling suggests that this is due to the presence in the α heme pocket of a water molecule coordinated between His58(E7) and Thr62(E11), in a manner similar to that reported for the same mutation in pig myoglobin (15Smerdon S.J. Dodson G.G. Wilkinson A.J. Gibson Q.H. Blackmore R.S. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6252-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analogous modifications were less evident in βV(E11)T, consistent with crystallographic analysis showing the absence of a water molecule in the deoxyheme pocket of this mutant hemoglobin (13Pechik I. Ji X. Fidelis K. Karavitis M. Moult J. Brinigar W.S. Fronticelli C. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Growth, expression, and purification of the recombinant α- and β-globins, reconstitution, and assembly into tetrameric hemoglobin followed the protocols previously described (7Fronticelli C. O'Donnell J.K. Brinigar W.S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,8Sanna M.T. Razynska A. Karavitis M. Koley A.P. Friedman F.K. Russu I.M. Brinigar W.S. Fronticelli C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3478-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the tetrameric hemoglobins obtained with this type of expression system one type of subunit is native and the other is recombinant (αrHbA and βrHbA). This allows the unambiguous assignment of observed differences to the recombinant subunit. The expression and purification of the βV(E11)T mutant has been previously described (12Fronticelli C. Brinigar W.S. Olson J.S. Bucci E. Gryczynski Z. O'Donnell J.K. Kowalczyk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the α-globin the Thr62(E11) was introduced using the Promega pAlter Mutagenesys System. The mutagenic oligonucleotide employed changed the Val codon GTC to the Thr codon ACC. The Ala63(E12) codon (GCC) was also changed to GCT which created a MspA1I site to facilitate screening for the mutation. Stocks of recombinant hemoglobins were stored in the CO form at −80 °C or in liquid nitrogen. The proteins were thawed immediately before use and diluted with the appropriate buffer. Portions of the stock solutions, thawed immediately before use and suitably diluted, were converted to the oxy form by photolysis under a flux of oxygen. Oxygen was then removed by flushing with nitrogen, and the sample was reduced by adding sodium dithionite. All steps were performed in the cold and, when dithionite was present, under anaerobic conditions. The final samples for spectrophotometric measurements were 65% (v/v) glycerol/water solutions containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7 in water, at room temperature) and ∼3·10−4m sodium dithionite; the final protein concentration was ∼10−5m in heme. Optical spectra in the spectral region 500 to 370 nm and in the temperature range 300 to 20 K were recorded in digital form at 0.4-nm intervals using a Cary 2300 spectrophotometer set at 0.4-nm bandwidth, 1-s time constant, and 40 nm/min scan speed; under these conditions the spectral resolution is about 20 cm−1 at 450 nm. The base line (cuvette + solvent) was measured at room temperature and subtracted from each spectrum (in this spectral range, the base line does not depend on temperature, and absorption due to dithionite is negligible); moreover, we stress that our samples remained homogeneous and transparent at all temperatures. All other experimental details were as described previously (16Cordone L. Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 24: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Di Pace A. Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The spectral deconvolution used in this paper yields information on the different contributions to the line width and on the various parameters that characterize the vibrational coupling. An analytical expression for the Soret band profile at various temperatures is obtained by considering a single electronic transition coupled to Franck-Condon active vibrational modes within the adiabatic and harmonic approximation. Details on the theoretical approach used have been given in previous publications (17Di Pace A. Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,18Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Eur. Biophys. J. 1995; 23: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), where it has been shown that the absorbance at frequency ν can be written as a progression of Voigtians (i.e. Gaussian convolutions of Lorentzians) (Equation 1), A(ν)=Mν∑(mi)∞∏i=1NSimie−Simi!×Γν−ν0−∑i=1Nhmiνi2+Γ2⊗1ς(T),Equation 1 where M is a constant proportional to the square of the electric dipole moment, and Γ is a damping factor related to the finite lifetime of the excited state (homogeneous broadening); the product extends to all high frequency vibrational modes (i.e. with hν i ≫k B T) coupled to the electronic transition, the summations to their occupation numbers, while ν i and S i are, respectively, the frequency and the linear coupling constant for the ith high frequency mode; ν0 is the frequency of the fundamental. In Equation1 quadratic coupling of the high frequency vibrational modes is neglected. The symbol ⊗ indicates the convolution operator. Coupling of the electronic transition with low frequency modes (i.e.with modes having frequency smaller than the observed bandwidth) is treated within the “short times approximation” (19Chan C.K. Page J.B. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 5234-5250Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar); this brings about the convolution with a gaussian line shape and contributes the temperature-dependent terms ς2(T) and ν0(T) to the line width and peak position of the band, respectively. Further contributions to the spectral line width are inhomogeneous broadening arising from different conformational substates and heme environments (20Frauenfelder H. Parak F. Young R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 451-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). For the deoxy derivatives, it has been suggested (18Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Eur. Biophys.

The coordinate Q is assumed to have a statistical distribution of width δ around the mean coordinate position Q0 (see Equation 3). P(Q)∝exp−[(Q−Q0)2/2δ2]Equation 3 Substitution of Equation 3 into Equation 2 yields a non-gaussian distribution of transition frequencies.

The first step of the data analysis is based on fittings of the experimental Soret absorption spectra with Equation 4. The analysis is performed on a Microway I860 add-on board for IBM-PC, using a Marquardt-type nonlinear least squares algorithm (24Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). The fitting parameters are M, Γ, S i, ς, ν o, Q0 b, and δ b; the values relative to high frequency modes are taken from resonance Raman spectra of human deoxyhemoglobin reported in the literature (25Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Schomacker K.T. Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5688-5698Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As in previous work (14Militello V. Cupane A. Leone M. Brinigar W.S. Lu A.L. Fronticelli C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we assume that the mutations investigated do not alter the frequency of these modes; this assumption is supported by the excellent quality of the fittings obtained (see Fig. 2 and Table I). The most coupled modes are those centered at 370, 674, and 1357 cm−1, whereas other less coupled modes do not contribute significantly to the line shapes and are therefore neglected. It is worth mentioning that in the resonance Raman spectra of hemoglobin the frequencies 674 cm−1 and 1357 cm−1 correspond to very sharp lines and are thought to arise from in-plane vibrational modes of the heme group (the well known ν7 and ν4respectively; Ref. 26Spiro T.G. Lever A.B.P. Gray H.B. Iron Porphyrins. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1983: 89-159Google Scholar). On the contrary, 370 cm−1 is the “average effective” frequency accounting for a spectral region characterized by several quasi-degenerate peaks; both in-plane and out-of-plane modes contribute to these spectral regions.S i parameters are fixed at the low temperature values determined from the clearly resolved vibronic structure of the band; in this way we avoid fitting ambiguities arising from broadening of the band and consequent lack of a clearly resolved vibronic structure at high temperature.Table ILow temperature (T = 20 K) linear coupling constants of the high frequency modes and Γ values for the deoxy derivatives of the mutant hemoglobins investigatedS 370S 674S L357ΓQs bδ bcm −1HbA1-aData relative to HbA and to SwMb have been taken from Ref. 23.0.11 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.01175 ± 90.18 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.03βV(E11)T0.04 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.02184 ± 100.22 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.03βrHbA0.09 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.030.06 ± 0.02190 ± 100.19 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.03αV(E11)T0.05 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.02190 ± 100.19 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.03αrHbA0.05 ± 0.020.27 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.01186 ± 100.19 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.03SwMb1-aData relative to HbA and to SwMb have been taken from Ref. 23.0.32 ± 0.020.24 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.01180 ± 100.17 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.021-a Data relative to HbA and to SwMb have been taken from Ref. 23Cupane A.

J. 1995; 23: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); within this model (Equation 5) one has ς2=NS<ν>2coth(h〈ν〉/2kT),Equation 5 where <ν> and S are the effective frequency and linear coupling constants of the low frequency bath, and Nis the number of soft modes. The ς2 increase with temperature predicted by Equation 5 simply reflects the well known amplitude increase of harmonic nuclear motions as the temperature is increased. As mentioned above, the effect of inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account by the parameter δ b. The ς2 thermal behavior therefore gives information on dynamic properties (linear coupling with the low frequency bath of the system) that involve motions not only of the chromophore but also of the heme pocket and of larger parts of the protein. Complementary information on the stereodynamic properties of the heme pocket is also obtained from the parameter ν0(i.e. the peak frequency of the band); in fact, its temperature dependence reflects not only the quadratic coupling of the electronic transition with the bath of soft modes but also the local electric field experienced by the chromophore within its surroundings. Flash photolysis was carried out in solutions containing 5 μm heme and 50 μm CO at 23 °C in 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.1m KCl. Approximately 0.5 mg of sodium dithionite was added to reduce any ferric heme to the ferrous state. The instrumentation and experimental details for laser flash photolysis were essentially as described previously (27Markowitz A. Robinson R.C. Omata Y. Friedman F.K. Anal. Instrum. 1992; 20: 213-221Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A pulse (0.6 μs) from a dye laser disrupted the photolabile heme Fe–CO bond, and the recombination of CO with the hemeprotein was then monitored by following the absorbance change at 436 nm. Data were transmitted to a microcomputer for processing and analysis. Standard multiexponential analysis of the kinetic data was performed according to Equation 6. ΔA(t)=∑i=1naiexp(−kit)Equation 6 ΔA(t) is the total absorbance change observed at time t, a i is the absorbance change for component i at t = 0,k i is the observed pseudo-first order rate constant for component i, and n is the number of independent components. Least squares analysis was performed with RS/1 software (BBN software products, Cambridge, MA) on a Dell 450/ME microcomputer. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was evaluated using the Student's t test, assuming equal variances for all the experimental points. Molecular modeling was carried out with the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.-V. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Comparison of the heme pockets of deoxymyoglobin with a Thr at position E11 (molecule B of the structure 1YCB) and of deoxyhemoglobin (molecule α2 of the structure 2HHD) was done using the program ALIGN (29Satow Y. Cohen G. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows the spectra of deoxy-βV(E11)T at various temperatures between 300 and 20 K. As can be seen, the band is markedly asymmetric at all temperatures; this asymmetry is accounted for by the asymmetric distribution of transition frequencies in Equation 4. The bandwidth of the Soret band decreases as the temperature is lowered, and the asymmetry is almost constant; moreover, a slight blue shift of the band position upon lowering the temperature is also present. Fig.2 shows the deconvolution of the 70 K spectrum of αV(E11)T in terms of Equation 4, together with the residuals on an expanded scale. A fitting of analogous quality is obtained also for βV(E11)T; for both proteins the fitting quality improves at higher temperatures. The values of the linear coupling constants for the high frequency modes (S i ) and of the Lorentzian width (Γ) are listed in TableI, in comparison with the values obtained for the recombinant wild type proteins αrHbA and βrHbA, for native human hemoglobin (HbA), and for sperm whale myoglobin (SwMb). As can be seen, no relevant effect on these parameters is observed; this indicates that the mutations, both in the α and in the β chain, do not affect the local electronic and vibrational properties of the chromophore. In particular, parameters Q0 band δ b are unaffected, thus suggesting that the iron-heme-proximal histidine geometry is also unaffected. The temperature dependence of parameter ν0 for the mutants αV(E11)T and βV(E11)T is reported in the left panels of Fig. 3, together with the analogous quantities relative to the recombinant wild type proteins. Values relative to HbA and to SwMb are reported in the right panels of the same figure, for the sake of comparison. From Fig. 3it can be seen that both the HbA recombinant proteins exhibit the same ν0 behavior as HbA; for the mutant βV(E11)T there is a very small effect while, for αV(E11)T, the ν0 behavior is markedly different and rather similar to that exhibited by SwMb. The difference is clearly evident at low temperatures, where a blue shift of ν0 values upon lowering the temperature is observed for HbA, αrHbA, βrHbA, and βV(E11)T, while SwMb is characterized by a red shift; ν0 values relative to αV(E11)T have an intermediate behavior and remain approximately constant. The temperature dependence of parameter ς2 for the investigated proteins is reported in Fig.4. As can be seen, both mutants exhibit a sharper ς2 temperature dependence with respect to the wild types and to HbA; moreover, the α chain mutant has lower ς2 values at low temperatures. The continuous lines represent the fittings of the data in the temperature range 20–120 K in terms of Equation 5; values of the parametersNS and <ν> obtained from the fittings are reported in Table II. The two mutants are characterized by lower values of the average frequency of the soft modes, and the α chain mutant exhibits also a lower value of parameter NS. At temperatures higher than 120 K an increase of ς2 values well above the predictions of Equation 5 is observed. Since Equation 5 has been derived within the harmonic approximation, we attribute these deviations to the onset of large amplitude non-harmonic nuclear motions (17Di Pace A. Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Cupane A. Leone M. Vitrano E. Cordone L. Eur. Biophys. J. 1995; 23: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An increase of average atomic fluctuations well above the prediction of the harmonic behavior and occurring at high temperatures has been observed, for hemeproteins, with a variety of experimental techniques (30Doster W. Cusack S. Petry W. Nature. 1989; 337: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 31Parak F. Knapp E.W. Kucheida W. J. Mol.

Knapp E.W. Parak F. Cordone L. Cupane A. Leone M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and has been attributed to a transition in protein mobility from the low temperature “solid like” behavior characterized by essentially harmonic oscillations of the nuclei around their equilibrium positions, to a high temperature “liquid like” behavior characterized by the jumping among different conformational substates of the biomolecule. It should be noted that, for deoxyhemoglobin and myoglobin, the onset of anharmonic motions occurs at about 120 K, i.e. well before the temperature at which the glass transition of the glycerol/water solvent mixture occurs (∼180 K) (34Cordone L.

In addition, AMP cooperativity was absent in the Arg49mutants. The R and T-state circular dichroism spectra of the position 49 mutants were identical and superimposable on only the R-state spectrum of the wild-type enzyme. Changes from noncompetitive to competitive inhibition by AMP can be accommodated within the framework of a steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1phosphohydrolase, EC3.1.3.11, FBPase 1The abbreviations used are: FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate; CD, circular dichroism. ) governs a crucial step in carbohydrate metabolism, the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the presence of required divalent cations such as Mg2+ (1Benkovic S.T. deMaine M.M.

In mammals, FBPase is a homotetramer, inhibited competitively by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) (3Sola M.M. Oliver F.J. Salto R. Gutierrez M. Vargas A.M. Int. J.

S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and a single common binding site for Fru-2,6-P2 and fructose 6-phosphate approximately 20 Å away from the AMP site. Metal ions bind at or near the active site. Activation of FBPase by Mg2+ exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 2 at neutral pH but exhibits hyperbolic kinetics at pH 9.6 (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the context of FBPase kinetics, the binding of AMP results in a diverse and complex set of phenomena. The inhibition of FBPase by AMP and Fru-2,6-P2 is synergistic (13Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Claus T.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 755-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2861-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the Fru-2,6-P2-induced enhancement of AMP binding is attributed to a decrease in the k off for the nucleotide (4Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMP and Mg2+ are mutually exclusive in their binding to FBPase (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have shown that AMP indirectly perturbs metal binding sites (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). AMP inhibition is cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of 2 (7Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Taketa K. Pogell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first two molecules of AMP putatively bind with positive cooperativity, whereas the last two molecules bind with negative cooperativity (17Levitzki A. Stallcup W.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The mechanism for AMP inhibition is nonlinear and noncompetitive, with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 and nonlinear and competitive with respect to Mg2+ (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four identical subunits (C1, C2, C3, and C4) of FBPase each consist of single AMP (residues 1–200) and FBP (residues 200–335) binding domains (10Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The tetramer is roughly a square with the upper left vertex occupied by subunit C1 followed by C2, C3, and C4 in a clockwise sense. Structures of AMP complexes of FBPase define the T-state, whereas structures of FBPase in complexes with substrates or substrate analogs without AMP define the R-state. To a first approximation, the transition from the T- to R-state is a 17° rotation of the lower subunit pair (C3-C4) relative to upper subunit pair (C1-C2) coupled with a 1.9° rotation of the AMP domain relative to the FBP domain within each subunit. The R- to T-state transition results in conformational changes at interfaces between C1 and C2, C1 and C4, and the AMP and FBP domains within a subunit (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues of helix H2, particularly residues 49 and 50, are strategically positioned at the C1-C2 interface, near the molecular center of the tetramer, approximately 20 Å from both the active site and the AMP binding site. The significance of Arg49 and Lys50 to the function of porcine liver FBPase is examined here by site-directed mutagenesis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, kinetics, and structural modeling. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of position 49 in AMP cooperativity and inhibition. In addition, both residues are important determinants in the thermostability of the FBPase tetramer. Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP, MgCl2, AMP, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. DNA-modifying and restriction enzymes were from Promega and CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., respectively. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase came from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or the equivalent. Mutations were accomplished by the introduction of specific base changes into a double-stranded plasmid (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Four mutagenic primers, 5′-ACCGCAGTCGGCAAGGC-3′, 5′-ACCGCAGTCGACAAGGC-3′, 5′-ACCGCAGTCTGCAAGGC-3′, and 5′-GCAGTCCGCATGGCGGGCA-3′ (mismatched bases in boldface), were used to mutate Arg49 → Leu, Arg49 → Asp, Arg49 → Cys, and Lys50 → Met, respectively. A selective primer, 5′-CAGCCTCGCCTCGAGAACGCCA-3′, which exchanged the originalNruI site for a unique XhoI site on the pET-11a vector was used. The double-stranded FBPase expression plasmid (pET-FBP) (19Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.-C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and mutagenic and selective primers were denatured, annealed, and polymerized as described by Deng and Nickoloff (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by NruI/XhoI digestion and by fluorescent dideoxy chain termination sequencing at the Nucleic Acid Facility at Iowa State University. The sequencing primer 5′-GTCATTGGAGAGGACATC-3′ was used to confirm the mutations. The mutagenesis plasmid was finally transformed into Escherichia coli DF 657, a strain deficient in the FBPase gene. Wild-type, Arg49 → Leu, Arg49 → Asp, Arg49→ Cys, and Lys50 → Met FBPases were purified by using 30–70% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, a Sephadex G-100 column, and a CM-Sephadex C-50 column. Homogeneous Arg49 → Asp was obtained by using an additional Cibacron blue column (from Sigma). The experimental details are described elsewhere (19Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.-C. Ling T. Fromm H.J.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. The protein purity was determined by using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Specific activity during purification was determined by the phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrometric assay at pH 7.5 and pH 9.6 (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All other kinetic experiments were done at pH 7.5 (Hepes buffer) and 25 °C by using a coupled spectrofluorometric assay (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rate data were analyzed by using a computer program written in MINITAB with an α value of 2.0 (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J.

Biophys. 1975; 170: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cooperativity was evaluated by using either the ENZFITTER program (25Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER, A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBMPC. Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987: 13-75Google Scholar) or the MINITAB program. CD studies on the wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase in the presence or absence of ligands employed a Jasco J710 CD spectrometer and a 1-mm cell at room temperature. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in 1.3-nm increments, and each spectrum was blank-corrected and smoothed by using the software package provided with the instrument. Models for the Arg49 → Leu, Arg49 → Cys, Arg49 → Asp, and Lys50 → Met mutants were built from the x-ray structures of the R- and T-states of the wild-type pig kidney enzyme (26Ke H. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Xue Y. Huang S. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The Arg49 → Asp T-state model was taken from the partially refined x-ray crystal structure determined at Iowa State University. 2B. W. Poland and R. B. Honzatko, unpublished data. With the exception of the Arg49 → Asp T-state model, the best conformations of the side chains of Leu49, Cys49, Asp49, and Met50 were obtained by a systematic search and then subjected to 20 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization using XPLOR (29Brünger A.F. X-PLOR, A System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The coordinates of all atoms except those within a 10 Å radius around the residue of interest were fixed at their crystallographic positions. Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using GRASP (30Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar) for residues 168–171 (turn T2) for the R- and T-state models after removal of all water molecules. The elution profiles from the CM-Sephadex column were similar for mutant and wild-type enzymes, except that Arg49 → Leu does not bind to the column. An additional Cibacron blue column was used to obtain homogeneous Arg49 → Leu enzyme. The wild-type and mutant forms of FBPases exhibited identical mobility and are >96% homogeneous using electrophoresis as a criterion (Fig.1). The pH 7.5/pH 9.6 activity ratios (Table I), along with the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results, suggest that the enzymes had not undergone proteolysis (23Ulm E.H. Pogell B.M. deMaine M.M.

Arg49 → Leu and Arg49 → Cys activity decreased to approximately 10 and 40%, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme after a 10-min incubation at 57 °C (Fig. 2). In contrast, the activity of Arg49 → Asp was <10% at 47 °C. The activity of the wild-type and Lys50 → Met enzymes did not change at 57 °C; however, a 70 and 20% decrease in activity was observed at 67 °C for wild type and Lys50→ Met mutations, respectively. Mutations of Arg49 and Lys50 do not alter the specific activity of FBPase or the K m for Fru-1,6-P2 (Table I). The K a and Hill coefficient for Mg2+ of the wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase were determined at saturating Fru-1,6-P2concentrations (12–20 μm). The wild-type as well as the mutant enzymes showed sigmoidal kinetics for Mg2+; however, 4–8-fold increases in the K a for Mg2+was found in the mutant enzymes relative to the wild-type enzyme (TableI). Slight decreases in affinity (3–5-fold) for Fru-2,6-P2were found in Arg49 → Leu and Arg49 → Asp, but no change was found for either Arg49 → Cys or Lys50 → Met relative to wild-type FBPase. Thus, Arg49 and Lys50 are involved neither in Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition nor in the discrimination between Fru-1,6-P2 and Fru-2,6-P2. AMP inhibition is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 but nonlinear and competitive relative to Mg2+ for the wild-type enzyme (11Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expected pattern for noncompetitive inhibition of AMP relative to Fru-1,6-P2was found in wild-type and Lys50 → Met FBPases; however, the mechanism was changed to competitive inhibition in Arg49 → Leu and Arg49 → Asp and to uncompetitive inhibition in the Arg49 → Cys mutant. In addition, the cooperativity for AMP inhibition was lost in the three Arg49 mutants. A double-reciprocal plot of 1/velocityversus [1/Fru-1,6-P2] at various concentrations of AMP for Lys50 → Met gave an excellent fit to Equation 1 when n = 2 (data not shown). The “goodness of fit” was 4%. AMP inhibition, then, is noncompetitive and cooperative as for the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Equation1 is, 1v=1Vm1+InKii+KaA1+InKiEquation 1 where v, V m, A,I, K a, K i, andK ii represent initial velocity, maximal velocity, the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2, the concentration of AMP, the Michaelis constants for Fru-1,6-P2, the dissociation constants for AMP from the enzyme AMP, and the enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2-AMP complexes, respectively.n represents the Hill coefficient for AMP with FBPase. Whenn = 2, the binding of AMP to FBPase exhibits cooperativity; on the other hand, there is no cooperativity whenn = 1. Double-reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus1/[Fru-1,6-P2] at various fixed concentrations of AMP for the Arg49 → Leu mutant (data not presented) gave a family of lines intersecting on the 1/v axis. The Arg49 → Asp mutant gave a similar result (data not shown). Thus, AMP inhibition of Arg49 → Asp and Arg49 → Leu is competitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2. The data fit best to Equation 2 withn = 1. 1v=1Vm1+KaA1+InKiEquation 2 where v, V m, A,I, n, K a, andK i are defined as above. The goodness of fit is <4% for both mutants when n = 1 and >10% whenn = 2. AMP inhibition relative to Fru-1,6-P2 of Arg49→ Cys gave a family of parallel lines (Fig.3), indicating a mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition. Equation 3 with n = 1 best accounts for the data. 1v=1Vm1+InKi+KaAEquation 3 where v, V m, A, I,n, K a, and K i are as above. The goodness of fit was <4%. Thus, cooperativity for AMP inhibition is lost in addition to the change in the kinetic mechanism. Residue 49 plays an important role in AMP cooperativity and the mechanism of AMP inhibition. All four mutants as well as wild-type FBPase exhibited competitive inhibition by AMP relative to Mg2+ (data not shown). TheK i (I50) for AMP increased 4–10-fold for Arg49 mutants. The Lys50 → Met mutation did not influence AMP affinity. In the absence of ligands, the CD spectra from 200 to 260 nm of wild-type and the four mutant FBPases were superimposable (data not shown), indicating no major differences in secondary structure. In the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 and Mg2+(R-state), the CD spectra for the wild-type enzyme from 200 to 260 nm were superimposable (Fig. 4). The CD spectra of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of AMP and substrate or in the presence of AMP alone (data not shown) were identical to each other but differed in the region of 210 nm from the spectrum of the wild-type enzyme in the R-state (Fig. 4). CD spectroscopy is thus sensitive to differences in the R- and T-states of the wild-type enzyme. The CD spectra of Lys50 → Met in the R- and T-state are identical to the CD spectra of wild-type FBPase in the R- and T-states, respectively (data not shown). On the other hand, the CD spectra of the R- and T-states of Arg49 → Leu, Arg49 → Asp, and Arg49 → Cys are identical (data not shown). Furthermore, the R- and T-state spectra of Arg49 → Leu are similar to the R-state spectrum of wild-type enzyme but dissimilar at 210 nm to the T-state spectrum of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.5). These data indicate the existence of a CD-sensitive, R-like feature in AMP complexes of Arg49mutants. Lipscomb and co-workers (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Ke H. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have proposed that FBPase exists in two different conformational states, an active R- and an inactive or less active T-state. Differences between the two states are most apparent at the C1-C4 and C1-C2 interfaces (and interfaces related to these by molecular symmetry). Residues in the AMP binding domain contribute to both interfaces (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, C1 Arg49hydrogen bonds with C2 Gly168 and C2 Ser169 of turn T2, which itself is in contact with loop L6 (residues 128–130 of C2) located at the C-terminal end of helix H4 (residues 123–127 of C2). Helix H4 is near the active site and may have an influence on the binding of metal ions and/or the 1-phosphate group of the substrate (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). AMP initiates the transition from the active R- to the inactive or less active T-state or stabilizes the T-state relative to the R-state. The R- to T-state transition involves significant intra- and intersubunit rearrangements that are coupled in the wild-type enzyme (31Shyur L.F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33301-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preliminary crystal structures of Arg49 → Asp in the presence of AMP reveal a T-state tetramer, which has R-like subunits.2 The FBP binding domains of the C1-C2 dimer (the asymmetric unit of the crystal) can be superimposed on the corresponding domain of the canonical T- and R-states of FBPase. The orientation of the AMP binding domain relative to the FBP binding domain of the Arg49 → Asp mutant approximates those of the R-state subunit. Thus, the T-state tetramer of Arg49→ Asp has R-like subunits in the context of the canonical T-state quaternary arrangement of those subunits. The CD spectra of position 49 mutants in the presence and absence of AMP are identical to each other and to the spectrum of the R-state of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the CD spectra of wild-type R- and T-states are different. Invariant CD spectra (with or without AMP) of Arg49 mutants may reflect the absence of conformational change in the mutant or be the result of conformational changes that are CD-insensitive. The Arg49 mutants are not locked into an R-state quaternary arrangement of subunits, as the crystal structure of Arg49 → Asp clearly reveals a T-state subunit arrangement. CD spectroscopy may be sensitive then to changes in relative orientation of the AMP and FBP domains within a subunit. Thus, an R-like subunit may produce an R-state CD spectrum regardless of the quaternary subunit arrangement. The most significant findings reported here are the loss of AMP cooperatively and the change in mechanism of AMP inhibition in the Arg49 mutants. Loss of AMP cooperatively has been observed by Shyur et al. (32Shyur L.F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3005-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in an Arg22 → Met mutant (C1-C4 interface) and more recently by Lu et al. (33Lu G. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5076-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in mutations of Glu192 to alanine and glutamine (C1-C4 interface). The Arg49 mutants are the first instances of mutations at the C1-C2 interface that abolish AMP cooperativity. Presumably the stabilization by AMP of a T-like conformation of one subunit (say C1) can be communicated through the C1-C2 interface to subunit C2 or the C1-C4 interface to subunit C4. If subunit C1 cannot adopt a T-like conformation and remains R-like in the presence of AMP, subunit C2 and/or C4 may not be influenced by the binding of AMP to subunit C1, hence the loss of positive cooperativity in AMP association. The modest decrease in AMP affinity observed in position 49 mutants may represent the loss in synergy between a pair of AMP molecules bound to C1/C2 or C1/C4. As mutations at the C1-C2 interface (Arg49) and the C1-C4 interface (Arg22 and Glu192) independently abolish AMP cooperativity, we cannot however unambiguously assign the phenomenon of cooperativity to a specific pair of subunits. Nonetheless, the crystal structure of the AMP complex of the Arg22 → Met mutant reveals a canonical T-state, 3V. Villeret, L.-F. Shyur, H. J. Fromm, and W. N. Lipscomb, unpublished data. implying that the loss in cooperativity is due to an effect (perhaps electrostatic in origin) localized to the C1-C4 interface (31Shyur L.F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33301-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Arg49 → Asp mutant has an impact on both C1-C2 and C1-C4 interfaces. As only the C1-C4 interface is perturbed by both mutations, the subunit pair most likely associated with positive cooperativity is C1-C4. Lu et al. (33Lu G. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5076-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also ascribed the origin of AMP cooperativity to the C1-C4 interface. The involvement of the C1-C2 interface in AMP cooperativity, however, was not considered by Luet al., perhaps because their work predates the discovery of a C1-C2 interface mutant that abolishes AMP cooperativity. It is possible to rationalize the data for noncompetitive inhibition and competitive inhibition within the context of the steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism proposed for FBPase (34Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the suggested relationship of interactions of FBPase with AMP and Mg2+(15Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If it is assumed that AMP can bind to the free enzyme and the FBPase·FBP complex, it is possible to reduce the steady-state Random Bi Bi initial rate equation to the competitive and noncompetitive models by simply making assumptions regarding the relationships that must exist among rate constants. Similar manipulations were made by Rudolph and Fromm (35Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6611-6619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for hexokinase by computer simulations. On the other hand, the steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism cannot readily account for the results of Fig. 3 (uncompetitive inhibition). The kinetic data infer that AMP inhibits wild-type FBPase by several related (and coupled) mechanisms and that the kind of side chain at position 49 determines the dominant mechanism of inhibition. Although other explanations are possible, the decrease in thermal stability of the Arg49 mutant can be explained by structural perturbations localized to the C1-C2 interface. In the R-state, C2 Arg49 hydrogen bonds with C1 Gly168and is in van der Waals contact with C1 Arg49 (16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the T-state, C2 Arg49 hydrogen bonds with C2 Gly168, C2 Ser169, and C2 Thr171(16Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The position-49 mutations eliminate the C1 Arg49-C2 Arg49 van der Waals contacts and the hydrogen bonds in both the R- and T-states. Another consequence of the mutation may be an increased exposure of residues 168–171 (turn T2) of the C1-C2 interface to water (Table II). In fact, for the Arg49 → Asp mutation, nonbonded contacts are not only lost but replaced with repulsive electrostatic interactions between C1 Asp49 and C2 Asp49,2possibly accounting for the increased thermosensitivity of the Arg49 → Asp mutant (Fig. 2). Both the loss of intersubunit hydrogen bonds and the increase in solvent-accessible surface area of the C1-C2 interface may contribute significantly to the decreased thermostability of the other Arg49 mutations.Table IISolvent-accessible surface area (Å2) of turn T2 (168–171)R-stateT-stateWild Type2114Arg-49 → Asp5059Arg-49 → Leu3529Arg-49 → Cys5348 Open table in a new tab The enhanced thermostability of the Lys50 → Met mutant, however, is not readily apparent from an examination of the R- and T-states. The energy-minimized model for the Lys50 → Met mutant in the R-state retains van der Waals contacts but replaces the salt-link of C1 Lys50 to C2 Asp187 with a nonbonded contact. The T-state model for Lys50 → Met retains similar nonbonded contacts to those of the wild-type enzyme. The enhanced thermostability of the Lys50 → Met mutant then must originate from either a kinetic phenomenon (an increase in the energy of activation of a fundamental step in the unfolding process) or a difference in the free energy between the unfolded states of the mutant and wild-type enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2034827313,"Similar to other stages ofDictyostelium development, spore germination is a particularly suitable model for studying regulation of gene expression. The transition from spore to amoeba is accompanied by developmentally regulated changes in both protein and mRNA synthesis. A number of spore germination-specific cDNAs have been isolated previously. Among these are two members of the 270 gene family, a group of four genes defined by the presence of a common tetrapeptide repeat of Thr-Glu-Thr-Pro. celA (formerly called 270–6) andcelB (formerly 270–11) are expressed solely and coordinately during spore germination, the levels of the respective mRNAs being low in dormant spores, rising during germination to a maximum level at about 2 h, and then rapidly declining as amoebae are released from spores. The mRNAs are not found in growing cells or during multicellular development. The rapidity with which these transcripts accumulate and then disappear during germination implies that the respective products may be important for the process. We reported previously that the CelA protein is a cellulase (endo-1,4-β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4)). In the present investigation, properties of the CelB protein, a glycosylated protein of 532 amino acids, 36% of which are serine or threonine, were examined, and the upstream sequences involved in the developmental regulation of the expression of the gene have been determined. The CelB protein does not demonstrate cellulase activity, but it has a cellulose-binding domain. Its role, if any, in degradation of the cellulose-containing spore wall is unknown. To identify cis-acting elements in the celB promoter, unidirectional 5′ deletions of the celB upstream noncoding region were constructed and used to transform amoebae. Analysis of promoter activity during different stages of development shows that a short, very A/T-rich sequence of approximately 81 base pairs is sufficient for spore-specific celB transcription. Contained in this sequence is the Myb oncogene protein binding site, TAACTG, which was shown previously to be a negative regulator ofcelA transcription. Dictyostelium and mouse Myb proteins bind to this region of the promoter, suggesting that Myb might regulate celB gene expression negatively as it does incelA.

Dictyostelium discoideum is a favorable organism for studying macromolecular events coincident with and necessary for eukaryotic development. Depletion of the food supply sets in motion an orderly succession of developmental events (1Loomis W.F. The Development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Academic Press, New York, NY1982: 3-10Google Scholar). New programs of gene expression allow individual vegetative cells to enter the multicellular mode and subsequently form the fruiting body which contains two morphologically distinct cells, those in the stalk and in the spores. Similar to other stages of Dictyostelium development, spore germination is a particularly suitable model for studying regulation of gene expression. The synchronous transition from spore to amoeba is accompanied by developmentally regulated changes in both protein and mRNA synthesis and requires ongoing protein synthesis (1Loomis W.F.

We reported previously that the purified CelA protein is a cellulase and is composed of three separable functional domains, catalytic, spacer containing the amino acid repeat and a cellulose-binding domain (8Ramalingam R.

The desired portion ofcelB coding region (GeneBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number J02916) was constructed using PCR and subcloned downstream of the actin promoter using BamHI andXhoI sites (underlined in the PCR primers). For both the full-length (1596 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; ConA, concanavalin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kbp, kilobase pairs; MRE, Myb oncogene protein response element; nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ) and truncated (1011 bp) celB coding sequence, the 5′ primer was 5′-CGCGGGATCCATGAAAAATATATATAGTTTATTCTTA-3′. The 3′ primer for the full-length insert was 5′-CGCGCTCGAGTCAACATGTATATTGAACTCCTTCGAGG-3′ and for the truncated sequence was 5′-CGCGCTCGAGTTAACTTGATGAATCTGAACATGTTGG-3′. The PCR cycle parameters were: 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min repeated for 30 cycles. The resulting full-length and truncated constructs, diagrammed in Fig.1, were named pDNeo67.CelB and pDNeo67.CelB-T, respectively. In both constructs, the celB translation initiation codon is the first ATG downstream of the actin 6 promoter transcription site. Strain AX-4 amoebae were transformed by each of the constructs as described previously (11Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Siversten A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A.

A plasmid genomic minilibrary was constructed by subcloning of gel-purified 2.5-kbp XbaI restriction fragments of AX4 genomic DNA into the XbaI site of Bluescript KS+ vector. A 1.2-kbpBamHI-XbaI restriction fragment from acelB genomic clone isolated previously in the lab that included 170 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 1 kbp of coding sequence was used as probe. The above genomic minilibrary was screened using this probe and a 2.3-kbp XbaI fragment containing the 1.2-kbp 5′ noncoding region, and the 1.1-kbp celB coding region was isolated. The clone was sequenced and used for further studies.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed and quantitated as described earlier (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis was performed as described earlier (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer, the sequence of which is presented in the legend to Fig. 9. To make Δ−420/−242, a 564-bp BamHI-Sau3AI fragment encompassing −984 to −420 was cloned into theBamHI site of the −242 construct. Construct −494/−242 was made by cloning a 490-bp PCR fragment encompassing −984 to −494 into the BamHI site of the −242 construct. All the constructs were sequenced to confirm the end points and deletion junctions. EMSA was carried out as described earlier (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to −436 to 416 of the celB promoter, sense strand 5′-ATTATTTGATCAGTTAGC-3′, antisense strand 5′-ATTGCTAACTGATCAAAT-3′ containing an MRE (underlined). Mutant oligonucleotide sequence was, sense strand 5′-ATTATTTGATCAtgTAGC-3′, antisense strand 5′-ATTGCTAcaTGATCAAAT-3′ (mutations in the MRE are indicated in lowercase letters). Bacterial extracts that expressed Dictyostelium or mouse Myb protein were used as the source of Myb in this assay. An extract from a bacterial culture lacking the expressed Myb protein was used as a control. To determine whether amoebae stably transformed with celB or celB-T constructs synthesized the correct transcripts, total RNA was prepared from amoebae of the transformants, size-fractionated on an agarose gel, and then probed forcelB mRNA expression. The autoradiogram (Fig. 2) showed that transcripts which hybridized to celB were made in transformed amoebae. Transcripts of 1600 and 1250 nt for celB andcelB-T, respectively, were found, consistent with the sizes of the cDNAs that were cloned (1596 and 1011 bp, respectively). NocelB-specific transcript was present in either untransformed amoebae or in amoebae transformed with only the pDNeo67 vector (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of the CelB N terminus suggested the presence of a signal peptide sequence (7Giorda R. Ohmachi T. Shaw D.R. Ennis H.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consequently, the media of vegetatively growing amoebae stably transformed withcelB expression constructs was examined by SDS-PAGE for the presence of secreted proteins (Figs. 3and 4). Amoebae containing constructs pDNeo67.CelB and pDNeo67.CelB-T secreted single predominant polypeptides of apparent molecular weights of 82,000 and 47,500, respectively. N-terminal amino acid analysis of the CelB protein gave the sequence NNAFI. The N-terminal sequence of the deduced CelB protein was MKNIYSLFLLFALISATFANNAFI etc. (7Giorda R. Ohmachi T. Shaw D.R. Ennis H.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consequently, the first 19 amino acids were not present in the secreted protein. No CelB was associated with amoebae (data not shown). The molecular weights of the deduced CelB and CelB-T proteins on the basis of amino acid content were 55,205 and 34,611, respectively, and the respective proteins minus the first 19 amino acids were 53,059 and 32,465. Thus, the secreted proteins were larger than their predicted molecular masses.Figure 4Determination of glycosylation of CelB proteins. Proteins were fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with either Coomassie Blue (A) or periodic acid-Schiff reagent (Glyco-Track, Oxford GlycoSystems, Bedford, MA) (B). Lanes 1, CelB-T, 10 μg; lanes 2, CelB, 10 μg. Protein standards in thousands are indicated to the left of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CelA protein is larger than its predicted molecular weight because it is glycosylated (8Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15432-15437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether CelB proteins were glycosylated, three different methods were used. First, concentrated supernatants from growing transformed amoebae were passed over ConA-agarose columns, and bound proteins were then eluted with methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions showed that CelB bound to ConA, whereas CelB-T did not (Fig.3). Compare lanes 5 and 6 (CelB unbound and bound fractions, respectively) with lanes 8 and 9(CelB-T unbound and bound fractions, respectively). CelA protein, which has been shown previously (8Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15432-15437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to bind to ConA, was included as a control (lanes 2 and 3). These results immediately indicated that CelB was glycosylated and that it contained sugars necessary for ConA binding. However, lack of binding to ConA of CelB-T did not mean that the protein was not glycosylated because the glysosyl moiety could contain sugars not recognized by ConA. The next method used was reaction of proteins with periodic acid-Schiff reagent (15Segrest J. Jackson R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 54-63Crossref Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment showed that both CelB and CelB-T reacted with this reagent, indicating that both proteins were glycosylated (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that other proteins were secreted by growing amoebae that reacted with the periodate-Schiff reagent, indicating other secreted glycosylated proteins. Further evidence that both proteins were glycosylated was obtained by reaction with the MUD50 (mod B gene) antibody (16Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). This antibody recognizes anO-linked epitope on other glycosylatedDictyostelium proteins (16Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consequently, the experiments described in Figs. 4 and 5 show that CelB and CelB-T were glycosylated although the glycosylation was not identical because CelB-T did not bind to ConA, whereas CelB did. Treatment of CelB with peptide N-glycosidase F (EC3.5.1.52), an enzyme that removes N-linked glycosyl groups from protein (17Alexander A. Elder J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 179: 505-518Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), did not affect its migration in SDS-PAGE, showing that the protein did not contain N-linked glycosyl groups (Fig. 6). Since the CelB protein sequence had been predicted earlier to contain a cellulose-binding domain (18Meinke A. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1991; 4: 349-353Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether CelB or CelB-T could bind to cellulose. Each protein was incubated with crystalline cellulose (Avicel), and the ability of the protein to bind to Avicel was determined. It is clear from the results shown in Fig. 7 that CelB but not CelB-T bound to cellulose. However, we have been unable to find an enzymatic activity for CelB. The protein did not hydrolyze a large number of carbohydrates tested, including carboxymethyl cellulose, crystalline cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, xylose, barley glucan, amorphous avicel, laminarin, and cellulose purified from D. discoideum spores (data not shown). The 5′-untranslated region ofcelB was not known. To understand the transcriptional regulation of CelB expression, we had to determine this sequence. Consequently, a genomic clone containing the 1.2 kbp upstream sequence was isolated from a genomic library and characterized (Fig. 8). As a first step, the transcription start site was determined. Primer extension analysis of RNA isolated from 1.5-h germinating spores showed that transcription was initiated from nine adjacent sites located 215 bases upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 9). A consensus TATA box sequence was located upstream of the transcriptional start sites at −29 to −24. To characterize regulatory sequences that determine spore germination-specific expression of celB, the 1.2-kbp upstream region was cloned into the reporter construct pAVCATII (−984) such that the cloned celB upstream region drives expression of the plasmid-borne CAT coding sequence. Amoebae transformed with this promoter construct were allowed to develop and form spores, spores were collected and induced to germinate, and CAT activity in 1.5-h germinating spores was measured. As shown in Fig. 10, the −984 construct possessed spore germination-specific promoter activity. To identify cis-acting elements in the celB promoter, unidirectional 5′ deletions of construct −984 were made. Spore germination-specific promoter activity was measured in the transformants of the deletion promoter constructs as described above. Constructs −684 and −494 were about 24- and 4-fold more active, respectively, than the −984 construct (Fig. 10). Since this vector inserts multiple copies in the Dictyostelium genome, the copy number in all tranformants was determined and found to be about equal in all (data not shown). Therefore, the difference in activity is not due to different copy number of the integrated construct. Construct −420 showed the same activity as −984. When the deletion extended to −242, spore germination-specific promoter activity was lost. These data suggested that a critical sequence that was required forcelB transcription was present in the 178 bp located between −420 and −242. In support of this proposal was the observation that an internal deletion of this region Δ−420/−242 rendered the construct inactive. A data base search for the presence of known transcription factor binding sites in the celB promoter showed a Myb binding site TAACTG (19Stober-Grasser U. Brydolf B. Bin X. Grasser F. Firtel R.A. Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar) in reverse orientation just upstream of −420. The Myb gene has been shown to be present and expressed in Dictyostelium(19Stober-Grasser U. Brydolf B. Bin X. Grasser F. Firtel R.A. Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar). An internal deletion of sequences containing the Myb binding site, in addition to another sequence (Δ−494/−242), was prepared and analyzed. The transformant containing this construct was as active as the −984 construct. An EMSA was performed to determine whether Myb protein bound to this sequence. The probe was a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence −436 to −416 of thecelB promoter (see Fig. 8). Bacterially synthesized D. discoideum Myb and mouse Myb were used. TheDictyostelium protein was the entire Myb sequence while the mouse protein was a truncated version lacking the C terminus but containing the DNA binding and transactivating domains (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 11, both Dictyosteliumand mouse Myb bound to the celB promoter containing the MRE (lanes 6 and 2, respectively), and excess unlabeled probe competed for binding to the complex (lanes 7and 3, respectively). However, excess unlabeled MRE mutant sequence (see “Experimental Procedures” for sequence), which was previously shown not to bind Myb, did not compete (lanes 8and 4, respectively), demonstrating that the complex formed was specific. An extract of bacteria that did not contain Myb did not form a complex (lane 5). The promoter construct −420 was tested for promoter activity during different developmental stages to verify that it contained sequences necessary for the proper temporal regulation of celB expression. The data presented in Fig.12 show that the gene was not transcribed during vegetative growth or 5- and 16-h multicellular development but was expressed during spore germination in a similar manner as the normal gene. The other constructs that displayed activity were also shown to be active during germination but not in growing amoebae (data not shown). The present study encompasses two aspects of CelB expression, the characterization of the protein and the definition of the gene promoter. The work may have special significance because the narrow window of gene expression intimates importance of the protein during this restricted portion of the organism life cycle. Consequently, an understanding of the role the protein plays in development may be a useful model of how other genes, similarly expressed during other stages of organism development, regulate their expression for use exclusively at a particular time. CelB protein has an uncommon sequence organization (18Meinke A. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1991; 4: 349-353Google Scholar). Its 532 amino acids can be arranged into five distinct portions of approximately similar size. The N-terminal 110 amino acids is followed by a 118-amino acid segment of mostly threonine and serine, after which is 104 amino acids with homology to bacterial cellulose-binding domains, connected to a 104-amino acid region containing the Thr-Glu-Thr-Pro repeat, and finally the C-terminal 96 amino acids that also show good homology to bacterial cellulose-binding domains. The two proline-, threonine-, glutamic acid-, and serine-rich segments correspond to the linker sequences connecting domains in β-1,4-glucanases (20Gilkes N.R. Henrissat B. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the isolation of large amounts of CelB protein, expression vectors were constructed that allowed the synthesis and secretion of full-length (532 amino acids) and truncated protein lacking the 195 C-terminal amino acids during growth of transformed amoebae, a stage in the life cycle which does not normally synthesize CelB. The N terminus of the secreted protein was shown to lack the first 19 amino acids of the deduced protein, defining the signal sequence. Both proteins were larger than their predicted molecular weights based on their amino acid content because of O-linked glycoslation in different portions of the protein. The full-length protein was glycoslyated in the Thr-Glu-Thr-Pro repeat region as well as in an undefined more N-terminal region. The truncated protein, which lacks the amino acid repeat region was also glycosylated. The two regions obviously contained different glycosylations since the full-length protein bound to ConA, whereas the truncated protein did not. Both glycosylations contained the MUD50 epitope, which is anO-linked oligosaccharide (16Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 195 amino acid region contained a cellulose-binding domain since the full-length protein bound avidly to crystalline cellulose whereas the truncated protein did not. Meinke, et al. (18Meinke A. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1991; 4: 349-353Google Scholar), predicted two cellulose-binding domains in CelB, on the basis of sequence homology to other cellulose-binding domains, one at the C terminus at around amino acid 460 to 503, and the other internal at about 270 to 302. These regions showed good homology to bacterial cellulose-binding domains. Our data showed that the C-terminal region did, in fact, contain a binding domain, but the other predicted sequence did not, under the conditions of our experiment. (Fig. 7). We were unable to demonstrate enzymatic activity for the CelB protein even though many different substrates were used. The most likely portion of the protein that could contain catalytic activity would be the N-terminal 110 amino acids. However, it is unlikely that this region has activity since the smallest cellulase catalytic domain described thus far is about 280 amino acids (21Wong W.K.R. Gerhard B. Guo Z.M. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A.J. Miller Jr., R.C. Gene (Amst .). 1986; 44: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cellulose-binding proteins lacking enzymatic activity have been found in other organisms, but they are usually a component of a multi-subunit complex (22Shoseyov O. Doi R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2192-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the cellulose-binding protein has no apparent enzymatic activity, it is nevertheless necessary for converting crystalline cellulose to a form that can be hydrolyzed by catalytic subunits in the cellulase complex. Other studies (23Din N. Gilkes N.R. Tekant B. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1096-1099Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Din N. Damude H.G. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11383-11387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that the cellulose-binding domain of a bacterial cellulase bound to crystalline cellulose, disrupted the structure of cellulose fibers and released small particles. There is synergy between the binding protein and the catalytic domain, which might explain why most cellulases contain both catalytic and cellulose-binding domains on the same protein. A conclusion from this work was that the cellulose-binding domain disorders the substrate to allow the catalytic domain easier access, and in this way allows for better hydrolysis of cellulose. Perhaps CelB protein binds to cellulose and makes the substrate more accessible to CelA cellulase. Because CelA and CelB are expressed coordinately during spore germination, it is tempting to suggest that these two proteins cooperate to digest the spore wall to enable the amoeba to emerge from the spore. Because celB is expressed during a narrow window of theD. discoideum life cycle, study of the mechanism by which promoter sequences can regulate the gene transcription should be important for understanding how specific sequences can regulate both the temporal and transcriptional control of the gene. We therefore set out to clone, sequence, and characterize the celB promoter. The celB promoter sequence was unusually AT-rich with several homopolymeric tracts of A or T. Transcription was initiated from eight A residues interspersed with one T residue. All the start sites seemed to be utilized at about equal frequency, as assessed by the intensity of the primer extension bands. The parental promoter construct −984 possessed regulatory sequences essential for spore germination-specific expression of celB. Deletion of sequences between −984 and −684 resulted in a 24-fold increase in celB promoter activity, indicating that there was a negatively acting sequence located between −984 and −684 (90% A/T). Close inspection of this region revealed the presence of an A-rich (96% A) sequence located between −858 and −804, including a homopolymeric run of 24 A residues. Another interesting feature of this sequence was the presence of a T-rich (91% T) sequence located between −757 and −687. The almost homopolymeric tract of T residues was punctuated by A residues occurring once in nine or ten residues. This arrangement of sequence might place the A residue on the helical face of the DNA. Similar homopolymeric tracts of A and T residues were present several times throughout the celB promoter sequence. Perhaps this AT-rich sequence can act negatively or positively by placing structural constraints on the chromatin. Deletion of sequences up to −494 and −420 gradually reduced celB promoter activity compared with the −684 construct. Finally, deleting the 178-bp sequence between −420 and −242 resulted in loss ofcelB promoter activity during spore germination. This was further confirmed by the observation that an internal deletion of this 178-bp sequence also led to loss of celB promoter activity (Δ−420/−242; Fig. 10). An internal deletion of sequences from −494 to −420 restored promoter activity to the −984 level, suggesting that another negatively acting sequence element was located between −494 and −420. This sequence included a perfect MRE in a reverse orientation. In celA, a gene that is coordinately expressed with celB, the MRE played a dual role in regulation of gene expression. In the absence of an adjacent AT-rich sequence, the MRE was required for correct gene expression while deletion of the MRE alone stimulated celA promoter activity (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since Dictyostelium Myb protein binds to the celB MRE (Fig. 11), it is a reasonable suggestion that Myb might regulate celB gene expression negatively as was observed in celA regulation (9Ramalingam R. Ennis H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). There was a high homology at the nucleotide level (57%) between the promoter sequences of these two genes. The highly conserved sequences included a tract of 70 T-rich residues, several runs of A residues, and the presence of the MRE. The high sequence homology and presence of similar regulatory sequences in both celA andcelB promoters suggested that expression of celB, which is expressed at the same time as celA, is possibly regulated by a similar mechanism. Since celB is thought, but not yet proved, to perform an accessory function for breakage of the spore wall during spore germination along with celA, it is conceivable that this family of genes is coordinately regulated by a common set of transactivating factors. We thank Dr. Stephen Alexander, for help in performing the experiment described in Fig. 6, and Drs. Kalyan Ganguly and Joseph S. Lipsick, for Myb samples."
