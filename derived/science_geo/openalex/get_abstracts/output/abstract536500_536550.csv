https://openalex.org/W1932780354,"The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables many metabolic processes, but why its inhibition suppresses cell proliferation is unclear. It is also not well understood why pyruvate supplementation allows cells lacking ETC function to proliferate. We used a CRISPR-based genetic screen to identify genes whose loss sensitizes human cells to phenformin, a complex I inhibitor. The screen yielded GOT1, the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, loss of which kills cells upon ETC inhibition. GOT1 normally consumes aspartate to transfer electrons into mitochondria, but, upon ETC inhibition, it reverses to generate aspartate in the cytosol, which partially compensates for the loss of mitochondrial aspartate synthesis. Pyruvate stimulates aspartate synthesis in a GOT1-dependent fashion, which is required for pyruvate to rescue proliferation of cells with ETC dysfunction. Aspartate supplementation or overexpression of an aspartate transporter allows cells without ETC activity to proliferate. Thus, enabling aspartate synthesis is an essential role of the ETC in cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1553978925,"Mitochondrial respiration is important for cell proliferation; however, the specific metabolic requirements fulfilled by respiration to support proliferation have not been defined. Here, we show that a major role of respiration in proliferating cells is to provide electron acceptors for aspartate synthesis. This finding is consistent with the observation that cells lacking a functional respiratory chain are auxotrophic for pyruvate, which serves as an exogenous electron acceptor. Further, the pyruvate requirement can be fulfilled with an alternative electron acceptor, alpha-ketobutyrate, which provides cells neither carbon nor ATP. Alpha-ketobutyrate restores proliferation when respiration is inhibited, suggesting that an alternative electron acceptor can substitute for respiration to support proliferation. We find that electron acceptors are limiting for producing aspartate, and supplying aspartate enables proliferation of respiration deficient cells in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors. Together, these data argue a major function of respiration in proliferating cells is to support aspartate synthesis."

Here, we combine axon-initiated viral transduction with rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing and Cre-based cell-type-specific targeting to systematically map input-output relationships of VTA-DA neurons. We found that VTA-DA (and VTA-GABA) neurons receive excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory input from diverse sources. VTA-DA neurons projecting to different forebrain regions exhibit specific biases in their input selection. VTA-DA neurons projecting to lateral and medial nucleus accumbens innervate largely non-overlapping striatal targets, with the latter also sending extensive extra-striatal axon collaterals. Using electrophysiology and behavior, we validated new circuits identified in our tracing studies, including a previously unappreciated top-down reinforcing circuit from anterior cortex to lateral nucleus accumbens via VTA-DA neurons. This study highlights the utility of our viral-genetic tracing strategies to elucidate the complex neural substrates that underlie motivated behaviors."

Barley was a founder crop in this process, and the most important steps in its domestication were mutations in two adjacent, dominant, and complementary genes, through which grains were retained on the inflorescence at maturity, enabling effective harvesting. Independent recessive mutations in each of these genes caused cell wall thickening in a highly specific grain “disarticulation zone,” converting the brittle floral axis (the rachis) of the wild-type into a tough, non-brittle form that promoted grain retention. By tracing the evolutionary history of allelic variation in both genes, we conclude that spatially and temporally independent selections of germplasm with a non-brittle rachis were made during the domestication of barley by farmers in the southern and northern regions of the Levant, actions that made a major contribution to the emergence of early agrarian societies.

Grain crops represent the primary source of caloric intake that enabled mankind to move from hunter-gathering to cultivation and agriculture (Harlan and Zohary, 1966Harlan J.R. Zohary D. Distribution of wild wheats and barley.Science. 1966; 153: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Archaeological evidence indicates that this change occurred in the Fertile Crescent ∼12,000 to 9,500 years ago, with the domestication process lasting several centuries (Tanno and Willcox, 2006Tanno K.

Subsequently, farming spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) was one of the first crops to be domesticated (Zohary et al., 2013Zohary D. Hopf M. Weiss E. Domestication of Plants in the Old World.Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press, 2013Google Scholar). Its wild progenitor, H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum (C. Koch) Thell.

The earliest evidence of such gathering comes from Ohalo II, a site located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee (Israel), where 23,000-year-old barley grain remnants have been found in large quantities (Kislev et al., 1992Kislev M.E. Nadel D. Carmi I. Epipalaeolithic (19,000 BP) cereal and fruit diet at Ohalo II, Sea of Galilee, Israel.Rev. Palaeobot.

Throughout the process of barley domestication, the effect of human selection under cultivation resulted in a plant type that produced an ever increasing amount of harvestable grain. Loss of the natural mode of grain dispersal was perhaps the most important single event in this process. In barley, the architecture of the inflorescence is classified as a “spike” (Forster et al., 2007Forster B.P. Franckowiak J.D. Lundqvist U. Lyon J. Pitkethly I. Thomas W.T.B. The barley phytomer.Ann.

USA. 2007; 104: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The individual dispersal unit is comprised of a central fertile spikelet (setting a single grain) along with two sterile lateral spikelets; this structure is attached to the node of the central floral axis, which is referred to as the rachis (Figures 1A and 1B ). At maturity, the spike in wild (i.e., ancestral) barley forms “constriction grooves” (Ubisch, 1915Ubisch G. Analyse eines Falles von Bastardatavismus und Faktorenkoppelung bei Gerste.Z Indukt Abstammungs Vererbungsl. 1915; 14: 226-237Google Scholar) (Figure 1B) and disarticulates at each rachis node allowing mature grain to disperse freely. This phenotype is referred to as “brittle rachis.” Classical genetic studies have established that a mutation in either of two complementary and tightly linked genes on barley chromosome 3H, Non-brittle rachis 1 (btr1) or Non-brittle rachis 2 (btr2), converts the brittle rachis into a non-brittle type. Wild-type dominant alleles of both genes are required to produce the brittle rachis that is ubiquitous among wild barleys (Komatsuda et al., 2004Komatsuda T. Maxim P. Senthil N. Mano Y.

The genotype of non-brittle cultivated barleys is either btr1Btr2 (hereafter btr1-type, Figure 1C) or Btr1btr2 (btr2-type, Figure 1D) (Takahashi and Hayashi, 1964Takahashi R. Hayashi J.

F1 plants (Btr1btr1Btr2btr2) produce a brittle rachis with constriction grooves (Figure 1E). A double-recessive (btr1btr2) cultivar has not as yet been identified (Komatsuda et al., 2004Komatsuda T.

In this study, we identify Btr1 and Btr2 genes and elucidate the mechanism underlying disarticulation of the wild-type barley spike. We explore the evolution of brittle rachis and its subsequent conversion to a non-brittle type during the process of domestication. Using comparative DNA sequence information and archaeo-botanical data (Tanno and Willcox, 2012Tanno K. Willcox G. Distinguishing wild and domestic wheat and barley spikelets from early Holocene sites in the Near East.Veg. Hist. Archaeobot. 2012; 21: 107-115Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) our data are consistent with independent origins of barley domestication. To identify the btr1 and btr2 genes, the cultivars (cv.) Kanto Nakate Gold (cv. KNG, btr1-type) and Azumamugi (cv. AZ, btr2-type) (Komatsuda and Mano, 2002Komatsuda T. Mano Y. Molecular mapping of the intermedium spike-c ( int-c) and non-brittle rachis 1 ( btr1) loci in barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.).Theor. Appl. Genet. 2002; 105: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and 1D) were intercrossed to produce a population segregating at both btr loci. Based on 10,084 F2 individuals, it was possible to map the two genes to within a 0.19 cM region on chromosome 3H flanked by the markers CB620466 and BJ484150 (Figure 1F). This interval was covered in its entirety by a 403-kb contig generated by chromosome walking within a barley cv. Morex (btr2-type, see Table S3) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Figures 1G and S1). A series of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that differentiated cvs. KNG and AZ were developed across the contig for the purpose of fine mapping (Table S1). An enlarged population of 14,058 F2 individuals, derived from the crosses between cvs. AZ × KNG and OUH602 × cv. KNG (see Experimental Procedures), was then used to locate btr1 by recombination to within a 1.2-kb interval (Figures 1F and 1G). Annotation of the 1.2-kb sequence identified only a single open reading frame (ORF1), which encodes a 196-residue protein. The 1.2-kb interval featured 18 sites that differed between cvs. KNG and AZ, with six sites located in ORF1. A comparison between the cv. KNG (btr1) and cv. AZ (Btr1) coding sequences revealed a 1-bp deletion (position +202, relative to the start codon in cv. KNG, see Figure 1H) predicted to induce a frameshift after changing leucine to serine at position 68. While a variable base at position +43 generated a threonine (T) residue at peptide position 15 in cv. AZ as opposed to an alanine (A) in cv. KNG, the wild barley accession OUH602 (Btr1) also carried alanine (A) at this position, indicating that this change could not be responsible for the non-brittle rachis phenotype (Figure 1I). The remaining four variable nucleotides were synonymous changes. To confirm the identity of ORF1 and Btr1, cv. Golden Promise (btr1-type) was transformed with the wild-type OUH602 ORF1 sequence under the control of the OUH602 native promoter (Figure S2A). The resulting primary transgenic plants (T1) produced brittle spikes (Figures 2A and S2B), reminiscent of those formed by OUH602 (Figure 3A). In the T2 generation, the transgene co-segregated with the brittle rachis character, confirming that ORF1 complemented the btr1 allele of cv. Golden Promise (Figures 2A and S2C).Figure 2Complementation of btr1 and btr2Show full caption(A) Genetic complementation of btr1 by ORF1. The expression of ORF1 in cv.

To identify Btr2, a set of 12,257 F2 segregants, derived from crosses of cvs. AZ × KNG and OUH602 × RIL50 (RIL50 line is a btr2-type derivative selected from the cross of cvs. AZ × KNG [Komatsuda et al., 2004Komatsuda T. Maxim P. Senthil N. Mano Y. High-density AFLP map of nonbrittle rachis 1 (btr1) and 2 (btr2) genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).Theor. Appl. Genet. 2004; 109: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar]; see Experimental Procedures), was analyzed. The btr2 location was ultimately delimited by recombination to a 4.9-kb interval (Figures 1F and 1G) that contained three short open reading frames, designated ORF2–ORF4, as predicted de novo by applying the gene prediction software FGENESH. Based on sequence comparisons, ORF2 and ORF4 matched scores to hundreds of sequences in many locations across the barley genome (BLASTN and BLASTX to barley genomic sequences at http://webblast.ipk-gatersleben.de/barley/index.php), suggesting that they represent components of as yet un-annotated repetitive elements of the barley genome. The repetitive natures of ORF2 and ORF4 were confirmed by k-mer-statistical analysis against the barley genome (Schmutzer et al., 2014Schmutzer T. Ma L. Pousarebani N. Bull F. Stein N. Houben A. Scholz U. Kmasker--a tool for in silico prediction of single-copy FISH probes for the large-genome species Hordeum vulgare.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2014; 142: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to ORF2 and ORF4, ORF3 represented low copy DNA (see “The Structure of the BTR Protein” section) and encoded a 202 amino acid residue protein. The KNG and AZ sequences covering the genetic interval differed at 69 nucleotide sites. A comparison between the ORF3 sequences present in cvs. AZ (btr2) and KNG (Btr2) revealed an 11-bp deletion positioned at +254–264 in cv. AZ (Figure 1H), which was predicted to create a frameshift after changing glycine to valine at position 85. The other three polymorphic sites within ORF3 were synonymous (Figure 1J). To test if ORF3 corresponded to Btr2, RIL50 was transformed using the construct pUBI1::ORF3, in which the OUH602 ORF3 sequence was driven by the maize UBIQUITIN1 promoter (Figure S2D). The T1 plants formed spikes with a brittle rachis at maturity (Figures 2B and S2E; Movie S1), comparable with those of the wild barley OUH602 (Figure 3A), and the transgene co-segregated with the brittle rachis trait among the T2 progeny (Figures 2B and S2F). Thus, ORF3 complemented btr2. A non-brittle rachis mutant, M96-1 (Figure 3B), was induced by sodium azide treatment of the wild barley accession OUH602 (Figure 3A) and proved to be a btr1-type based on allelic testing (Table S3). The M96-1 sequence (GenBank: KR813811) harbors a C-to-T transition at position +466 relative to the OUH602 sequence, which introduces a stop codon and results in a transcript with a truncated ORF1 encoding a 155 amino acid residue protein. In the M96-1 mutant, the dispersal units remain attached to one another at maturity (Figure 3B). In the brittle rachis line OUH602, toluidine blue staining of rachis sections at the anthesis stage revealed that five to six cell layers are expanded above each rachis node (Figure 3C), whereas no such expansion is visible in M96-1 (Figure 3D). Disarticulation occurs at the so-called “constriction groove” (Ubisch, 1915Ubisch G. Analyse eines Falles von Bastardatavismus und Faktorenkoppelung bei Gerste.Z Indukt Abstammungs Vererbungsl. 1915; 14: 226-237Google Scholar) immediately below this expanded region (Figures 3C and 1B), although this region is not physically constricted. The thickness of the cell walls in the wild barley OUH602 separation layer is ∼25% of those in the M96-1 equivalent cells (Figures 3E, 3F, S3A, and S3B) with the thicknesses of both primary and secondary walls appearing to be greatly reduced (compare Figures 3E and 3F); the thin cell walls collapse at maturity, resulting in disarticulation across the plane of the cell wall that is marked by a smooth disarticulation scar (Figure 3G). In M96-1, detaching the grains from the rachis node requires the application of considerable force, which results in the formation of a rough, jagged disarticulation scar (Figure 3H). Fluorescence-based immunocytochemical studies using specific antibodies against cell wall polysaccharides revealed no significant differences in levels of heteroxylan, (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, pectic polysaccharides, or cellulose in the disarticulation zones of both brittle and non-brittle rachis barley lines (Figures S3C–S3N). Furthermore, no reduction in lignin content was apparent in the separation layers (Figure 3M), in contrast to other cereal taxa (e.g., Oryza, Bromus, Agropyron, Elymus), where disarticulation is associated with an apparent reduction in lignin content in the disarticulation layer (Figures 3I–3L), at least using the acridine orange stain. In situ RNA hybridization experiments demonstrated that Btr2 transcription is localized to within a few cell layers at the rachis node (Figures 3N and 3O), exactly where the five or six layers of cells mentioned previously expand to form the separation layer. This data is consistent with Btr2 expression playing a key role in the spatial determination of the disarticulation cell layer above the rachis nodes. While functionally related, Btr1 and Btr2 share no significant similarity with one another at either the nucleic acid or the peptide sequence level, consistent with the hypothesis that they are complementary dominant genes (Takahashi and Hayashi, 1964Takahashi R. Hayashi J. Linkage study of two complementary genes for brittle rachis in barley.Ber. Ohara Inst. Landwirtsch Biol. Okayama Univ. 1964; 12: 99-105Google Scholar). BLASTing BTR1 and BTR2 against the National Center for Biotechnology Information nr database revealed no hits within the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) using the default Expect (E)-value of 0.01. Secondary structure prediction by SOSUI (Hirokawa et al., 1998Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. SOSUI: classification and secondary structure prediction system for membrane proteins.Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) databases predicted two lipophilic regions in BTR1, suggesting it might be a membrane-bound protein. In contrast, BTR2 was predicted to be a soluble protein. The BTR2 protein showed limited similarity with CAR and PIP motifs present in the IDA protein encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION gene, but BTR2 and IDA are not considered homologs because the amino acid similarity covers only a short region containing the CAR and PIP motifs. Re-sequencing the btr1 and btr2 regions in a large panel of wild and cultivated barleys showed that the two transmembrane domains in BTR1, and the CAR and PIP motifs in BTR2, are fully conserved (Figures S4A and S4B). BLAST searches of the BTR1 and BTR2 sequences against the current barley genome assembly detected homology with two further hypothetical proteins, that we term BTR1-LIKE and BTR2-LIKE (Figures 4A and 4B ). Btr1-like and Btr2-like genes lie in a head-to-head orientation with respect to one another, separated by just 400 bp and their location is only 103 kb away from Btr2 in the wild barley OUH602 (Figure 1G). Other than those in Figure 1G, we could not detect any further Btr and Btr-like sequences in cv. Morex, based on the currently available barley genome sequence. This genomic configuration is consistent with Btr1/Btr2 and Btr1-like/Btr2-like representing the product of a duplication event involving an ancestral gene pair. Dot-plot analysis supports this hypothesis (Figures S1A and S1B). Btr1 and Btr2 are separated from one another in Morex by 88 kb, by 111 kb in OUH602, and by 118 kb in cv. Haruna Nijo (Figure 1G). The greater separation between Btr1 and Btr2 compared to Btr1-like and Btr2-like appears to be the result of nested retrotransposon insertions (Figures S1C and S1D). The Btr and Btr-like genes duplication was detected in the wheat A genome as well (Figure 4A). The Btr duplications present in rice are independent from these of barley and wheat (Figure 4A), implying that this local gene duplication event occurred post separation of the Pooideae and Ehrhartoideae lineages some 40–53 million years ago (Aliscioni et al., 2012Aliscioni S.

Despite their sequence similarity, there was no evidence of any transmembrane helices or ligand motifs in either BTR1-LIKE, BTR2-LIKE or any of their homologs in related cereals (Figure 4A). Neither Btr1-like nor Btr2-like are functional paralogs of Btr1 or Btr2 as they are unable to complement btr1 or btr2 in barley cultivars. Furthermore, there are very pronounced differences of expression between Btr1 and Btr1-like in spike development stages 1 to 5 and between Btr2 and Btr2-like in stage 4 (Figure 4C). Collectively, these features suggest that Btr and Btr-like genes diverged functionally after a duplication event that occurred specifically in the Pooideae lineage. This divergence may have occurred during the evolution of the Triticeae as suggested earlier (Sakuma et al., 2011Sakuma S. Salomon B. Komatsuda T. The domestication syndrome genes responsible for the major changes in plant form in the Triticeae crops.Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 738-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A series of test hybrids was generated to reveal the genotype of 274 barley cultivars in a world core collection (Table S5). The btr1 tester was cv. KNG and the btr2 tester was RIL50. Scoring for brittle rachis in the hybrids revealed that 130 of the cultivars were btr1 and 123 were Btr1 (Figure 5A) and the remaining 21 cultivars could not be phenotyped because no F1 plants were obtained. The btr1-type cultivars are widely distributed but are found at higher frequency in European and Middle Eastern barleys compared with those from East Asia (Figure 5B). Re-sequencing the 2.4-kb stretch of DNA spanning the locus (Table S2) revealed that all of the btr1 lines carried the 1-bp deletion present in cv. KNG, while none of the Btr1 carriers carried this mutation (Table S5). While this further supports the hypothesis that the 1-bp deletion is responsible for the non-brittle rachis phenotype, it also indicates that the btr1 allele is monophyletic (Figure 5C). The equivalent test for btr2 revealed that 124 of the cultivars carried btr2 and 129 Btr2 (Figure 5A). The remaining 21 cultivars could not be phenotyped because no F1 plants were obtained. The btr2-type cultivars are distributed mainly in East Asia but also in North Africa (Figure 5B). Re-sequencing the key 4.9-kb interval (Table S2) showed that all of the btr2 lines carried the 11-bp deletion (Table S5). No Btr2 lines carried this deletion. We conclude that the 11-bp deletion is responsible for the non-brittle rachis in btr2 lines and that this btr2 allele is also monophyletic (Figure 5D). An examination of sequence diversity at both loci, covering cultivated barley and a geo-referenced set of wild barley accessions representative of the geographical range of the species (Tables S5, S6, and S7), was based on a concatenated Btr1/Btr2 sequence template. A total of 232 haplotypes was represented among 343 wild barley accessions and 53 among 267 domesticated cultivars (Table S4).

The human pluripotent stem cell state is facilitated by an intricate regulatory network controlled chiefly by master transcription factors (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. et al.Core transcriptional regulatory circuitry in human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar). These master regulators form multiple regulatory connections with other transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, signal transduction pathways, non-coding RNAs, and other regulators that, together, maintain self-renewal and pluripotency (Ng and Surani, 2011Ng H.H.

Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Sustenance of this internal regulatory network is dependent on external cues from the cell culture environment. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) mainly rely on the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and Activin/transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways for self-renewal (Beattie et al., 2005Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Bucay N. Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A.

Basic fibroblast growth factor supports undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell growth without conditioned medium.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of these signaling pathways causes the shutdown of the complex hESC regulatory network; we call this process pluripotent state dissolution (PSD). Because many applications of hESCs require their complete and efficient differentiation, it is necessary to obtain detailed knowledge of how the hESC regulatory network is dissolved during differentiation. However, because the maintenance of the pluripotent state requires multiple interactions between regulatory pathways and factors, the dissolution of such a state is likely to be an equally complex process with multiple routes from which it can be enforced. Although several studies have identified regulators of PSD in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Betschinger et al., 2013Betschinger J. Nichols J. Dietmann S. Corrin P.D. Paddison P.J. Smith A. Exit from pluripotency is gated by intracellular redistribution of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3.Cell. 2013; 153: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2011Guo G. Huang Y. Humphreys P. Wang X. Smith A. A PiggyBac-based recessive screening method to identify pluripotency regulators.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), there is a lack of knowledge about how PSD is regulated in hESCs. Systematic studies like high-throughput functional genomics assays have greatly advanced the knowledge about the regulatory networks of ESCs. The unbiased nature of functional genomics makes it a powerful discovery tool for the identification of key protein complexes and pathways by detecting multiple crucial hits from the same pathway or complex. However, for hESCs, most studies rely on expanding the hESC regulatory network using previously known factors, and, to date, only one arrayed high-throughput functional genomics study has been performed in hESCs (Chia et al., 2010Chia N.Y. Chan Y.S. Feng B. Lu X. Orlov Y.L. Moreau D. Kumar P. Yang L. Jiang J. Lau M.S. et al.A genome-wide RNAi screen reveals determinants of human embryonic stem cell identity.Nature. 2010; 468: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a lack of knowledge in the molecular understanding of the regulatory network that governs PSD of hESCs. To address this deficiency, we undertook a large-scale high-throughput RNAi screen in differentiating hESCs for the de novo identification of the molecular pathways regulating PSD. To be comprehensive in dissecting PSD, we probed five differentiation conditions to discover both context-dependent and universal gatekeepers. Strikingly, we found a strong enrichment of cell-cycle hits clustering specifically in S and G2 phases but not in other phases of the cell cycle. Genetic and chemical manipulations of cell-cycle progression established an intrinsic propensity toward pluripotency maintenance in S and G2 phases, enacted by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATR-mediated replication checkpoint and Cyclin B1 pathways. Our study reveals a link that hardwires the hESC pluripotency network to the cell-cycle machinery, where S and G2 phase-specific pathways deterministically restrict PSD and the absence of such pathways at G1 phase could permit PSD. The process of ESC differentiation can be conceptually subdivided into two major steps: PSD, where the transcriptional network of pluripotency is shut down, and lineage specification, where a new transcriptional program corresponding to a specific somatic lineage is assembled. Although the regulation of lineage specification could differ greatly differ between different lineages, PSD is an early event for the ESC differentiation process. To obtain evidence that PSD is distinct from lineage specification, we looked at the expression kinetics of pluripotency and lineage-specific genes upon withdrawal of the self-renewal factors bFGF and TGF-β. 48 hr after induction of differentiation, the downregulation of many hESC-specific genes (Assou et al., 2007Assou S. Le Carrour T. Tondeur S. Ström S. Gabelle A. Marty S. Nadal L. Pantesco V. Réme T. Hugnot J.P. et al.A meta-analysis of human embryonic stem cells transcriptome integrated into a web-based expression atlas.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) began (Figure S1A), but the upregulation of lineage-specific factor expression was only evident at 96 hr (Figure S1B). An examination of gene expression of single cells showed similar results (Figure S1C). Therefore, these data indicate that PSD occurs immediately at the onset of differentiation, distinct from lineage specification (Figure S1D). Because NANOG is decreased significantly at both early and late time points (Figure S1A), we assigned NANOG downregulation as a marker for PSD and created a NANOG-GFP hESC line as a reporter of PSD (Figures S1E–S1H). To achieve robust and unbiased identification of universal and specific factors required for PSD, we carried out a high-throughput RNAi screen under five differentiation conditions (Figure 1A). Under the first condition, we removed the two important cytokines bFGF and TGF-β from hESC medium (Beattie et al., 2005Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Bucay N. Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A. Activin A maintains pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells in the absence of feeder layers.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2005Xu C. Rosler E. Jiang J. Lebkowski J.S. Gold J.D. O’Sullivan C. Delavan-Boorsma K. Mok M. Bronstein A. Carpenter M.K. Basic fibroblast growth factor supports undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell growth without conditioned medium.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Under the second to fourth conditions, we individually perturbed signaling of the TGF-β pathway as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) branches of the bFGF pathway. Under the fifth condition, we introduced retinoic acid (RA), a potent inducer of differentiation. All conditions led to PSD, as indicated by the efficient loss of hESC identity (Figures S1I–S1K). Cells were transfected with siRNAs 24 hr before induction of differentiation. The degree of preservation of hESC identity was then measured through the average NANOG-GFP fluorescence intensity per cell; hESCs depleted of PSD effectors are expected to retain higher GFP signals. We screened a total of 4,558 genes in triplicate for all five conditions, summing up to 68,370 data points (Table S1). We first ensured the quality of the screen by checking for intra-plate layout effects (Figure 1B; Figure S2A), proper inter-plate alignment (Figure S2B), and good correlation between replicates (Figure 1C; Figure S2C). Genes that reproducibly scored above noise (z > 1.25 or z > 1.5 in at least two replicates) were regarded as hits (Figure 1D). Hits obtained were observed to maintain a visible GFP signal (Figure 1E). We detected no cell number bias in hit selection (Figure S2D), eliminating the possibility that housekeeping genes could be misidentified as hits. We further conducted counter-screens using a hESC line harboring an ACTIN-GFP reporter (Table S2) and found no overlap with the NANOG-GFP hits (Figure S2E). Collectively, these results ascertain that the RNAi screen identified genes important for PSD rigorously and reliably. The screen was designed to enable the identification of both context-dependent and universally important processes that regulate PSD (Figure 2A). We examined the hits from the five distinct conditions using protein interaction network (Figure 2B), Reactome (Table S3), and gene ontology (Table S4) analyses to look for context-dependent effectors of PSD. First, we observed that the hits included factors that are associated with the primary pathways transducing the distinct initial differentiation cues. These include the repressors SKI and SKIL for TGF-β inhibition (Figure 2B), the ERK2 inactivator DUSP6 for MEK inhibition (Table S1), and the RA receptor RXRA and the transcriptional complexes RNA polymerase II and transcription factor II D (TFIID)/Mediator for +RA (Figure 2B; Table S1). This is reassuring because perturbation of these primary pathways is expected to nullify the differentiation-inducing effect stemming from the same pathway, demonstrating the robustness of the high-throughput screening assay. Interestingly, the RNA splicing machinery seems to play a role in PSD, especially during RA addition and MEK inhibition (Tables S3 and S4). This is notable because, although multiple RNA splicing factors have been reported to control the pluripotent state of hESCs (Gabut et al., 2011Gabut M. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Wang X. Slobodeniuc V. O’Hanlon D. Sung H.K. Alvarez M. Talukder S. Pan Q.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it has been unknown whether they also regulate its dissolution. RNA splicing has been shown in other cell types to interact with the MEK and RA pathways (Shilo et al., 2014Shilo A. Ben Hur V. Denichenko P. Stein I. Pikarsky E. Rauch J. Kolch W. Zender L. Karni R.

Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. Role of Acinus in regulating retinoic acid-responsive gene pre-mRNA splicing.J. Cell. Physiol. 2015; 230: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms might be in place in hESCs, explaining why RNA splicing could affect PSD triggered specifically by MEK inhibition or RA introduction. Our study therefore opens the door for studying the crosstalk between the splicing machinery, PSD, and these developmental pathways. Besides RNA splicing, studying the functional genetics of PSD further revealed novel nodes of contact between signaling pathways and pluripotency. For example, we observed an enrichment of nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex members under conditions where bFGF-MEK signaling is abolished (Figure 2B; Table S4). The NuRD complex has an established role in promoting PSD in mESCs (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Latos P.

Kalkan T. et al.NuRD suppresses pluripotency gene expression to promote transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and our results demonstrate the conservation of this function in hESCs. Interestingly, although the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-Stat3 pathway opposes the action of the NuRD complex in mESCs (Hu and Wade, 2012Hu G. Wade P.A. NuRD and pluripotency: a complex balancing act.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), this role seems to be assumed by the bFGF-MEK pathway in hESCs. On the other hand, a strong enrichment of histone demethylases, specifically those targeting histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), was observed under the PI3K pathway inhibition condition (Figure 2B; Tables S3 and S4). This points toward an epigenetic link between the PI3K pathway and the pluripotency network through the maintenance of activating H3K4 methylation marks. Finally, we noticed that developmental pathways play highly context-dependent roles in PSD. For instance, Wnt signaling-associated factors, particularly those regulating β-catenin-mediated transcription, were enriched in hits during inactive bFGF-MEK signaling (Figure 2B; Tables S3 and S4). This is in agreement with the identified cross-regulation between these two pathways (Ding et al., 2005Ding Q. Xia W. Liu J.C. Yang J.Y. Lee D.F. Xia J. Bartholomeusz G. Li Y. Pan Y. Li Z. et al.Erk associates with and primes GSK-3beta for its inactivation resulting in upregulation of beta-catenin.Mol.

On the other hand, negative regulators of the PI3K pathway are enriched under the −bFGF, −TGFβ condition (Table S3), whereas positive regulators are enriched under the +RA condition (Figure 2B; Table S3). The PI3K pathway therefore seems to help uphold pluripotency in hESCs (Figures S1I–S1K) in coordination with both the bFGF and TGFβ pathways (Singh et al., 2012Singh A.M. Reynolds D. Cliff T. Ohtsuka S. Mattheyses A.L. Sun Y. Menendez L. Kulik M. Dalton S.

These results emphasize the importance of studying the role of developmental pathways in the proper context. Therefore, separate analyses of the various screening conditions demonstrate the robustness of our screen results in addition to identifying context-dependent processes that are crucial for PSD. Hierarchical clustering of the results from the five conditions revealed that the +RA condition is excluded from a tight cluster comprising the other four conditions (Figure 2C). This was conceivable given that the +RA condition introduces a differentiation signal in contrast to the withdrawal of self-renewal signals under the other four conditions. Therefore, we next performed a combined analysis of the four clustering conditions (Figures 2D–2F) to find central pathways that are important for PSD induced by the removal of self-renewal signals. The combined analysis identified members of multiple chromatin-modifying complexes important for PSD. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex proteins appear to be top hits (Figures 2D–2F), most prominently those that belong to Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA)-type (TATA-binding protein-free TAF-containing complex [TFTC]/SPT3-TAF9-GCN5-acetylase complex [STAGA]) and TIP60 (NuA4) HAT complexes. Strikingly, the catalytic subunit of the TIP60 complex KAT5 is among the top five hits of all four conditions (Table S1), underlining the importance of this complex in PSD. Although histone acetylation levels are known to be higher in undifferentiated ESCs (Legartová et al., 2014Legartová S. Kozubek S. Franek M. Zdráhal Z. Lochmanová G. Martinet N. Bártová E. Cell differentiation along multiple pathways accompanied by changes in histone acetylation status.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a global but transient increase in histone acetylation occurs during PSD (Golob et al., 2008Golob J.L. Paige S.L. Muskheli V. Pabon L. Murry C.E. Chromatin remodeling during mouse and human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), potentially necessitating the activity of HAT complexes at the onset of PSD. Nucleosome remodeling is also essential because knockdown of multiple Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) family members prevented efficient downregulation of NANOG in differentiating hESCs (Figures 2D and 2F). Notably, certain members of these complexes, such as Trrap of the NuA4 complex and Arid1a of the SWI/SNF complex, have a conserved function in shutting down pluripotency in ground-state mESCs (Betschinger et al., 2013Betschinger J. Nichols J. Dietmann S. Corrin P.D. Paddison P.J. Smith A. Exit from pluripotency is gated by intracellular redistribution of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3.Cell. 2013; 153: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, our study systematically highlights the importance of epigenetic regulations in the PSD of hESCs. Besides epigenetic modifiers, our combined analysis also revealed that genes involved in cell-cycle regulation were among the most enriched (Figures 2D–2F), particularly those that are involved in DNA replication during S phase or in G2-to-M transition (Figures 2D and 2E). On the contrary, we found no strong enrichment of processes specific to other phases of the cell cycle, implying that specific cell-cycle regulations influence the cell fate transitions of pluripotent cells. Although the cell cycle has been found to influence cell fate decisions in perspectives other than proliferation (Lee et al., 2014Lee Y. Dominy J.E. Choi Y.J. Jurczak M. Tolliday N. Camporez J.P. Chim H. Lim J.H. Ruan H.B.

Coppé J.P. Patil C.K. Hoeijmakers W.A. Muñoz D.P. Raza S.R. Freund A. Campeau E. Davalos A.R. Campisi J. Persistent DNA damage signalling triggers senescence-associated inflammatory cytokine secretion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), knowledge about the regulation of PSD by the cell cycle is limited, especially for G1-independent cell-cycle states such as S and G2 phases. To explore this topic, we first functionally validated the effect of cell-cycle genes in PSD by impeding DNA replication or prolonging the gap phases using both genetic and chemical approaches (Figure 3A). Genetic validation of the S- and G2-associated hits confirmed that their depletion (Figures S3A and S3B) impedes pluripotency gene downregulation after removal of self-renewal signals (Figures 3B and 3C). Because their depletion concomitantly perturbs progression through the cell cycle (Figures S3C and S3D), these results suggest that extending the S and G2 phases of the hES cell cycle may dominantly impede PSD. In contrast, although lengthening of G1 phase is associated with differentiation, artificially extending G1 phase by knocking down CDK4/6, depleting Cyclin D, or overexpressing the CDK inhibitor p21 (Figures S3E–S3G) did not significantly affect the downregulation of pluripotency markers upon removal of self-renewal signals (Figure 3D). These findings suggest that the lengthening of G1 phase does not elicit a deterministic effect on PSD of hESCs. NANOG-GFP fluorescence was also preserved (Figure S3H), and differentiation marker upregulation was inhibited (Figures S3I–S3K) upon knockdown of S and G2 phase progression genes but not upon G1 phase prolongation, corresponding with the observed changes in pluripotency marker expression. Because depletion of cell-cycle-related hits impeded S and G2 phase progression, we next validated whether direct manipulation of these cell-cycle phases using chemical inhibitors can similarly affect PSD. With proper dosage, we managed to enrich, but not completely arrest, hESCs in specific cell-cycle phases (Figure S4A) without inducing extensive apoptosis (Figures S4B and S4C). In concordance with our screen results, we found that perturbing DNA replication in S phase as well as delaying mitotic transition from G2 phase consistently deterred PSD in different hESC lines (Figure 3E; Figures S4D–S4G). In contrast, inhibitors that led to an elongation of G1 and M phases did not exhibit PSD attenuation (Figure 3E; Figures S4D–S4G), proving that restriction of PSD is not conferred by simply locking cell-cycle progression. Importantly, these observed changes in marker expression ultimately influenced the functional pluripotency of hESCs (Figure 3F). Because cell-cycle manipulations in ESCs inevitably lead to a certain degree of cell death (Ruiz et al., 2011Ruiz S. Panopoulos A.D. Herrerías A. Bissig K.D. Lutz M. Berggren W.T. Verma I.M. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. A high proliferation rate is required for cell reprogramming and maintenance of human embryonic stem cell identity.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 45-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar; Figures S4B and S4C), we wanted to ascertain that the effects of cell-cycle perturbation on PSD are not just a secondary effect of cell death. We observed that the levels of induced cell death did not correlate with the effects of cell-cycle perturbation on PSD (Figure S4H). Additionally, inhibition of apoptosis during perturbation of S or G2 phase did not alter the observed delay in PSD (Figure S4I). These findings collectively indicate that the effects of cell-cycle perturbation on PSD are independent of cell death. Together, these data demonstrate that the cell cycle can dominantly influence PSD. More importantly, these results also indicate that resistance to PSD is potentially mediated by specific cell-cycle events in S and G2 phases. G1 phase of the cell cycle has been correlated to susceptibility to differentiation, attributed to a higher expression of differentiation markers (Singh et al., 2013Singh A.M. Chappell J. Trost R. Lin L. Wang T. Tang J. Matlock B.K. Weller K.P. Wu H.

Vallier L. The cell-cycle state of stem cells determines cell fate propensity.Cell. 2013; 155: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because the reduction in proportion of cells in G1 phase was observed when we delayed progression in the S and G2 phases (Figures S3C and S3D and S4A), it can be argued that the resulting PSD block could be an indirect effect of an inaccessibility to G1 phase or G1-associated factors that initiate differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we first measured the actual time cells spend in G1 and S/G2 phases using the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI) reporter (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T. Miyoshi H. et al.Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Although hESCs spent more time in S/G2 phase when we interfered with DNA replication and G2 phase progression, the absolute time in G1 phase remained largely unchanged (Figure 4A). However, the collective time spent in G1 phase was still decreased when we allowed the cells to differentiate for the same period of time (Figure 4B). Therefore, we measured pluripotency marker expression after an equal number of cell divisions in untreated and cell-cycle-perturbed hESCs (Figure 4C). In these experiments, we observed that PSD was still attenuated in hESCs with delayed S or G2 phase progression (Figure 4C), ruling out the possibility that the restriction of PSD could be a result of G1 phase inaccessibility. We next checked whether the expression levels of G1 phase-specific factors that are implicated in differentiation were decreased. Neither CDK inhibitors, such as p21 and p27, nor Cyclin D were downregulated upon knockdown of S or G2 phase-related hits (Figure 4D). In fact, the protein levels of these G1-associated factors were increased slightly, indicating that the consequent prevention of PSD is definitely not due to an unavailability of G1-associated lineage specification factors. Because delayed PSD could not be explained via the length of G1 phase or by its associated factors, this phenome"
https://openalex.org/W1649199697,"We have used both a rat orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model and a mouse allograft tumor model to study liver tumor ablation with nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF). We confirm that nsPEF treatment triggers apoptosis in rat liver tumor cells as indicated by the appearance of cleaved caspase 3 and 9 within two hours after treatment. Furthermore we provide evidence that nsPEF treatment leads to the translocation of calreticulin (CRT) to the cell surface which is considered a damage-associated molecular pattern indicative of immunogenic cell death. We provide direct evidence that nanoelectroablation triggers a CD8-dependent inhibition of secondary tumor growth by comparing the growth rate of secondary orthotopic liver tumors in nsPEF-treated rats with that in nsPEF-treated rats depleted of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. The growth of these secondary tumors was severely inhibited as compared to tumor growth in CD8-depleated rats, with their average size only 3% of the primary tumor size after the same one-week growth period. In contrast, when we depleted CD8+ T-cells the second tumor grew more robustly, reaching 54% of the size of the first tumor. In addition, we demonstrate with immunohistochemistry that CD8+ T-cells are highly enriched in the secondary tumors exhibiting slow growth. We also showed that vaccinating mice with nsPEF-treated isogenic tumor cells stimulates an immune response that inhibits the growth of secondary tumors in a CD8+-dependent manner. We conclude that nanoelectroablation triggers the production of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells resulting in the inhibition of secondary tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1018056124,"Microglia are activated quickly in response to external pathogens or cell debris and clear these substances via the inflammatory response. However, excessive activation of microglia can be harmful to host cells due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is reportedly induced under various inflammatory conditions in the central nervous system. We herein demonstrated that activated microglia strongly express SOD2 and examined the role of SOD2, focusing on regulation of the microglial activity and the susceptibility of microglia to oxidative stress. When rat primary microglia were treated with LPS, poly(I:C), peptidoglycan, or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, respectively, the mRNA and protein levels of SOD2 largely increased. However, an increased expression of SOD2 was not detected in the primary neurons or astrocytes, indicating that SOD2 is specifically induced in microglia under inflammatory conditions. The activated microglia showed high tolerance to oxidative stress, whereas SOD2 knockdown conferred vulnerability to oxidative stress. Interestingly, the production of proinflammatory cytokines was increased in the activated microglia treated with SOD2 siRNA compared with that observed in the control siRNA-treated cells. Pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, decreased in not only reactive oxygen species generation but also the proinflammatory cytokine expression. Notably, SOD2 knockdown largely potentiated the nuclear factor κB activity in the activated microglia. Taken together, increased SOD2 conferred tolerance to oxidative stress in the microglia and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production by attenuating the nuclear factor κB activity. Therefore, SOD2 might regulate neuroinflammation by controlling the microglial activities."
https://openalex.org/W1883584681,"We identified a dominant missense mutation in the SCN transcription factor Zfhx3, termed short circuit (Zfhx3Sci), which accelerates circadian locomotor rhythms in mice. ZFHX3 regulates transcription via direct interaction with predicted AT motifs in target genes. The mutant protein has a decreased ability to activate consensus AT motifs in vitro. Using RNA sequencing, we found minimal effects on core clock genes in Zfhx3Sci/+ SCN, whereas the expression of neuropeptides critical for SCN intercellular signaling was significantly disturbed. Moreover, mutant ZFHX3 had a decreased ability to activate AT motifs in the promoters of these neuropeptide genes. Lentiviral transduction of SCN slices showed that the ZFHX3-mediated activation of AT motifs is circadian, with decreased amplitude and robustness of these oscillations in Zfhx3Sci/+ SCN slices. In conclusion, by cloning Zfhx3Sci, we have uncovered a circadian transcriptional axis that determines the period and robustness of behavioral and SCN molecular rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W1956897052,"Landscape heterogeneity is regarded as a key factor for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in production landscapes. We investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the 200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover, species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also influenced species composition of bats and species richness of functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function in agricultural landscapes."

https://openalex.org/W1787940529,"The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells can lead to cancer recurrence in a permissive cell-microenvironment interplay, promoting invasion in glioblastoma (GBM) and neuroblastoma (NB). Extracellular matrix (ECM) small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) play multiple roles in tissue homeostasis by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Due to their pan-inhibitory properties against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), SLRPs are reported to exert anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. However, their roles seem to be tissue-specific and they are also involved in cancer cell migration and drug resistance, paving the way to complex different scenarios. The aim of this study was to determine whether the SLRPs decorin (DCN) and lumican (LUM) are recruited in cell plasticity and microenvironmental adaptation of differentiated cancer cells induced towards stem-like phenotype. Floating neurospheres were generated by applying CSC enrichment medium (neural stem cell serum-free medium, NSC SFM) to the established SF-268 and SK-N-SH cancer cell lines, cellular models of GBM and NB, respectively. In both models, the time-dependent synergistic activation of DCN and LUM was observed. The highest DCN and LUM mRNA/protein expression was detected after cell exposure to NSC SFM for 8/12 days, considering these cells as SLRP-expressing (SLRP+) CSC-like. Ultrastructural imaging showed the cellular heterogeneity of both the GBM and NB neurospheres and identified the inner living cells. Parental cell lines of both GBM and NB grew only in soft agar + NSC SFM, whereas the secondary neurospheres (originated from SLRP+ t8 CSC-like) showed lower proliferation rates than primary neurospheres. Interestingly, the SLRP+ CSC-like from the GBM and NB neurospheres were resistant to temozolomide (TMZ) at concentrations >750 μM. Our results suggest that GBM and NB CSC-like promote the activation of huge quantities of SLRP in response to CSC enrichment, simultaneously acquiring TMZ resistance, cellular heterogeneity, and a quiescent phenotype, suggesting a novel pivotal role for SLRP in drug resistance and cell plasticity of CSC-like, allowing cell survival and ECM/niche modulation potential."
https://openalex.org/W1491965167,"PACT is a stress-modulated activator of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). Stress-induced phosphorylation of PACT is essential for PACT's association with PKR leading to PKR activation. PKR activation leads to phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis. A recessively inherited form of early-onset dystonia DYT16 has been recently identified to arise due to a homozygous missense mutation P222L in PACT. To examine if the mutant P222L protein alters the stress-response pathway, we examined the ability of mutant P222L to interact with and activate PKR. Our results indicate that the substitution mutant P222L activates PKR more robustly and for longer duration albeit with slower kinetics in response to the endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the affinity of PACT-PACT and PACT-PKR interactions is enhanced in dystonia patient lymphoblasts, thereby leading to intensified PKR activation and enhanced cellular death. P222L mutation also changes the affinity of PACT-TRBP interaction after cellular stress, thereby offering a mechanism for the delayed PKR activation in response to stress. Our results demonstrate the impact of a dystonia-causing substitution mutation on stress-induced cellular apoptosis."

We sought to (1) better understand optic nerve head (ONH) structure and anterior lamina cribrosa surface (ALCS) microarchitecture between fellow eyes of living, normal non-human primates and (2) characterize the time-course of in vivo structural changes in the ONH, ALCS microarchitecture, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) in non-human primate eyes with early experimental glaucoma (EG). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) images of the ONH were acquired cross-sectionally in six bilaterally normal rhesus monkeys, and before and approximately every two weeks after inducing unilateral EG in seven rhesus monkeys. ONH parameters and RNFLT were quantified from segmented SDOCT images. Mean ALCS pore area, elongation and nearest neighbor distance (NND) were quantified globally, in sectors and regionally from adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope images. In bilaterally normal monkeys, ONH parameters were similar between fellow eyes with few inter-eye differences in ALCS pore parameters. In EG monkeys, an increase in mean ALCS Depth (ALCSD) was the first structural change measured in 6 of 7 EG eyes. A decrease in mean minimum rim width (MRW) simultaneously accompanied this early change in 4 of 6 EG eyes and was the first structural change in the 7th EG eye. Mean ALCS pore parameters were among the first or second changes measured in 4 EG eyes. Mean ALCS pore area and NND increased in superotemporal and temporal sectors and in central and peripheral regions at the first time-point of change in ALCS pore geometry. RNFLT and/or mean ALCS radius of curvature were typically the last parameters to initially change. Survival analyses found mean ALCSD was the only parameter to significantly show an initial change prior to the first measured loss in RNFLT across EG eyes."

At present there is no pharmacological treatment that successfully reverses muscle wasting from catabolic conditions. We hypothesized that acupuncture plus low frequency electric stimulation (Acu-LFES) would mimic the impact of exercise and prevent diabetes-induced muscle loss. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in mice. The mice were then treated with Acu-LFES for 15 minutes daily for 14 days. Acupuncture points were selected according to the WHO Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature guide. The needles were connected to an SDZ-II electronic acupuncture device delivering pulses at 20Hz and 1mA. Acu-LFES prevented soleus and EDL muscle weight loss and increased hind-limb muscle grip function in diabetic mice. Muscle regeneration capacity was significantly increased by Acu-LFES. The expression of Pax7, MyoD, myogenin and embryo myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) was significantly decreased in diabetic muscle vs. control muscle. The suppressed levels in diabetic muscle were reversed by Acu-LFES. The IGF-1 signaling pathway was also upregulated by Acu-LFES. Phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and p70S6K were downregulated by diabetes leading to a decline in muscle mass, however, Acu-LFES countered the diabetes-induced decline. In addition, microRNA-1 and -206 were increased by Acu-LFES after 24 days of treatment. We conclude that Acu-LFES is effective in counteracting diabetes-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by increasing IGF-1 and its stimulation of muscle regeneration."

The levels of plasma IL-21 in all patients and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-21 in some MS patients and controls with non-inflammatory neuronal diseases (NND) were measured by ELISA.In comparison with that in the HC, the numbers of circulating CD3+CD4+CXCR5+CD45RA-, ICOS+, CCR7+ and CCR7+ICOS+ memory Tfh cells and the levels of plasma IL-21 significantly increased in MS patients, but significantly decreased in the patients with complete remission (CR). The levels of CSF IL-21 were significantly higher in the MS patients than that in the NND patients. The numbers of CCR7+ICOS+ memory Tfh cells were positively correlated with the EDSS scores, the levels of plasma and CSF IL-21, IgG, MBP-Ab or MOG-Ab.Our findings indicated that circulating memory Tfh cells, especially CCR7+ICOS+ memory Tfh cells, may be associated with the relapse of MS and may serve as a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1646727285,"Increasing children's physical activity at school is a national focus in the U.S. to address childhood obesity. While research has demonstrated associations between aspects of school environments and students' physical activity, the literature currently lacks a synthesis of evidence to serve as a practical, spatially-organized resource for school designers and decision-makers, as well as to point to pertinent research opportunities. This paper describes the development of a new practical tool: Physical Activity Design Guidelines for School Architecture. Its aims are to provide architects and designers, as well as school planners, educators, and public health professionals, with strategies for making K-12 school environments conducive to healthy physical activity, and to engage scientists in transdisciplinary perspectives toward improved knowledge of the school environment's impact. We used a qualitative review process to develop evidence-based and theory-driven school design guidelines that promote increased physical activity among students. The design guidelines include specific strategies in 10 school design domains. Implementation of the guidelines is expected to enable students to adopt healthier physical activity behaviors. The tool bridges a translational gap between research and environmental design practice, and may contribute to setting new industry and education standards."
https://openalex.org/W1955899532,"The immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) thalidomide and its structural analogs lenalidomide and pomalidomide are highly effective in treating clinical indications. Thalidomide binds to cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the cullin-4 really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligase complex. Here, we examine the effect of thalidomide and its analogs on CRBN ubiquitination and its functions in human cell lines. We find that the ubiquitin modification of CRBN includes K48-linked polyubiquitin chains and that thalidomide blocks the formation of CRBN-ubiquitin conjugates. Furthermore, we show that ubiquitinated CRBN is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Treatment of human myeloma cell lines such as MM1.S, OPM2, and U266 with thalidomide (100 μM) and its structural analog lenalidomide (10 μM) results in stabilization of CRBN and elevation of CRBN protein levels. This in turn leads to the reduced level of CRBN target proteins and enhances the sensitivity of human multiple myeloma cells to IMiDs. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which thalidomide and its analogs modulate the CRBN function in cells. Through inhibition of CRBN ubiquitination, thalidomide and its analogs allow CRBN to accumulate, leading to the increased cullin-4 RING E3 ligase-mediated degradation of target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1955042011,"Saving energy is an important pillar for the mitigation of climate change. Electric devices (e.g., freezer and television) are an important player in the residential sector in the final demand for energy. Consumers' purchase decisions are therefore crucial to successfully reach the energy-efficiency goals. Putting energy labels on products is often considered an adequate way of empowering consumers to make informed purchase decisions. Consequently, this approach should contribute to reducing overall energy consumption. The effectiveness of its measurement depends on consumers' use and interpretation of the information provided. Despite advances in energy efficiency and a mandatory labeling policy, final energy consumption per capita is in many countries still increasing. This paper provides a systematic analysis of consumers' reactions to one of the most widely used eco-labels, the European Union (EU) energy label, by using eye-tracking methodology as an objective measurement. The study's results partially support the EU's mandatory policy, showing that the energy label triggers attention toward energy information in general. However, the energy label's effect on consumers' actual product choices seems to be rather low. The study's results show that the currently used presentation format on the label is insufficient. The findings suggest that it does not facilitate the integration of energy-related information. Furthermore, the current format can attract consumers to focus more on energy-efficiency information, leading them to disregard information about actual energy consumption. As a result, the final energy consumption may increase because excellent ratings on energy efficiency (e.g., A++) do not automatically imply little consumption. Finally, implications for policymakers and suggestions for further research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1668353575,"Expression of RAD51, a crucial player in homologous recombination (HR) and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is dysregulated in human tumors, and can contribute to genomic instability and tumor progression. To further understand RAD51 regulation we functionally characterized a long non-coding (lnc) RNA, dubbed TODRA (Transcribed in the Opposite Direction of RAD51), transcribed 69bp upstream to RAD51, in the opposite direction. We demonstrate that TODRA is an expressed transcript and that the RAD51 promoter region is bidirectional, supporting TODRA expression (7-fold higher than RAD51 in this assay, p = 0.003). TODRA overexpression in HeLa cells induced expression of TPIP, a member of the TPTE family which includes PTEN. Similar to PTEN, we found that TPIP co-activates E2F1 induction of RAD51. Analysis of E2F1's effect on the bidirectional promoter showed that E2F1 binding to the same site that promotes RAD51 expression, results in downregulation of TODRA. Moreover, TODRA overexpression induces HR in a RAD51-dependent DSB repair assay, and increases formation of DNA damage-induced RAD51-positive foci. Importantly, gene expression in breast tumors supports our finding that E2F1 oppositely regulates RAD51 and TODRA: increased RAD51 expression, which is associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype (e.g. negative correlation with positive ER (r = -0.22, p = 0.02) and positive PR status (r = -0.27, p<0.001); positive correlation with ki67 status (r = 0.36, p = 0.005) and HER2 amplification (r = 0.41, p = 0.001)), correlates as expected with lower TODRA and higher E2F1 expression. However, although E2F1 induction resulted in TPIP downregulation in cell lines, we find that TPIP expression in tumors is not reduced despite higher E2F1 expression, perhaps contributing to increased RAD51 expression. Our results identify TPIP as a novel E2F1 co-activator, suggest a similar role for other TPTEs, and indicate that the TODRA lncRNA affects RAD51 dysregulation and RAD51-dependent DSB repair in malignancy.

We examined quality of care for 2,965 and 4,483 adults (≥ 20 years) with diagnosed type 2 diabetes using fourteen simple and two composite indicators derived from self-reported information. In a subsample for both surveys, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured at the time of the interview. We obtained survey weight-adjusted estimators using multiple regression models (logistic and linear) with combined data files, including survey year as covariate to assess change.Global quality of care in 2012 was 40.8%, with a relative improvement of 11.7% between 2006 and 2012. Detections of cardiovascular disease risk factors (dyslipidemia and hypertension) were the indicators with the highest improvement, while non-pharmaceutical treatment and diabetic foot exams showed minor changes. We found a significant association between the quality of the process of diabetes care and glycemic control (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.63-3.94). Age more than 65 years old, the type of health subsystem, gender (males), and high socio-economic status were also significantly associated to glycemic control.Quality diabetes care and glycemic control improved and are significantly associated.

https://openalex.org/W2338263744,"Hyperglycemia leads to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation and enhances responses to IGF-I. Prior studies showed that hyperglycemia stimulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) synthesis, and IGF-I facilitated its recruitment to a signaling complex where it oxidized src, leading to AKT and MAPK activation. To determine the mechanism that led to these changes, we analyzed the roles of p62 (sequestrosome1) and PKCζ. Hyperglycemia induced a 4.9 ± 1.0-fold increase in p62/PKCζ association, and disruption of PKCζ/p62 using a peptide inhibitor or p62 knockdown reduced PKCζ activation (78 ± 6%). 3-Phosphoinoside—dependent protein kinase 1 was also recruited to the p62 complex and directly phosphorylated PKCζ, leading to its activation (3.1 ± 0.4-fold). Subsequently, activated PKCζ phosphorylated p65 rel, which led to increased Nox4 synthesis. Studies in diabetic mice confirmed these findings (6.0 ± 0.4-fold increase in p62/PKCζ) and their disruption of attenuated Nox4 synthesis (76 ± 9% reduction). PKCζ/p62 activation stimulated inflammatory cytokine production and enhanced IGF-I-stimulated VSMC proliferation. These results define the molecular mechanism by which PKCζ is activated in response to hyperglycemia and suggest that this could be a mechanism by which other stimuli such as cytokines or metabolic stress function to stimulate NF-κB activation, thereby altering VSMC sensitivity to IGF-I.—Xi, G., Shen, X., Wai, C., Vilas, C.

Over 63% of A. baumannii infections occurring in the United States are caused by multidrug resistant isolates, and pan-resistant isolates have begun to emerge that are resistant to all clinically relevant antibiotics. The complement system represents the first line of defense against invading pathogens. However, many A. baumannii isolates, especially those causing severe bacteremia are resistant to complement-mediated killing, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show for the first time that A. baumannii binds host-derived plasminogen and we identify the translation elongation factor Tuf as a moonlighting plasminogen-binding protein that is exposed on the outer surface of A. baumannii. Binding of plasminogen to Tuf is at least partly dependent on lysine residues and ionic interactions. Plasminogen, once bound to Tuf can be converted to active plasmin and proteolytically degrade fibrinogen as well as the key complement component C3b. Thus, Tuf acts as a multifunctional protein that may contribute to virulence of A. baumannii by aiding in dissemination and evasion of the complement system."
https://openalex.org/W1948598933,"Glucan phosphatases are central to the regulation of starch and glycogen metabolism. Plants contain two known glucan phosphatases, Starch EXcess4 (SEX4) and Like Sex Four2 (LSF2), which dephosphorylate starch. Starch is water-insoluble and reversible phosphorylation solubilizes its outer surface allowing processive degradation. Vertebrates contain a single known glucan phosphatase, laforin, that dephosphorylates glycogen. In the absence of laforin, water-soluble glycogen becomes insoluble, leading to the neurodegenerative disorder Lafora Disease. Because of their essential role in starch and glycogen metabolism glucan phosphatases are of significant interest, yet a comparative analysis of their activities against diverse glucan substrates has not been established. We identify active site residues required for specific glucan dephosphorylation, defining a glucan phosphatase signature motif (CζAGΨGR) in the active site loop. We further explore the basis for phosphate position-specific activity of these enzymes and determine that their diverse phosphate position-specific activity is governed by the phosphatase domain. In addition, we find key differences in glucan phosphatase activity toward soluble and insoluble polyglucan substrates, resulting from the participation of ancillary glucan-binding domains. Together, these data provide fundamental insights into the specific activity of glucan phosphatases against diverse polyglucan substrates. Glucan phosphatases are central to the regulation of starch and glycogen metabolism. Plants contain two known glucan phosphatases, Starch EXcess4 (SEX4) and Like Sex Four2 (LSF2), which dephosphorylate starch. Starch is water-insoluble and reversible phosphorylation solubilizes its outer surface allowing processive degradation. Vertebrates contain a single known glucan phosphatase, laforin, that dephosphorylates glycogen. In the absence of laforin, water-soluble glycogen becomes insoluble, leading to the neurodegenerative disorder Lafora Disease. Because of their essential role in starch and glycogen metabolism glucan phosphatases are of significant interest, yet a comparative analysis of their activities against diverse glucan substrates has not been established. We identify active site residues required for specific glucan dephosphorylation, defining a glucan phosphatase signature motif (CζAGΨGR) in the active site loop. We further explore the basis for phosphate position-specific activity of these enzymes and determine that their diverse phosphate position-specific activity is governed by the phosphatase domain. In addition, we find key differences in glucan phosphatase activity toward soluble and insoluble polyglucan substrates, resulting from the participation of ancillary glucan-binding domains. Together, these data provide fundamental insights into the specific activity of glucan phosphatases against diverse polyglucan substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1866599711,"Enveloped virus vaccines can be damaged by high osmotic strength solutions, such as those used to protect the vaccine antigen during drying, which contain high concentrations of sugars. We therefore studied shrinkage and activity loss of whole inactivated influenza virus in hyperosmotic solutions and used those findings to improve vaccine coating of microneedle patches for influenza vaccination. Using stopped-flow light scattering analysis, we found that the virus underwent an initial shrinkage on the order of 10% by volume within 5 s upon exposure to a hyperosmotic stress difference of 217 milliosmolarity. During this shrinkage, the virus envelope had very low osmotic water permeability (1 – 6×10−4 cm s–1) and high Arrhenius activation energy (Ea = 15.0 kcal mol–1), indicating that the water molecules diffused through the viral lipid membranes. After a quasi-stable state of approximately 20 s to 2 min, depending on the species and hypertonic osmotic strength difference of disaccharides, there was a second phase of viral shrinkage. At the highest osmotic strengths, this led to an undulating light scattering profile that appeared to be related to perturbation of the viral envelope resulting in loss of virus activity, as determined by in vitro hemagglutination measurements and in vivo immunogenicity studies in mice. Addition of carboxymethyl cellulose effectively prevented vaccine activity loss in vitro and in vivo, believed to be due to increasing the viscosity of concentrated sugar solution and thereby reducing osmotic stress during coating of microneedles. These results suggest that hyperosmotic solutions can cause biphasic shrinkage of whole inactivated influenza virus which can damage vaccine activity at high osmotic strength and that addition of a viscosity enhancer to the vaccine coating solution can prevent osmotically driven damage and thereby enable preparation of stable microneedle coating formulations for vaccination."

Inflammatory cytokines are critical components of the immune system and influence cellular signaling, and genetic imbalances. In this study, we found that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were significantly induced by HCV infection and HCV NS5A expression, and induction of COX-2 correlated with HCV-induced IL-8 production. We also found that the ERK and JNK signaling pathways were involved in the regulation of IL-8-mediated COX-2 induction in response to HCV infection. Using a promoter-linked reporter assay, we identified that the C/EBP regulatory element within the COX-2 promoter was the dominant factor responsible for the induction of COX-2 by HCV. Silencing C/EBP attenuated HCV-induced COX-2 expression. Our results revealed that HCV-induced inflammation promotes viral replication, providing new insights into the involvement of IL-8-mediated COX-2 induction in HCV replication."
https://openalex.org/W1034899557,"Epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechingallate (ECG) and epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) are antioxidants present in the green tea, a widely used beverage whose health benefits are largely recognized. Nevertheless, major physicochemical limitations, such as the high instability of catechins, pose important questions concerning their potential pharmacological use. Recent studies indicate that binding of catechins with plasmatic proteins may modulate their plasma concentration, tissue delivery and biological activity. After 5 minutes of incubation with HSA both ECG and EGCG were fully bound to HSA, while after 48h incubation only 41% of EC and 70% of EGC resulted linked. HSA had a strong stabilizing effect on all catechins, which could be found in solution between 29 and 85% even after 48h of incubation. In the absence of HSA, EGC and EGCG disappeared in less than 24h, while ECG and EC were found after 48h at 5 and 50%, respectively. The stabilizing effect of HSA toward EGCG, obtained in aqueous physiological conditions, resulted stronger in comparison to cysteine and HCl, previously reported to stabilize this polyphenol. Because of the multitude of contradictory data concerning in vivo and in vitro antioxidant-based experimentations, we believe our work may shed some light on this debated field of research."

Among endogenous ligands, C1q binds to DNA and apoptotic cells, but whether C1q binds to nuclear DNA in apoptotic cells remains to be investigated. With UV irradiation-induced apoptosis, C1q initially bound to peripheral cellular regions in early apoptotic cells. By 6 h, binding concentrated in the nuclei to the nucleolus but not the chromatins. When nucleoli were isolated from non-apoptotic cells, C1q also bound to these structures. In vivo, C1q exists as the C1 complex (C1qC1r2C1s2), and C1q binding to ligands activates the C1r/C1s proteases. Incubation of nucleoli with C1 caused degradation of the nucleolar proteins nucleolin and nucleophosmin 1. This was inhibited by the C1 inhibitor. The nucleoli are abundant with autoantigens. C1q binding and C1r/C1s degradation of nucleolar antigens during cell apoptosis potentially reduces autoimmunity. These findings help us to understand why genetic C1q and C1r/C1s deficiencies cause systemic lupus erythematosus.

This study sought to identify such a disagreement and its predictors.A cross-sectional sample of 84 family caregivers and patients with dementia was recruited from memory clinics. We used the Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Clinical Dementia Rating, and Katz index of independence in activities of daily living to assess patient symptoms, functions, and severity of dementia. Caregivers completed questionnaires on perceived patient end-of-life care preferences, caregiver end-of-life care preferences for patients, Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and knowledge of clinical complications of advanced dementia.The self-disclosure rates of patient preferences were 34.5% for tube feeding, 39.3% for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 45.2% for mechanical ventilation. For patients who had disclosed preferences, the disagreement rate between them and their caregivers was 48.3% for tube feeding, 48.5% for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 60.3% for mechanical ventilation. Caregiver depression (i.e., CES-D ≥16) was associated with disagreements on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.6, 95% CI = 1.4-31.1, P = 0.01) and mechanical ventilation (aOR = 14, 95% CI = 2.2-87.2, P = 0.005) preferences.The preferences of end-of-life issues differed greatly between dementia patients and their caregivers. Depression in caregivers is associated with such discrepancy."

At this time, there is no biological marker of psoriatic arthritis.To test whether antinuclear antibodies (ANA) can be used as a diagnostic tool in psoriatic arthritis (PsA), we evaluated the prevalence of ANA in biologic-naïve PsA patients and in healthy blood donors.232 patients from the Rheumatology department, St Marguerite's Hospital, Marseilles, who fulfilled the CASPAR criteria for PsA, underwent clinical and laboratory investigations. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) were assayed. Ninety-one healthy blood donors were also tested.Detection of ANA by indirect immunofluorescence was significantly more frequent in sera from PsA patients than those from controls at serum dilution of 1:100 (57% compared with 40%, Odds Ratio (OR) 1.98 (1.2-3.4) p<0.02) and 1:160 (52% compared with 24%, OR 3,7 (1.9-7.2) p<0.001). No patients had lupus specific autoantibodies, 15 % had RF (34/232), and 1.7 % had ACPA (4/232).Detection of ANA was more frequent in sera from PsA patients than in those from healthy controls. This suggests that ANA could be a diagnosis orientation tool in PsA. Nevertheless, the specificity of these antibodies still remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1885870414,"Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) such as parvalbumin are part of the cellular calcium buffering system that determines intracellular calcium diffusion and influences the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signals. In neurons, CaBPs are primarily localized to the cytosol and function, for example, in nerve terminals in short-term synaptic plasticity. However, CaBPs are also expressed in the cell nucleus, suggesting that they modulate nuclear calcium signals, which are key regulators of neuronal gene expression. Here we show that the calcium buffering capacity of the cell nucleus in mouse hippocampal neurons regulates neuronal architecture by modulating the expression levels of VEGFD and the complement factor C1q-c, two nuclear calcium-regulated genes that control dendrite geometry and spine density, respectively. Increasing the levels of nuclear calcium buffers by means of expression of a nuclearly targeted form of parvalbumin fused to mCherry (PV.NLS-mC) led to a reduction in VEGFD expression and, as a result, to a decrease in total dendritic length and complexity. In contrast, mRNA levels of the synapse pruning factor C1q-c were increased in neurons expressing PV.NLS-mC, causing a reduction in the density and size of dendritic spines. Our results establish a close link between nuclear calcium buffering capacity and the transcription of genes that determine neuronal structure. They suggest that the development of cognitive deficits observed in neurological conditions associated with CaBP deregulation may reflect the loss of necessary structural features of dendrites and spines."
https://openalex.org/W1790608331,"Trauma patients with an ISS=75 have been deliberately excluded from some trauma studies because they were assumed to have unsurvivable injuries. This study aimed to assess the true mortality among patients with an ISS=75, and to examine the characteristics and primary diagnoses of these patients. Retrospective review of the 2006-2010 U.S. Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) generated 2,815 patients with an ISS=75 for analysis, representing an estimated 13,569 patients in the country. Dispositions from the emergency department and hospital for these patients were tabulated by trauma center level. Survivors and non-survivors were compared using Pearson's chi-square test. Primary diagnosis codes of these patients were tabulated by mortality status. Overall, about 48.6% of patients with an ISS=75 were discharged alive, 25.8% died and 25.6% had unknown mortality status. The mortality risks of these patients did not vary significantly across different levels of trauma centers (15.6% vs. 13.0%, P = 0.16). Non-survivors were more likely than survivors to: be male (81.2% vs. 74.4%, P < 0.0001), be over 65 years (20.3% vs. 10.2%, P < 0.0001), be uninsured (33.8% vs. 19.1%), have at least one chronic condition (58.0% vs. 43.7%, P <0.0001), sustain life-threatening injuries (79.2% vs. 49.4%, P<0.0001), sustain penetrating injuries (42.0% vs. 25.9%, P<0.0001), and have injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes (32.9% vs. 21.1%, P<0.0001) or firearms (21.9% vs. 4.4%, P<0.0001). The most frequent diagnosis code was 862.8 (injury to multiple and unspecified intrathoracic organs, without mention of open wound into cavity). Our results revealed that at least half of patients with an ISS=75 survived, demonstrating that the rationale for excluding patients with an ISS=75 from analysis is not always justified. To avoid bias and inaccurate results, trauma researchers should examine the mortality status of patients with an ISS=75 before exclusion, and explicitly describe their method of generating ISS scores."
https://openalex.org/W971843153,"During pregnancy there are significant changes in gut microbiota composition and activity. The impact of secretor status as determined by genotyping FUT2 (fucosyltransferase 2) gene was taken as one of the confounding factors associated with faecal microbiota changes during pregnancy. In this prospective study, we followed women during pregnancy (total = 123 of which secretors = 108, non-secretors = 15) and characterised their gut microbiota by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Fluorescence In situ Hybridisation (FISH), Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing. qPCR revealed that C. coccoides group counts decreased significantly in non-secretors in comparison to secretors (p = 0.02). Similar tendency was found by FISH analysis in Clostridium histolyticum and Lactobacillus-Enterococcus groups between the secretor and the non-secretor pregnant women. DGGE analysis showed significant decrease in richness of Clostridium sp. between secretor and non-secretor mothers during pregnancy. Pyrosequencing based analysis at phyla level showed that there is greater increase in Actinobacteria in secretors in comparison to non-secretors, whereas Proteobacteria showed more increase in non-secretors. Change in relative abundance of Clostridiaceae family from first to third trimester were significantly associated with secretor status of pregnant women (p = 0.05). Polyphasic approach for microbiota analysis points out that the host secretor status (FUT2 genotype) affects the gut microbiota during pregnancy. This may lead to altered infant gut microbiota colonization."
https://openalex.org/W1865601901,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes with the severity of biliary atresia (BA).One hundred and fourteen BA patients and 114 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Relative telomere length (RTL) was assessed using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate RTL as an independent risk factor of BA. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to calculate the accuracy of biomarkers in the prediction of liver cirrhosis.BA patients had significantly shorter telomeres than healthy controls (p < 0.0001). The RTL in BA patients with jaundice was considerably lower than that of patients without jaundice (p = 0.005). Moreover, RTL was markedly shorter in patients with cirrhosis (F4), as compared to patients with mild fibrosis (F2) and non-fibrosis (F0-F1, p < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that short RTL was associated with a higher risk of liver cirrhosis in BA. Tertile analysis showed a dose-response effect for this association (p trend < 0.0001). Additionally, RTL in BA children revealed a negative correlation with age (r = -0.50, p < 0.001). We noted an association between reduction of RTL and liver stiffness scores, adjusted for age and gender (b = -0.01, p < 0.0001). Short RTL can be employed to distinguish cirrhosis patients from non-cirrhosis patients (AUC = 0.78). Further analysis showed a linear correlation between leukocyte RTL and liver RTL in BA patients (r = 0.83, p < 0.001).The findings of this study provide evidence that telomere shortening is associated with an elevated risk of liver cirrhosis in BA."
https://openalex.org/W1891023930,"Agave quid chewing is examined as a potential contributing behavior to hunter-gatherer dental wear. It has previously been hypothesized that the contribution of Agave quid chewing to dental wear would be observed in communities wherever phytolith-rich desert succulents were part of subsistence. Previous analysis of coprolites from a prehistoric agricultural site, La Cueva de los Muertos Chiquitos in Durango, Mexico, showed that Agave was a consistent part of a diverse diet. Therefore, quids recovered at this site ought to be useful materials to test the hypothesis that dental wear was related to desert succulent consumption. The quids recovered from the site were found to be largely derived from chewing Agave. In this study, the quids were found to be especially rich in phytoliths, and analysis of dental casts made from impressions left in the quids revealed flat wear and dental attrition similar to that of Agave-reliant hunter-gatherers. Based on evidence obtained from the analysis of quids, taken in combination with results from previous studies, it is determined that Agave quid chewing was a likely contributing factor to dental wear in this population. As such, our method provides an additional avenue of dental research in areas where quids are present."

Whereas these novel sequencing processes have a validated robust performance, choice of enrichment method and different available bioinformatic software as reliable analysis tool needs to be further investigated in a diagnostic setting.DNA from 21 patients with genetic variants in SDHB, VHL, EPAS1, RET, (n=17) or clinical criteria of NF1 syndrome (n=4) were included. Targeted NGS was performed using Truseq custom amplicon enrichment sequenced on an Illumina MiSEQ instrument. Results were analysed in parallel using three different bioinformatics pipelines; (1) Commercially available MiSEQ Reporter, fully automatized and integrated software, (2) CLC Genomics Workbench, graphical interface based software, also commercially available, and ICP (3) an in-house scripted custom bioinformatic tool.A tenfold read coverage was achieved in between 95-98% of targeted bases. All workflows had alignment of reads to SDHA and NF1 pseudogenes. Compared to Sanger sequencing, variant calling revealed a sensitivity ranging from 83 to 100% and a specificity of 99.9-100%. Only MiSEQ reporter identified all pathogenic variants in both sequencing runs.We conclude that targeted next generation sequencing have equal quality compared to Sanger sequencing. Enrichment specificity and the bioinformatic performance need to be carefully assessed in a diagnostic setting. As acceptable accuracy was noted for a fully automated bioinformatic workflow, we suggest that processing of NGS data could be performed without expert bioinformatics skills utilizing already existing commercially available bioinformatics tools."
https://openalex.org/W2157456012,"Hook microtubule-tethering protein 3 (HOOK3) is an adaptor protein for microtubule-dependent intracellular vesicle and protein trafficking. In order to assess the role of HOOK3 in prostate cancer we analyzed HOOK3 expression by immunohistochemistry on a TMA containing more than 12,400 prostate cancers. Results were compared to tumor phenotype and PSA recurrence as well as aberrations possibly defining relevant molecular subtypes such as ERG status and deletions of 3p13, 5q21, 6q15 and PTEN. HOOK3 immunostaining was negative in normal luminal cells of prostate epithelium, whereas 53.3% of 10,572 interpretable cancers showed HOOK3 expression, which was considered low in 36.4% and high in 16.9% of cases. High-level HOOK3 expression was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason score, high proliferation index, positive lymph node stage, and PSA recurrence (p<0.0001 each). The prognostic role of HOOK3 expression was independent of established clinico-pathological parameters both in preoperative and postoperative settings. Comparisons with molecular features were performed to draw conclusions on the potential function of HOOK3 in the prostate. A strong association with all examined deletions is consistent with a role of HOOK3 for maintaining genomic integrity by contributing to proper centrosome assembly. Finding HOOK3 expression in 74% of ERG positive but in only 38% of ERG negative cancers (p<0.0001) further suggests functional interactions between these genes. In conclusion, the results of our study identify HOOK3 as a strong candidate prognostic marker with a possible role in maintaining genomic integrity in prostate cancer, which may have potential for inclusion into clinical routine assays."

https://openalex.org/W1827625579,"There is an increasing prevalence of childhood asthma and allergic diseases in mainland of China. Few studies investigated the indoor dampness, ventilation and cleaning habits and their interrelationship with childhood asthma and allergic diseases. A large-scale cross-sectional study was performed in preschool children in Urumqi, China. Questionnaire was used to collect information on children’s health, home dampness and ventilation/cleaning (V/C) habits. Multiple logistic regressions were applied to analyze the associations between childhood asthma/allergic diseases and each sign of home dampness, dampness levels, each V/C habit and total V/C scores. The associations between dampness and health were further performed by strata analyses in two groups with low and high V/C scores. Totally 4618(81.7%) of 5650 children returned the questionnaire. Reports on home dampness were most common for water condensation on windows (20.8%) followed by damp beddings (18.0%). The most common ventilation measure was the use of exhaust fan in bathroom (59.3%), followed by daily home cleaning (48.3%), frequently putting beddings to sunshine (29.9%) and frequently opening windows in winter (8.4%). There were positive associations between the 6 signs of home dampness and children’s health particularly the symptoms last 12 months. By comparing with the reference dampness level (dampness scored 0), both the low dampness (scored 1~2) level and the high dampness level (scored 3~6) showed significantly increasing associations with childhood symptoms. There were crude negative associations between V/C habits and childhood health but not significant adjusting for home dampness levels. The risks of home dampness on children’s health were lower in the group with higher V/C score but the differences were not statistically significant. Home dampness is a potential risk factor for childhood asthma and allergic symptoms in preschool children in Urumqi, China. No significant effects were observed for ordinary home ventilation and cleaning habits in reducing the risks of home dampness on childhood asthma and allergic diseases in Urumqi, China."
https://openalex.org/W1924763664,"Background and Purpose Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are arachidonic acid metabolites that play a protective role against damaging processes that may occur after re-oxygenation of the graft. We aimed to investigate whether the presence of functional polymorphisms in the gene encoding soluble epoxy hydrolase (EPHX2), which metabolizes EETs to less active compounds, may play a role in the outcome of renal transplantation. Methods In a group of 259 Caucasian renal transplant recipients and 183 deceased donors, we determined the presence of three common EPHX2 SNPs, namely rs41507953 (K55R), rs751141 (R287Q) and rs1042032 A/G. Associations with parameters of graft function and the incidence of acute rejection were retrospectively investigated throughout the first year after grafting by logistic regression adjusting for clinical and demographic variables. Results Carriers of the rs1042032 GG genotype displayed significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (38.15 ± 15.57 vs. 45.99 ± 16.05; p = 0.04) and higher serum creatinine values (1.57 ± 0.58 vs. 1.30 ± 0.47 g/dL; p=0.02) one year after grafting, compared to patients carrying the wildtype A-allele. The same GG genotype was also associated to increased risk of acute rejection. Interestingly, this association was observed for the genotype of both recipients [OR =6.34 (1.35-29.90); p = 0.015] and donors [OR = 5.53 (1.10-27.80); p=0.042]. A statistical model including both genotypes along with other meaningful demographic and clinical variables resulted in an increased significance for the association with the recipients’ genotype [OR=8.28 (1.21-74.27); p=0.031]. Conclusions Our results suggest that genetic variability in the EETs-metabolizing gene, EPHX2, may have a significant impact on the outcome of deceased-donor renal transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1856013876,"The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that sound communication signals have an optimal relationship with animals' native environments. However, species sharing a habitat produce signals stratified in the spectral domain and exhibit different temporal patterns resulting in acoustic niche partitioning. The diversity generated is likely to affect differently the characteristics of propagating signals. We recorded at various distances from the sound source calls of the frogs Eupsophus calcaratus and E. emiliopugini in the austral temperate forest where they communicate and breed syntopically. The calls of E. calcaratus have higher frequency components and lower amplitude relative to calls of E. emiliopugini, and the acoustic active space for the signals of E. calcaratus is restricted relative to E. emiliopugini. The signals of both species experience similar attenuation patterns, but calls of E. calcaratus are affected by spectral degradation to a larger extent, with linear decreases in spectral cross-correlation and in the amplitude ratio between the first two harmonics. The calls of E. emiliopugini are affected by temporal degradation as a linear decrease in amplitude modulation depth of their pulsed structure. Further studies are needed to assess the relative importance of selective and phylogenetic factors on the divergent propagation patterns reported."
https://openalex.org/W2108889923,"Previously we reported that higher patient satisfaction (PS) with service quality is associated with favorable survival outcomes in a variety of cancers. However, we cautioned the readers that patients with greater satisfaction might be the ones with better self-rated health (SRH), a well-established prognosticator of cancer survival. In other words, SRH could potentially confound the PS and survival relationship. We investigated this hypothesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).778 NSCLC patients (327 males and 451 females; mean age 58.8 years) treated at 4 Cancer Treatment Centers of America hospitals between July 2011 and March 2013. PS was measured on a 7-point scale ranging from ""completely dissatisfied"" to ""completely satisfied"". SRH was measured on a 7-point scale ranging from ""very poor"" to ""excellent"". Both were dichotomized into 2 categories: top box response (7) versus all others (1-6). Patient survival was the primary end point. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between PS and survival controlling for covariates.74, 70, 232 and 391 patients had stage I, II, III and IV disease respectively. 631 (81.1%) patients were ""completely satisfied"". 184 (23.7%) patients had ""excellent"" SRH. There was a weak but significant correlation between overall PS and SRH (Kendall's tau b = 0.19; p<0.001). On univariate analysis, ""completely satisfied"" patients had a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Similarly, patients with ""excellent"" SRH had a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.81; p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment history and gender, SRH was found to be a significant predictor of survival (HR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.89; p = 0.007) while PS was not (HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.2; p = 0.32). Among the individual PS items, the only significant independent predictor of survival was ""teams communicating with each other concerning your medical condition and treatment"" (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.94; p = 0.03).SRH appears to confound the PS-survival relationship in NSCLC. SRH should be used as a control/stratification variable in analyses involving PS as a predictor of clinical cancer outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W1843366938,"Although Asian societies are remarkably different from Western societies in terms of sociocultural characteristics, little is known about the gender differences in the health effects of marriage and marital satisfaction in Asian countries.Using a randomly sampled dataset from the 2006 East Asian Social Survey comprising 8528 individuals from China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, this study performs analyses using a multivariate logistic regression model to predict the probability for a man or a woman to report poor health. Our results differ quite significantly from those of most studies focusing on Western countries. Considering marital satisfaction, there may be no health benefits from marriage for a specific gender in a given country, because the health loss associated with a dissatisfied marriage usually supersedes the health benefits from marriage. Moreover, women may reap greater health benefits from marriage than men. Additionally, those most likely to report poor health are found to be married and dissatisfied men or women, rather than never-married individuals.The present study argues the need to design and carry out a gender- and country-specific social health policy approach to target individuals suffering from poor health, thereby reducing the gender differences in health status."

Here, we use neutral molecular markers to explore the genetic consequences of the recent population decline and posterior recovery of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in the Iberian Peninsula. During the last century, the species was the object of extermination programs, suffering direct persecution by hunters until the 70's. Moreover, during the last decades the eagle owl was severely impacted by increased mortality due to electrocution and the decline of its main prey species, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In recent times, the decrease of direct persecution and the implementation of some conservation schemes have allowed the species' demographic recovery. Yet, it remains unknown to which extent the past population decline and the later expansion have influenced the current species' pattern of genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellite markers to genotype 235 eagle owls from ten Spanish subpopulations and analyse the presence of genetic signatures attributable to the recent population fluctuations experienced by the species. We found moderate levels of differentiation among the studied subpopulations and Bayesian analyses revealed the existence of three genetic clusters that grouped subpopulations from central, south-western and south-eastern Spain. The observed genetic structure could have resulted from recent human-induced population fragmentation, a patchy distribution of prey populations and/or the philopatric behaviour and habitat selection of the species. We detected an old population bottleneck, which occurred approximately 10,000 years ago, and significant signatures of recent demographic expansions. However, we did not find genetic signatures for a recent bottleneck, which may indicate that population declines were not severe enough to leave detectable signals on the species genetic makeup or that such signals have been eroded by the rapid demographic recovery experienced by the species in recent years."

JT-ISH-224, and P. leiognathi JT-SHIZ-145 were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and their ST activities were compared directly using a galactosylated bi-antennary N-glycan as an acceptor substrate. In all ST reactions, there was an increase of sialylated glycans at shorter reaction times and later a decrease in prolonged reactions, which is related with the inherent sialidase activities of bacterial STs. These sialidase activities are greatly increased by free cytidine monophosphate (CMP) generated from a donor substrate CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) during the ST reactions. The decrease of sialylated glycans in prolonged ST reaction was prevented through an inhibition of sialidase activity by simple treatment of alkaline phosphatase (AP), which dephosphorylates CMP to cytidine. Through supplemental additions of AP and CMP-Neu5Ac to the reaction using the recombinant α(2,6)-ST from P. leiognathi JT-SHIZ-145 (P145-ST), the content of bi-sialylated N-glycan increased up to ~98% without any decrease in prolonged reactions. This optimized P145-ST reaction was applied successfully for α(2,6)-sialylation of asialofetuin, and this resulted in a large increase in the populations of multi-sialylated N-glycans compared with the reaction without addition of AP and CMP-Neu5Ac. These results suggest that the optimized reaction using the recombinant P145-ST readily expressed from E. coli has a promise for economic glycan synthesis and glyco-conjugate remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1788784629,"Objective 
Ecstasy use is associated with memory deficits. Serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms have been linked with memory function in healthy samples. The present pilot study investigated the influence of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on memory performance in ecstasy users, marijuana-using controls, and non-drug-using controls, after a minimum of 7 days of abstinence.


Method 
Data were collected from 116 young adults (18–25 years-old), including 45 controls, 42 marijuana users, and 29 ecstasy users, and were balanced for 5-HTTLPR genotype. Participants were abstinent seven days prior to completing memory testing. Three MANCOVAs and one ANCOVA were run to examine whether drug group, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and their interactions predicted verbal and visual memory after controlling for gender, past year alcohol use, other drug use, and nicotine cotinine levels.


Results 
MANCOVA and ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant interaction between drug group and genotype (p = .03) such that ecstasy users with the L/L genotype performed significantly worse on CVLT-2 total recall (p = .05), short (p = .008) and long delay free recall (p = .01), and recognition (p = .006), with the reverse pattern found in controls. Ecstasy did not significantly predict visual memory. 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly predicted memory for faces (p = .02); short allele carriers performed better than those with L/L genotype.


Conclusions 
5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the effects of ecstasy on verbal memory, with L/L carriers performing worse compared to controls. Future research should continue to examine individual differences in ecstasy’s impact on neurocognitive performance as well as relationships with neuronal structure. Additional screening and prevention efforts focused on adolescents and emerging adults are necessary to prevent ecstasy consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1889545768,"Individualization of treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C showed benefit in controlled trials and was implemented in treatment guidelines to increase response rates and to reduce side effects and costs. However, it is unknown whether individualization was adopted in routine daily practice and whether it translated into improved outcomes.From a large noninterventional cohort study, clinical and virologic response data of 10,262 HCV patients who received peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin between 2003-2007 and 2008-2011 were analyzed. To account for treatment individualization, a matched-pair analysis (2,997 matched pairs) was performed. Variation in treatment duration and dosing of ribavirin were analyzed as indicators for individualization.Sustained virological response (SVR) rates were similar between 2003-2007 and 2008-2011 (62.0% vs. 63.7%). Patients with comorbidities were more abundant in the later period, (44.3% vs. 57.1%). The subsequent matched-pair analysis demonstrated higher SVR rates in the 2008-2011 period (64.3%) than in the 2003-2007 period (61.2%, p=0.008). More patients received abbreviated or extended treatment regimens in the later than the earlier period as an indicator of treatment individualization. To the same end, ribavirin doses were higher in the later period (12.6 versus 11.6 mg/kg/day). Factors independently associated with SVR included HCV genotype, low baseline viral load, younger age, route of infection, absence of concomitant diseases, lower APRI score, normal gamma-GT, higher ribavirin doses, no substitution for drug abuse, treatment duration, and treatment in the 2008-2011 period.Treatment individualization with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin was implemented in daily routine between 2003-2007 and 2008-2011, SVR rates improved in the same period. These findings may be most relevant in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W1961727091,"Categorical perception (CP), the perceptual experience whereby continuous sensory phenomena are perceived as distinct and separate percepts, is one of the most characteristic features of information processing in human cognition. CP is considered as the result of the integration of the top-down processing including background knowledge and verbal labeling and the bottom-up processing such as physical characteristics of the sensory signal. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the integration remain unclear. To address this issue, we focused on the temporal characteristics of CP of facial expression. In the current study, we investigated the contributions of temporal factors in CP processes, using facial expression recognition tasks as an example of CP. Participants completed an identification task and a discrimination task, well-established tasks for evaluating CP of facial expressions, with variable temporal parameters, that is, duration of stimulus presentation and delay time (interval between stimulus and response). The results demonstrated that the emotionally ambiguous stimuli are categorized more distinctively with the extension of delay length, not of stimulus duration. In contrast, the category boundary for facial expressions shifted toward “happy” with extention in stimulus duration, not in delay length. This dissociation between the impact of stimulus duration and delay suggests that there are two processes contributing to CP of facial emotion; one process may reflect the internal processing associated with the length of the delay period including verbal labeling of the stimuli, and the other process may reflect the temporal summation of stimulus inputs, associated with stimulus duration. These findings suggest that paying more attention to temporal factors in CP could be useful for further study of the mechanisms underlying CP."
