https://openalex.org/W1527910795,"Human red blood cells (RBC) were separated by density on self-forming Percoll gradients into five distinct populations. The transbilayer movement and equilibrium distribution of 1-oleoyl-2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4- yl)aminocaproyl)phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) was slower in dense cells and equilibrated in the inner leaflet of these cells to a lesser degree than in light cells. Conversely, the outward movement of the lipid was slower in light cells. Assessment of endogenous PS in the cells' outer leaflet by the prothrombinase activity of externalized PS revealed an increase in its presence at the cell surface with increasing cell density. The presence of PS on the cell surface directly correlated with the propensity of the RBC to bound by autologous monocytes. To determine whether increased cell density is associated with increased cell age, the in vivo clearance of density-separated murine RBC was monitored in syngeneic mice. The T1/2 of circulation of light cells was about twice that of dense cells. The majority of the cleared cells localized in the spleen. Studies carried out in antibody-deficient SCID mice indicated that RBC were cleared via a mechanism that was independent of antibody. These data suggest that cell age is related to cell density and that cells of increasing age and density display higher amounts of PS in their outer leaflet."
https://openalex.org/W1960586600,"Extensive biochemical studies of phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) over the last two decades indicate that there are likely to be several distinct PLA2 genes in mammals. Here we report the cloning of a 1-kilobase pair cDNA encoding a novel human low molecular weight PLA2. The cDNA appears to encode a 118-amino acid mature peptide (M(r) = 13,592) preceded by a 20-residue prepeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein that lacks one of the seven disulfide bridges found in similar PLA2s and, therefore, represents a class of enzymes distinct from the mammalian group I and group II enzymes. An RNA blot hybridized with the cDNA exhibited a putative 1.2-kilobase pair transcript in heart and, less abundantly, in lung, as well as multiple putative transcripts in placenta. When the cDNA was expressed using an Epstein-Barr virus-based vector in human 293s cells, PLA2 activity accumulated in the culture medium. Conditioned medium optimally hydrolyzed the phospholipids of [1-14C]oleate-labeled Escherichia coli at neutral to alkaline pH with 10 mM or greater Ca2+. In assays done with individual substrates, L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine was more efficiently hydrolyzed than L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine, L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylethanolamine, or L-alpha-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W1553843803,"Inactivation of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) by its own reaction product H2O2 is a well-known phenomenon. Generation of the hydroxyl radical has been a matter of great concern, and the target molecule has been regarded as its own active site histidine residues, whose oxidized forms have not yet been identified (Hodgson, E.K., and Fridovich, I. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 5294-5299). Here we report on the identification of oxidized histidines generated at the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD by reaction with H2O2. When bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD (0.5 mg/ml) was treated with 5 mM H2O2 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), histidine was significantly lost; however, except for a significant increase in aspartate and glutamate, nothing new appeared in the amino acid analysis of oxidized Cu,Zn-SOD. On the other hand, the hydrolysates of oxidized Cu,Zn-SOD involved an unknown product that was detectable by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The product was found to be identical to 2-oxo-histidine that had been discovered as the major oxidation product of histidine and its peptides treated with a copper/ascorbate-free radical generating system. The main product present in the hydrolysate of H2O2-treated Cu,Zn-SOD was 2-oxo-histidine. Approximately 0.66 mol/mol subunit was formed when Cu,Zn-SOD was treated with 5 mM H2O2 for 30 min. Both metal chelators and the hydroxyl radical scavengers only slightly inhibited the 2-oxo-histidine formation (10-39%), suggesting that the active species were produced mainly inside the ligands of the Cu2+ in the enzyme. Trypsin digestion of H2O2-treated Cu,Zn-SOD showed selective reactions at the sequences of Gly24-Lys67 and Thr114-Arg126, in that histidine residues locate at the active center. Two new products derived from those peptides appeared in the tryptic map. Amino acid analysis of both products demonstrated the loss of only histidine. One of them derived from Thr114-Arg126 contained an equimolar amount of 2-oxo-histidine, indicating that His-118 was converted selectively to 2-oxo-histidine; however, another product derived from Gly24-Lys67 contained only 0.085 mol of 2-oxo-histidine/mol of peptide, suggesting that the product is a mixture consisting of unidentified forms of oxidized histidine. Taken together, the present study provided direct evidence that 2-oxo-histidine was generated in the Cu,Zn-SOD exposed to H2O2 and that its generation was selective at histidine 118 of the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1511491270,"The interaction of two ruthenium(III) complexes exhibiting high anticancer activity, namely trans-indazolium(bisindazole)tetrachlororuthenate(III) (ru-ind) and trans-imidazolium(bisimidazole)tetrachlororuthenate(III) (ru-im), with human serum apotransferrin has been investigated through spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques with the ultimate goal of preparing adducts with good selectivity for cancer cells. Whereas the binding of ru-im to human serum apotransferrin takes several hours, ru-ind, the less toxic complex, gives rise to a well defined 2:1 complex within a few minutes. We have ascertained that ru-ind binding occurs around the iron binding sites; binding does not occur in the absence of bicarbonate, and this anion dictates the kinetic and mechanistic characteristics of protein binding of ru-ind. The two ruthenium(III) complexes do not behave as iron(III) complexes, e.g. Fe(EDTA) or Fe(nitrilotriacetate), which lose their respective ligands when binding apotransferrin, but the N-heterocycles remain attached to the metal in the protein-bound species. Reversion of binding is obtained by acidification in the presence of chelators such as citrate or ATP. In comparison with cisplatin and its deactivation by serum proteins, our results indicate that other metal complexes such as ru-ind could use transferrin as a drug delivery system. Furthermore, the rapid protein binding of ru-ind seems to be related to a lower toxicity while still exhibiting high antitumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1530102586,"A detailed study on the activation of H+ transport by reconstituted uncoupling proteins from brown adipose tissue is given, including the influence of chain lengths and of other structural modifications, concentration dependence, and the influence of nucleotides. Uncoupling protein was reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine in such a way as to keep H+ transport with endogenous fatty acids at a minimum. Using excess of polystyrene beads on reconstitution avoided the complications arising from the use of albumin. Both delta psi-driven H+ uptake and H+ efflux systems are used by changing the polarity. Fatty acids stimulate H+ uptake up to 6-fold and H+ efflux more than 10-fold. There is no competition between the inhibition by nucleotides (GTP) and fatty acids. Also, the binding of GTP and ATP is not affected. Only fatty acids starting from C8 activate, reaching a maximum at C14. However, unsaturated homologous of C18 (oleic, linoleic, etc.) are fully active. Hydrophilic substitutions by hydroxyl, CO2H, bromo, doxyl groups also permit good activation, probably due to improved uptake into the lipid phase. The hydrophobic moiety exhibits a low specificity. Blockage of carboxyl by esterification abolishes the activation. Maximum activation requires high total concentrations of 200-300 microM. The distribution of fatty acids between proteoliposomes and solution was determined. The activation mode of fatty acids is discussed either as regulatory activators or as cofactors in H+ translocation involving their carboxyl groups. Two alternatives are considered, namely that the fatty acids carboxyl group is at the translocation center or in the channel facilitating H+ transfer to the constituent H(+)-translocating carboxyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1767446315,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass pattern B is a common genetically influenced lipoprotein profile characterized by a predominance of small, dense LDL particles, and associated with increased levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increased risk of coronary artery disease compared to individuals with a predominance of larger LDL (pattern A). We sought to determine whether LDL subclass patterns are associated with response of plasma lipoprotein levels to changes in dietary fat and carbohydrate content. In a randomized cross-over study, 105 men consumed, for six weeks each, high-fat (46%) and low-fat (24%) solid food diets, with replacement of fat by carbohydrate. Diet-induced changes in subjects who exhibited pattern B (n = 18) following the high-fat diet differed significantly from those in subjects with pattern A (n = 87): in pattern B subjects LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions were two-fold greater and plasma apolipoprotein (apo) B levels decreased significantly. These differences remained significant after adjustment for levels of plasma LDL-C, apo B, HDL-C, and body mass index. Thus, LDL subclass pattern is a factor that contributes significantly to interindividual variation of plasma lipoprotein response to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet."

https://openalex.org/W1511459507,"The platelet-activating factor (PAF) was seen to potently activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and MAP kinase kinase through the cloned guinea pig PAF receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Both 42- and 44-kDa MAP kinases were activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PAF. The PAF receptor also triggered the production of inositol phosphates and the release of arachidonic acid and inhibited cyclic AMP accumulation. Differential inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin (PTX) on these signals suggested that the PAF receptor couples to both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins in CHO cells. MAP kinase and MAP kinase activations were partially regulated by PTX-sensitive G proteins. The PAF receptor did not trigger any detectable increase in the GTP form of Ras under the conditions in which the human insulin receptor expressed in the same parent CHO cells potently increased the level. Since these agonists induced comparable MAP kinase activations through cognate receptors, Ras seems to play different roles in MAP kinase activation by the two different classes of receptors. The activation of MAP kinase by the cloned PAF receptor may explain part of the mechanisms underlying PAF-induced differentiation and proliferation in non-inflammatory cells."

https://openalex.org/W1483862258,"Heparin-binding (HB) epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF protein family, is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and keratinocytes that was initially identified as a secreted product of macrophage-like cells. HB-EGF and EGF appear to act on target cells utilizing the same receptor, but HB-EGF is distinguishable from EGF by its strong affinity for heparin. To facilitate studies of structure-function relationships in HB-EGF, a bacterial recombinant expression system was established that produced biologically active HB-EGF with the expected disulfide bonding pattern. Mutagenesis and protease digestion studies of the recombinant HB-EGF, coupled with heparin-binding analyses of synthetic peptides, indicated that the sequences within HB-EGF mediating its interaction with heparin are located primarily in a stretch of 21 amino acids characterized by a high content of lysine and arginine residues. Most of this heparin-binding domain lies in an amino-terminal region of HB-EGF that has no counterpart in EGF, but a portion of the 21-residue sequence extends into the EGF-like region of HB-EGF. In addition, the mutagenesis and synthetic peptide studies indicated that sequences in HB-EGF lying outside of the 21-residue stretch can also influence the interaction with heparin. Finally, a synthetic peptide derived from the 21-residue stretch was found to compete with HB-EGF for binding to Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that the heparin-binding sequences in HB-EGF may also mediate the interaction of this factor with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1551470871,"Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man. Biochemical studies were focused on the asexual, intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, because of their role in the clinical phase of the disease and the possibility of propagation in a cell culture system. In this report, we describe the in-culture labeling of malarial glycolipids and the analysis of their hydrophilic moieties. They were identified as glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) by: 1) labeling with [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]ethanolamine and 2) sensitivity toward glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D, phospholipase A2, and nitrous acid. Malarial GPIs are shown to be unaffected by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, regardless of prior treatment with mild base commonly used for inositol deacylation. Two candidates for putative GPI-anchor precursors to malarial membrane proteins with the structures ethanolamine-phosphate-6(Man alpha 1-2)Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4 GlcN-PI (Pfg1 alpha) and ethanolamine-phosphate-6Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man-alpha 1-4-GlcN-PI (Pfg1 beta) were identified."

Twenty-two Gaucher disease mutations or created mutations were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and analyzed for catalytic properties, stability, inhibitor binding, and modifier interactions. Many Gaucher disease mutations encoded highly disruptive amino acid substitutions (e.g. P289L and D409V) and produced severely compromised proteins with very reduced activity (kcat"
https://openalex.org/W1663095249,"In normal adult liver, hepatocytes are arrested in G0, and they rapidly respond to a mass loss by a definite number of divisions. Thus, taking advantage of the in vivo regenerative capacity of the liver following partial hepatectomy, we have analyzed both expression and activation of p34cdc2 (= cdk1) and p33cdk2 through the cell cycle, particularly during the long lasting G1 phase and in the G1/S transition. While p33cdk2 is constantly expressed during the cell cycle, p34cdc2 is completely absent in resting hepatocytes and remains unexpressed for up to 20 h after partial hepatectomy, a time period corresponding to the G1 phase and G1/S transition, and then accumulates in the S, G2, and M phases. No histone H1 kinase activity is detected during the G1 phase, while two peaks of p34cdc2 kinase activity are observed during the S and M phases and only one peak of p33cdk2 kinase activity in the S phase. p34cdc2 forms complexes with both cyclins A and B while p33cdk2 is associated with cyclin A only. Surprisingly, cyclins E and D1 are present in resting liver and with modest variation throughout the cell cycle. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the pattern of G1-associated proteins in hepatocytes during liver regeneration is distinct from that described in other cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1590242587,"Hyperglycemia is postulated to cause chronic changes in the vasculature of diabetic patients, suggesting structural or genetic alterations. We have characterized the glucose induced alterations of gene expression in cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells using the recently developed mRNA differential display method. After five days of incubation with either 5.5 or 22 mM glucose, RNA preparations were isolated from confluent cells and probed with 10 candidate clones identified after screening up to 3000 mRNA species. Among these, three clones (2A, 2C, 3) showed significant changes in expression by Northern blot analysis. Elevated glucose levels decreased the mRNA expression of clones 2A and 3 to 51 +/- 7% (P < .01) and 59 +/- 10% (P < .05) (mean% of control +/- SEM), respectively. Expression of clone 2C was increased in 22 mM glucose condition to 221 +/- 23% (P < .05). Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that clone 3 had 77% homology to the 3'-noncoding region of human elongation factor 2, a member of the GTPase family which is essential for polypeptide synthesis. Clones 2A and 2C do show no homology to known nucleotide sequences. These results indicate that physiologically attainable high glucose conditions can significantly effect gene expression in aortic smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, mRNA differential display can be used in metabolic studies to identify new genes regulated by nutrients such as glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1491249957,"Insulin resistance resulting from prolonged exposure of intact animals or cultured cells to glucocorticoids is often attributed to postreceptor signaling defects. To better understand the specific effects of glucocorticoids on insulin signaling, we have characterized the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of an insulin signaling intermediate, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Addition of dexamethasone resulted in a 40-70% decline in steady-state IRS-1 protein over 24-48 h of treatment. Dexamethasone did not significantly change the degradation rate of IRS-1 protein but decreased the net rate of amino acid incorporation into IRS-1 by 87%. Between 1 and 2.5 h of treatment with dexamethasone, actinomycin D, or both drugs given simultaneously, the concentration of IRS-1 mRNA declined with a half-life of 0.7-1.0 h. However, after 4 h of dexamethasone treatment, IRS-1 mRNA concentrations stabilized at approximately 35% of the control level. The dexamethasone-induced decline in IRS-1 protein could be prevented by simultaneous administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone, RU38486. These results suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes the loss of IRS-1 protein after dexamethasone treatment can be accounted for chiefly by inhibition of the synthesis of IRS-1 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2100057506,"Hepatocyte-like mhAT3F cells have been derived from the hepatoma of a transgenic mouse expressing the SV40 large T antigen under the control of the antithrombin III gene regulatory region (Antoine, B., Levrat, F., Vallet, V., Berbar, T., Cartier, N., Dubois, N., Briand, P., and Kahn, A. (1992) Gene expression in hepatocyte-like lines established by targeted carcinogenesis in transgenic mice. Exp. Cell. Res. 200, 175–185; F. Levrat et al., unpublished results). In these cells, the l-PK gene is transcriptionally activated by glucose, as it is in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes. However, in contrast to the l-PK gene regulation in the liver and isolated hepatocytes, the glucose responsiveness does not require insulin and is not blocked by cyclic AMP. In mhAT3F cells, the insensitivity to insulin might be due to the replacement of insulin-dependent glucokinase by insulin-independent hexokinases able to phosphorylate glucose in the absence of the hormone. The glucose-dependent activation of the l-PK gene is delayed, requires ongoing protein synthesis, and is mediated by the same glucose response element as in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes. These results suggest that the glucose-dependent signaling pathway responsible for the transcriptional activation of glycolytic and lipogenic genes requires glucose phosphorylation, a phenomenon that is insulin-dependent in the liver but insulin-independent in cultured hepatoma cells. Nevertheless, the action of glucose 6-phosphate is most likely indirect.— Lefrançois-Martinez, A.-M., Diaz-Guerra, M.-J. M., Vallet, V., Kahn, A., Antoine, B. Glucose-dependent regulation of the L-pyruvate kinase gene in a hepatoma cell line is independent of insulin and cyclic AMP. FASEB J. 8: 89-96; 1994."
https://openalex.org/W1592939302,"Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A interacts with RNA along multiple binding subsites that essentially recognize the negatively charged phosphates of the substrate. This work gives additional strong support to the existence of the postulated phosphate-binding subsite p2 (Pares, X., Llorens, R., Arus, C., and Cuchillo, C. M. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 105, 571-579) and confirms the central role of Lys-7 and Arg-10 in establishing an electrostatic interaction with a phosphate group of the substrate. The effects of charge elimination by Lys-7-->Gln (K7Q) and/or Arg-10-->Gln (R10Q) substitutions in catalytic and ligand-binding properties of ribonuclease A have been studied. The values of Km for cytidine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and cytidylyl-3',5'-adenosine are not altered but are significantly increased for poly(C). In all cases, kcat values are lower. Synthetic activity, i.e. the reversion of the transphosphorylation reaction, is reduced for K7Q and R10Q mutants and is practically abolished in the double mutant. Finally, the extent of the reaction of the mutants with 6-chloropurine-9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate indicates that the phosphate ionic interaction in p2 is weakened. Thus, p2 modification alters both the catalytic efficiency and the extent of the processes in which an interaction of the phosphate group of the substrate or ligand with the p2-binding subsite is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1534190118,"Several genes expressed in skeletal muscle are transcriptionally repressed by electrical activity arising from motor innervation and are rapidly induced following denervation. Among these are genes encoding the subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and the myogenic helix-loop-helix protein myogenin, which activates muscle-specific genes. To understand how electrical activity arising from motor innervation is converted into a transcriptional response, we have attempted to localize cis-acting sequences in the AChR alpha subunit and myogenin genes sufficient to direct activity-dependent transcription. Here we show that an 111-base pair and a 335-base pair region from the promoters of the AChR alpha subunit and myogenin genes, respectively, can confer activity-dependent regulation to a linked reporter gene in transgenic mice. The presence of binding sites for myogenic helix-loop-helix proteins in both of these regulatory regions is consistent with the hypothesis that these myogenic regulators serve as nuclear targets for the signaling cascade through which motor innervation leads to changes in gene transcription in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1555506689,"The contractile vacuole complex serves to excrete excess cytosolic water from protists. In the amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, the organelle had a bipartite morphology: a large main vacuole (bladder) marked by lumenal alkaline phosphatase was surrounded by numerous satellite vacuoles (spongiomes). Bladders and spongiomes have now been purified for the first time. The spongiome membranes had a high density of surface projections identified as catalytically-active vacuolar proton pumps (V-H(+)-ATPase). Spongiomes were resolved from the pump-poor bladders by immunogold buoyant density shift with antibodies to the V-H(+)-ATPase; they contained little protein other than this pump. It appears that, following homogenization, most of the spongiome dissociated from bladders and populated the proton pump-rich membrane fraction called acidosomes. Isolated bladders were enriched > 40-fold in alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase, the activities of which were > 85% latent. Bladders depleted of spongiomes bore several distinctive polypeptides; they also had an excess of the basepieces of the proton pump over the catalytic heads. Bladder membranes were also lipid-rich and had a distinctive lipid composition. We conclude that the contractile vacuole system in Dictyostelium is a complex of discrete, separable bladder and spongiome membranes. The V-H(+)-ATPase in the spongiome may catalyze the primary energy transduction step for pumping water out of the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1480183232,"Uptake of inositol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated through transcriptional control of the gene that encodes the major inositol permease, ITR1 (Nikawa, J., Tsukagoshi, Y., and Yamashita, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11184-11191). ITR1 mRNA abundance decreases when cells are transferred from medium without inositol to medium with inositol. Here we demonstrate that the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of ITR1 is through the action of the INO2, INO4 and OPI1 genes. INO2 and INO4 are required for derepressed levels of ITR1 mRNA, and OPI1 is necessary for repression of transcript levels in response to inositol. The INO2, INO4, and OPI1 genes thus coordinate uptake of inositol to endogenous inositol biosynthesis and to phospholipid biosynthesis. Repression of transcription of ITR1 also requires ongoing synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, defining an additional link between synthesis of phospholipids and regulation of inositol uptake. Analysis showed that the INO1 gene, encoding a key enzyme in the inositol biosynthetic pathway, responded to decreases in permease activity with a graduated increase in the level of INO1 mRNA. We also found that, in addition to the transcriptional regulation, inositol permease activity is regulated by irreversible inactivation. Inactivation of the ITR1 permease occurs in response to the presence of inositol and involves a change in the functional half-life of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1575079052,"Mitochondrial delta 3,5, delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, which catalyzes the conversion of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA, was purified from rat liver 370-fold at almost 30% yield by a six-step purification procedure. The final preparation appeared to be homogeneous as judged by gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of the native enzyme and its subunit(s) were estimated to be 126,000 and 32,000, respectively. The purification of delta 3,5, delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase completes the characterization of the enzymes functioning in the NADPH-dependent pathway for the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from odd-numbered carbon atoms. This novel pathway may not be operative in peroxisomes because delta 3,5, delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase was only detected in mitochondria. Substrates of this pathway are 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs formed from 5-enoyl-CoAs by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Two sequential isomerization reactions catalyzed by delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoAs isomerase and delta 3,5, delta 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, respectively, convert 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs to 2,4-dienoyl-CoAs, which are reduced by NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) before reentering the beta-oxidation spiral."
https://openalex.org/W1588430604,"The characteristics of plasminogen activation by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored urokinase were evaluated and compared with those reported previously for receptor-bound urokinase. When expressed in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, GPI anchoring of single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scu-PA) potentiated plasmin generation as compared with GPI-anchored scu-PA that had been released into solution from the cell surface by enzymatic cleavage of the GPI anchor (released scu-PA). The potentiation of plasmin generation by GPI-anchored scu-PA was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 6-aminohexanoic acid, a lysine analog, suggesting that the augmentation of plasmin generation by GPI-anchored scu-PA was dependent on simultaneous binding of plasminogen to the cell surface. GPI-anchored two-chain urokinase (tcu)-PA cleaved a peptide substrate at a rate equivalent to that of released urokinase. However, at a plasminogen concentration of 0.5 microM, GPI-anchored tcu-PA activated plasminogen less rapidly than did released urokinase. Modeling of kinetics of individual reactions revealed that cell-associated plasminogen activation by GPI-anchored tcu-PA was characterized by a Km of approximately 0.15 microM. This value of Km was 70-fold below that for activation of solution plasminogen by GPI-anchored urokinase. There was a concomitant decrease in Vmax for plasminogen activation by anchored tcu-PA. These alterations in kinetic parameters are similar to those reported previously for the activation of plasminogen by receptor-bound tcu-PA. In addition, GPI-anchored tcu-PA exhibited a modest resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 inactivation. The enzymatic characteristics of GPI-anchored urokinase reported here resemble closely those reported previously for receptor-bound urokinase. These data suggest that the urokinase receptor may regulate plasmin generation through a relatively nonspecific localization of urokinase to the cell surface rather than through any intrinsic property of the urokinase receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1589954808,"Three clones of NC1 of alpha 3(IV) collagen, named Q1, L5, and V, were isolated from human kidney; these predict three variant alpha 3(IV) NC1 domains of 232-, 60-, and 199-amino acid residues, respectively, with unique COOH-termini. The human collagen IV gene (COL4A3) was isolated and characterized, and it was shown that the cDNA variants arose from alternative splicing by deletion of exon 4 in L5 and deletion of exon 2 in V. The mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed in fetal and adult human kidney with Q1 the major species. Exon 4-L5 lacked 183 residues from the carboxyl terminus with a frameshift producing a unique 11-amino acid terminal peptide. In exon 2-V a frameshift resulted in a unique V carboxyl terminus of 53 novel peptides with a new glycosylation site. The size of recombinant proteins indicated the frameshifts and new stop codons were as predicted. The multiple forms of the alpha 3(IV) NC1 region may contribute to autoimmune glomerular disease and hereditary nephritis, in which this portion of the collagen IV molecule is thought to play an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1480413910,"We report that leukotriene A4, the electrophilic product of 5-lipoxygenase catalysis, irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. Leukotriene A4 inhibits 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation by human neutrophils and differentiated granulocytic HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values = 22.4 +/- 2.5 and 29.0 +/- 8.0 microM, respectively. Recovery of cellular enzymatic activity is negligible (< 6%) following inactivation. Leukotriene A4 inactivates cellular 5-lipoxygenase without inhibiting its translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, suggesting that it impairs catalysis without impairing formation of the complex between 5-lipoxygenase and its membrane-associated activating protein. Consistent with this, leukotriene A4 inactivates purified 5-lipoxygenase from human neutrophils, via saturable, pseudo first-order kinetics with a rate constant, ki = 0.14 min-1 and a dissociation constant, Ki = 2.1 +/- 0.7 microM. Purified 5-lipoxygenase incubated with [3H]arachidonic acid incorporated a radiolabeled species that was not removed by electrophoresis under reduced denaturing conditions. Preincubation with leukotriene A4 diminished the incorporation of radiolabeled material, consistent with irreversible modification of 5-lipoxygenase by its metastable product, leukotriene A4. This unusual product inactivation mechanism may contribute to the decline in 5-lipoxygenase activity observed during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1595838944,"Cell type-specific expression of the major differentiated products of alpha (glucagon) and beta (insulin) cells are regulated by sequences found within their 5'-flanking region. Specific transcription of the insulin gene appears to be principally controlled by a single cis-acting DNA element, termed the insulin control element (ICE). The ICE activator acts in combination with other positive regulatory factors that interact within this region to generate the correct, cell type-specific expression. In the present study, we show that the ICE activator is not only present but is functionally active in the islet glucagon-producing alpha cell line, alpha TC6. Analysis of the expression of various transfected insulin enhancer expression plasmids demonstrated that the insulin enhancer is active in alpha TC6 cells, although at a lower level than in beta cells. The reduced transcription from these constructs appears to be a consequence of the lack of other essential positive regulator(s). The alpha TC6 cells were also shown to display neuronal-like properties. Since islet cells appear to evolve from an alpha-like precursor cell that transiently expresses neuronal cell markers, these results would indicate that the ICE activator factor is induced before transcription of the insulin gene in the developing islet."

However, the mechanism of CD45-mediated signal transduction and the identity of CD45-associated proteins have remained unclear. A CD45-associated 30-kDA phosphorylated protein (CD45-AP) was purified by virtue of its specific association with CD45, and its mouse cDNA was cloned by using the internal amino acid sequence information. In vitro translated CD45-AP bound specifically to CD45. CD45-AP appears to be leukocyte-specific and shares no significant homology with presently known sequences. The predicted sequence contains no consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites or conserved sequences of GTP-binding proteins. CD45-AP may act as an adapter molecule for CD45-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1498434249,"In the presence of inducer molecules produced by wounded plants, the VirA/VirG two-component positive regulatory system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens initiates transcription of virulence genes required for crown gall tumor formation. Exactly how this system enables the bacterium to respond to an environmental signal is not known, but phosphorylation of VirA and VirG plays a role. To analyze further the function of VirA, we chemically mutagenized the virA gene. Two mutants that activate vir transcription without the plant inducer acetosyringone were found; these mutants alter VirA function by distinct mechanisms. One mutant functions entirely independently of acetosyringone, whereas the activity of the second mutant is enhanced by acetosyringone. Both mutants function best at acid pH, but respond differently to specific monosaccharides that stimulate induction by wild-type VirA. Both mutant phenotypes are dominant over wild-type VirA, and both need the conserved histidine at the autophosphorylation site for strong inducer-independent vir transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1562438702,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) down-regulates the anticoagulant cofactor activity of protein S in the protein C pathway since free protein S but not the protein S:C4BP complex is anticoagulantly active. To identify beta chain residues responsible for binding protein S, synthetic overlapping pentadecapeptides covering the entire 1-235 sequence were tested as inhibitors of complex formation. The peptide comprising residues 31-45 (VCIKGYHLVGKKTLF) from the first short consensus repeat domain inhibited the binding of C4BP to protein S with half-maximal inhibition at 20-45 microM, and studies suggested the sequence of YxLVG was crucial. Peptide beta(31-45) specifically inhibited the APC cofactor activity of purified protein S in Xa-1-stage coagulation assays with 50% inhibition at 15 microM peptide. Peptide beta(31-45) and related peptides such as beta(34-42) inhibited the binding of protein S to an antipeptide monoclonal antibody made against residues 420-434 of protein S (monoclonal antibody LJ-56). Polyclonal anti-beta(31-45) peptide antibodies inhibited complex formation. Dose-dependent binding studies showed that protein S bound directly to immobilized peptide beta(31-45). These results show that residues 31-45 of the C4BP beta chain provide a binding site for protein S, and they suggest that the C4BP beta chain residues 34-42 are located near residues 420-434 of protein S in the protein S:C4BP complex."

https://openalex.org/W1503618461,"The troponin I (TnI) inhibitory region (residues 104-115) was synthesized with alpha-14C-labeled Gly-104 and a covalently linked benzoylbenzoyl (BB) moiety at the N terminus to yield a photoactivatable radioactive peptide (BBIp). BBIp was cross-linked to rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) to locate the binding site on TnC. The TnC/BBIp mixture was subjected to photolysis in aqueous buffer at pH 7.5 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. A covalent (1:1) cross-linked protein-peptide complex (TnC.BBIp) was isolated in both cases. The cross-linked complex was digested with trypsin, and the peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The radioactive cross-linked peptide was isolated and further characterized by peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry before and after cyanogen bromide cleavage. The results indicated that Met-155 of TnC was cross-linked to the BB moiety of BBIp in either the presence or absence of Ca2+. The biological activity of both the BBIp peptide and the cross-linked TnC.BBIp complex was studied and a model of the TnC.inhibitory peptide complex was derived using molecular dynamic and energy minimization calculations."
https://openalex.org/W1553653726,"Nucleosome ordering on a variety of replicating plasmids, assembled into chromatin in transfected COS-1 cells, was studied by micrococcal nuclease digestion of isolated nuclei. Generally, no more than three well defined multiples of a unit nucleosome repeat, which resembled the first three bands of the (187 +/- 5 base pair (bp)) cellular chromatin ladder, could be detected in constructs that contained a near-minimal SV40 replication origin. In contrast, constructs that additionally contained the SV40 early region exhibited significantly more regular nucleosome arrangements. In some cases, eight to nine multiples of a 203 +/- 5-bp repeat could be resolved. The presence of the SV40 early region was necessary for physiological nucleosome alignment over the SV40 late and ori regions, or onto adjacent pBR327 DNA. In an in vitro chromatin assembly system, using purified chicken erythrocyte histones plus polyglutamic acid, a portion of SV40 DNA became packaged into a highly ordered 200 +/- 5-bp nucleosome array, which encompassed the early region and extended for about 2800 bp. The data suggest that in the cell nucleus, nucleosome ordering on SV40 DNA might spread from sequences in the early region, close to where transcription terminates, probably as a consequence of histone H1-nucleosome interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1523760018,"Abstract We have previously established that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the expression of new specific LPS-binding sites (LpsR) in mouse bone marrow cells (BMC). We now show that exposure of human BMC to LPS elicits the production of both CD14 molecules (detectable with monoclonal antibody My4) and LpsR (detectable with fluorescein isothiocyanate-LPS). Pretreatment of stimulated human BMC with My4 inhibited the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-LPS. The stimulation of human BMC, but not mouse BMC, required the presence of serum. Other characteristics of mouse and human BMC examined were very similar. Their inducible LpsR interacted with the lipid moieties of LPS and Leishmania donovani lipophosphoglycan and with a soluble preparation of peptidoglycan. Moreover, mouse and human LpsR were susceptible to treatment with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), thus suggesting that both are PI-anchored CD14 molecules. Neither LpsR appeared able to interact with a synthetic LPS antagonist (compound PPDm2) structurally related to the lipid region of LPS. However, PPDm2 blocked LPS-induced expression of LpsR in both BMC. Furthermore, in both species, pretreatment of BMC with PI-PLC did not prevent the cells from expressing LpsR in response to LPS. The results support the hypothesis that the elicited LpsR of mouse and human BMC is an inducible form of CD14, whereas the putative signaling LPS receptor of these cells is not CD14 or any other PI-anchored molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1546669025,"Cytochrome b was identified as one of the ubiquinone-binding proteins in bovine heart mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase by photoaffinity labeling using 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyl[3H]-octyl)-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]azido-Q). The [3H]azido-Q-labeled cytochrome b protein was purified to homogeneity from the azido-Q-labeled ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase by a procedure involving Triton X-100 and urea treatment, calcium phosphate column chromatography, acetone precipitation, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide-cholate extraction, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified cytochrome b protein containing 0.5 mol of azido-Q/mol of protein was subjected to reductive carboxymethylation and succinylation prior to digestion by chymotrypsin. Two azido-Q-linked peptides with retention times of 47.1 and 49.0 min were obtained by high performance liquid chromatographic separation. Partial amino-terminal amino acid sequences of these two peptides were determined to be GATVI- and ALVADL-, indicating that these two chymotryptic peptides are from amino residues 142-155 and 326-336. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies against two synthetic ubiquinone-binding peptides, NH2-G-A-T-V-I-T-N-L-L-S-COOH (P-47) and NH2-W-A-L-V-A-D-L-L-T-L-T-W-I-COOH (P-49), were generated in rabbits and purified. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the purified antibodies against P-47 reacted with cytochrome b-containing reductases and purified cytochrome b protein. Antibodies against P-47 inhibited activities of succinate-cytochrome c and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductases only when they were incubated with phospholipid-depleted reductases prior to the replenishment with phospholipid. No inhibition was observed with incubation with phospholipid-containing reductases, indicating that this peptide involved in ubiquinone binding is buried in a phospholipid environment."
https://openalex.org/W2116840132,"Enhancement of energy metabolism is fundamental to the developmental programs of many cell types. This work examines the molecular mechanisms that mediate changes in energy metabolism during differentiation of osteoblastic cells. When the rat osteoblastic cell line, ROS 17/2.8, is induced to differentiate with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, expression of creatine kinase-b (ck-b), a pivotal enzyme in energy metabolism, is enhanced. Maximum enhancement occurs at 48 h of induction with 10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 when creatine kinase activity is 2.1-fold over uninduced cells. This is associated with a 2-fold increase in transcription rate and the formation of a second protein-DNA complex on the ck-b gene promoter that is supplementary to the one present in undifferentiated cells. In addition, the contribution of posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms is suggested by (1) the increase in ck-b mRNA abundance exceeds that of transcription rate, indicating an increase in message stability, (2) the increase in ck-b mRNA precedes and exceeds that of protein activity, indicating translational modulation, and (3) RNA mobility-shift assays indicate that a cytosolic factor in ROS 17/2.8 cells interacts specifically with the highly conserved 3'-untranslated region of the ck-b mRNA. We have previously reported that such an interaction mediates translational control (Ch'ng, J. L. C., Shoemaker, D. L., Schimmel, P., and Holmes, E.W. (1990) Science 248, 1003-1006). The physiological roles of these regulatory mechanisms during osteoblast differentiation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1578843695,"Gastrin gene expression in the pancreatic islets is developmentally regulated and occurs largely during fetal life. Deletional analysis of transiently transfected rat insulinoma cells with gastrin 5'-flanking sequences in luciferase reporter genes demonstrated that the gastrin promoter sequence proximal to -111 base pairs (bp) contains the cis-regulatory elements necessary for maximal transcription. Mutational analysis identified the sequence CCCCACCCCA (-109 to -100 bp) as a positive cis-regulatory element (CACC) located 5' to a previously described negative element (-100 to -90 bp) and E-box positive element at -82 bp. Multimers of the CACC element in a heterologous promoter activated transcription independent of the other cis-regulatory elements. CACC binding proteins were purified from insulinoma cell nuclear extracts by cation exchange and affinity chromatography. Southwestern blot of nuclear extracts identified a 70-kDa CACC-binding protein. Mutational analysis of the CACC element showed a close correlation between DNA binding of this protein and transcriptional activation. Transcriptional activation by multimers of the CACC element in a heterologous promoter was detected in a variety of cell lines but was strongest in those of islet lineage. Likewise, the presence of the 70-kDa CACC-binding protein was found in many cell lines but was most abundant in the insulinoma cells. The CACC-binding protein has not been previously identified among the known pancreatic regulatory factors and may have an important role in the developmental expression of gastrin."
https://openalex.org/W1495890871,"Dietary copper deficiency impairs cardiovascular function by depression of catecholamine metabolism, and alteration of the structure and function of cardiac mitochondria. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of cellular homeostatic proteins that are induced in vascular tissue by catecholaminergic transmission after exposure to stress. We investigated the effects of dietary copper deficiency on the induction and accumulation of HSPs in several cardiovascular tissues. Stress-induced levels of aortic HSP70 mRNA were reduced in copper-deficient (CuD) rats when compared with copper-adequate (CuA) controls. Cocaine-induced HSP70 mRNA accumulation was not different between CuA and CuD rats, suggesting that reduced HSP70 levels in restrained CuD animals may result from altered catecholaminergic neurotransmission. The level of HSP60 mRNA was specifically reduced in the atria of CuD rats, which may be associated with altered mitochondrial structure and function. These results describe a novel relationship between dietary copper deficiency and the expression of highly conserved cellular stress response proteins. Loss of these essential homeostatic proteins in vascular tissue may contribute to the impairment of cardiovascular function known to accompany copper deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1578717770,"Reaction of pig muscle aldose reductase with phenylglyoxal resulted in the chemical modification of 2 arginine residues with accompanying loss of catalytic activity. The amino acid sequences of radioactive peptides resulting from the reaction of aldose reductase with [14C]phenylglyoxal followed by tryptic digestion and high performance liquid chromatography separation allowed identification of the modified arginine residues as R268 and R293. In the presence of the coenzyme NADP+, R268 is protected from modification by phenylglyoxal, while R293 becomes hyper-reactive. Phenylglyoxal modification of aldose reductase is slowed 3-fold by the presence of the coenzyme analog ADPRP; however, both arginines are still modified. These chemical modification results are in complete accord with the previously determined crystal structures of human and porcine aldose reductase complexed with NADPH, NADP+, and ADPRP. These structures indicate that R268 is located at the adenosine binding site, salt bridged to the 2'-phosphate group of NADP(H) and ADPRP. Arginine 293 is near the surface of the enzyme and is part of the C-terminal loop. In the apoenzyme or the ADPRP complex, R293 is partially protected by loop 7; upon binding NADP(H), loop 7 folds down over the coenzyme, thus exposing R293 to solvent. Our modification studies provide further evidence of the conformational change that occurs during the aldose reductase catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1594760180,"Calcium-activated, voltage-independent Cl- currents have been demonstrated in human neutrophils (Krause, K.-H., and Welsh, M.J. (1990) J. Clin. Invest. 85, 491-498). The activation is mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and not by protein kinase C (PKC) (Schumann, M., Gardner, A.P., and Raffin, T.A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2134-2140). It is not known whether there are Ca(2+)-independent, voltage-dependent Cl- currents in these cells. Using K(+)-free solutions and patch-clamp recordings from human neutrophils, we separated the whole cell Cl- current. Base-line Cl- currents of unstimulated cells were small and displayed time and voltage independence; some showed voltage dependence. With a Ca(2+)-free pipette solution, bath-administered 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 0.1 microM N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) for 10 s induced augmented Cl- currents with voltage- and time-dependent outwardly rectifying properties. The threshold voltage of tail Cl- current activation was -69 mV. With a pipette solution containing 0.1 mM Ca2+, bath-administered 0.1 microM fMLP, 1 microM PMA, or 1 microM Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for 30 s induced augmented Cl- currents with voltage-independent properties. With intracellular application of 5 microM PKC inhibitor PKC(19-36), voltage-dependent Cl- currents were no longer activated by PMA or fMLP. Similar application of 5 microM PKC noninhibitory analog [Glu27]PKC(19-36) did not block PMA (or fMLP)-induced Cl- currents. These results indicate that, in addition to Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents, human neutrophils have voltage-dependent Cl- currents which are regulated by PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1500514988,"The role of acceptor stem base pairs in determining the identity of Escherichia coli tRNA(Trp) was examined by complementation of an E. coli strain containing a temperature-sensitive tRNA(Trp) gene (trpTts) and by monitoring aminoacylation levels in vivo. All derivatives of tRNA(Trp) containing substitutions at the first 3 base pairs in the acceptor stem complemented the trpTts mutation at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C). However, three acceptor stem derivatives (tRNA(Trp)/C1.G72, tRNA(Trp)/C2.G71, and tRNA(Trp)/A3.U70) required overexpression for growth at 42 degrees C. Northern analysis of these derivatives following acid/urea gel electrophoresis showed no defects in tRNA aminoacylation at the nonpermissive temperature. Instead, these tRNAs appear to be defective in translation. This was suggested by the weak opal suppressor activities of the corresponding tRNA(UCATrp) derivatives. These results demonstrate that the three terminal acceptor stem base pairs do not contribute to the identity of tRNA(Trp). Substitution of the C1.A72 base pair in a methionine initiator tRNA containing the tryptophan anticodon and discriminator base (tRNA(CCAfMet)/G73) with A1.U72, the base pair found in tRNA(Trp), or G1.C72 resulted in the conversion of these tRNAs into tryptophan-inserting elongator tRNAs in vivo. However, changes to U1.A72 or C1.G72 in tRNA(CCAfMet)/G73 resulted in misaminoacylation and/or defects in translation. Our data indicate that the A1.U72 base pair is a context-dependent, negative identity element of tRNA(Trp)."
https://openalex.org/W1659211119,"Abstract Adenovirus preterminal protein (pTP) exists as a heterodimer with the viral DNA polymerase (AdPol) and becomes covalently linked to a dCMP residue during initiation of DNA replication. The in vivo phosphorylation of pTP could be demonstrated when pTP is overproduced using recombinant vaccinia viruses, or by a large scale metabolic labeling of adenovirus 2 (Ad2)-infected HeLa cells. Phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid obtained by acid hydrolysis of 32P-labeled pTP immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled HeLa cells infected with either Ad2 or recombinant vaccinia virus. Tryptic peptide maps of pTP expressed using recombinant vaccinia virus system in HeLa cells revealed that phosphorylation of pTP occurred on multiple sites. Dephosphorylation of pTP with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase resulted in a significant decrease in its activity in the in vitro DNA replication initiation assays. Further characterization of the phosphatase-treated pTP indicated that although dephosphorylation did not affect its interaction with AdPol, the specific recognition of the DNA replication origin by pTP was significantly reduced as determined by gel electrophoresis-based DNA mobility shift assays."

Two additional metabolites were produced when pupae were injected with either 3DFG, 3DFS, 3DFF, or 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-mannose (3DFM). One of these was identified as 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-mannitol (3DFML) by 13C NMR using [1-13C]3DFM and [1-13C]3DFG as metabolic probes. H. cecropia pupae injected with D-glucose labeled with 13C at C-1, C-2, or C-3 and subsequently analyzed by 13C NMR clearly demonstrated the ability to generate sorbitol and fructose. In contrast, gas chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis of hemolymph failed to detect sorbitol in pupae reared under natural conditions (i.e. in the absence of injected enriched sugars). Thus, although H. cecropia pupae have the enzymic machinery to biosynthesize sorbitol, they do not appear to accumulate high steady-state concentrations of this polyol over the temperature range studied. The specificity of the enzymes involved in alditol biosynthesis in H. cecropia was examined by 13C NMR with a wide range of aldoses enriched with 13C at C-1. Pupae were capable of converting these sugars to their corresponding [1-13C]alditols, indicating that nonspecific dehydrogenase(s), in addition to aldose reductase, is(are) involved in polyol biosynthesis in H. cecropia pupae."
