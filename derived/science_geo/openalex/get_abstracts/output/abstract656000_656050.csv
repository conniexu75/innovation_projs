https://openalex.org/W3042374389,"After two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3041502662,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has dramatically expedited global vaccine development efforts1–3, most targeting the viral ‘spike’ glycoprotein (S). S localizes on the virion surface and mediates recognition of cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4–6. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block S–ACE2 interaction7–9, or indirectly prevent membrane fusion10, constitute an attractive modality for vaccine-elicited protection11. However, although prototypic S-based vaccines show promise in animal models12–14, the immunogenic properties of S in humans are poorly resolved. In this study, we characterized humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell (cTFH) immunity against spike in recovered patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that S-specific antibodies, memory B cells and cTFH are consistently elicited after SARS-CoV-2 infection, demarking robust humoral immunity and positively associated with plasma neutralizing activity. Comparatively low frequencies of B cells or cTFH specific for the receptor binding domain of S were elicited. Notably, the phenotype of S-specific cTFH differentiated subjects with potent neutralizing responses, providing a potential biomarker of potency for S-based vaccines entering the clinic. Overall, although patients who recovered from COVID-19 displayed multiple hallmarks of effective immune recognition of S, the wide spectrum of neutralizing activity observed suggests that vaccines might require strategies to selectively target the most potent neutralizing epitopes. In a cohort of recovered patients with COVID-19, virus spike-specific antibodies were consistently elicited, but neutralizing activity was highly variable and inversely correlated with the proportion of CCR6+CXCR3− spike-specific circulating follicular helper T cells."

However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3041250095,"Cerebellar dysfunction has been demonstrated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, the circuits underlying cerebellar contributions to ASD-relevant behaviors remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice; showed that the mPFC mediates cerebellum-regulated social and repetitive/inflexible behaviors; and showed disruptions in connectivity between these regions in multiple mouse models of ASD-linked genes and in individuals with ASD. We delineated a circuit from cerebellar cortical areas Right crus 1 (Rcrus1) and posterior vermis through the cerebellar nuclei and ventromedial thalamus and culminating in the mPFC. Modulation of this circuit induced social deficits and repetitive behaviors, whereas activation of Purkinje cells (PCs) in Rcrus1 and posterior vermis improved social preference impairments and repetitive/inflexible behaviors, respectively, in male PC-Tsc1 mutant mice. These data raise the possibility that these circuits might provide neuromodulatory targets for the treatment of ASD. Kelly et al. describe two cerebellum–thalamus–mPFC pathways in mice that regulate social and repetitive behavior. PC activation in Rcrus1 and posterior vermis improved social and reduced repetitive behaviors, respectively, in PC-Tsc1 mutant mice."
https://openalex.org/W3042004622,"Disruption of systemic homeostasis by either chronic or acute stressors, such as obesity1 or surgery2, alters cancer pathogenesis. Patients with cancer, particularly those with breast cancer, can be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to treatment toxicity and changes in lifestyle behaviors3-5. While elevated risk and incidence of cardiovascular events in breast cancer is well established, whether such events impact cancer pathogenesis is not known. Here we show that myocardial infarction (MI) accelerates breast cancer outgrowth and cancer-specific mortality in mice and humans. In mouse models of breast cancer, MI epigenetically reprogrammed Ly6Chi monocytes in the bone marrow reservoir to an immunosuppressive phenotype that was maintained at the transcriptional level in monocytes in both the circulation and tumor. In parallel, MI increased circulating Ly6Chi monocyte levels and recruitment to tumors and depletion of these cells abrogated MI-induced tumor growth. Furthermore, patients with early-stage breast cancer who experienced cardiovascular events after cancer diagnosis had increased risk of recurrence and cancer-specific death. These preclinical and clinical results demonstrate that MI induces alterations in systemic homeostasis, triggering cross-disease communication that accelerates breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3041039796,"Cas12a RNA-guided endonucleases are promising tools for multiplexed genetic perturbations because they can process multiple guide RNAs expressed as a single transcript, and subsequently cleave target DNA. However, their widespread adoption has lagged behind Cas9-based strategies due to low activity and the lack of a well-validated pooled screening toolkit. In the present study, we describe the optimization of enhanced Cas12a from Acidaminococcus (enAsCas12a) for pooled, combinatorial genetic screens in human cells. By assaying the activity of thousands of guides, we refine on-target design rules and develop a comprehensive set of off-target rules to predict and exclude promiscuous guides. We also identify 38 direct repeat variants that can substitute for the wild-type sequence. We validate our optimized AsCas12a toolkit by screening for synthetic lethalities in OVCAR8 and A375 cancer cells, discovering an interaction between MARCH5 and WSB2. Finally, we show that enAsCas12a delivers similar performance to Cas9 in genome-wide dropout screens but at greatly reduced library size, which will facilitate screens in challenging models. Improved Cas12a variants and sgRNA design rules enhance genome-wide screens."
https://openalex.org/W3041920105,"Visualizing biomolecular and cellular processes inside intact living organisms is a major goal of chemical biology. However, existing molecular biosensors, based primarily on fluorescent emission, have limited utility in this context due to the scattering of light by tissue. In contrast, ultrasound can easily image deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution, but lacks the biosensors needed to connect its contrast to the activity of specific biomolecules such as enzymes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first genetically encodable acoustic biosensors—molecules that ‘light up’ in ultrasound imaging in response to protease activity. These biosensors are based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles, which we engineered to produce nonlinear ultrasound signals in response to the activity of three different protease enzymes. We demonstrate the ability of these biosensors to be imaged in vitro, inside engineered probiotic bacteria, and in vivo in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Engineering cleavage sites into gas vesicle proteins enables protease-responsive regulation of gas vesicle mechanics and activates them as ultrasound contrast agents for imaging applications in cells and living mice."
https://openalex.org/W3041276616,"Engineered T cells are effective therapies against a range of malignancies, but current approaches rely on autologous T cells, which are difficult and expensive to manufacture. Efforts to develop potent allogeneic T cells that are not rejected by the recipient’s immune system require abrogating both T- and natural killer (NK)-cell responses, which eliminate foreign cells through various mechanisms. In the present study, we engineered a receptor that mediates deletion of activated host T and NK cells, preventing rejection of allogeneic T cells. Our alloimmune defense receptor (ADR) selectively recognizes 4-1BB, a cell surface receptor temporarily upregulated by activated lymphocytes. ADR-expressing T cells resist cellular rejection by targeting alloreactive lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, while sparing resting lymphocytes. Cells co-expressing chimeric antigen receptors and ADRs persisted in mice and produced sustained tumor eradication in two mouse models of allogeneic T-cell therapy of hematopoietic and solid cancers. This approach enables generation of rejection-resistant, ‘off-the-shelf’, allogeneic T-cell products to produce long-term therapeutic benefit in immunocompetent recipients. Off-the-shelf CAR T cells avoid immune rejection in mouse models of allogeneic cancer cell therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3041329673,"Complement-mediated synapse elimination has emerged as an important process in both brain development and neurological diseases, but whether neurons express complement inhibitors that protect synapses against complement-mediated synapse elimination remains unknown. Here, we show that the sushi domain protein SRPX2 is a neuronally expressed complement inhibitor that regulates complement-dependent synapse elimination. SRPX2 directly binds to C1q and blocks its activity, and SRPX2-/Y mice show increased C3 deposition and microglial synapse engulfment. They also show a transient decrease in synapse numbers and increase in retinogeniculate axon segregation in the lateral geniculate nucleus. In the somatosensory cortex, SRPX2-/Y mice show decreased thalamocortical synapse numbers and increased spine pruning. C3-/-;SRPX2-/Y double-knockout mice exhibit phenotypes associated with C3-/- mice rather than SRPX2-/Y mice, which indicates that C3 is necessary for the effect of SRPX2 on synapse elimination. Together, these results show that SRPX2 protects synapses against complement-mediated elimination in both the thalamus and the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3041065315,"Engineered genetic systems are prone to failure when their genetic parts contain repetitive sequences. Designing many nonrepetitive genetic parts with desired functionalities remains a difficult challenge with high computational complexity. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Nonrepetitive Parts Calculator to rapidly generate thousands of highly nonrepetitive genetic parts from specified design constraints, including promoters, ribosome-binding sites and terminators. As a demonstration, we designed and experimentally characterized 4,350 nonrepetitive bacterial promoters with transcription rates that varied across a 820,000-fold range, and 1,722 highly nonrepetitive yeast promoters with transcription rates that varied across a 25,000-fold range. We applied machine learning to explain how specific interactions controlled the promoters’ transcription rates. We also show that using nonrepetitive genetic parts substantially reduces homologous recombination, resulting in greater genetic stability. An algorithm to design nonrepetitive genetic parts enables synthetic biologists to reliably engineer stable circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3041065302,"Patients awaiting lung transplantation face high wait-list mortality, as injury precludes the use of most donor lungs. Although ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is able to recover marginal quality donor lungs, extension of normothermic support beyond 6 h has been challenging. Here we demonstrate that acutely injured human lungs declined for transplantation, including a lung that failed to recover on EVLP, can be recovered by cross-circulation of whole blood between explanted human lungs and a Yorkshire swine. This xenogeneic platform provided explanted human lungs a supportive, physiologic milieu and systemic regulation that resulted in functional and histological recovery after 24 h of normothermic support. Our findings suggest that cross-circulation can serve as a complementary approach to clinical EVLP to recover injured donor lungs that could not otherwise be utilized for transplantation, as well as a translational research platform for immunomodulation and advanced organ bioengineering. In a new strategy for increasing the availability of lungs for transplantation, human lungs declined for transplantation because of their poor quality can be recuperated by connecting them to the circulation of a pig."
https://openalex.org/W3040701282,"A central question related to virtually all social decisions is how animals integrate sex-specific cues from conspecifics. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging in mice, we find that sex information is represented in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) across excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These cells form a distributed code that differentiates the sex of conspecifics and is strengthened with social experience. While males and females both represent sex in the dmPFC, male mice show stronger encoding of female cues, and the relative strength of these sex representations predicts sex preference behavior. Using activity-dependent optogenetic manipulations of natively active ensembles, we further show that these specific representations modulate preference behavior toward males and females. Together, these results define a functional role for native representations of sex in shaping social behavior and reveal a neural mechanism underlying male- versus female-directed sociality."

https://openalex.org/W3042924585,"The economic and social impacts due to diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in the latest years have been significant. Currently, no specific treatment or commercial vaccine exists for the control and prevention of arboviruses, thereby making entomological characterization fundamental in combating diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The morphological identification of mosquitos includes a visual exam of the samples. It is time consuming and requires adequately trained professionals. Accordingly, the development of a new automated method for realizing mosquito-perception and -classification is becoming increasingly essential. Therefore, in this study, a computational model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to extract features from the images of mosquitoes and then classify the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. In addition, the model was trained to detect the mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. To train CNNs to perform the automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, a dataset, which included 7,561 images of the target mosquitoes and 1,187 images of other insects, was acquired. Various neural networks, such as Xception and DenseNet, were used for developing the automatic-classification model based on images. A structured optimization process of random search and grid search was developed to select the hyperparameters set and increase the accuracy of the model. In addition, strategies to eliminate overfitting were implemented to increase the generalization of the model. The optimized model, during the test phase, obtained the balanced accuracy (BA) of 93.5% in classifying the target mosquitoes and other insects and the BA of 97.3% in detecting the mosquitoes of the genus Aedes in comparison to Culex. The results provide fundamental information for performing the automatic morphological classification of mosquito species. Using a CNN-embedded entomological tool is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and non-taxonomists for identifying insects that can transmit infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3041224300,"Engineering resource allocation in biological systems is an ongoing challenge. Organisms allocate resources for ensuring survival, reducing the productivity of synthetic biology functions. Here we present a new approach for engineering the resource allocation of Escherichia coli by rationally modifying its transcriptional regulatory network. Our method (ReProMin) identifies the minimal set of genetic interventions that maximizes the savings in cell resources. To this end, we categorized transcription factors according to the essentiality of its targets and we used proteomic data to rank them. We designed the combinatorial removal of transcription factors that maximize the release of resources. Our resulting strain containing only three mutations, theoretically releasing 0.5% of its proteome, had higher proteome budget, increased production of an engineered metabolic pathway and showed that the regulatory interventions are highly specific. This approach shows that combining proteomic and regulatory data is an effective way of optimizing strains using conventional molecular methods. An econometric model built on regulatory networks and calibrated by proteomics data identifies nonessential transcription factors that when deleted in Escherichia coli result in a strain with an expanded proteome for engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W3042658591,"Barth syndrome is a mitochondrial myopathy resulting from mutations in the tafazzin (TAZ) gene encoding a phospholipid transacylase required for cardiolipin remodeling. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for the function of numerous mitochondrial proteins and processes. However, it is unclear how tafazzin deficiency impacts cardiac mitochondrial metabolism. To address this question while avoiding confounding effects of cardiomyopathy on mitochondrial phenotype, we utilized Taz-shRNA knockdown (TazKD) mice, which exhibit defective cardiolipin remodeling and respiratory supercomplex instability characteristic of human Barth syndrome but normal cardiac function into adulthood. Consistent with previous reports from other models, mitochondrial H2O2 emission and oxidative damage were greater in TazKD than in wild-type (WT) hearts, but there were no differences in oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency or membrane potential. Fatty acid and pyruvate oxidation capacities were 40–60% lower in TazKD mitochondria, but an up-regulation of glutamate oxidation supported respiration rates approximating those with pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine in WT. Deficiencies in mitochondrial CoA and shifts in the cardiac acyl-CoA profile paralleled changes in fatty acid oxidation enzymes and acyl-CoA thioesterases, suggesting limitations of CoA availability or “trapping” in TazKD mitochondrial metabolism. Incubation of TazKD mitochondria with exogenous CoA partially rescued pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine oxidation capacities, implicating dysregulation of CoA-dependent intermediary metabolism rather than respiratory chain defects in the bioenergetic impacts of tafazzin deficiency. These findings support links among cardiolipin abnormalities, respiratory supercomplex instability, and mitochondrial oxidant production and shed new light on the distinct metabolic consequences of tafazzin deficiency in the mammalian heart.

This phenotypic heterogeneity suggests that variations in tafazzin function or compensatory adaptations that preserve cardiac function must occur across affected individuals and highlights an incomplete understanding of how cardiolipin abnormalities impact the heart. To investigate the effects of tafazzin deficiency on the mammalian heart, an inducible Taz short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown mouse was developed to overcome the embryonic lethality of full genetic ablation (24Acehan D.

Understanding how tafazzin-deficient mice preserve basal cardiac function despite persistent cardiolipin abnormalities and respiratory chain defects could reveal novel strategies for attenuating the development of cardiomyopathy in BTHS. These mice also provide an ideal model for resolving the impact of aberrant cardiolipin remodeling on cardiac mitochondrial function without the confounding influence of cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define the cardiac mitochondrial phenotype of Taz shRNA mice through an integration of functional studies, cardiac metabolite analyses, and mitochondrial proteomic profiling, with a particular focus on elucidating the mechanism of substrate-specific respiratory impairment and identifying compensatory adaptations that manifest prior to the development of cardiac dysfunction. Doxycycline-inducible Taz shRNA mice originally generated on a C57Bl/6 background at TaconicArtemis, GmbH (Köln, Germany) were obtained from Dr. Zaza Khuchua (University of Cincinnati) (24Acehan D.

To confirm this, electrospray ionization Mass spectrometry was performed on cardiac mitochondrial phospholipids, which demonstrated expected losses of total CL and L4CL with accumulation of monolysocardiolipin in TazKD versus WT mice within this age range (Fig. S1, C–E). Similarly, gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acids present in the cardiolipin fraction isolated by normal phase liquid chromatography revealed a predominant loss of linoleic acid with higher monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids in TazKD versus WT mitochondria, reflective of abundant nascent (nonremodeled) cardiolipin species (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, significant changes were also observed in the acyl composition of mitochondrial phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. S1, F and G) and the total phospholipid fraction (Fig. 1C), consistent with broader effects of tafazzin deficiency on mitochondrial membrane composition than cardiolipin (22Kiebish M.A. Yang K.

Phospholipid compositional changes were nearly identical between subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IF) mitochondria, indicating similar effects of tafazzin deficiency in these major cardiac mitochondrial subpopulations.

In this study, renal IR was induced in female C57BL/6 mice after melatonin administration. Renal function, histological damage, inflammatory infiltration, cytokine production, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, autophagy changing, apoptosis levels, and autophagy-associated intracellular signaling pathway were assessed to evaluate the impact of antecedent melatonin treatment on IR-induced renal injury. The administration of melatonin resulted in significantly preserved renal function, and the protective effect was associated with ameliorated oxidative stress, limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Moreover, autophagic flux was increased after melatonin administration while the apoptosis levels were decreased in the melatonin-pretreated mice. Using TAK-242 and CRX-527, we confirmed that MyD88-dependent TLR4 and MEK/ERK/mTORC1 signaling participated in melatonin-induced autophagy in IR mice. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence that antecedent melatonin treatment provides protection for the kidney against IR injury by enhancing autophagy, as regulated by the TLR4/MyD88/MEK/ERK/mTORC1 signaling pathway. Therefore, melatonin preconditioning offers a potential therapeutic approach to prevent renal IR injury related to various clinical conditions."

We reported the lifetime prevalence of SSTI, severity of infections, key risk factors, and associated sequelae. Pictorial questions were used to assess SSTI severity.We recruited 455 PWID. SSTI lifetime prevalence was high: 64% reported an abscess and/or cellulitis. Over one-third (37%) reported a severe infection, 137 (47%) reported hospitalisation. SSTIrisk factors were: aged 35+ years, injecting once or more times a day, subcutaneous or intra-muscular injections, and making four or more attempts to achieve an injection. Those who reported having other health conditions were at higher odds of having an abscess or cellulitis, with risk tending to increase with number of reported conditions. Half (46%) employed self-care for their worst SSTI, and 43% waited for ten or more days before seeking medical care or not seeking medical care at all.Abscess and cellulitis are very common among PWID in London. We corroborate findings indicating SSTIs are associated with risks, e.g. venous access problems, as well as other co-morbid conditions: septicaemia, endocarditis, DVT, and kidney disease. These co-morbidities may impact SSTIs severity and outcomes. Delayed healthcare seeking potentially exacerbates infection severity, which in turn increases poorer health outcomes and complications."

Neutrophils are central cells of innate immunity, primarily dedicated to the killing of invading microbes. They are nondividing, short-lived white blood cells that, in large numbers and with impressive specificity, can perform numerous functions. It is well-established that mature neutrophils in circulation contain different granule subsets that harbor distinct proteins and other biomolecules (1Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Granules of the human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte.Blood. 1997; 89 (9160655): 3503-352110.1182/blood.V89.10.3503.3503_3503_3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Faurschou M. Borregaard N.

Sequential mobilization of granules allows for the cells to rapidly change their surface receptor repertoire and release matrix-destroying proteases to facilitate transmigration from the blood, extravasation into infected and inflamed tissues, and phagocytosis of microbes and cellular debris. Therefore, a distinct separation of proteins between the different granules and vesicles is important for neutrophils to appropriately respond to inflammation and infection. The neutrophil granules are sequentially formed during granulopoiesis, the process of neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow (1Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Granules of the human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte.Blood. 1997; 89 (9160655): 3503-352110.1182/blood.V89.10.3503.3503_3503_3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early during the promyelocyte stage, the azurophil granules (AG) are formed, followed by the specific and gelatinase granules (SG and GG), which develop sequentially during the myelocyte/metamyelocyte and band cell stages, respectively. Finally, the so-called secretory vesicles (SV) are formed from the plasma membrane (PM) of mature neutrophils through endocytosis. Because no subsequent exchange of proteins between fully synthesized compartments are thought to occur, the neutrophil proteins that are synthesized during the different stages of granulopoiesis end up in the corresponding granule type, a process known as “targeting by timing.” This was elegantly exemplified in studies correlating transcriptomics and proteomic data of maturing neutrophils and their granules, SV, and PM (1Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Granules of the human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte.Blood. 1997; 89 (9160655): 3503-352110.1182/blood.V89.10.3503.3503_3503_3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rørvig S.

Glycosylation adds structural and functional heterogeneity to proteins by the attachment of oligosaccharides to specific amino acid residues. The N-glycans are attached to amino acid consensus sequences Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (where Xaa ≠ Pro), whereas O-glycans (mucin-type, O-GalNAc-type) are attached to Ser and Thr. Specific glycan structures and/or epitopes are involved in multiple aspects of the immune response, including neutrophil function. The glycosylation of neutrophil proteins is diverse and functionally important for the inflammatory response, e.g. by binding to immune regulating lectins such as selectins, siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins, and microbial adhesins (5Phillips M.L.

Recently, we have identified paucimannosidic glycans (Man1–3GlcNAc2Fuc0–1) carried by glycoproteins in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients (20Venkatakrishnan V. Thaysen-Andersen M. Chen S.C. Nevalainen H. Packer N.H.

These glycoproteins were traced back to the AG of human neutrophils (21Thaysen-Andersen M. Venkatakrishnan V. Loke I. Laurini C. Diestel S. Parker B.L. Packer N.H. Human neutrophils secrete bioactive paucimannosidic proteins from azurophilic granules into pathogen-infected sputum.J. Biol.

Herein, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the N- and O-glycans in neutrophil granules, isolated using subcellular fractionation and analyzed by porous graphitized carbon (PGC)–LC–MS/MS. We show vast differences in glycosylation between different granules. By building on the targeting-by-timing hypothesis, the granule-specific glycan differences therefore suggest that the glycosylation machinery undergoes alterations during granulopoiesis. The differences in glycosylation between granules could impact the immune modulating functions of neutrophils during inflammation. Subcellular organelles of healthy resting neutrophils were first separated by two-layer Percoll gradients into three fractions; AG, SG + GG, and SV + PM (Fig. 1a). Organelle lysis and extraction and solubilization of organelle proteins were followed by enzymatic release of N-glycans, and MS analyses enabled the unambiguous identification of 69 unique N-glycans. The obtained profiles between the three fractions differed vastly from each other (Fig. 1b). Paucimannosidic and complex N-glycans were predominantly identified in AG and SG + GG, respectively, whereas SV + PM contained oligomannose and complex glycans, at similar levels (40–50%). The analysis identified 36 N-glycans in AG, 60 in SG + GG, and 61 in SV + PM. Of the total 69 N-glycans, 27 were present in all organelles, and SG + GG and SV + PM were mostly similar, sharing 50 N-glycans (Fig. 1c). These qualitative differences were corroborated also on the quantitative level (Fig. 1d). Hence, the different organelles all had unique sets of glycan structures that were in some parts overlapping. The detailed list of N-glycans and their relative abundances in each fraction is found in Table S1. The hallmark of AG was the presence of paucimannosidic glycans, with a relative abundance of 49.4 ± 5.8% of all N-glycans. In contrast, only 18.7 ± 5.2% and 4.9 ± 0.9%, respectively, of all N-glycans were paucimannosidic in SG + GG and SV + PM (Fig. 1d). Six different paucimannosidic glycans were identified in AG, with the most abundant (65% of the paucimannose glycans) containing two mannoses and a core fucose (M2F; m/z 895.31−) (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1). In fact, within the class of paucimannosidic-type N-glycans, the M2F was clearly the most abundant paucimannosidic glycan species in all organelles (Fig. 2a), but the overall abundance of M2F in SV + PM and SG + GG was <5% of total N-glycans as compared with 40% in the AG. Only the α1,6-isomer of the M2F glycan was observed in agreement with our previous reports (21Thaysen-Andersen M. Venkatakrishnan V. Loke I. Laurini C. Diestel S. Parker B.L. Packer N.H. Human neutrophils secrete bioactive paucimannosidic proteins from azurophilic granules into pathogen-infected sputum.J. Biol.

Another striking feature of AG is the high abundance of core fucosylation (80.4%) as compared with antenna fucosylation (19.6%). Oligomannose and complex type N-glycans predominate in the SV + PM fraction, with a relative abundance of 46.1 ± 3.7% and 49.1 ± 3.2%, respectively (Fig. 1, b and d). Oligomannose N-glycans in the SV + PM fraction showed low abundance of Man4 glycan and a varied distribution of Man5 to Man9 glycans (Fig. 2b). Oligomannose glycans were present also in AG and SG + GG, however at much lower levels (9.7 ± 0.7% and 19.9 ± 4.2%, respectively). The distribution between Man4 to Man9 glycans was similar in these organelles as in SV + PM (Fig. 2b). Complex N-glycans were observed in all fractions, with a higher abundance in the SG + GG (61.4 ± 9.5% of all N-glycans) as compared with the AG (40.7 ± 6.5%) and SV + PM (49.1 ± 3.2%) (Fig. 1d). Conventional glycans carrying single LacNAcs on both antennae were observed in AG, albeit in lower abundance (5.8 ± 1.8%) as compared with the other fractions. In contrast, one of the key glycosylation features in SG + GG and SV + PM was the presence of unusual, very-high-molecular-mass complex glycans extended with repeating LacNAc units (Fig. 3a). Because these glycans were characterized by broad peaks of extracted precursor ions caused by unresolved multiple isomers, their abundances were not considered during our initial analysis. Apart from oligomannose structures, the glycan profile of SV + PM was similar to that of the SG + GG with elongated complex N-glycans (Fig. S2). In SG + GG, complex-type N-glycans were predominantly biantennary fucosylated glycans with or without terminal sialic acid. The most abundant glycan (m/z 1111.92−) identified in SG + GG was a biantennary monosialylated and difucosylated glycan with both core and a single antenna fucosylation (Fig. 3a). The identified sialylated glycans were found to be mainly α2,6 linked to galactose on the 3′ arm and α2,3 linked forming sLex on the 6′ arm. In conclusion, complex N-glycans with LacNAc repeats were abundant in SG + GG and SV + PM but absent from AG. The structures of the extended LacNAcs were confirmed based on their composition related to their molecular mass, along with supporting PGC–LC retention time data and MS/MS spectral data that concertedly were able to confirm the sequence and branch points of the extended structures. Spectra were manually annotated for B-/Y- and C-/Z- ion series as well as diagnostic ions for various glycoepitopes (23Everest-Dass A.V. Abrahams J.L. Kolarich D. Packer N.H. Campbell M.P. Structural feature ions for distinguishing N- and O-linked glycan isomers by LC–ESI–IT MS/MS.J. Am. Soc.

A representative MS/MS fragmentation of a four-LacNAc-containing glycan at m/z 15502− is shown in Fig. 3b. The presence of various fragment ions, including m/z 1039.52−, 1213.22−, 1294.82−, 1469.02−, 1713.41−, and 1917.41− and D-ions of 1692.41− and 1710.41−, suggests exclusive elongation of 6′ arm rather than 3′ arm elongation (24Harvey D.J.

These fragment ions were observed in the MS/MS fragmentation spectra of other glycans as well (Fig. S3), which support and confirm our assessment. Furthermore, the monosaccharide composition of glycans with additional LacNAc repeats contains either one or two terminal sialic acids, supporting the presence of elongated biantennary glycans instead of higher branched glycans. Broad signal peaks of higher m/z values suggest that tri- and tetra-antennary glycans elongated with LacNAc units may also be present but at a lower abundance. Information about the degree of LacNAc extensions could be obtained from the combined intensities of the broad LC peaks, which corresponds to structures potentially carrying three to ten LacNAc units (Fig. S4, top panel). It could be seen that structures containing six to eight LacNAc units were the most abundant in both SG + GG and SV + PM. Simple extrapolation of the data suggests that structures even longer than 10 LacNAc units could be present in both of these fractions, but they were due to structural ambiguity not included here. Fucosylation of the GlcNAc moiety in the LacNAc chains, building Lewis type epitopes, was observed in the SG + GG and SV + PM fractions. It should be noted that not all LacNAcs in an antenna were fucosylated. For the high-molecular-mass glycans, we calculated the number of Lewis epitopes per structure and their corresponding relative intensities (Fig. S4, bottom panel). Simple structures containing one to three Lewis epitopes were more abundant than structures containing higher numbers of fucose. Structures were found to be decorated with a maximum of seven fucose residues. The data also show that the amount of fucosylation per LacNAc was decreasing with the increasing number of Lewis epitopes. When analyzing the fractions for Le epitopes by immunoblotting analyses, the Lex antigens were mainly found in the SG + GG fraction, whereas sLex epitopes were detected predominantly in the SV + PM fraction (Fig. 3c). Using confocal microscopy, the presence of Lex was detected in intracellular granules, whereas sLex was mainly localized to vesicles close to the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that sLex is carried by glycans that are associated with the SV + PM (Fig. 3d). Overall, these data show that neutrophils extensively express complex N-glycans with elongated LacNAc repeats that are decorated with fucose (Lex; in SG + GG) and capped with sialic acid (sLex; in SV + PM). Using crude granule separation, the above have demonstrated that the neutrophil granules, in addition to their difference in size, density, and protein composition, also differs in their glycan composition (Fig. 1, b and d) (3Rørvig S.

We wanted to investigate the granule-specific glycosylation further using a higher resolution granule separation technique. The SG and GG fractions were separated using a three-layer Percoll gradient (Fig. 4a) and analyzed for high molecular mass N-glycans. Mass spectra of the N-glycans in the m/z 1200–2000 region revealed an enrichment of triply charged ions in the GG, whereas doubly charged ions were more abundant in the SG (Fig. 4b). It is important to note that the detection of more high-molecular-mass glycans in the isolated GG fraction (three-layer gradient) as compared with in the combined SG + GG fraction (two-layer gradient) is a consequence of absence of SG in the GG fraction. Consequently, the precursor ion (m/z 1933.73−) corresponding to eleven LacNAcs, four fucoses, and one sialic acid (Δmassof-0.016Da), the longest glycan detected, was identified only in the GG fraction of the three-layer gradient. The relative intensities of glycans, based on their predicted monosaccharide compositions, were grouped into different mass ranges. It is evident that the relative intensities of glycans containing five to eight LacNAcs per structure were more abundant in SG as compared with GG (Fig. 4c). In contrast, structures containing nine or more LacNAcs were more abundant in the GG fraction. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that the glycans in GG are further elongated and larger than those in the SG. The glycans identified in the granule fractions may originate either from the granule membrane or luminal (i.e. soluble) proteins. For SV, the lumen contains plasma proteins taken up during invagination of the plasma membrane during neutrophil terminal differentiation (27Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Rygaard K. Bastholm L. Nielsen M.H. Sengeløv H. Bjerrum O.W. Johnsen A.H. Stimulus-dependent secretion of plasma proteins from human neutrophils.J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90 (1378856): 86-9610.1172/JCI115860Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To address which of the identified glycans are displayed on membrane-associated proteins, the membrane protein extracts were separated from the soluble protein extracts for each granule population (AG, SG, and GG) and the SV + PM obtained from the three-layered Percoll isolation method. Paucimannosidic glycans were enriched in the AG membrane protein fraction, whereas oligomannose glycans were enriched in the membrane fraction of SG and SV + PM (Fig. 5). In contrast, complex glycans were observed in high abundance on the soluble protein fraction in all granules. Apart from N-glycan analysis, proteins were also subjected to reductive β-elimination, after which the released O-glycans were analyzed. Notably, no O-glycans were detected in the AG, whereas SG + GG (Fig. 6a) and SV + PM (Fig. S5) demonstrated the presence of similar O-glycans, with a total of 17 O-glycans identified. The most abundant O-glycans were mono- and disialylated core 1 and core 2 glycans (Fig. 6a). Analogous to the LacNAc extension of the N-glycans, only one of the branches was elongated with LacNAcs on O-glycans. Sialic acid linked to galactose was found on the 3′ arm but not on the 6′ arm, whereas the fucose moiety was located on the 6′ arm together with LacNAc extensions as elucidated using molecular mass, PGC–LC retention time, and MS/MS fragmentation (Fig. 6b). Similar to N-glycans, O-glycans with Lex epitopes were identified, with fucosylation on 6′ arm and sialylation capping on the other arm (Fig. 6b). In conclusion, neutrophil granule proteins are modified with core 1 and core 2 O-glycans car"

Continuous decline in chickpea productivity is attributed to insufficient genetic variability and different environmental stresses. Chickpea like several other legumes is highly susceptible to terminal drought stress. Multiple genes control drought tolerance and ASR gene plays a key role in regulating different plant stresses. The present study describes the molecular characterization and functional role of Abscissic acid and stress ripening (ASR) gene from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and the gene sequence identified was submitted to NCBI Genbank (MK937569). Molecular analysis using MUSCLE software proved that the ASR nucleotide sequences in different legumes show variations at various positions though ASR genes are conserved in chickpea with only few variations. Sequence similarity of ASR gene to chickpea putative ABA/WDS induced protein mRNA clearly indicated its potential involvement in drought tolerance. Physiological screening and qRT-PCR results demonstrated increased ASR gene expression under drought stress possibly enabled genotypes to perform better under stress. Conserved domain search, protein structure analysis, prediction and validation, network analysis using Phyre2, Swiss-PDB viewer, ProSA and STRING analysis established the role of hypothetical ASR protein NP_001351739.1 in mediating drought responses. NP_001351739.1 might have enhanced the ASR gene activity as a transcription factor regulating drought stress tolerance in chickpea. This study could be useful in identification of new ASR genes that play a major role in drought tolerance and also develop functional markers for chickpea improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3041080899,"Abstract Cervical cancer (CC) remains highest in the mortality of female reproductive system cancers, while cisplatin (CDDP) resistance is the one of main reasons for the lethality. Preceding evidence has supported that karyopherins are associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we simultaneously compared CDDP-incomplete responders with CDDP-complete responders of CC patients and CDDP‐insensitive CC cell lines with CDDP‐sensitive group. We finally identified that DNA-PKcs (PRKDC) was related to CDDP sensitivity after overlapping in CC sample tissues and CC cell lines. Further functional assay revealed that targeting PRKDC by shRNA and NU7026 (specific PRKDC inhibitor) could enhance CDDP sensitivity in vitro and in vivo, which was mediated by impairing DNA damage repair pathway in CC. Mechanistically, we found that PRKDC was transcriptionally upregulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), while intriguingly, CDDP treatment strengthened the transcriptional activity of CEBPD to PRKDC. We further disclosed that Importin 4 (IPO4) augmented the nuclear translocation of CEBPD through nuclear localization signals (NLS) to activate PRKDC-mediated DNA damage repair in response to CDDP. Moreover, we demonstrated that IPO4 and CEBPD knockdown improved CDDP-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Together, we shed the novel insight into the role of IPO4 in chemosensitivity and provide a clinical translational potential to enhance CC chemosensitivity since the IPO4-CEBPD-PRKDC axis is actionable via NU7026 (PRKDC inhibitor) or targeting IPO4 in combination with CDDP."
https://openalex.org/W3040886827,"The family of signal-transducing adapter proteins (STAPs) has been reported to be involved in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways and implicated as transcriptional factors. We previously cloned STAP-2 as a c-Fms interacting protein and explored its effects on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leukemogenesis. STAP-2 binds to BCR-ABL, upregulates BCR-ABL phosphorylation, and activates its downstream molecules. In this study, we evaluated the role of STAP-1, another member of the STAP family, in CML pathogenesis. We found that the expression of STAP-1 is aberrantly upregulated in CML stem cells (LSCs) in patients' bone marrow. Using experimental model mice, deletion of STAP-1 prolonged the survival of CML mice with inducing apoptosis of LSCs. The impaired phosphorylation status of STAT5 by STAP-1 ablation leads to downregulation of antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Interestingly, transcriptome analyses indicated that STAP-1 affects several signaling pathways related to BCR-ABL, JAK2, and PPARγ. This adapter protein directly binds to not only BCR-ABL, but also STAT5 proteins, showing synergistic effects of STAP-1 inhibition and BCR-ABL or JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibition. Our results identified STAP-1 as a regulator of CML LSCs and suggested it to be a potential therapeutic target for CML."
https://openalex.org/W3043053040,"Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are often considered luxury services by policy-makers and the general population, which are always susceptible of removal from public funding of health care. The analysis of the economic aspects of this scope seems essential due to the high prevalence of infertility in Iran and the high costs of infertility treatments. This study aimed to investigate the value put on IUI and IVF treatments by communities in Iran and the affordability of services based on community preferences. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was performed based on the WTP approach, and the contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to estimate WTP for IUI and IVF using a researcher-made survey in two cities of Kerman and Isfahan, Iran, in 2016–17. The sample size was 604, and the study sample frame to estimate WTP included two groups of couples who were/were not aware of their fertility statuses. The costs of one cycle of IUI and IVF were calculated according to the treatment protocols, tariffs of 2016–17, and medical information records of patients. The mean direct and indirect medical costs of one cycle of IUI and IVF were equivalent to 19561140 and 60897610 IRR, respectively. Also, the mean WTP for IUI and IVF treatments were obtained of 15941061 and 28870833 IRR, respectively. The demand for IUI and IVF treatments was elastic and the community was sensitive to price changes of these treatment methods. IUI and IVF treatments brought no positive net benefits, and economic variables had the highest impact on the WTP and community preferences, indicating the significant role of financial constraints in the community's valuation for advanced infertility treatments in Iran."
https://openalex.org/W3043232844,"Based on Social Learning Theory and the General Aggression Model, this study aims to explore the relationship between parental emotional warmth and the cyberbullying perpetration attitudes of college students and the mediating roles of trait gratitude and empathy. Using the stratified cluster random sampling method, 1198 college students (716 boys and 482 girls with an average age of 20.44 years) were tested using the subscale of the Parenting Styles Instrument, the Basic Empathy Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire-6, and the Cyberbullying Attitude Questionnaire. Results: Emotional warmth, trait gratitude, cognitive empathy, and affective empathy all demonstrated significantly positive relationships with each other (rs from .175 to .403, ps < 0.01) and negative correlations with cyberbullying perpetration attitudes (rs from -.137 to -.306, ps < 0.01). Emotional warmth can exert an impact on cyberbullying perpetration attitudes through three fully mediating paths: the mediating roles of trait gratitude (41.91% of the total effect), cognitive empathy (14.5% of the total effect), and the chain mediating roles of trait gratitude-cognitive empathy (19.5% of the total effect). The results may have important implications for future studies to develop effective interventions for cyberbullying."
https://openalex.org/W3042784895,"Today the development of antibiotic resistance, especially in the treatment of bacterial infections associated with biofilms, has led to increasing the importance of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this work, antimicrobial and synergistic activity of three truncated HNP-1 analogs (2Abz14S29, 2Abz23S29, and HNP1ΔC18A) with β-lactam (amoxicillin and cefixime) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) antibiotics against multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogenic E. coli clinical isolates were evaluated. The anti-biofilm potential of peptides at different stages was also investigated. All peptides exhibited additive activity just with β-lactam antibiotics in a checkerboard synergy assay. Inhibition and eradication of MDR uropathogenic E. coli biofilm were shown by all test peptides at different concentrations. Thus, truncated HNP-1 analogs (2Abz14S29, 2Abz23S29, and HNP1ΔC18A) may have the potential for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by biofilm-forming MDR uropathogenic E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W3043197903,"Introduction Chagas disease presents bio-psycho-social and cultural determinants for infected patients, their family members, close friends, and society. For this reason, diagnosis and treatment require an active approach and an integral focus, so that we can prevent the disease from creating stigma and exclusion, as is actively promoting access to diagnosis, medical attention and social integration Methodology The study was conducted in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) from 2004 to 2017. After an increased detection rates of CHD in our region, the process of construction of community strategies started (2004–2013). Different community interventions with informational, educational, and communication components were designed, developed, implemented, and evaluated. The results of the evaluation helped to determine which intervention should be prioritized: 1) workshop; 2) community event; 3) in situ screening. Afterwards, those strategies were implemented (2014–2017). Results Each of the three strategies resulted in a different level of coverage, or number of people reached. The in situ screening interventions reached the highest coverage (956 persons, 58.98%).Clear differences exist (p-value<0.001) between the three strategies regarding the percentage of screenings and diagnoses carried out. The largest number was in the in situ screening intervention, with a total of 830 persons screened despite the greatest number of diagnoses was among the workshop participants (33 persons, 20.75% of those screened). The prevalence of infection found is similar among the three strategies, ranging from 16.63% to 22.32% of the screened patients (p-value = 0.325). Conclusions The results of the study show that community interventions seem to be necessary to improve access to diagnosis and treatment of CHD in the area of Barcelona. They also show which strategy is the most appropriate based on the detected needs of the community, the proposed objectives of the intervention, and the given socio-temporal context."

https://openalex.org/W3043753567,"Soil solution chemistry is influenced by atmospheric deposition of air pollutants, exchange processes with the soil matrix and soil-rhizosphere-plant interactions. In this study we present the results of the long-term Intercantonal Forest Observation Program in Switzerland with soil solution measurements since 1998 on a current total of 47 plots. The forest sites comprise two major forest types of Switzerland including a wide range of ecological gradients such as different nitrogen (N) deposition and soil conditions. The long-term data set of 20 years of soil solution measurements revealed an ongoing, but site-specific soil acidification. In strongly acidified soils (soil pH below 4.2), acidification indicators changed only slowly over the measured period, possibly due to high buffering capacity of the aluminum buffer (pH 4.2-3.8). In contrast, in less acidified sites we observed an increasing acidification rate over time, reflected, for example, by the continuous decrease in the ratio of base cations to aluminum (BC/Al ratio). Nowadays, the main driver of soil acidification is the high rate of N deposition, causing cation losses and hampering sustainable nutrient balances for tree nutrition. Mean nitrate leaching rates for the years 2005-2017 were 9.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1, ranging from 0.04 to 53 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Three plots with high N input had a remarkable low nitrate leaching. Both N deposition and nitrate leaching have decreased since 2000. However, the latter trend may be partly explained due to increased drought in recent years. Nonetheless, those high N depositions are still affecting the majority of the forest sites. Taken together, this study gives evidence of anthropogenic soil acidification in Swiss forest stands. The underlying long-term measurements of soil solution provides important information on nutrient leaching losses and the impact climate change effects such as droughts. Furthermore, this study improves the understanding of forest management and tree mortality regarding varying nitrate leaching rates."
https://openalex.org/W3042294872,"A remarkable charge transfer (CT) band is described in the bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein (Bf-ETF) from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpaETF). RpaETF contains two FADs that play contrasting roles in electron bifurcation. The Bf-FAD accepts electrons pairwise from NADH, directs one to a lower-reduction midpoint potential (E°) carrier, and the other to the higher-E° electron transfer FAD (ET-FAD). Previous work noted that a CT band at 726 nm formed when ET-FAD was reduced and Bf-FAD was oxidized, suggesting that both flavins participate. However, existing crystal structures place them too far apart to interact directly. We present biochemical experiments addressing this conundrum and elucidating the nature of this CT species. We observed that RpaETF missing either FAD lacked the 726 nm band. Site-directed mutagenesis near either FAD produced altered yields of the CT species, supporting involvement of both flavins. The residue substitutions did not alter the absorption maximum of the signal, ruling out contributions from residue orbitals. Instead, we propose that the residue identities modulate the population of a protein conformation that brings the ET-flavin and Bf-flavin into direct contact, explaining the 726 nm band based on a CT complex of reduced ET-FAD and oxidized Bf-FAD. This is corroborated by persistence of the 726 nm species during gentle protein denaturation and simple density functional theory calculations of flavin dimers. Although such a CT complex has been demonstrated for free flavins, this is the first observation of such, to our knowledge, in an enzyme. Thus, Bf-ETFs may optimize electron transfer efficiency by enabling direct flavin-flavin contact."
https://openalex.org/W3042300876,"This study aimed to assess agreement between antenatal estimates of gestational age by ultrasound and clinical records at birth in the Brazilian Amazon. Ultrasound examinations were scheduled during the second trimester for 578 pregnant women prospectively screened at primary health care units, following a standardized protocol for image quality control. A multistage algorithm was used to assess the best estimate of gestational age during the antenatal period, considering reliability of last menstrual period (LMP) and acceptable differences in relation to ultrasound estimates derived from fetal biparietal diameter and femur length. Agreement of antenatal estimates of gestational age confirmed by ultrasound and clinical records at birth was analyzed with Bland-Altman plots and kappa coefficients (preterm and postterm births). Overall, ultrasound examinations presented high quality (>90% of satisfactory images), and were adopted as the best estimate of gestational age among 83.4% of pregnant women, confirming reliable LMP in the remaining proportion. On average, difference in gestational age between antenatal estimates and clinical records was 0.43 week (95% CI: 0.32, 0.53). Classification of preterm births had a good agreement (kappa: 0.82, p<0.001), but a poor performance was observed for postterm births (kappa: -0.06, p = 0.92). Higher differences in gestational age were noted for participants with >11 years of education and cases of caesarean deliveries. In conclusion, high-quality ultrasound images from the second trimester of pregnancy based the assessment of gestational age, while reliability of LMP was limited. Information from clinical records at birth presented an acceptable agreement on average and for classification of preterm births, which is relevant for properly interpreting perinatal outcomes. Discrepancies in caesarean deliveries may warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3042652350,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer. Certain proteins in the tumor microenvironment have attracted considerable attention owing to their association with tumor invasion and metastasis. Here, we used proteomics to identify proteins associated with lymph-node metastasis, which is one of the prognostic factors. We selected lymph node metastasis-positive and -negative patients (n = 5 each) who underwent pancreatectomy between 2005 and 2015 and subjected to comprehensive proteomic profiling of tumor stroma. A total of 490 proteins were detected by mass spectrometry. Software analysis revealed that nine of these proteins were differentially expressed between the two patient groups. We focused on hemopexin and ferritin light chain based on immunohistochemistry results. We assessed the clinicopathological data of 163 patients and found that hemopexin expression was associated with UICC N2 (p = 0.0399), lymph node ratio (p = 0.0252), venous invasion (p = 0.0096), and lymphatic invasion (p = 0.0232). Notably, in vitro assays showed that hemopexin promotes invasion of the pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings suggest that hemopexin is a lymph node metastasis-associated protein that could potentially serve as a useful therapeutic target or biomarker of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3042697587,"The tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-epidemic continues to increase globally. Low-and middle-income countries bear the highest burden of co-epidemic, and Ghana is no exception. In 2011, the World Health Organisation (WHO) responded to this global challenge by launching a collaborative framework with a view to guide countries in implementing their DM and TB care, prevention and control plans. Subsequently, several countries, including Ghana, adopted this framework and began implementing bidirectional screening of TB and DM patients. Almost a decade later since the launch of the framework, the implementation of bidirectional screening in Ghana has not been subjected to empirical research. This study explored the barriers and facilitators to bidirectional screening through the lenses of the implementing healthcare workers.This was an exploratory qualitative study conducted in three public health facilities offering both TB and DM services in Northern Ghana. In-depth interviews, document review and observations, were used to generate data. In total twenty-three healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, prescriber, health managers and TB task- shifting officers delivering care in TB and DM clinics) were interviewed, using semi-structured interview guides. The interview questions solicited information on the screening process, including knowledge of the collaborative framework, comorbidity, collaboration and workload.Six themes emerged from the analysis, of which two (Increase in staff capacity, and Institutionalisation of bidirectional screening) were facilitators, and four (Delays in screening, Fear and stigmatization of TB, Poor collaboration between TB and DM units, and Skewed funding for screening) were barriers.The implementation of bidirectional screening at public health facilities in Ghana was evident in this study and increased staff capacity, funding and institutionalisation enhanced the policy implementation process. However, the screening of TB patients for DM is yet to be prioritised, and emphasis should be put on the design for cost-effective screening approaches for low- and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3042850649,"The accumulation-associated protein (Aap) from Staphylococcus epidermidis is a biofilm-related protein that was found to be a critical factor for infection using a rat catheter model. The B-repeat superdomain of Aap, composed of 5–17 B-repeats, each containing a Zn2+-binding G5 and a spacer subdomain, is responsible for Zn2+-dependent assembly leading to accumulation of bacteria during biofilm formation. We previously demonstrated that a minimal B-repeat construct (Brpt1.5) forms an antiparallel dimer in the presence of 2–3 Zn2+ ions. More recently, we have reported the presence of functional amyloid-like fibrils composed of Aap within S. epidermidis biofilms and demonstrated that a biologically relevant construct containing five and a half B-repeats (Brpt5.5) forms amyloid-like fibrils similar to those observed in the biofilm. In this study, we analyze the initial assembly events of the Brpt5.5 construct. Analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to determine hydrodynamic parameters of reversibly associating species and to perform linked equilibrium studies. Linkage studies indicated a mechanism of Zn2+-induced dimerization similar to smaller constructs; however, Brpt5.5 dimers could then undergo further Zn2+-induced assembly into a previously uncharacterized tetramer. This led us to search for potential Zn2+-binding sites outside of the dimer interface. We developed a Brpt5.5 mutant that was unable to form the tetramer and was concordantly incapable of amyloidogenesis. CD and dynamic light scattering indicate that a conformational transition in the tetramer species is a critical step preceding amyloidogenesis. This mechanistic model for B-repeat assembly and amyloidogenesis provides new avenues for potential therapeutic targeting of staphylococcal biofilms."

Its overexpression is highly correlated with the metastasis of certain cancers. P-Rex1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and its activity are regulated via interactions with heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, PIP3, and protein kinase A (PKA). Deletion analysis has further shown that domains C-terminal to its catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain confer autoinhibition.

The 3.1 Å crystal structure of DEP1 features a domain swap, similar to that observed previously in the Dvl2 DEP domain, involving an exposed basic loop that contains the PKA site. Using purified proteins, we show that although DEP1 phosphorylation has no effect on the activity or solution conformation of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment, it inhibits binding of the DEP1 domain to liposomes containing phosphatidic acid.

Thus, P-Rex1 represents an important therapeutic target, and understanding its atomic structure and mechanisms of regulation would facilitate the drug discovery process. In its basal state, P-Rex1 is autoinhibited and localized in the cytoplasm (12Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

Deletion of domains C-terminal to the DH domain in the full-length enzyme, including the PH domain, generally led to increased GEF activity, thereby implying involvement of these domains in autoinhibition (28Hill K. Krugmann S. Andrews S.R. Coadwell W.J. Finan P. Welch H.C. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Regulation of P-Rex1 by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and Gβγ subunits.J. Biol.

These studies also showed that the DH/PH fragment of P-Rex1 has significantly higher activity than P-Rex1. Thus, the PH domain does not seem to inhibit GEF activity on its own, implying coordination among the C-terminal domains in autoinhibition. The P-Rex1 PH domain mediates binding and activation by PIP3, and also contains a β3-β4 polybasic loop, which might play a role in interacting with the cell membrane through ionic interactions (29Cash J.N. Davis E.M. Tesmer J.J. Structural and biochemical characterization of the catalytic core of the metastatic factor P-Rex1 and its regulation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.Structure. 2016; 24 (27150042): 730-74010.1016/j.str.2016.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our recent single particle cryo-EM structure of P-Rex1 in complex with Gβγ resolved the C-terminal portion of the protein spanning from the DEP2 domain through the C terminus (13Cash J.N. Urata S. Li S. Ravala S.K. Avramova L.V. Shost M.D. Gutkind J.S. Tesmer J.J.G. Cianfrocco M.A. Cryo-electron microscopy structure and analysis of the P-Rex1-Gβγ signaling scaffold.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 (31663027): eaax885510.1126/sciadv.aax8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), wherein the DEP2, PDZ1, PDZ2, and IP4P domains coalesce to form a Gβγ interaction scaffold. The DH/PH-DEP1 domains were disordered in the structure. Because the DH/PH domains exhibit robust basal activity on their own, autoinhibition would seem to be imposed by DEP1, the C-terminal Gβγ-binding assembly, or both. Furthermore, Ser-436 in the DEP1 domain is phosphorylated by PKA, which blunts activation by Gβγ and PIP3 (14Mayeenuddin L.H. Garrison J.C. Phosphorylation of P-Rex1 by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits the phosphatidylinositiol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and Gβγ-mediated regulation of its activity.J. Biol.

The DEP1 domain is also reported to contribute to a binding site for mTOR, which positively regulates P-Rex1 signaling (30Hernández-Negrete I. Carretero-Ortega J. Rosenfeldt H. Hernández-García R. Calderón-Salinas J.V. Reyes-Cruz G. Gutkind J.S. Vázquez-Prado J. P-Rex1 links mammalian target of rapamycin signaling to Rac activation and cell migration.J. Biol.

Therefore, the DEP1 domain seems poised to play a key role in regulating the GEF activity of P-Rex1. To gain further insight, we determined its crystal structure and compared the activity and the solution structures of the DH/PH and DH/PH-DEP1 fragments of P-Rex1. We also studied the effect of PKA phosphorylation on the GEF activity and solution conformation of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment. We further tested if PKA phosphorylation affects the ability of the domain to bind liposomes. Our results support a model in which the DEP1 domain associates with and inhibits the DH/PH module in a phosphorylation-independent manner, at least in vitro. However, because phosphorylation by PKA diminishes the ability of the DEP1 domain to bind negatively charged phospholipids, it implies that PKA phosphorylated P-Rex1 will lose its ability to efficiently interact with cellular membranes, which will diminish its interactions with other membrane associated regulators such as PIP3 and Gβγ. In a previous study (28Hill K. Krugmann S. Andrews S.R. Coadwell W.J. Finan P. Welch H.C. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Regulation of P-Rex1 by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and Gβγ subunits.J. Biol.

In another study, it was shown that fragments of P-Rex1 that included the tandem DEP and tandem PDZ domains had less activity in cells than the DH/PH module alone (15Chávez-Vargas L. Adame-Garcia S.R. Cervantes-Villagrana R.D. Castillo-Kauil A. Bruystens J.G. Fukuhara S. Taylor S.S. Mochizuki N. Reyes-Cruz G. Vázquez-Prado J. Protein kinase A (PKA) type I interacts with P-Rex1, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor: effect on PKA localization and P-Rex1 signaling.J. Biol.

Because our recent structure showed that DEP2 is intimately incorporated into the Gβγ-binding module (13Cash J.N. Urata S. Li S. Ravala S.K. Avramova L.V. Shost M.D. Gutkind J.S. Tesmer J.J.G. Cianfrocco M.A. Cryo-electron microscopy structure and analysis of the P-Rex1-Gβγ signaling scaffold.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 (31663027): eaax885510.1126/sciadv.aax8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the DEP1 domain alone could exhibit autoinhibition. Indeed, the GEF activity of DH/PH was 4-fold higher than that of DH/PH-DEP1 (Fig. 1B). We next tested whether DEP1 could inhibit the DH/PH domain in trans by adding increasing amounts of the independently purified DEP1 domain to the DH/PH module. Surprisingly, instead of the expected decrease in activity of DH/PH, a slight increase was observed (Fig. 1C). Thus, either the DEP1 domain binds but does not directly block GTPase binding to the DH domain, or its affinity is too low when not covalently attached to the DH/PH module. In support of the latter hypothesis, there is no observed association of the DEP1 domain with DH/PH by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (data not shown). The human P-Rex1 DEP1 domain, encompassing residues 409-499, crystallized as a D3 hexamer wherein each protomer undergoes two domain swaps (Fig. 2, A–C). Thus, one unique chain of DEP1 contributes to three different DEP domains in the hexamer. DEP1 is predominantly monomeric in solution (Fig. S2A) but does exhibit evidence of some dimers and tetramers. The domain swaps in the DEP1 structure occur at residue 435, at the end of what would have been a β hairpin, and at residue 480, before the final β strand of the domain (Fig. 2C). Thus, the N and C termini of the DEP1 domain must exhibit a high degree of structural dynamics in solution. Notably, the DEP domain of human Dvl2 also forms a similar domain swap involving the β1–β2 hairpin (31Gammons M.V. Renko M. Johnson C.M. Rutherford T.J. Bienz M. Wnt signalosome assembly by DEP domain swapping of Disheveled.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64 (27692984): 92-10410.1016/j.molcel.2016.08.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and consequently it may represent a common occurrence in this domain-fold. When the domain swaps are deconvoluted (Fig. 2D), DEP1 assumes the expected globular DEP-fold with a three-helix bundle (H1–H3), an extended β hairpin formed by β1 and β2 (residues 429-440) between H1 and H2 and ending with two more β strands (β3 and β4) (Fig. 2D). Its fold is most closely related to that of the adjacent DEP2 domain (root mean squared deviation of 1.1 Å for 62 Cα atoms) (Fig. 2E), with the most variable regions being the domain-swapped loops and an extra C-terminal helix in DEP2. The β1–β2 hairpin projects outward from the core and is extremely basic in character (Fig. 2D), in that it contains two lysine and three arginine residues. In other DEP domains, this loop is involved in interactions with negatively charged membranes (32Consonni S.V. Gloerich M. Spanjaard E. Bos J.L. cAMP regulates DEP domain-mediated binding of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 to phosphatidic acid at the plasma membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The loop also happens to be the site of PKA phosphorylation (Ser-436) (15Chávez-Vargas L. Adame-Garcia S.R. Cervantes-Villagrana R.D. Castillo-Kauil A. Bruystens J.G. Fukuhara S. Taylor S.S.

Because crystallographic analysis of DH/PH-DEP1 has not yet been successful, we compared the small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles of the purified DH/PH and DH/PH-DEP1 proteins after SEC (SEC-SAXS) (Fig. 3, A–B). In SEC, proteins showed monodisperse elution profiles (Fig. S3, A and B), and Guinier analysis of the SAXS data (Fig. S4, A and B) confirmed that the scattering profiles were monodisperse with little or no aggregation. The Guinier fit provided the radius of gyration (Rg) and scattering at zero angle (I(0)). DH/PH and DH/PH-DEP1 have Rg values of 28.4 ± 0.09 and 29.9 ± 0.09 Å, respectively. The molecular weight calculated from the Guinier fit via the volume of correlation (34Rambo R.P. Tainer J.A. Accurate assessment of mass, models and resolution by small-angle scattering.Nature. 2013; 496 (23619693): 477-48110.1038/nature12070Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), the most appropriate method for flexible systems, was 47 and 59 kDa, respectively, in reasonable agreement with their expected molecular weights (43 and 54 kDa, respectively). The dimensionless Kratky plot showed a shift in the maximum away from that of a globular protein and an extended tail at higher qRg (Fig. 3D). This indicates some degree of flexibility (35Durand D. Vivès C. Cannella D. Pérez J. Pebay-Peyroula E. Vachette P. Fieschi F. NADPH oxidase activator p67(phox) behaves in solution as a multidomain protein with semi-flexible linkers.J. Struct.

Pair distribution function (P(r)) analyses of scattering data computed the maximum intramolecular dimensions (Dmax) of protein molecules, with values of ∼105 and 104 Å, for DH/PH and DH/PH-DEP1, respectively (Fig. S5). The maximum interatomic vector in the structure of the DH/PH domain of P-Rex1 (29Cash J.N. Davis E.M. Tesmer J.J. Structural and biochemical characterization of the catalytic core of the metastatic factor P-Rex1 and its regulation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.Structure. 2016; 24 (27150042): 730-74010.1016/j.str.2016.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is on the order of 100 Å. The fact that DEP1 does not extend this length is consistent with a relatively condensed state for these three domains in solution. To assess the conformational distribution in solution, we employed ensemble optimization method (EOM) analysis (36Tria G. Mertens H.D. Kachala M. Svergun D.I. Advanced ensemble modelling of flexible macromolecules using X-ray solution scattering.IUCr J. 2015; 2 (25866658): 207-21710.1107/S205225251500202XCrossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The selected ensemble for DH/PH fits the data very well (Fig. 3A), χ2 = 1.0, and consists of both compact and elongated conformations in solution (Fig. 3E, Fig. S6A). The selected ensemble is quite different from the generated pool, suggesting that although the system is flexible in solution, it is not adopting purely random configurations. For DH/PH-DEP1, the selected ensembles had χ2 = 1.1 (Fig. 3B). The conformational distribution of DH/PH-DEP1 shows predominantly one set of conformations, concentrated near an Rg of 29 Å and Dmax of 90 Å (Fig. 3F and Fig. S6B). This selected ensemble is significantly less extended than the full generated pool, suggesting that DH/PH-DEP1, although flexible, adopts predominantly compact states in solution. This compact state is similar in size to the DH/PH compact state, with Rg and Dmax peaking at ∼26 and ∼85 Å, respectively. The quantitative measure of flexibility of the selected ensembles is given by two metrics Rflex and Rσ. Rflex of a system can vary from completely flexible (100%) to perfectly rigid (0%). The importance of Rflex is not the absolute value, but the value of the selected ensemble relative to the entire pool. Rσ is the ratio of the variance between the selected ensemble and the full ensemble pool. As shown in Table 1, the Rflex value of DH/PH is close to that of the ensemble pool, indicating that this protein is very flexible. The Rflex of DH/PH-DEP1 is smaller than that of the pool, indicating less flexibility in the system. In both cases, the Rσ is greater than 1. An Rσ greater than 1 can indicate poor quality data (36Tria G. Mertens H.D. Kachala M. Svergun D.I. Advanced ensemble modelling of flexible macromolecules using X-ray solution scattering.IUCr J. 2015; 2 (25866658): 207-21710.1107/S205225251500202XCrossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Given the high signal to noise and good fit to the data, as indicated by both the χ2 values and the normalized residuals (Fig. 3, A and B), this is not the case here. Rather, the large values of Rσ comes from the long tails of the DH/PH-DEP1 and the bimodal distribution of the DH/PH ensemble sizes (such as seen in the Rg plot in Fig. 3, E and F).Table 1SAXS parametersDH/PHDH/PH-DEP1p-DH/PH-DEP1Guinier analysisI(0)aI(0), Rg"
https://openalex.org/W3042374880,"Background Neisseria meningitidis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Meningococcal isolates have a highly dynamic population structure and can be phenotypically and genetically differentiated into serogroups and clonal complexes. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of invasive isolates recovered in Colombia from 2013 to 2016. Methodology A total of 193 invasive isolates were analyzed. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics were determined by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing. Results Based on the results, meningococcal serogroups C, B and Y were responsible for 47.9%, 41.7%, and 9.4% of cases, respectively, and the distribution of serogroups B and C changed over time. Fifteen clonal groups and 14 clonal complexes (cc) were identified by PFGE and genome sequencing. The main clonal group included serogroup B isolates with sequence type (ST)-9493 and its four single-locus variants, which has only been identified in Colombian isolates. The clonal population structure demonstrates that the isolates in this study mainly belong to four clonal complexes: ST-11 cc, ST-32 cc, ST-35 cc and ST-41/44 cc. Thirty-eight penA alleles were identified, but no correlation between MICs and specific sequences was observed. Conclusion This study shows that most meningococcal isolates recovered from patients with invasive meningococcal disease in Colombia are strains associated with distinct globally disseminated hyperinvasive clones."

Among these metabolites, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) represents a very versatile compound that undergoes a variety of enzymatic modifications.

The generated 4-keto-hexose-uronic acid intermediate is unstable and converted into different products, depending on the enzyme (Scheme 1). Because of their catalytic versatility, sugar-modifying SDR enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable targets for many industrial biocatalytic applications. As can be seen from Scheme 1, the UDP-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase stands out for its ability to prevent decarboxylation at the C5′ position of the 4-keto-hexose-uronic acid intermediate. This enzyme thereby efficiently interconverts UDP-GlcA into UDP-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) by inverting the configuration of the 4′-carbon. The strategies used by epimerases to invert the stereochemistry of UDP-sugar carbons have been subject of in-depth investigations (12Allard S.T. Giraud M.F. Naismith J.H. Epimerases: structure, function and mechanism.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58 (11706991): 1650-166510.1007/PL00000803Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among these, the structural features underlying the selective C4′ epimerization by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase were extensively studied in the past few years (13Eixelsberger T. Sykora S. Egger S.

It belongs to the SDR family, featuring the same Ser/Thr-Tyr-Lys catalytic triad as UDP-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase. The substrate is first oxidized at the C4′, and the resulting 4-keto-hexose intermediate is thought to undergo a rotational movement within the active site. The intermediate is then reduced by NADH, leading to the inversion of the C4′ configuration (18Thoden J.B. Henderson J.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M.

In this work, we carried out a comprehensive structural analysis of UDP-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase from Bacillus cereus (BcUGAepi) by solving six high-resolution crystal structures that elucidate different steps along the reaction. The main aspects of these structures were compared with other SDR epimerases and decarboxylases. We also isolated a remarkable complex showing an equilibrium mixture of both substrate and product in approximately 1:1 ratio. We further used structural, kinetic isotope effect and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to inspect the fine roles of catalytic residues. Our studies provide an overview of catalysis with critical insight into the mechanism of 4-ketose-uronic acid intermediate rotation and protection against intermediate decarboxylation. They further demonstrate that the UDP moiety is not only an accessory part of the molecule, but it is fundamental for substrate recognition and active-site configuration. The crystal structure of BcUGAepi co-purified with NAD+ was initially solved at 2.2 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Table 1). The enzyme is composed of nine β-strands and eight α-helices assembled in two domains (13Eixelsberger T. Sykora S. Egger S. Brunsteiner M. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Brecker L. Nidetzky B.

This binding mode orients the si-face on the nicotinamide ring toward the substrate-binding site to cope with the sugar moiety and mediate hydride transfer. In the NAD+ complex, two loops around the catalytic site (residues 86–91 and 269–276) are disordered as gathered from the absence of well-defined electron density around them (Fig. 2B). The crystal structure of the enzyme bound to UDP (1.7 Å resolution; Table 1) reveals that these two loops become ordered in the presence of the nucleotide diphosphate. In particular, Glu-276 anchors the hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide ribose, whereas loop 86–91 lends more rigidity to the part of the cavity hosting the pyrophosphate (Fig. 2, B and C). UDP binding affects the conformation of a third loop, formed by residues 204–214. This loop moves closer to the UDP-binding site so that Gln-211 and Arg-213 can hydrogen-bond to the UDP's ribose hydroxy groups and the β-phosphate, respectively. Moreover, Phe-206 is implicated in π-stacking with the uracil ring, whereas Thr-204 is hydrogen-bonded to the NH group of the base. This com"
https://openalex.org/W3042293189,"Non-dividing cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes and macrophages are target cells of HIV that have low dNTP pool concentrations and elevated levels of dUTP, which leads to frequent incorporation of dUMP opposite to A during reverse transcription (“uracilation”). One factor determining the fate of dUMP in proviral DNA is the host cell uracil base excision repair (UBER) system. Here we explore the relative UBER capacity of monocytes (MC) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and the fate of integrated uracilated viruses in both cell types to understand the implications of viral dUMP on HIV diversification and infectivity. We find that the kinetics for MC infection is compatible with their lifetime in vivo and their near absence of hUNG2 activity is consistent with the retention of viral dUMP at high levels at least until differentiation into macrophages, where UBER becomes possible. Overexpression of human uracil DNA glycosylase in MDM prior to infection resulted in rapid removal of dUMP from HIV cDNA and near complete depletion of dUMP-containing viral copies. This finding establishes that the low hUNG2 expression level in these cells limits UBER but that hUNG2 is restrictive against uracilated viruses. In contrast, overexpression of hUNG2 after viral integration did not accelerate the excision of uracils, suggesting that they may poorly accessible in the context of chromatin. We found that viral DNA molecules with incorporated dUMP contained unique (+) strand transversion mutations that were not observed when dUMP was absent (G→T, T→A, T→G, A→C). These observations and other considerations suggest that dUMP introduces errors predominantly during (-) strand synthesis when the template is RNA. Overall, the likelihood of producing a functional virus from in vitro infection of MC is about 50-fold and 300-fold reduced as compared to MDM and activated T cells. The results implicate viral dUMP incorporation in MC and MDM as a potential viral diversification and restriction pathway during human HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3043079711,"Wild boar are considered one the world's worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern Brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as Puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected."
https://openalex.org/W3043290063,"Although signal transduction by immunoreceptors such as the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), B cell antigen receptor (BCR), and Fc receptors uses the same schematic and similar molecules, the threshold and the fine-tuning are set differently for each receptor. One manifestation of these differences is that inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK) blocks TCR but not BCR signaling. SFKs are key kinases phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) in both these receptors. However, it has been proposed that in B cells, downstream kinase SYK can phosphorylate ITAM sequences independently of SFK, allowing it to compensate for the loss of SFK activity, whereas its T cell paralog ZAP-70 is not capable of this compensation. To test this proposal, we examined signaling in SYK- and ZAP-70–deficient B and T cell lines expressing SYK or ZAP-70. We also analyzed signal transduction in T cells expressing BCR or B cells expressing part of the TCR complex. We show that when compared with ZAP-70, SYK lowered the threshold for SFK activity necessary to initiate antigen receptor signaling in both T and B cells. However, neither SYK nor ZAP-70 were able to initiate signaling independently of SFK. We further found that additional important factors are involved in setting this threshold. These include differences between the antigen receptor complexes themselves and the spatial separation of the key transmembrane adaptor protein LAT from the TCR. Thus, immunoreceptor sensing of SFK activity is a complex process regulated at multiple levels.

Evolution of receptors and associated signaling pathways has generated a range of different signal transduction systems. However, among this variety, groups of receptors can be distinguished which utilize common schemes of signal transmission. The multiple usage of similar molecules in similar arrangements is typical for immunoreceptor signaling, including signaling by TCR, BCR, Fc receptors, NK cell receptors, and several others (1Irving B.

The signaling is initiated by Src family kinases (SFK), which phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM), located within intracellular domains of receptor-associated transmembrane adaptor proteins. Phosphorylated ITAM motifs serve as docking sites for SYK family kinases. Their activation is a crucial step in subsequent signal transduction.

In this study, we have re-evaluated these data using human B and T cell lines. We show that SYK-mediated ITAM phosphorylation is rather limited and that what may appear as SFK-independent signaling by SYK in studies employing SFK inhibitors can be largely explained by incomplete inhibition of SFKs, coupled to a low threshold for signaling initiation in B cells. Importantly, multiple components of TCR and BCR signaling apparatuses, including antigen receptors themselves, Src and Syk family kinases, and LAT, appear to be parts of a complex mechanism differentially setting this threshold for signaling by BCR and TCR. First, we established our experimental system using model T cell line Jurkat and B cell line Ramos. In Jurkat T cells, 2 μm concentration of PP2 was sufficient to completely inhibit Ca2+ response initiated by TCR crosslinking with anti–TCR antibody C305 (Fig. 1A).

The difference can be explained by two alternative hypotheses. First, that downstream B cell kinase SYK but not its T cell paralogue ZAP-70 can initiate receptor signaling by phosphorylating ITAMs independently of SFKs. Second, it is also possible that SFKs are incompletely inhibited by PP2 and their residual activity is sufficient to initiate signaling by BCR but not by TCR. To start addressing these questions we employed Jurkat-derived T cell line P116, which lacks expression of SYK and ZAP-70 (25Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Genetic evidence for differential coupling of Syk family kinases to the T-cell receptor: reconstitution studies in a ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T-cell line.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18 (9488454): 1388-139910.1128/mcb.18.3.1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We reconstituted these cells with SYK, ZAP-70, or empty vector (all containing IRES-CD90.1 reporter) and stimulated these cells with anti–TCR antibody C305. To select the cells with expression of SYK and ZAP-70 similar to their native expression in Jurkat and Ramos cells, we have determined the level of reporter gene CD90.1, at which the amount of transduced SYK or ZAP-70 was similar to the endogenous levels and then we gated on these cells using only the reporter (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). Interestingly, SYK expression somewhat increased TCR signaling resistance to SFK inhibition and these cells responded even in the presence of 5 μm PP2. However, 10 μm concentration, a standard dose widely used to inhibit SFK activity, completely abolished Ca2+ response in SYK expressing P116 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). This result suggested that although it contributes to the resistance of the signaling to SFK inhibition, SYK activity alone cannot explain it. To further dissect the role of SYK, we complemented the experiment in T cells with a similar experiment in B cell line Ramos. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we have obtained several clones of Ramos B cells, which lack expression of SYK (Fig. 1F). None of the tested clones was responsive to BCR stimulation and all the clones had comparable expression of BCR (Fig. 1G and data not shown). For further experiments, we have used one of these clones, hereafter termed R.SYKKO. To avoid clonal bias, we always used SYK reconstituted cells as a control. We transduced R.SYKKO cells with SYK, ZAP-70, and empty vector (Fig. 1H) and stimulated the cells with anti BCR antibody in the presence of different doses of PP2. SYK-expressing cells were similarly resistant to PP2 inhibition as original Ramos cells. Importantly, ZAP-70 expressing cells were also resistant to 10 μm PP2 and the signaling was only inhibited by 20 μm concentration (Fig. 1, I and J). Such a high resistance of ZAP-70–expressing cells suggests that the differences between ZAP-70 and SYK account only for part of the resistance of BCR signaling to SFK inhibition and additional mechanisms substantially contribute to this phenomenon. To test if SYK ability to phosphorylate ITAMs contributes to the BCR resistance to SFK inhibition, we have analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of CD79a immunoprecipitated from BCR-stimulated R.SYKKO cells reconstituted (or not) with SYK or ZAP-70. We also probed the phosphorylation of tyrosine 182 of CD79a in the whole cell lysates of the same cells to complement immunoprecipitation with an independent method (Fig. 2A). Expression of both SYK and ZAP-70 increased ITAM phosphorylation in activated cells detected by CD79a immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine staining. However, only in the case of ZAP-70 the difference was statistically significant (Fig. 2, A and B). Staining for phosphotyrosine 182 of CD79a in the whole cell lysates did not reveal any significant effects, although the results in general followed a similar trend with slight increase of tyrosine 182 phosphorylation in the presence of SYK or ZAP-70 (Fig. 2, A and C). These data do not support the hypothesis that SYK can potentiate ITAM phosphorylation more efficiently than ZAP-70. They rather suggest that ZAP-70 is at least as efficient as SYK if not better. Despite this, SYK was better able to restore the resistance of BCR signaling to SFK inhibition (Fig. 1, I and J). These observations led to the conclusion that any potentially unique ability of SYK to phosphorylate ITAM motifs is not the reason why BCR better tolerates SFK inhibition. Importantly, increase in ITAM phosphorylation induced by BCR stimulation could be observed even after treatment with 20 μm PP2 in the absence of SYK and presence of ZAP-70 or in the complete absence of SYK or ZAP-70 (Fig. 2, A–C), demonstrating that even high dose of PP2 is not able to completely inhibit ITAM phosphorylation by SFKs. Collectively, these data show that SYK ability to phosphorylate ITAMs does not explain increased resistance of SYK-expressing cells to SFK inhibition. In addition, they also show that there still is a residual SFK activity in PP2-treated cells, which is probably sufficient to trigger BCR-mediated signaling. To address the question whether TCR per se is inherently less sensitive than BCR to SFK activity, we transduced our T and B cell lines with chimeric protein composed of extracellular domain of CD16 and full-length TCRζ (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, CD16 is not expressed in any of the cell lines used in our experiments (Fig. 3C). Crosslinking of CD16-ζ on T cells induced strong Ca2+ response similar to the one elicited by TCR stimulation (Fig. 3D). Crosslinking of CD16-ζ on B cells induced relatively strong but already delayed Ca2+ response, which was inhibited by 10 μm concentration of PP2 (Fig. 3, E and F), indicating that antigen receptor composition is important for the resistance to SFK inhibition. To further explore this possibility, we transduced Jurkat T cells with the BCR complex, including IgH, Igα, and Igβ (Fig. 4A). We stimulated these cells with anti-TCR or anti-BCR antibody and treated with different doses of PP2. Interestingly, and analogously to CD16-ζ–induced signaling in B cells, BCR signaling in T cells was delayed compared with TCR signaling even in PP2 nontreated cells (Fig. 4B). However, despite this, BCR signaling was still more resistant to PP2 inhibition than TCR signaling in the same cells (Fig. 4, B–D), demonstrating that structural features of BCR contribute to the higher resistance of BCR signaling to SFK inhibition.Figure 4Ectopic expression of BCR in T cells increases the resistance to SFK inhibition.

Data are plotted and analyzed similarly as in Fig. 1E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even though BCR signaling in Jurkat T cells was more resistant to PP2 inhibition than TCR signaling in the same cells, it still could be completely inhibited by a relatively low dose of PP2, suggesting that other factors are contributing too. We have shown above that SYK activity is one of these factors. Next we wanted to test whether differences between SFK members in T cells and B cells can also be responsible. Therefore, we transduced the Jurkat BCR cells with Lyn, a major B cell member of Src family (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, in Jurkat BCR cells, Lyn expression accelerated Ca2+ response both in the absence and in the presence of PP2, which demonstrates certain level of nonredundancy between the T cell and B cell SFK and suggests that Lyn expression also slightly increases the resistance of BCR signaling to PP2. Moreover, the fact that Lyn was able to alter signaling output significantly more in the presence of PP2 further supports the argument that signaling in PP2-treated cells is still initiated by SFKs (Fig. 5, B and C). The data described above suggested that multiple members of antigen receptor signaling apparatus cooperate to set the threshold for the amount of SFK activity required for receptor activation. This threshold appears to be lower in B cells than in T cells, allowing B cells to respond even to the residual SFK activity surviving in the presence of PP2. When considering the differences between BCR and TCR signaling at the level of organization of the molecules potentially involved in regulating this threshold, we realized that one of the most apparent differences is in the usage of receptor-independent transmembrane adaptor LAT by TCR signaling machinery, which serves as a docking site for assembly of PLCγ containing signalosome. It was recently published that bridging the TCR to LAT requires adaptor function of Lck, which depends on Lck-mediated phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (18Yan Q. Barros T. Visperas P.R. Deindl S.

We speculated that because of its relative complexity, maintaining this bridge may require comparatively high SFK activity. Moreover, when functioning as a mere adaptor, Lck cannot employ enzymatic amplification and, thus, more Lck molecules in open active conformation are required to transduce the signal. To test this possibility, we wanted to bring LAT to the proximity of TCR independently of Lck-mediated bridging mechanism. To achieve this, we prepared chimeric protein composed of extracellular domain of CD16 and full-length LAT (Fig. 6A). It enabled us to co-crosslink TCR with LAT and thus probe the resistance of TCR signaling to SFK inhibition independently of LAT-bridging step. We transduced ZAP-70 or SYK expressing P116 T cells with chimeric construct coding for CD16-LAT (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, co-crosslinking of LAT to TCR resulted in resistance of the TCR signaling to 10 μm concentration of PP2, which is the highest level of resistance we were so far able to achieve in T cells. As expected, the resistance was more profound in case of SYK-expressing cells (Fig. 6, C–F). Although the resistance was still not as strong as in the case of B cells, the results support the conclusion that LAT bridging step is regulated by SFKs and that it is an important part of the mechanism by which TCR signaling apparatus sets the threshold for the amount of SFK activity required for signal propagation. In our work, we analyzed the mechanisms that make TCR signaling sensitive and BCR signaling resistant to the inhibition of SFK. This phenomenon has been observed in previous works. Similar difference in the sensitivity of antigen receptor signaling to PP2-mediated inhibition has been observed in primary mouse T cells and B cells (8Mukherjee S. Zhu J. Zikherman J.

This is a qualitative-quantitative study conducted in two municipalities in the semi-arid region of the state of Alagoas, northeastern Brazil. A structured questionnaire was applied to collect information on demographic and socioeconomic status and household access to food, based on the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale of 29 family farmers’ households. Food intake was assessed by food intake markers of the Ministry of Health, while nutritional status was determined by measuring the weight and height of all family members and waist circumference of adults. Nutrition diagnosis was performed using the cutoff points of body mass index for age. Three focus groups were conducted, and the information collected was analyzed through Content Analysis with the aim of knowing the participants' perception of the effects of the received water equipment. The study showed a high prevalence of excess weight (52.7%) and high risk for cardiovascular diseases (35.9%) marked by a high salt and sugar in the food intake. Food Insecurity Scale showed that food insecurity is a problem occurring in 75% of these families. However, focus groups showed that families have a positive perception of Boardwalk Cisterns for their food security. They believe that agricultural production has improved, thereby offering a wider range of foods and, consequently, improving food security. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of water access programs for food production within public policies to guarantee FNS."
https://openalex.org/W3043470286,"Objectives At any point in time, a person’s lifetime health is the number of healthy life years they are expected to experience during their lifetime. In this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, Health Adjusted Age at Death (HAAD), that facilitates comparison of lifetime health for individuals at the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups are worse off. A method for estimating HAAD is presented, and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of “worse off” as a proof of concept. Methods For individuals with specific conditions HAAD consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data from 2017 for all countries and for all diseases were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to have HAAD<20 (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of HAAD for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average HAAD (aHAAD) across all affected individuals. Results Even in settings where aHAAD is similar for two conditions, other measures may vary. One example is AML (aHAAD = 59.3, T20 = 2.0%, Q3-Q1 = 14.8) and ALL (58.4, T20 = 4.6%, Q3-Q1 = 21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with more lifetime health in high-income settings (Q1 in Japan = 59.2) than in low-income settings (Q1 in Ethiopia = 26.3). Conclusion Using HAAD we may estimate the distribution of lifetime health of all individuals in a population, and this distribution can be incorporated as an equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3043271614,"Non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been shown to modulate neuronal function and are used both in cognitive neuroscience and to treat neuropsychiatric conditions. In this context, animal models provide a powerful tool to identify the neurobiological mechanisms of action of tDCS. However, finding a current generator that is easily usable and which allows a wide range of stimulation parameters can be difficult and/or expensive. Here, we introduce the Open-tES device, a project under a Creative Commons License (CC BY, SA 4.0) shared on the collaborative platform Git-Hub. This current generator allows tDCS (and other kinds of stimulations) to be realized, is suitable for rodents, is easy to use, and is low-cost. Characterization has been performed to measure the precision and accuracy of the current delivered. We also aimed to compare its effects with a commercial stimulator used in clinical trials (DC-Stimulator Plus, NeuroConn, Germany). To achieve this, a behavioral study was conducted to evaluate its efficacy for decreasing depression related-behavior in mice. The stimulator precision and accuracy were better than 250 nA and 25 nA, respectively. The behavioral evaluation performed in mice in the present study did not reveal any significant differences between the commercial stimulator used in clinical trials and the Open-tES device. Accuracy and precision of the stimulator ensure high repeatability of the stimulations. This current generator constitutes a reliable and inexpensive tool that is useful for preclinical studies in the field of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation."

Of 24 cultivars investigated, No.5 Gambela showed the highest electron-donating capacity, as indicated by the highest peak area, height, and peak anodic potential. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated the contribution of polyphenols (rather than amino acids) on CV voltammograms of juice samples. The Eh-pH values of 173 sweet sorghum juice samples collected in 2017 aligned with quercetin model polyphenol. Accumulation of quercetin-like polyphenols in No.5 Gambela could offer antioxidant-rich juice for conversion to edible syrup as well as an increased tolerance against a recently emerged pest, sugarcane aphid [(Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner)]."
https://openalex.org/W3042611982,"Background Healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients and families are often faced with ethical dilemmas. The role of healthcare ethics committees (HECs) is to offer support in these situations. Aim The primary objective was to study how often HCPs encounter ethical dilemmas. The secondary objective was to identify the main types of ethical dilemmas encountered and how HCPs solve them. Subjects and methods We conducted a cross-sectional, survey-based study among HCPs in 14 Slovenian hospitals. A questionnaire was designed and validated by HCPs who were selected by proportional stratified sampling. Data collection took place between April 2015 and April 2016. Results The final sample size was n = 485 (385 or 79.4%, female). The response rates for HCPs working in secondary and tertiary level institutions were 45% and 51%, respectively. Three hundred and forty (70.4%) of 485 HCPs (very) frequently encountered ethical dilemmas. Frequent ethical dilemmas were waiting periods for diagnostics or treatment, suboptimal working conditions due to poor interpersonal relations on the ward, preserving patients’ dignity, and relations between HCPs and patients. Physicians and nurses working in secondary level institutions, compared to their colleagues working in tertiary level institutions, more frequently encountered ethical dilemmas with respect to preserving patients’ dignity, protecting patients’ information, and relations between HCPs and patients. In terms of solutions, all HCPs most frequently discussed ethical dilemmas with co-workers (colleagues), and with the head of the department. According to HCPs, the most important role of HECs is staff education, followed by improving communication, and reviewing difficult ethical cases. Conclusions Waiting periods for diagnostics and treatment and suboptimal working conditions due to poor interpersonal relations are considered to be among the most important ethical issues by HCPs in Slovenian hospitals. The most important role of HECs is staff education, improving communication, and reviewing difficult ethical cases."

In wild mammal populations, greying can change with life history or environmental factors (e.g., sexual maturity in silverback gorillas). Yet, whether humans are unique in our pattern of age-related hair depigmentation is unclear. We examined the relationship between pigmentation loss in facial hair (greying) to age, population, and sex in wild and captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Digital facial photographs representing three chimpanzee populations (N = 145; ages 1-60 years) were scored for hair greying on a scale of one [~100% pigmented] to six [~0% pigmented]. Our data suggest that chimpanzee head and facial hair generally greys with age prior to mid-life (~30 years old), but afterwards, greying ceases to increase incrementally. Our results highlight that chimpanzee pigmentation likely exhibits substantial variation between populations, and that both 'grey' and pigmented phenotypes exist across various age classes. Thus, chimpanzee facial hair greying is unlikely a progressive indicator of age beyond mid-life, and thus facial greying in chimpanzees seems different from the pattern observed in humans. Whether this reflects neutral differences in senescence, or potential differences in selection pressures (e.g. related to conspecific communication), is unclear and worthy of more detailed examination across populations and taxa."
