https://openalex.org/W3177618960,"‘Public engagement with science’ has become a ‘buzzword’ reflecting a concern about the widening gap between science and society and efforts to bridge this gap. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the development of the ‘engagement’ rhetoric in the pertinent academic literature on science communication and in science policy documents. By way of a content analysis of articles published in three leading science communication journals and a selection of science policy documents from the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and South Africa (SA), the variety of motives underlying this rhetoric, as well as the impact it has on science policies, are analyzed. The analysis of the science communication journals reveals an increasingly vague and inclusive definition of ‘engagement’ as well as of the ‘public’ being addressed, and a diverse range of motives driving the rhetoric. Similar observations can be made about the science policy documents. This study corroborates an earlier diagnosis that rhetoric is running ahead of practice and suggests that communication and engagement with clearly defined stakeholder groups about specific problems and the pertinent scientific knowledge will be a more successful manner of ‘engagement’."
https://openalex.org/W3179411660,"Introduction The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related restrictions (closed schools and sports centers, social isolation, masks) may have a negative impact on children’s health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of physical activity (PA) of Czech children during COVID-19 in autumn 2020. Methods Ninety-eight Czech children (mean age = 10.1 ± 1.47 years) completed the standardized Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Czech Children (PAQ-C/cz) during COVID lockdown. Data were compared with previously published norms. Thirty-five children also reported daily number of steps measured by accelerometers. Results Total PAQ-C score was 0.38 lower during COVID compared to Pre-COVID [ t (302) = 5.118., p &lt; .001]. The male PAQ-C total score was 0.37 lower [t(146) = 3.21., p = .002)] and the female total score was 0.39 lower [t(154) = 3.97., p &lt; .001] during COVID compared to Pre-COVID. Specifically, responses of PA during spare time, before-school, physical education (PE), and recess were significantly lower during COVID. The average number of steps was 7.767 steps/day (boys = 9.255; girls = 6.982). Conclusion COVID lockdown resulted in significant reduction of PA in Czech children. Strategies to promote adequate PA of children during the pandemic need to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3182774107,"The goal of this work was to evaluate changes in dietary fiber measured by the traditional enzymatic-gravimetric method (AOAC 991.43) and the more recently accepted modified enzymatic-gravimetric method (AOAC 2011.25), mono- and disaccharides, and starch as a function of assessed ripeness in a controlled study of a single lot of bananas and in bananas at the same assessed stages of ripeness from bananas purchased in retail stores, from different suppliers. Sugars, starch, and dietary fiber were analyzed in bananas from a single lot, at different stages of ripeness, and in retail samples at the same assessed stages of ripeness. Mean fiber measured by the traditional enzymatic-gravimetric method (EG) was ~2 g/100g and not affected by ripeness. Mean fiber assessed with the recently modified method (mEG) was ~18 g/100g in unripe fruit and decreased to 4-5 g/100g in ripe and ~2 g/100g in overripe bananas. Slightly ripe and ripe bananas differed by ~1.1 g/100g in the controlled single-lot study but not among retail samples. There was a large increase in fructose, glucose and total sugar going from unripe to ripe with no differences between ripe and overripe. Aside from stage of ripeness, the carbohydrate composition in retail bananas is likely affected by differences in cultivar and post-harvest handling. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of measuring dietary fiber using the mEG approach, developing more comprehensive and sensitive carbohydrate analytical protocols and food composition data, and recognizing the impact of different stages of maturity and ripeness on carbohydrate intake estimated from food composition data."
https://openalex.org/W3178714987,"Purpose Considering that time spent outdoors is protective for myopia, we investigated how ambient light levels reaching the eye varies across 9 outdoor and 4 indoor locations in 5 different environmental conditions. Methods Illuminance (lux) was recorded using a lux meter under conditions of weather (sunny/cloudy), time of a day (7:00,10:00,13:00, and 16:00 hours), seasons (summer/winter), and sun protection (hat and cap) in outdoor and indoor locations. Nine outdoor locations were “open playground”, “under a translucent artificial-shade”, “under a porch facing east”, “under a porch facing south”, “under a big tree”, “between three buildings”, “within 4 buildings”, and “canopy”. As a ninth outdoor location, “Under a glass bowl” in the outdoor location was used as a simulation for “glass classroom model” and measurement was taken at the floor level only to determine in overall the illuminance conditions with glass covered on all sides. The 4 indoor locations included “room with multiple large windows”, “room with combination light source”, “room with multiple artificial lights”, and “room with single artificial light”. Results The overall median illuminance level (median; Q1-Q3) recorded in 9 outdoor locations was 8 times higher than that of all indoor locations (1175;197–5400 lux vs. 179;50–333 lux). Highest illuminance in outdoor locations was recorded in “open playground” (9300;4100–16825 lux), followed by “under a translucent artificial shade (8180;4200–13300 lux) and the lowest in “within 4 buildings” (11;6–20 lux). Illuminance under ‘Canopy’, ‘between three buildings’ and ‘within four buildings’ was similar to that of indoor locations (&lt;1000 lux). Time of the day, weather, season, sensor position and using sun protection did not alter illuminance to change from high to low level (&gt;1000 to &lt;1000 lux). Among indoor locations, illuminance in “room with multiple large windows” crossed 1000 lux at a specific time points on both sunny and cloudy days. Conclusions Illuminance levels in outdoors and indoors varied with location type, but not with other conditions. Given the variation in illuminance in different locations, and the impact it may have on myopia control, appropriate detailed recommendations seems necessary while suggesting time outdoors as an anti-myopia strategy to ensure desired outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3178545361,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to mental health fallout in the US; yet research about mental health and COVID-19 primarily rely on samples that may overlook variance in regional mental health. Indeed, between-city comparisons of mental health decline in the US may provide further insight into how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting at-risk groups. Purpose This study leverages social media and COVID-19-city infection data to measure the longitudinal (January 22- July 31, 2020) mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 20 metropolitan areas. Methods We used longitudinal VADER sentiment analysis of Twitter timelines (January-July 2020) for cohorts in 20 metropolitan areas to examine mood changes over time. We then conducted simple and multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions to examine the relationship between COVID-19 infection city data, population, population density, and city demographics on sentiment across those 20 cities. Results Longitudinal sentiment tracking showed mood declines over time. The univariate OLS regression highlighted a negative linear relationship between COVID-19 city data and online sentiment (β = -.017). Residing in predominantly white cities had a protective effect against COVID-19 driven negative mood (β = .0629, p &lt; .001). Discussion Our results reveal that metropolitan areas with larger communities of color experienced a greater subjective well-being decline than predominantly white cities, which we attribute to clinical and socioeconomic correlates that place communities of color at greater risk of COVID-19. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is a driver of declining US mood in 20 metropolitan cities. Other factors, including social unrest and local demographics, may compound and exacerbate mental health outlook in racially diverse cities."
https://openalex.org/W3182993744,"Graphene oxide/metal-organic frameworks (GO/MOFs) have been prepared via solvothermal synthesis with ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, zirconium acetate and terephthalic acid for the purpose of removing organic pollutants from wastewater. The composites were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectrometry, and XRD. Tetracycline hydrochloride and orange II were implemented as model pollutants to evaluate the efficacy of the GO/MOFs in water purification, in which 50 mg of Zr/Fe-MOFs/GO was mixed with 100 mL of 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, or 50 mg/L tetracycline hydrochloride solution and 25 mg/L, 35 mg/L, 45 mg/L, or 60 mg/L orange II solution, respectively. The removal efficacy after 4 hours was determined to be 96.1%, 75.8%, 55.4%, and 30.1%, and 98.8%, 91.9%, 71.1%, and 66.2%, respectively. The kinetics of pollutant removal was investigated for both tetracycline hydrochloride and orange II and excellent correlation coefficients of greater than 0.99 were obtained. The high efficacy of these MOFs in pollutant removal, coupled with their inexpensive preparation indicates the feasibility of their implementation in strategies for treating waste liquid. As such, it is anticipated that Zr/Fe-MOFs/GO composites will be widely applied in wastewater purification."
https://openalex.org/W3181500921,"Background Norway has not implemented universal varicella vaccination, despite the considerable clinical and economic burden of varicella disease. Methods An existing dynamic transmission model of varicella infection was calibrated to age-specific seroprevalence rates in Norway. Six two-dose vaccination strategies were considered, consisting of combinations of two formulations each of a monovalent varicella vaccine (Varivax ® or Varilrix ® ) and a quadrivalent vaccine against measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (ProQuad ® or PriorixTetra ® ), with the first dose given with a monovalent vaccine at age 15 months, and the second dose with either a monovalent or quadrivalent vaccine at either 18 months, 7 or 11 years. Costs were considered from the perspectives of both the health care system and society. Quality-adjusted life-years saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios relative to no vaccination were calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of vaccine efficacy, price, the costs of a lost workday and of inpatient and outpatient care, vaccination coverage, and discount rate. Results In the absence of varicella vaccination, the annual incidence of natural varicella is estimated to be 1,359 per 100,000 population, and the cumulative numbers of varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over 50 years are projected to be 1.81 million, 10,161, and 61, respectively. Universal varicella vaccination is projected to reduce the natural varicella incidence rate to 48–59 per 100,000 population, depending on the vaccination strategy, and to reduce varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by 75–85%, 67–79%, and 75–79%, respectively. All strategies were cost-saving, with the most cost-saving as two doses of Varivax ® at 15 months and 7 years (payer perspective) and two doses of Varivax ® at 15 months and 18 months (societal perspective). Conclusions All modeled two-dose varicella vaccination strategies are projected to lead to substantial reductions in varicella disease and to be cost saving compared to no vaccination in Norway."
https://openalex.org/W3150924578,"Plant species from Annonaceae are commonly used in traditional medicine to treat various cancer types. This study aimed to investigate the antiproliferative potential of an alkaloid and acetogenin-rich fraction from the fruit peel of Annona crassiflora in HepG2 cells. A liquid-liquid fractionation was carried out on the ethanol extract of A. crassiflora fruit peel in order to obtain an alkaloid and acetogenin-rich fraction (AF-Ac). Cytotoxicity, proliferation and migration were evaluated in the HepG2 cells, as well as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), vinculin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was determined using Fluo4-AM and fluorescence microscopy. First, 9 aporphine alkaloids and 4 acetogenins that had not yet been identified in the fruit peel of A. crassiflora were found in AF-Ac. The treatment with 50 μg/mL AF-Ac reduced HepG2 cell viability, proliferation and migration (p < 0.001), which is in accordance with the reduced expression of PCNA and EGFR levels (p < 0.05). Furthermore, AF-Ac increased intracellular Ca2+ in the HepG2 cells, mobilizing intracellular calcium stores, which might be involved in the anti-migration and anti-proliferation capacities of AF-Ac. Our results support the growth-inhibitory potential of AF-Ac on HepG2 cells and suggest that this effect is triggered, at least in part, by PCNA and EGFR modulation and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. This study showed biological activities not yet described for A. crassiflora fruit peel, which provide new possibilities for further in vivo studies to assess the antitumoral potential of A. crassiflora, especially its fruit peel."
https://openalex.org/W3182086977,"The worldwide traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs sales figures have increased considerably to 50 billion US$ (2018). Astragali Radix (AR) is amongst the most often sold TCM herbs; sales in the European Union (EU) need European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval. However, comparisons of characteristic bioactive molecules concentrations in AR from different EU vendors are lacking. This study uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with standard addition to evaluate the influence of different sample and preparation types and ammonia treatment on bioactive molecules concentrations in AR. We also compare AR samples from different EU-vendors. Astragaloside IV (AG-IV), ononin and calycosin 7-O-β-D-glucoside concentrations were higher in root powder samples when extracted with boiled water than with ultrasonication using 70% methanol. AG-IV content was by far the highest in granulates from vendor 1 (202 ± 35 μg/g) but very low in hydrophilic concentrates from vendor 1 (32 ± 7 μg/g) and granulates from vendor 4 (36 ± 3 μg/g). Ammonia-treatment significantly increased AG-IV concentrations in all samples (e.g., to 536 ± 178 μg/g in vendor 1 granulates). Comparable effects were found for most other bioactive molecules. AG-IV and other bioactive molecules concentrations differed strongly depending on sample types, extraction processes, ammonia treatment-or-not and especially between different vendors samples. Ammonia-treatment is debatable, as it is supposed to convert other astragalosides, to AG-IV. The results indicate that routine quantitative analysis of major bioactive compounds present in AR, helps in quality control of AR and to guarantee the quality of commercial products."
https://openalex.org/W3178947855,"Graphene has shown great potential for improving growth of many plants, but its effect on woody plants remains essentially unstudied. In this work, Pinus tabuliformis Carr. bare-rooted seedlings grown outdoors in pots were irrigated with a graphene solution over a concentration range of 0–50 mg/L for six months. Graphene was found to stimulate root growth, with a maximal effect at 25 mg/L. We then investigated root microstructure and carried out transcript profiling of root materials treated with 0 and 25 mg/L graphene. Graphene treatment resulted in plasma-wall separation and destruction of membrane integrity in root cells. More than 50 thousand of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by RNA sequencing, among which 6477 could be annotated using other plant databases. The GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis of the annotated DEGs indicated that abiotic stress responses, which resemble salt stress, were induced by graphene treatment in roots, while responses to biotic stimuli were inhibited. Numerous metabolic processes and hormone signal transduction pathways were altered by the treatment. The growth promotion effects of graphene may be mediated by encouraging proline synthesis, and suppression of the expression of the auxin response gene SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNA 41 ( SAUR41 ), PYL genes which encode ABA receptors, and GSK3 homologs."
https://openalex.org/W3180725277,"Background The purpose of this study was to examine the association between electronic media use, including use of social media and gaming, and symptoms of depression, and whether gender or having friends moderated these associations. Methods This study was based on self-reported cross-sectional data from the Ungdata survey, conducted in 2018 by the Norwegian Social Research (NOVA) Institute in cooperation with seven regional drug and alcohol competence centres. The target group comprised 12,353 15–16 years old adolescents. Binominal logistic regression was used to analyse the association between electronic media use and symptoms of depression. Results The odds of having symptoms of depression were higher for those who used social media more than 3 hours per day (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.43–1.80), compared to those who used social media 3 hours or less per day. Additionally, the odds of having symptoms of depression was higher for those who used more than 3 hours on gaming per day (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.36–1.80), compared to those who used 3 hours and less on gaming per day after adjustment for potential confounders. There were no interaction effects between social media and gaming use with symptoms of depression. Neither were the associations between social media use and gaming with symptoms of depression moderated by gender or having friends. Conclusions The odds of having symptoms of depression were significantly higher for adolescents with a more frequent use of electronic media."

https://openalex.org/W3181022785,"Preservatives play an essentially role in ensuring that cosmetic formulations remain safe for use via control of microbial contamination. Commonly used preservatives include organic acids, alcohols and phenols and these play an essential role in controlling the growth of bacteria, fungi and moulds in substrates that can potentially act as a rich food source for microbial contaminants. Whilst the activity of these compounds is clear, both in vitro and in formulation, little information exists on the potential impact that common preservative systems, in full formulation, have on the skin’s resident microbiome. Dysbiosis of the skin’s microbiome has been associated with a number of cosmetic conditions but there currently are no in vivo studies investigating the potential for preservative ingredients, when included in personal care formulations under normal use conditions, to impact the cutaneous microbiome. Here we present an analysis of four in vivo studies that examine the impact of different preservation systems in full formulation, in different products formats, with varying durations of application. This work demonstrates that despite the antimicrobial efficacy of the preservatives in vitro , the skin microbiome is not impacted by preservative containing products in vivo ."
https://openalex.org/W3181831656,"Yellow fever (YF), Chikungunya (CHIK), and Zika(ZIK) are among re-emerging arboviral diseases of major public health concern. Despite the proximity of the Gambella Region to South Sudan where arboviral cases have been recorded repeatedly the current epidemiological situation is unclear in this part of southwest Ethiopia. Therefore, we conducted a community-based seroprevalence survey of YF virus (YFV), CHIK virus (CHIKV), and ZIK virus (ZIKV) infections in two selected districts. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two locations of the Gambella region (Lare and Itang) to investigate the seroprevalence of these viruses’ infections. Blood samples were collected from the study participants and screened for IgG antibodies specific to YFV and CHIKV infections using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For the detection of ZIKV specific IgG antibodies, Blockade-of-binding ELISA was used. Data were analyzed using the STATA version 13.1 Softwares. A total of 150 individuals (96 males and 54 females, age ranging from 18 to 65 years, mean age ± SD = 35.92 ± 10.99) participated and provided blood samples. Among the 150 samples 135, 90, and 150 were screened for YFV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, respectively. Hence, 2.9% (95% CI: 1.1–7.7%), 15.6% (95% CI: 9.3–24.8%), and 27.3% (95% CI: 20.7–35.3%) of samples tested positive for IgG antibodies to YFV, CHIKV, and ZIKV infections, respectively. Among the individual seropositive for ZIKV, YFV and CHIKV, only six, one and three had a history of residence outside the Gambella region respectively. Agro-pastoral occupation was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of IgG against CHIKV (AOR = 14.17; 95%CI: 2.30, 87.30) and residency in the Lare district (AOR = 11; 95%CI: 3.31, 39.81) was found to be significantly associated with a higher prevalence of IgG against ZIKV. Our findings revealed the occurrence of YFV, CHIKV and ZIKV infections in the study locations."
https://openalex.org/W3178436131,"Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. Physical disability and cognitive impairment due to stroke are conditions that considerably affect quality of life. We estimated the prevalence and incidence of possible vascular dementia (PVD) in older adults using data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS 2012 and 2015 waves).The MHAS is a representative longitudinal cohort study of Mexican adults aged ≥50 years. Data from 14, 893 participants from the 2012 cohort and 14,154 from the 2015 cohort were analyzed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of PVD. Self-respondents with history of stroke were classified as PVD if scores in two or more cognitive domains in the Cross-Cultural Cognitive Examination were ≥ 1.5 standard deviations below the mean on reference norms and if limitations in ≥ 1 instrumental activities of daily living were present. For proxy respondents with history of stroke, we used a score ≥3.4 on the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Crude and standardized rates of prevalent and incident PVD were estimated.Prevalence of PVD was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5-0.8) (0.5 with age and sex- standardization). Rates increased with age reaching 2.0% among those aged 80 and older and decreased with educational attainment. After 3.0 years of follow-up, 87 new cases of PVD represented an overall incident rate of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.7-2.6) per 1,000 person-years (2.0 with age and sex- standardization). Incidence also increased with advancing age reaching an overall rate of 9.4 (95% CI, 6.3-13.6) per 1,000 person-years for participants aged >80 years. Hypertension and depressive symptoms were strong predictors of incident PVD.These data provide new estimates of PVD prevalence and incidence in the Mexican population. We found that PVD incidence increased with age. Males aged 80 years or older showed a greater incidence rate when compared to females, which is comparable to previous estimates from other studies."
https://openalex.org/W3180584480,"Background Shared decision-making is a central component of person-centred care and can be facilitated with the use of patient decision aids (PtDA). Barriers and facilitators to shared decision-making and PtDA use have been identified, yet integration of PtDAs into clinical care is limited. We sought to understand why, using the concepts of complexity science. Methods We conducted 60-minute in-depth interviews with patients with diabetes, primary care physicians, nurses and dietitians who had participated in a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of MyDiabetesPlan (an online goal-setting PtDA). Relying on a qualitative description approach, we used a semi-structured interview guide to explore participants’ experiences with using MyDiabetesPlan and how it was integrated into the clinical encounter and clinical care. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim, then coded independently by two analysts. Findings 17 interviews were conducted (5 physicians, 3 nurses, 2 dietitians, 7 patients). Two themes were developed: (1) MyDiabetesPlan appeared to empower patients by providing tailored patient-important information which engaged them in decision-making and self-care. Patients’ use of MyDiabetesPlan was however impacted by their competing medical conditions, other life priorities and socioeconomic context. (2) MyDiabetesPlan emphasized to clinicians a patient-centred approach that helped patients assume greater ownership for their care. Clinicians’ use of MyDiabetesPlan was impacted by pre-existing clinical tools/workplans, workflow, technical issues, clinic administrative logistics and support, and time. How clinicians adapted to these barriers influenced the degree to which MyDiabetesPlan was integrated into care. Conclusions A complexity lens (that considers relationships between multiple components of a complex system) may yield additional insights to optimize integration of PtDA into clinical care. A complexity lens recognizes that shared decision-making does not occur in the vacuum of a clinical dyad (patient and clinician), and will enable us to develop a family of interventions that address the whole process, rather than individual components.

https://openalex.org/W3182630753,"Successful reproduction is critical to the persistence of at-risk species; however, reproductive characteristics are understudied in many wild species. New Zealand's endemic tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), the sole surviving member of the reptile order Rhynchocephalia, is restricted to 10% of its historic range. To complement ongoing conservation efforts, we collected and characterized mature sperm from male tuatara for the first time. Semen collected both during mating and from urine after courting contained motile sperm and had the potential for a very high percentage of viable sperm cells (98%). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a filiform sperm cell with distinct divisions: head, midpiece, tail, and reduced end piece. Finally, our initial curvilinear velocity estimates for tuatara sperm are 2-4 times faster than any previously studied reptile. Further work is needed to examine these trends at a larger scale; however, this research provides valuable information regarding reproduction in this basal reptile."
https://openalex.org/W3182744595,"The treatment response to anti-angiogenic agents varies among cancer patients and predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients with resistant cancer or guide the choice of anti-angiogenic treatment. We present ""the Cancer Angiogenesis Co-Culture (CACC) assay"", an in vitro Functional Precision Medicine assay which enables the study of tumouroid induced angiogenesis. This assay can quantify the ability of a patient-derived tumouroid to induce vascularization by measuring the induction of tube formation in a co-culture of vascular cells and tumoroids established from the primary colorectal tumour or a metastasis. Furthermore, the assay can quantify the sensitivity of patient-derived tumoroids to anti-angiogenic therapies. We observed that tube formation increased in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with the pro-angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). When investigating the angiogenic potential of tumoroids from 12 patients we found that 9 tumoroid cultures induced a significant increase in tube formation compared to controls without tumoroids. In these 9 angiogenic tumoroid cultures the tube formation could be abolished by treatment with one or more of the investigated anti-angiogenic agents. The 3 non-angiogenic tumoroid cultures secreted VEGF-A but we observed no correlation between the amount of tube formation and tumoroid-secreted VEGF-A. Our data suggests that the CACC assay recapitulates the complexity of tumour angiogenesis, and when clinically verified, could prove a valuable tool to quantify sensitivity towards different anti-angiogenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3177502577,"Manual axon histomorphometry (AH) is time- and resource-intensive, which has inspired many attempts at automation. However, there has been little investigation on implementation of automated programs for widespread use. Ideally such a program should be able to perform AH across imaging modalities and nerve states. AxonDeepSeg (ADS) is an open source deep learning program that has previously been validated in electron microscopy. We evaluated the robustness of ADS for peripheral nerve axonal histomorphometry in light micrographs prepared using two different methods.Axon histomorphometry using ADS and manual analysis (gold-standard) was performed on light micrographs of naïve or regenerating rat median nerve cross-sections prepared with either toluidine-resin or osmium-paraffin embedding protocols. The parameters of interest included axon count, axon diameter, myelin thickness, and g-ratio.Manual and automatic ADS axon counts demonstrated good agreement in naïve nerves and moderate agreement on regenerating nerves. There were small but consistent differences in measured axon diameter, myelin thickness and g-ratio; however, absolute differences were small. Both methods appropriately identified differences between naïve and regenerating nerves. ADS was faster than manual axon analysis.Without any algorithm retraining, ADS was able to appropriately identify critical differences between naïve and regenerating nerves and work with different sample preparation methods of peripheral nerve light micrographs. While there were differences between absolute values between manual and ADS, ADS performed consistently and required much less time. ADS is an accessible and robust tool for AH that can provide consistent analysis across protocols and nerve states."
https://openalex.org/W3180166647,"The cellular cortex is an approximately 200-nm-thick actin network that lies just beneath the cell membrane. It is responsible for the mechanical properties of cells, and as such, it is involved in many cellular processes, including cell migration and cellular interactions with the environment. To develop a clear view of this dense structure, high-resolution imaging is essential. As one such technique, electron microscopy, involves complex sample preparation procedures. The final drying of these samples has significant influence on potential artifacts, like cell shrinkage and the formation of artifactual holes in the actin cortex. In this study, we compared the three most used final sample drying procedures: critical-point drying (CPD), CPD with lens tissue (CPD-LT), and hexamethyldisilazane drying. We show that both hexamethyldisilazane and CPD-LT lead to fewer artifactual mesh holes within the actin cortex than CPD. Moreover, CPD-LT leads to significant reduction in cell height compared to hexamethyldisilazane and CPD. We conclude that the final drying procedure should be chosen according to the reduction in cell height, and so CPD-LT, or according to the spatial separation of the single layers of the actin cortex, and so hexamethyldisilazane."
https://openalex.org/W3181795462,"The RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 (MSI2) controls the translation of proteins that support stem cell identity and lineage determination and is associated with progression in some cancers. We assessed MSI2 as potential clinical biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) and tubulovillous adenoma (TA) of colon mucosa.We assessed 125 patients, of whom 20 had polyps of the colon (TAs), and 105 had CRC. Among 105 patients with CRC, 45 had stages I-III; among metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients, 31 had synchronous and 29 metachronous liver metastases. We used immunohistochemistry to measure MSI2 expression in matching specimens of normal tissue versus TAs, primary CRC tumors, and metastases, correlating expression to clinical outcomes. We analyzed the biological effects of depleting MSI2 expression in human CRC cells.MSI2 expression was significantly elevated in polyps versus primary tissue, and further significantly elevated in primary tumors and metastases. MSI2 expression correlated with decreased progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), higher tumor grade, and right-side localization (p = 0.004) of tumors. In metastases, high MSI2 expression correlated with E-cadherin expression. Knockdown of MSI2 in CRC cells suppressed proliferation, survival and clonogenic capacity, and decreased expression of TGFβ1, E-cadherin, and ZO1.Elevated expression of MSI2 is associated with pre-cancerous TAs in the colonic mucosa, suggesting it is an early event in transformation. MSI2 expression is further elevated during CRC progression, and associated with poor prognosis. Depletion of MSI2 reduces CRC cell growth.

Methods 120 human enamel samples were randomized into 3 groups (n = 40): APF-gel (1.23% F - , 4 min.); Laser+APF (Nd:YAG laser irradiation—0.6W, 84.9J/cm 2 , 10Hz, followed by APF-gel); and APF+Laser (APF-gel followed by laser irradiation). The samples were subjected to a 15-day pH-cycling, evaluated by OCT (quantification of optical attenuation coefficient–OAC) and FTIR (analysis of carbonate and phosphate content) before treatments, after treatments, and on the 5 th , 10 th and 15 th days of pH-cycling. The statistical analysis was performed (α = 5%). Results The Optical Attenuation Coefficient (OAC) assessed by OCT increases with the progression of demineralization, and the Laser+APF presented the highest values of OAC in 10 th and 15 th days of pH-cycling. Nd:YAG decreased the carbonate content after treatment regardless of the application order of the APF-gel, while APF-gel did not interfere in the composition of enamel. The carbonate content was also changed in the first 5 days of the pH-cycling in all groups. Conclusion Nd:YAG laser irradiation before or after the application of APF-gel did not influence the appearance of incipient caries lesions, showing no synergistic effect. Regardless of the application order of the APF-gel, laser irradiation reduces the carbonate content of the enamel, which also changes during the demineralization process. However, irradiation before the application of APF-gel increased the speed of progression of the lesions, which positively impacts public health as it can prevent caries disease, even in high risk individuals. OCT and FTIR are suitable for assessing this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3182741598,"The fear-avoidance model provides an explanation for the development of chronic pain, including the role of perception (i.e. pain catastrophism) as an explanatory variable. Recent research has shown that the relationship between pain catastrophism and avoidance is influenced in turn by different psychological and contextual variables, highlighting the affective-motivational ones. From this perspective, the Goal Pursuit Questionnaire (GPQ) was developed to measure the preference for hedonic goals (mood-management or pain-avoidance goals) over achievement goals in musculoskeletal pain patients. Recently, the Spanish version of the GPQ in fibromyalgia patients has been validated. Our aim has been to adapt the Spanish version of GPQ from pain to fatigue symptoms and to validate this new questionnaire (GPQ-F) in fibromyalgia. Despite the recognition of fibromyalgia as a complex disorder and the need for a differential study of its symptoms, fatigue, despite its high prevalence and limiting nature, remains the forgotten symptom. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 231 women with fibromyalgia. Previously, we adapted the Spanish GPQ for fatigue symptoms with three sub-studies (group structured interview, self-administration questionnaire and thinking-aloud; n = 15–27 patients). We explored the GPQ structure and performed path analyses to test conditional mediation relationships. Exploratory factor analysis showed two factors: ‘Fatigue-avoidance goal’ and ‘Mood-management goal’ (39.3% and 13.9% of explained variance, respectively). The activity avoidance pattern fully mediated the relation between both catastrophizing and fatigue-avoidance goals with fatigue. The study shows initial findings about the usefulness of the GPQ-F as a tool to analyze goal preferences related to fatigue in fibromyalgia. The results supported the mediational role of activity avoidance patterns in the relationship between preference for fatigue-avoidance goals and fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3163928658,"The ability to switch between different visuomotor maps accurately and efficiently is an invaluable feature to a flexible and adaptive human motor system. This can be examined in dual adaptation paradigms where the motor system is challenged to perform under randomly switching, opposing perturbations. Typically, dual adaptation doesn’t proceed unless each mapping is trained in association with a predictive cue. To investigate this, we first explored whether dual adaptation occurs under a variety of contextual cues including active follow-through movements, passive follow-through movements, active lead-in movements, and static visual cues. In the second experiment, we provided one group with a compensatory strategy about the perturbations (30° CW and 30° CCW rotations) and their relationships to each context (static visual cues). We found that active, but not passive, movement cues elicited dual adaptation. Expectedly, we didn’t find evidence for dual adaptation using static visual cues, but those in the Instruction group compensated by implementing aiming strategies. Then, across all experimental conditions, we explored the extent by which dual learning is supported by both implicit and explicit mechanisms, regardless of whether they elicited dual adaptation across all the various cues. To this end, following perturbed training, participants from all experiments were asked to either use or ignore the strategy as they reached without visual feedback. This Process Dissociation Procedure teased apart the implicit and explicit contributions to dual adaptation. Critically, we didn’t find evidence for implicit learning for those given instructions, suggesting that when explicit aiming strategies are implemented in dual adaptation, implicit mechanisms are likely not involved. Thus, by implementing conscious strategies, dual adaptation can be easily facilitated even in cases where learning would not occur otherwise."

Novel therapies for GBM are being developed under the orphan drug legislation and the knowledge on the molecular makeup of this disease has been increasing rapidly. However, the clinical outcomes in GBM patients with currently available therapies are still dismal. An insight into the current drug development pipeline for GBM is therefore of particular interest.To provide a quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat GBM.Quantitative cross-sectional analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database between 1983 and 2020. STROBE criteria were respected.Four orphan drugs out of 161 (2,4%) orphan drug designations were approved for the treatment for GBM by the FDA between 1983 and 2020. Fourteen orphan drug designations were subsequently withdrawn for unknown reasons. The number of orphan drug designations per year shows a growing trend. In the last decade, the therapeutic mechanism of action of designated compounds intended to treat glioblastoma shifted from cytotoxic drugs (median year of designation 2008) to immunotherapeutic approaches and small molecules (median year of designation 2014 and 2015 respectively) suggesting an increased focus on precision in the therapeutic mechanism of action for compounds the development pipeline.Despite the fact that current pharmacological treatment options in GBM are sparse, the drug development pipeline is steadily growing. In particular, the surge of designated immunotherapies detected in the last years raises the hope that elaborate combination possibilities between classical therapeutic backbones (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and novel, currently experimental therapeutics may help to provide better therapies for this deadly disease in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3178776582,"Although the pedicle is routinely used as a surgical fixation site, the pedicle wall bone area fraction (bone area per unit area) and its distribution at the isthmus of the pedicle remain unknown. The bone area fraction at the pedicle isthmus is an important factor contributing to the strength of pedicle screw constructs. This study investigates the lumbar pedicle wall microstructure based on micro-computed tomography.Six fresh-frozen cadaveric lumbar spines were analyzed. Left and right pedicles of each vertebra from L1 to L5 were resected for micro-computed tomography scanning. Data was analyzed with custom-written software to determine regional variation in pedicle wall bone area fraction. The pedicular cross-section was divided into four regions: lateral, medial, cranial, and caudal. The mean bone area fraction values for each region were calculated for all lumbar spine levels.The lateral region showed lower bone area fraction than the medial region at all spinal levels. Bone area fraction in the medial region was the highest at all levels except for L4, and the median values were 99.8% (95.9-100%). There were significant differences between the lateral region and the caudal region at L1, L2 and L3, but none at L4 and L5. The bone area fraction in the lateral region was less than 64% at all spinal levels and that in the caudal region was less than 67% at the L4 and L5 levels.This study provides initial detailed data on the lumbar pedicle wall microstructure based on micro-computed tomography. These findings may explain why there is a higher incidence of pedicle screw breach in the pedicle lateral and caudal walls."
https://openalex.org/W3179389969,"Background Malawi has halved the neonatal mortality rate between 1990–2018, however, is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 12 per 1,000 live births. Despite a high facility birth rate (91%), mother-newborn dyads may not remain in facilities long enough to receive recommended care and quality of care improvements are needed to reach global targets. Physical access and distance to health facilities remain barriers to quality postnatal care. Methods Using data We used individual data from the 2015–16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and facility data from the 2013–14 Malawi Service Provision Assessment, linking households to all health facilities within specified distances and travel times. We calculated service readiness scores for facilities to measure their capacity to provide birth/newborn care services. We fitted multi-level regression models to evaluate the association between the service readiness and appropriate newborn care (receiving at least five of six interventions). Results Households with recent births (n = 6010) linked to a median of two birth facilities within 5–10 km and one facility within a two-hour walk. The maximum service environment scores for linked facilities median was 77.5 for facilities within 5–10 km and 75.5 for facilities within a two-hour walk. While linking to one or more facilities within 5-10km or a two-hour walk was not associated with appropriate newborn care, higher levels of service readiness in nearby facilities was associated with an increased risk of appropriate newborn care. Conclusions Women’s choice of nearby facilities and quality facilities is limited. High quality newborn care is sub-optimal despite high coverage of facility birth and some newborn care interventions. While we did not find proximity to more facilities was associated with increased risk of appropriate care, high levels of service readiness was, showing facility birth and improved access to well-prepared facilities are important for improving newborn care."
https://openalex.org/W3180186669,"The annual migration and spawning event of Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) can lead to cross-boundary delivery of marine-derived nutrients from their carcasses into adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. The densities of some passerine species, including Pacific wrens ( Troglodytes pacificus ), have been shown to be positively correlated with salmon abundance along streams in Alaska and British Columbia, but mechanisms maintaining these densities remain poorly understood. Riparian areas near salmon streams could provide higher quality habitat for birds through greater food availability and more suitable vegetation structure for foraging and breeding, resulting in wrens maintaining smaller territories. We examined relationships between salmon biomass and Pacific wren territory size, competition, and habitat selection along 11 streams on the coast of British Columbia, Canada. We show that male wren densities increase and territory sizes decrease as salmon-spawning biomass increases. Higher densities result in higher rates of competition as male wrens countersing more frequently to defend their territories along streams with more salmon. Wrens were also more selective of the habitats they defended along streams with higher salmon biomass; they were 68% less likely to select low-quality habitat on streams with salmon compared with 46% less likely at streams without salmon. This suggests a potential trade-off between available high-quality habitat and the cost of competition that structures habitat selection. Thus, the marine-nutrient subsidies provided by salmon carcasses to forests lead to higher densities of wrens while shifting the economics of territorial defence toward smaller territories being defended more vigorously in higher quality habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3182906425,"The importance of coastal upwelling systems is widely recognized. However, several aspects of the current and future behaviors of these systems remain uncertain. Fluctuations in temperature because of anthropogenic climate change are hypothesized to affect upwelling-favorable winds and coastal upwelling is expected to intensify across all Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. To better understand how upwelling may change in the future, it is necessary to develop a more rigorous method of quantifying this phenomenon. In this paper, we use SST data and wind data in a novel method of detecting upwelling signals and quantifying metrics of upwelling intensity, duration, and frequency at four sites within the Benguela Upwelling System. We found that indicators of upwelling are uniformly detected across five SST products for each of the four sites and that the duration of those signals is longer in SST products with higher spatial resolutions. Moreover, the high-resolution SST products are significantly more likely to display upwelling signals at 25 km away from the coast when signals were also detected at the coast. Our findings promote the viability of using SST and wind time series data to detect upwelling signals within coastal upwelling systems. We highlight the importance of high-resolution data products to improve the reliability of such estimates. This study represents an important step towards the development of an objective method for describing the behavior of coastal upwelling systems."
https://openalex.org/W3178139368,"Donation after circulatory death (DCD) has expanded the donor pool for liver transplantation. However, ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) after DCD liver transplantation causes inferior outcomes. The molecular mechanisms of IC are currently unknown but may depend on ischemia-induced genetic reprograming of the biliary epithelium to mesenchymal-like cells. The main objective of this study was to determine if cholangiocytes undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) after exposure to DCD conditions and if this causally contributes to the phenotype of IC. H uman cholangiocyte cultures were exposed to periods of warm and cold ischemia to mimic DCD liver donation. EMT was tested by assays of cell migration, cell morphology, and differential gene expression. Transplantation of syngeneic rat livers recovered under DCD conditions were evaluated for EMT changes by immunohistochemistry. Human cholangiocytes exposed to DCD conditions displayed migratory behavior and gene expression patterns consistent with EMT. E-cadherin and CK-7 expressions fell while N-cadherin, vimentin, TGF β , and SNAIL rose, starting 24 hours and peaking 1–3 weeks after exposure. Cholangiocyte morphology changed from cuboidal (epithelial) before to spindle shaped (mesenchymal) a week after ischemia. These changes were blocked by pretreating cells with the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF β ) receptor antagonist Galunisertib (1 μM). Finally, rats with liver isografts cold stored for 20 hours in UW solution and exposed to warm ischemia (30 minutes) at recovery had elevated plasma bilirubin 1 week after transplantation and the liver tissue showed immunohistochemical evidence of early cholangiocyte EMT. Our findings show EMT occurs after exposure of human cholangiocytes to DCD conditions, which may be initiated by upstream signaling from autocrine derived TGFβ to cause mesenchymal specific morphological and migratory changes."
https://openalex.org/W3179050714,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy with few available targeted therapies. We previously reported that the phosphatase calcineurin (Cn) is required for LIC (leukemia Initiating Capacity) potential of T-ALL pointing to Cn as an interesting therapeutic target. Calcineurin inhibitors have however unwanted side effect. NFAT transcription factors play crucial roles downstream of calcineurin during thymocyte development, T cell differentiation, activation and anergy. Here we elucidate NFAT functional relevance in T-ALL. Using murine T-ALL models in which Nfat genes can be inactivated either singly or in combination, we show that NFATs are required for T-ALL LIC potential and essential to survival, proliferation and migration of T-ALL cells. We also demonstrate that Nfat genes are functionally redundant in T-ALL and identified a node of genes commonly deregulated upon Cn or NFAT inactivation, which may serve as future candidate targets for T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W3180264929,"Radiotherapy remains a mainstay of treatment for a majority of cancer patients. We have previously shown that the membrane bound matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP confers radio- and chemotherapy resistance to breast cancer via processing of the ECM and activation of integrinβ1/FAK signaling. Here, we further discovered that the nuclear envelope protein laminB1 is a potential target of integrinβ1/FAK. FAK interacts with laminB1 contributing to its stability. Stable laminB1 is found at replication forks (RFs) where it is likely to allow the proper positioning of RF protection factors, thus preventing RF degradation. Indeed, restoration of laminB1 expression rescues replication fork stalling and collapse that occurs upon MT1-MMP inhibition, and reduces DNA damage in breast cancer cells. Together, these data highlight a novel mechanism of laminB1 stability and replication fork restart via MT1-MMP dependent extracelluar matrix remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3180353987,"Predation is a major selective agent, so that many taxa evolved phenotypically plastic defensive mechanisms. Among them are many species of the microcrustacean genus Daphnia , which respond to an increased predation risk by developing inducible morphological alterations. Some of these features are obvious and easily recognized, e.g., crests in D . longicephala , while others are rather hidden, such as the bulkier shape of D . magna induced by the presence of the tadpole shrimp Triops . In this study we investigated the extraordinary diversity of morphological adaptations in the presence of predators with different foraging strategies in six predator-prey systems. For the first time we were able to analyze the unexposed and predator-exposed morphs comprehensively using three-dimensional scanning and reconstruction. We show that morphological changes are manifold in appearance between species and predators, and go beyond what has been known from previous 2D analyses. This further demonstrates the enormous trait flexibility of Daphnia . Interestingly, we found that among this variety some species share morphological strategies to counter a predator, while others use a different strategy against the same predator. Based on these intra- and interspecific comparisons, we discuss the mechanisms by which the respective defense might operate. These data therefore contribute to a deeper understanding of the inducible defenses’ morphology as well as their diversified modes of operation in Daphnia , being a cornerstone for subsequent investigations, including the determination of costs associated with morphological change."
https://openalex.org/W3181041250,"Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are expressed widely in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. One of the best characterised insect GABA-gated chloride channels is RDL, an abbreviation of ‘resistance to dieldrin’, that was originally identified by genetic screening in Drosophila melanogaster . Here we have cloned the analogous gene from the bumblebee Bombus terrestris audax (BtRDL) and examined its pharmacological properties by functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. Somewhat unexpectedly, the sensitivity of BtRDL to GABA, as measured by its apparent affinity (EC 50 ), was influenced by heterologous expression conditions. This phenomenon was observed in response to alterations in the amount of cRNA injected; the length of time that oocytes were incubated before functional analysis; and by the presence or absence of a 3’ untranslated region. In contrast, similar changes in expression conditions were not associated with changes in apparent affinity with RDL cloned from D . melanogaster (DmRDL). Changes in apparent affinity with BtRDL were also observed following co-expression of a chaperone protein (NACHO). Similar changes in apparent affinity were observed with an allosteric agonist (propofol) and a non-competitive antagonist (picrotoxinin), indicating that expression-depended changes are not restricted to the orthosteric agonist binding site. Interestingly, instances of expression-dependent changes in apparent affinity have been reported previously for vertebrate glycine receptors, which are also members of the pLGIC super-family. Our observations with BtRDL are consistent with previous data obtained with vertebrate glycine receptors and indicates that agonist and antagonist apparent affinity can be influenced by the level of functional expression in a variety of pLGICs."
https://openalex.org/W3181186918,"We investigated the expression and localization of the receptor activator nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in cartilage from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of relevance to cartilage degeneration. We also examined the role of exogenous lymphotoxin (LT)-α on RANKL expression in human chondrocytes and its effect on in vitro osteoclast differentiation. Cartilage and synovial fluid samples were obtained from 45 patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery or joint puncture, including 24 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and 21 patients with RA. RANKL expression in articular cartilage was examined by immunohistochemistry. LT-α concentrations in synovial fluid were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Normal human chondrocytes were stimulated with LT-α, and the relative mRNA levels of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG), matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Soluble RANKL protein in culture media was measured using ELISA, and membrane-bound RANKL protein in cells was examined by western blotting. Co-cultures of human chondrocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor and LT-α, and osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. LT-α concentrations were higher in RA synovial fluid than in OA samples. The population of RANKL-positive chondrocytes of RA cartilage was higher than that of OA cartilage, and correlated with cartilage degeneration. Stimulation of cultured human chondrocytes by LT-α increased RANKL expression, the RANKL/OPG ratio, and angiogenic factors. Membrane-bound RANKL in chondrocytes was up-regulated after stimulation of LT-α, whereas soluble RANKL in culture medium did not increase. Co-cultures of human chondrocytes and PBMCs demonstrated that LT-α stimulated human chondrocytes to produce RANKL and induced osteoclastic differentiation of PBMCs. RANKL produced by chondrocytes may contribute to cartilage destruction during RA and LT-α could promote the expression of RANKL in human chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3178203701,"This study aimed to quantify the influence of clays and partially oxidised cellulose nanofibrils (OCNF) on gelation as well as characterise their physical and chemical interactions. Mixtures of Laponite and montmorillonite clays with OCNF form shear-thinning gels that are more viscous across the entire shear range than OCNF on its own. Viscosity and other rheological properties can be fine-tuned using different types of clay at different concentrations (0.5-2 wt%). Laponite particles are an order of magnitude smaller than those of montmorillonite (radii of 150 Å compared to 2000 Å) and are therefore able to facilitate networking of the cellulose fibrils, resulting in stronger effects on rheological properties including greater viscosity. This work presents a mechanism for modifying rheological properties using renewable and environmentally-friendly nanocellulose and clays which could be used in a variety of industrial products including home and personal care formulations."

The study is aimed to assess the knowledge and practices of healthcare professionals, in a tertiary care setting, who deal with depressive symptoms amongst mothers. It gauges whether a psychological screening criterion is being implemented by the clinical staff during prenatal and postnatal visits to recommend steps that can help develop a service framework. A qualitative, exploratory study design was implemented for this research. With purposive sampling, eight in-depth interviews (three nurses and five doctors) at a single tertiary care hospital were conducted categorically using a semi-structured (open and close-ended questions) interview toolkit. Content Analysis was carried out using information gathered from the unit of analysis. The study provided evidence of the existing gaps in one particular tertiary healthcare system, within Pakistan, concerning diagnosis and management of maternal depression. Results highlighted that providers were well-versed with explanations of maternal depression, the aftermath of it, and the current status of healthcare; however, they were minimally educated about the specifics and levels of treatment. The gathered information assisted in recommending steps to develop a service framework."

However, population-based sex- and age-specific reference intervals and day-night differences in adults are lacking. Methods Sixty-five diagnostic ratios were calculated from steroid metabolites measured by GC-MS in day- and night-time and in 24-hour urine from 1128 adults recruited within the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (SKIPOGH), a population-based, multicenter cohort study. Differences related to sex, age and day- and night-time were evaluated and reference curves in function of age and sex were modelled by multivariable linear mixed regression for diagnostic ratios and were compared to values from the literature. Results Most ratios had sex- and age-specific relationships. For each ratio, percentiles were plotted in function of age and sex in order to create reference curves and sex- and age-specific reference intervals derived from 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles were obtained. Most ratios reflected a higher enzyme activity during the day compared to the night. Conclusions Sex- and age-specific references for 24 hours, day and night urine steroid metabolite ratios may help distinguishing between health and disease when investigating human disorders affecting steroid synthesis and metabolism. The day-night differences observed for most of the diagnostic ratios suggest a circadian rhythm for enzymes involved in human steroid hormones metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3179712298,"Multiple Imputation (MI) is always challenging in high dimensional settings. The imputation model with some selected number of predictors can be incompatible with the analysis model leading to inconsistent and biased estimates. Although compatibility in such cases may not be achieved, but one can obtain consistent and unbiased estimates using a semi-compatible imputation model. We propose to relax the lasso penalty for selecting a large set of variables (at most n). The substantive model that also uses some formal variable selection procedure in high-dimensional structures is then expected to be nested in this imputation model. The resulting imputation model will be semi-compatible with high probability. The likelihood estimates can be unstable and can face the convergence issues as the number of variables becomes nearly as large as the sample size. To address these issues, we further propose to use a ridge penalty for obtaining the posterior distribution of the parameters based on the observed data. The proposed technique is compared with the standard MI software and MI techniques available for high-dimensional data in simulation studies and a real life dataset. Our results exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach to the existing MI approaches while addressing the compatibility issue."
https://openalex.org/W3182089464,"Objective Post-traumatic posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) can be shown as radiocapitellar incongruity or posterior translation (PT) of the radial head in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to evaluate whether PT correlated with pathologic changes of lateral elbow stabilizers in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Materials and methods In MRIs of 160 patients with lateral epicondylitis, we measured PT of the radial head in the sagittal images. We qualitatively graded five lesions of the lateral elbow structures that included common extensor tendon (CET) lesion (grade 1–3), lateral collateral ligament complex (LCLC) insufficiency (grade 0–2), and absence or presence of bone marrow signal change, osteochondral lesion, and calcification. We analyzed whether the PT correlated with pathologic changes of the lateral elbow stabilizers and evaluated the diagnostic value of the PT for severe lesions. Results The average PT was 1.9 mm. The PT correlated with both the CET lesion ( p &lt; 0.001) and LCLC insufficiency ( p &lt; 0.001). The optimal cutoff values of the PT for grade 3 CET lesion and grade 2 LCLC lesion were 2.6 and 2.8 mm, respectively. When potential PLRI was defined as the PT of &gt; 3.4mm as suggested for post-traumatic PLRI, 21 patients had potential PLRI. The positive predictive values of the PT &gt; 3.4mm were 76% for grade 3 CET lesions and 67% for grade 2 LCLC insufficiency. Conclusion This study demonstrates that PT of the radial head correlates with pathological changes of the lateral elbow stabilizers. As radiocapitellar incongruity is easy to measure quantitatively, it can be used for screening potential PLRI in patients with lateral epicondylitis."
https://openalex.org/W3177644941,"Institutions that conduct animal research are often obliged to release some information under various legal or regulatory frameworks. However, within an institution, perspectives on sharing information with the broader public are not well documented. Inside animal facilities, managers exist at the interface between the people who conduct animal research and those charged with providing care for those animals. Their perception of transparency may influence their interpretation of the institutional culture of transparency and may also influence others who use these facilities. The objective of our study was to describe perceptions of transparency among animal research facility managers (all working within the same ethical oversight program), and how these perceptions influenced their experiences. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were used to describe perceptions and experiences of 12 facility managers relating to animal research transparency. Four themes emerged from the participant interviews: 1) communication strategies, 2) impact on participant, 3) expectations of transparency, and 4) institutional policies. Similarities and differences regarding perceptions of transparency existed among participants, with notable differences between participants working at university versus hospital campuses. These results illustrate differences in perceptions of transparency within one institutional animal care and use program. We conclude that institutions, regulators and the public should not assume a uniform interpretation of a culture of transparency among managers, and that sustained communication efforts are required to support managers and to allow them to develop shared perspectives."

However, in Ethiopia, there is a dearth of research evidence in this regard. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of undernutrition and its associated factors among adult chronic kidney disease patients.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in selected hospitals of Addis Ababa from May to August 2018. Data were collected by structured and pretested questionnaires. Patients' charts were reviewed from their medical profiles. Body mass index was calculated from anthropometric measurements using calibrated instruments. Serum albumin level was determined by reference laboratory standard procedure. Data were entered into Epi- data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and presented by tables, graphs and texts. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed and the level of statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05.From the total sample size of 403 participants, 371 were involved in the study. The prevalence of undernutrition (BMI<18.5) among adult chronic kidney disease patients was 43.1% (95% CI: 38%-48%). Undernutrition (BMI<18.5) was significantly higher among patients with diabetic nephropathy [AOR = 2.00, 95% CI, 1.09-2.66], serum albumin value less than 3.8g/dl [AOR = 4.21: CI, 2.07-5.07], recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus [AOR = 2.36, 95% CI, 1.03-3.14] and stage V chronic kidney disease [AOR = 3.25:95% CI, 1.00-3.87].Undernutrition in chronic kidney disease patients was significantly higher among patients with diabetic nephropathy, patients on stage V chronic kidney disease, recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and serum albumin value less than 3.8g/dl."

This is well-documented in cross-sectional and/or quantitative studies utilizing self-report instruments which compare children with and without VI. Young people’s views on the experience of growing up with VI as a developmental, change-driven process remain largely unexplored. Methods As part of our broader research programme on quality of life of visually impaired children and young people in the United Kingdom, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted between March and June 2015, with a stratified sample of 17 young people with VI, aged 16–19 years. An age-sensitive, empirically-based topic guide encouraged retrospective reflections on participants’ experiences of growing up with VI, including age-normative and vision-specific challenges. Results Descriptions of growing up with VI largely centered on an overarching higher-order theme labelled becoming me . Four themes representing everyday activities, attitudes, preferences and perceptions in relation to i) social relationships , ii) independence and responsibilities , iii) the future , and iv) rising to challenges emerged and were used by participants in their description of three stages in which they developed a sense of self: i) laying the foundations , ii) testing the waters , and iii) this is me . Differences in manifestation of VI influenced how young people made sense of their experiences and their sense of self. Conclusions Findings are discussed in relation to normative and vision-specific changes in psychosocial development during adolescence, including the development of identity. They highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of subjective well-being in a clinical population with a unique early life course trajectory."

To study infection in intact mammals, mice are often used as essential genetic models. Due to humane concerns, there is a constant unmet demand to develop studies that reduce the number of mice utilized while generating objective data. Here, we describe an integrated method of evaluating lung inflammation in mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV)-68. This method conserves animal resources while permitting evaluation of disease mechanisms in both infection settings. Lungs from a single euthanized mouse were used for two purposes-biological assays to determine inflammation and infection load, as well as histology to evaluate tissue architecture. For this concurrent assessment of multiple parameters from a single euthanized mouse, we limit in-situ formalin fixation to the right lung of the cadaver. The unfixed left lung is collected immediately and divided into several segments for biological assays including determination of pathogen titer, assessment of infection-driven cytokine levels and appearance of cell death markers. In situ fixed right lung was then processed for histological determination of tissue injury and confirmation of infection-driven cell death patterns. This method reduces overall animal use and minimizes inter-animal variability that results from sacrificing different animals for different types of assays. The technique can be applied to any lung disease study in mice or other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3183100692,"Multigenerational effects (often called maternal effects) are components of the offspring phenotype that result from the parental phenotype and the parental environment as opposed to heritable genetic effects. Multigenerational effects are widespread in nature and are often studied because of their potentially important effects on offspring traits. Although multigenerational effects are commonly observed, few studies have addressed whether they affect offspring fitness. In this study we assess the effect of potential multigenerational effects of parental body size and natal carcass size on lifetime fitness in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus marginatus (Coleoptera; Silphidae). Lifespan, total number of offspring, and number of offspring in the first reproductive bout were not significantly related to parental body size or natal carcass size. However, current carcass size used for reproduction was a significant predictor for lifetime number of offspring and number of offspring in the first brood. We find no evidence that multigenerational effects from larger parents or larger natal carcasses contribute to increased fitness of offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3177506002,"The shift from postauricular to transcanal microscopic tympanoplasty brings potential advantages of minimal morbidity, less postoperative pain, patient comfort, and surgical ease and speed, but also uncertainties of unfamiliar grafting material, an inadequate operation view, and an uncertain learning curve. These challenges might affect the successful repair rate and the frequency-specific hearing outcome, which is important for hearing perception. Rare studies reported frequency-specific hearing outcome with the learning curve for shifting from postauricular to transcanal microscopic tympanoplasty. Here, from Jul. 2013 to Nov. 2018, we compared patients in a shift from postauricular approach (35 ears) to transcanal approach (35 ears) of microscopic type-1 tympanoplasty. The results show that both of postauricular and transcanal microscopic tympanoplasties reduced the mean air-bone gap, 0.5k Hz gap, and 1k Hz gap after the surgery. The further analyses on gap change as a function of frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4k Hz) show that both of postauricular and transcanal tympanoplasties improved postoperative air-bone gap among the levels of frequency. The post hoc comparisons display a common gap reduction difference between 0.5k and 4k Hz. The successful repair rate did not differ between the 2 groups. There was no correlation between the postoperative mean gap change and the surgery date, suggesting a minimal learning-curve effect. The results of similar frequency-specific improvements and a minimal learning-curve effect may help to ease the concerns of those uncertainties before the shift."

However, as every coin has two sides, revaluation may also bring some possible losses. In this paper, bilateral associated game will be presented by taking into account the possible surpluses and losses when revaluing the worth of a coalition. Based on different bilateral associated games, associated consistency is applied to characterize the equal allocation of non-separable costs value (EANS value) and the center-of-gravity of imputation-set value (CIS value). The Jordan normal form approach is the pivotal technique to accomplish the most important proof."

Understanding the genomic structure, gene order, and gene content of chloroplasts (cp) of such species can provide a glimpse into the evolution of photosynthesis. In the present study, we obtained a well-annotated cp genome of M . arvensis using long PacBio and short Illumina reads with a de novo assembly strategy. The M . arvensis cp genome was a quadripartite circular molecule with the length of 153,312 bp, including two inverted repeats (IR) regions of 26,196 bp, divided by a small single copy (SSC) region of 17,786 bp and a large single copy (LSC) region of 83,134 bp. We detected 112 unigenes in this genome, comprising 79 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNAs, and four rRNAs. Forty-nine long repeat sequences and 51 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci of 15 repeat types were identified. The analysis of Ks (synonymous) and Ka (non-synonymous) substitution rates indicated that the genes associated with “subunits of ATP synthase” ( atpB ), “subunits of NADH-dehydrogenase” ( ndhG and ndhE ), and “self-replication” ( rps12 and rpl16 ) showed relatively higher Ka/Ks values than those of the other genes. The gene content, gene order, and LSC/IR/SSC boundaries and adjacent genes of the M . arvensis cp genome were highly conserved compared to those in related C3 species. Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that M . arvensis was clustered into a subclade with cultivated Brassica species and Raphanus sativus , indicating that M . arvensis was not involved in an independent evolutionary origin event. These results will open the way for further studies on the evolutionary process from C3 to C4 photosynthesis and hopefully provide guidance for utilizing M . arvensis as a resource for improvinng photosynthesis efficiency in cultivated Brassica species."
https://openalex.org/W3180593444,"Many studies show the importance of adult attachment styles and their impact on social and emotional adaptation in adulthood. However, there is no agreement about whether attachment should be regarded as typological or dimensional, and some authors have proposed reconciling both options, so that adult attachment styles can be assessed more accurately and realistically. In this study we have adopted this comprehensive view and used Factor Mixture Analysis, the most appropriate model for assessing this mixture view. More specifically, we attempted to determine the nature and types (if any) of attachment styles that can be assessed with the Adult Attachment Questionnaire (CAA), using this mixture view. A total of 515 adults from Spain took part, with ages between 18 and 56 years old. In addition to the CAA questionnaire, they completed the Parental Bonding Instrument and the emotional stability subscale of the Overall Personality Assessment Scale. On the basis of the CAA scores, the results show that only two profiles–insecure attachment and normal-range–can be univocally differentiated. Furthermore, the results of a full multiple-group structural model show that each of these profiles has a different pattern of validity relations with the external variables maternal care, maternal overprotection and emotional stability. These differential validity results reinforce the general hypothesis that two differentiated clusters of individuals can be distinguished on the basis of the responses to the CAA items."
https://openalex.org/W3182708380,"Disentangling the influence of environmental drivers on community assembly is important to understand how multiple processes influence biodiversity patterns and can inform understanding of ecological responses to climate change. Phylogenetic Community Structure (PCS) is increasingly used in community assembly studies to incorporate evolutionary perspectives and as a proxy for trait (dis)similarity within communities. Studies often assume a stationary relationship between PCS and climate, though few studies have tested this assumption over long time periods with concurrent community data. We estimated two PCS metrics-Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) and Net Relatedness index (NRI)-of fossil pollen assemblages of Angiosperms in eastern North America over the last 21 ka BP at 1 ka intervals. We analyzed spatiotemporal relationships between PCS and seven climate variables, evaluated the potential impact of deglaciation on PCS, and tested for the stability of climate-PCS relationships through time. The broad scale geographic patterns of PCS remained largely stable across time, with overdispersion tending to be most prominent in the central and southern portion of the study area and clustering dominating at the longitudinal extremes. Most importantly, we found that significant relationships between climate variables and PCS (slope) were not constant as climate changed during the last deglaciation and new ice-free regions were colonized. We also found weak, but significant relationships between both PCS metrics (i.e., NTI and NRI) and climate and time-since-deglaciation that also varied through time. Overall, our results suggest that (1) PCS of fossil Angiosperm assemblages during the last 21ka BP have had largely constant spatial patterns, but (2) temporal variability in the relationships between PCS and climate brings into question their usefulness in predictive modeling of community assembly."
