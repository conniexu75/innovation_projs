https://openalex.org/W1979456353,"When horseradish peroxidase is injected into the optic tectum of a chick, axons of ganglion cells transport it centripetally to their cell bodies in the retina at a rate of about 72 millimeters per day. After intraocular injections in the young chick, the peroxidase is transported centripetally along efferent axons, and is concentrated in cell bodies within the isthmo-optic nucleus. This retrograde movement of protein from axon terminal to cell body suggests a possible mechanism by which neurons respond to their target areas."
https://openalex.org/W1964517848,"Higher-order dendritic branching is considerably greater in Golgistained neurons from the occipital cortex of rats reared in groups in a complex environment than in similar neurons of littermates reared individually in laboratory cages have intermediate amounts of branching, while lower-order branching did not appear to be affected by any rearing environment."
https://openalex.org/W2015816135,"During the refractory period that follows ejaculation, the male rat regularly emits 22-kilohertz vocalizations. These cease after about three-fourths of the total period has elapsed, and this corresponds to an ""absolute refractory period"" during which the male cannot spontaneously initiate copulation. Similar 22-kilohertz vocalizations occur in other social contexts, and in general they appear to be desist-contact signals."
https://openalex.org/W2086519342,"The cochlear microphonic response was measured with differential electrodes from the first and third cochlear turns of normal guinea pigs and those treated with the ototoxic drug kanamycin. Histological controls showed that the outer hair cells in treated animals were missing over the basal half of the damaged cochleas, while the inner hair cells were intact. Measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the potentials produced by inner hair cells are proportional to the velocity of the basilar membrane, whereas potentials generated by outer hair cells (which dominate the response of normal cochleas) are proportional displacement of the basilar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2013223637,"The common marine mussel Mytilus edulis has been observed to rapidly take up mineral oil, [(14)C]heptadecane, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, [(14)C]toluene, [(14)C]naphthalene, and [(3)C]3,4-benzopyrene from seawater solution. This species of mussel did not metabolize any of these compounds, and transfer of the mussel to fresh seawater, after exposure to the hydrocarbon in solution, resulted in the discharge of most of the hydrocarbon, although significant amounts remained (between 1 and 400 micrograms per mussel). The nontoxic paraffinic hydrocarbons mineral oil and heptadecane were taken up (10 milligrams per mussel) to a much greater extent than the aromatic hydrocarbons (2 to 20 micro-grams per mussel)."
https://openalex.org/W2046466396,"Within certain auditory patterns, fainter sounds may be ""heard"" clearly when replaced by louder sounds having appropriate spectral compositions. This auditory induction of fainter by louder sounds can cancel the perceptual effects of masking. Phonemic restorations, which have been reported previously, appear to be a specialized application to speech of the much broader phenomenon of auditory induction. The rules governing auditory induction indicate that it helps maintain stable auditory perception in our frequently noisy environment."
https://openalex.org/W2021390962,"Detection sensitivities of a few parts per billion for ten gaseous pollutants have been evaluated by measuring the strength of the absorption of infrared radiation from carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide lasers. Ethylene concentrations as small as 5 parts per billion have been detected in air. The measured absorption strengths indicate that in mixtures of pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and water vapor, the sensitivity is reduced by overlapping absorption bands. However, calculations indicate that it should be possible to detect nitrogen dioxide concentrations of 0.01 part per million in the presence of water vapor concentrations of 105 parts per million."
https://openalex.org/W2001030378,"Cytochalasin B inhibits transport of (D)-2-deoxyglucose and of glucosamine into kukocytes, but does not impair uptake of kucine by these cells. This inhibitory action is rapid and reversible, and results in suppression of glycolysis. Cytochalasin B also blocks transport of (D)-2-deoxyglucose, but not of leucine, into mouse L strain fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2011090228,"Stimulation of the excitatory axon of the opener muscle of the crayfish in the presence of the metabolic inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol leads to depletion of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals containing round vesicles. Stimulation of the inhibitory axon under these conditions produces depletion of vesicles in other nerve terminals containing more elongate synaptic vesicles. The experiments show that terminals with round synaptic vesicles are excitatory and that terminals with elongate synaptic vesicles are inhibitory. Replenishment of synaptic vesicles appears to require metabolic energy."
https://openalex.org/W2089636758,"Nuclei and cytoplasm were transferred between a normal strain anda variant strain of Amoeba discoides heavily infected with bacteria. After 5 years of infection, the infective bacteria that were initially harmful to the host cells became harmless, and the nucleus of the host cell became dependent on the infective organisms for its normal functions."
https://openalex.org/W2044679472,"Abolut 1 milligram of twice-recrystallized fraction I protein of constant specific ribulose diphosphate carboxylase activity per gram of leaves (fresh weight) has been obtained from each of seven different species of Nicotiana and 14 reciprocal, interspecific F(1) hybrids. Crystals are produced from honmogenates that have only been centrifuged to remove particulate matter."
https://openalex.org/W2048209730,"Micrococcus luteus and Azotobacter sp. cells grown in broth in contact with a dialysis membrane containing lead bromide were found to immobilize 4.9 and 3.1 x 10(2) milligrams of lead per gram of whole cells, on a dry weight basis, respectively. Culture turbidity and cell count measurements on these and other cell cultures show that lead bromide, lead iodide, and lead bromochloride in concentrations approaching solubility limits have no detectable effect on overall growth rate and cell viability. Analyses of cellular subfractions reveal that fractions of cell wall plus membrane contain 99.3 and 99.1 percent of the lead found associated with Micrococcus luteus and Azotobacter sp., respectively. The remainder is found associated with the cytoplasmic fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1997879161,"The amplitude of a late positive component of the average evoked potential recorded from the human scalp varied systematically as a function of the observer's response criterion as defined within the context of signal detection theory. With signal intensity invariant, the P(3), component of the evoked potential increased monotonically with increasing strictness of the criterion. The results are viewed as supporting the signal detection theory approach to the analysis of discrimination behavior as well as providing further evidence of the sensitivity of P(3) to the manipulation of psychological variables."

The relative potencies of these compounds were closely correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficients and their pK(a) values."
https://openalex.org/W2021430762,"Human neoplasms derived from the same tissue have been previously shown to have tumor associated antigens characterizing that tissue type. Evidence is now presented for the existence of analogous antigens common to both rat bladder papillomas and carcinomas, and for antigens common to mouse bladder carcinomas. Rats immunized with syngeneic urinary bladder papillomas, then challenged with a methylcholanthrene pellet inserted into the bladder, develop (4 to 6 months later) fewer primary bladder tumors than rats immunized with normal bladder tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1966135993,"Ionic dependence of regenerative responses of the embryonic cell mnembrane has been studied successively at each stage of development from the unfertilized egg to the differentiated striated muscle in the tadpole larva of the tunicate. The unfertilized egg cell itself showed a type of regenerative response dependent on both sodium and calcium ions, while the spike potentials exclusively dependent on calcium ions were elicited in the differentiated muscle cell."
https://openalex.org/W2093618427,"Hemoglobin Ann Arbor, in which arginine replaces leucine in position 80 of the α chain, occurs in affected individuals in low proportion to hemoglobin A. Biosynthetic studies were performed on reticulocytes of a patient heterozygous for this hemoglobin. These studies suggested that the low percentage of hemoglobin Ann Arbor is primarily due to preferential destruction of the abnormal component. The reduced concentration of α Ann Arbor chains was also reflected in a decreased synthesis of normal β chains."
https://openalex.org/W2060978616,"The extracellular space of the rat brain was visualized by electron roscopy in sections of cerebral cortex fixed by freeze-substitution. The volume tissue occupied by the extracellular space was estimated stereomnetrically, and found to decrease from 20.8 percent in 3-month-old rats to 9.6 percent in escent animals, 26 months of age. This decrease in extracellular space indicates age-associated change in the microenvironment of nerve cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093886867,"The oxygen equilibria of Catostomus insignis hemoglobins are pH dependent. Catostomus clarkii hemoglobins have some components (20 percent) whose oxygen equilibria are independent of pH because the alpha chains have NH2-termini that are blocked and the beta chains lack the ""usual"" COOH-terminal histidine. Since the Bohr effect is normally a beneficial phenomenon, the maintenance of some hemoglobins without a Bohr effect must provide a physiological advantage that is habitat specific. The intrastream ecological preferences of these sympatric catostomids suggest that the hemoglobins without the Bohr effect confer an ecological advantage in a swift water habitat."
https://openalex.org/W1995977941,"Reports concerning the ineffectiveness of warfarin rodenticide, used at farms and stores in a rural area about 8 kilometers in diameter near Raleigh, North Carolina, prompted subsequent laboratory testing. All of the 25 Norway rats trapped from the area survived 6 days of no-choice feeding of bait containing 0.025 percent (by weight) warfarin."

https://openalex.org/W1979635373,Lymph nodes of normal rats contain lymphocytes that can be induced in vitro to mediate a specific cellular immune reaction against reticulum cells derived from syngeneic adult thymus glands. It is likely that these lymphocytes had access to reticulum cell antigens during the period in which they developed immunocompetence within the thymus. This suggests that contact with self-antigens during development may not eliminate self-reactive lymphocytes. These findings are in conflict with the theory that natural tolerance to self-antigens depends upon elimination of lymphocyte clones.
https://openalex.org/W2111191224,"Administration of certain commonly used barbiturates containing allyl groups, such as secobarbital, allobarbital, or aprobarbital to rats treated chronically with a microsomal enzyme inducer causes a rapid destruction of the liver microsomal hemoprotein that serves as the terminal oxidase for drug metabolism. In contrast, barbiturates without an allyl group do not have this effect. The decrease in this hemoprotein, cytochrome P(450), by the barbiturates containing an allyl group could also be demonstrated in an in vitro liver microsomal system requiring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. These results suggest that the barbiturates containing an allyl group are converted to a metabolite that leads to the destruction of cytochrome P(450)."
https://openalex.org/W1493541967,"Abstract The present study describes some characteristics of soluble hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, including end product inhibition by hemin. The enzyme is shown to contain a —SH group at its active center which is associated with the initial binding of the cofactor pyridoxal-5'-PO4 to the enzyme. In addition, the —SH group may influence the activation of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by divalent cations. A mechanism is suggested for the catalytic formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid from glycine and succinyl-CoA. From data derived from isotopic studies with [1 -14C]glycine, and studies utilizing specific inhibitors, the following sequence of reactions resulting in the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid is proposed. The initial formation of a thiohemiacetal between the enzyme and pyridoxal-5'-PO4; the subsequent formation of a Schiff base with glycine which is followed by its condensation with succinyl-CoA; the enzymatic reaction is terminated with the decarboxylation of the glycyl carboxyl group in association with the release of δ-aminolevulinic acid from the enzyme. End product inhibition of the mammalian enzyme was confirmed using hemin, which was demonstrated to have a Ki of 2 x 10-5 m. In addition, various metalloporphyrins, porphyrins, and bilirubin also inhibit δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity. The relative potencies of the inhibitors appear to be dependent on the net charge present on the tetrapyrrole."
https://openalex.org/W2037667867,"When the concentration of calcium ions in the cerebral ventricles is elevated, a fully satiated rat eats voraciously. This feeding response is not prevented by prior intraventricular administration of alpha-or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or other pharmacological antagonists. This supports the concept of an independent ionic mechanism, rather than a neurotransmitter one, for modulating a ""set-point"" for weight or hunger."
https://openalex.org/W2081722995,"Administration of a single large dose of ethanol to mice results in increases, for concentrations in the brain, of ratios of lactate to pyruvate, of aglycerophosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, of malate to oxaloacetate, and of glutamate to the product of alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonium ion. These changes are noticed as early as 5 minutes after the single dose is given. Ethanol administration for 30 days also produces these changes in metabolite concentrations in the brain. However, in contrast to the single alcohol dose, long-term alcohol administration results in a marked decrease in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate in brain and increases in those of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine monophosphate. Pyrazole, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, prevents the effects of ethanol on the concentration of brain metabolites. These results may provide new insight into the biochemical and pharmacological effects of alcohol on brain metabolism and the importance of alcohol dehydrogenase activity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2013722795,Lines leading forward from the eye may function as aiming sights in many small vertebrates. The chief evidence is the correlation of distribution and positions of eye-lines in various vertebrate groups with predatory feeding habits. Dark patches around the eye may serve to reduce glare in species in bright environments. Facial patterns often have multiple functions.
https://openalex.org/W2047961533,"The transport of [(3)H]putrescine is demonstrated by autoradiography in the retino-tectal tract of Brachydanio rerio embryos. Transport of [(3)H]putrescine appears to be more rapid than that of tritium-labeled protein and is not inhibited by a colchicine effect on axonal neurotubules as is protein transport. The radioactivity transported to the brain is found, on electrophoresis, in the putrescine fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1986686284,"The steady-state levels of potassium and sodium of taenia coli of guinea pig are critically affected by varying temperature in the narrow range 12° to 17°C. For the accumulation of both cations the critical temperature, Tc, is 13.8°C in the presence of 5 millimolar external potassium. The value of Tc decreases to 10.0°C when the external potassium is raised to 10 millimolar. Since, at a fixed temperature, the potassium accumulation follows a cooperative mechanism, the results are compared with the quantitative predictions of this approach. The critical thermal transition behavior can be described in terms of the cooperative accumulation process."
https://openalex.org/W1968707045,"Lymph node cells of rats sensitized with hen ovalbumin produced lymphotoxin after 6 to 12 hours of exposure to specific antigen. Lymphotoxin was assayed by its cytotoxicity for fibroblasts from syngeneic embryos during a 72-hour incubation. Cytochalasin B inhibited lymphotoxin production, as well as later DNA synthesis, at concentrations (0.1 to 5.0 micrograms per milliliter) comparable to those which affect microfilament function and cell motility in other systems, and this inhibition was reversible. Binding of antigen was not affected."

The uptake of potassium by these muscles is studied at three different temperatures as a function of external potassium concentration, K(ex). The steady-state potassium content of the tissue is related to K(ex). by a sigmoidal cooperative curve at all temperatures. These results are compared with findings on a mammalian smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2089619047,"Oxidation-reduction changes of cytochrome P-450 and oxygen consumption were measured in isolated perfused livers from normal and phenobarbital-treated rats. Phenobarbital treatment markedly increased the aminopyrine-induced reduction of cytochrome P-450, but ethanol did not cause any redox changes of this cytochrome. It was concluded that the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system has an insignificant role in the metabolism of ethanol in intact liver."
https://openalex.org/W2074900808,"Cerebral electrical abnormalities associated with variability of attention and responsivity were sought in individuals with schizophrenia and epilepsy. Experimental and control subjects were given stimulus-response tasks, and average power spectra for brief electroencephalographic epochs preceding responses of short and long latency were compared. Spectra that precede long-latency or erroneous responses resemble the ""ramp"" configuration of spectra computed from scalp electroencephalograms for 1-second epochs triggered by (time-locked to) focal subcortical spikes."

https://openalex.org/W2052984786,The ability of rats to perform correctly a bar-pressing response that meets a specific duration criterion is related through spectral analysis to systematic variations in response force. It is suggested that these oscillations are representative of sensory feedback which aids in making the required temporal discrimination.

https://openalex.org/W1976124752,"A 17-minute passage taken from a patient's talking in a psychoanalytic interview was played to 40 subjects, including trained therapists, therapists in training, and inexperienced undergraduates. Subjects were alerted to the organizing theme (termination of the patient's treatment) and asked to attend to direct and indirect references to this theme. Tonic heart rate, averaged over 30-second periods, was lower when clues were present on the tape than during control periods when clues were not present. Profiles of phasic heart rate were drawn for 11-second periods that overlapped the end of each clue and control passage. Profiles associated with clues were significantly lower than profiles for control passages; profiles for recalled and recognized clues showed a wave form distinct from that of profiles associated with unrecognized clues."
https://openalex.org/W2055007911,The internal conductivity of Aplysia neuron somata was measured by passing constant current pulses across a calibrated four-electrode array. The intracellular medium is less than one-tenth as conductive as seawater. The low conductivity probably results from structured cell water since ions are present in quantity and do not appear to be bound.
https://openalex.org/W2040917141,A simple model is presented to describe the principal links between environmental pollution on the 1 hand and population and per capita incomes on the other. There has been enough said about factors that could cause changes in the parameters of the model to make the following 2 main points: 1) no single cause is sufficient to explain this countrys environmental problems and 2) there is little about the pollution problems that the U.S. is likely to deal with during the next 50 years that is inevitable. It would not be difficult to devise government policies that would change the composition of consumption and induce technological developments that could have significant positive effects on the parameters. Additionally it is possible to bring about some beneficial changes in the distribution of the population and in the countrys institutions. Furthermore it is feasible that improvements resulting from these changes during the next 50 years could offset the effects of population growth per capita incomes and other factors working in the opposite direction. However massive changes in attitudes and behavior patterns that have become accepted as part of the American way of life would be required. Consequently the principal effect that a slowdown in the rate of population growth would have an effect that is not revealed in any system of equations is that is would allow time for changes in attitudes and institutions time for the power struggle between vested interest groups to be played out and time to devise and implement solutions.(Authors modified)
