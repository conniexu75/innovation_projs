https://openalex.org/W2335012284,"Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2077659966,"CAS9 nucleases, a new tool for genome editing, show significant offtarget activity. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) have rapidly emerged as a facile and efficient platform for genome editing. Here, we use a human cell–based reporter assay to characterize off-target cleavage of CRISPR-associated (Cas)9-based RGNs. We find that single and double mismatches are tolerated to varying degrees depending on their position along the guide RNA (gRNA)-DNA interface. We also readily detected off-target alterations induced by four out of six RGNs targeted to endogenous loci in human cells by examination of partially mismatched sites. The off-target sites we identified harbored up to five mismatches and many were mutagenized with frequencies comparable to (or higher than) those observed at the intended on-target site. Our work demonstrates that RGNs can be highly active even with imperfectly matched RNA-DNA interfaces in human cells, a finding that might confound their use in research and therapeutic applications."

https://openalex.org/W2157979200,"Despite efforts to understand the interactions between nanoparticles and cells, the cellular processes that determine the efficiency of intracellular drug delivery remain unclear. Here we examine cellular uptake of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) using cellular trafficking probes in combination with automated high-throughput confocal microscopy. We also employed defined perturbations of cellular pathways paired with systems biology approaches to uncover protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. We show that multiple cell signaling effectors are required for initial cellular entry of LNPs through macropinocytosis, including proton pumps, mTOR and cathepsins. siRNA delivery is substantially reduced as ≅70% of the internalized siRNA undergoes exocytosis through egress of LNPs from late endosomes/lysosomes. Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) is shown to be an important regulator of the major recycling pathways of LNP-delivered siRNAs. NPC1-deficient cells show enhanced cellular retention of LNPs inside late endosomes and lysosomes, and increased gene silencing of the target gene. Our data suggest that siRNA delivery efficiency might be improved by designing delivery vehicles that can escape the recycling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2073433320,"Gene expression profiles and chromosome 3 copy number divide uveal melanomas into two distinct classes correlating with prognosis. Using exome sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1, specifically occurring in uveal melanomas with disomy 3, which rarely metastasize. Targeted resequencing showed that 24 of 31 tumors with disomy 3 (77%) had mutations in either EIF1AX (15; 48%) or SF3B1 (9; 29%). Mutations were infrequent (2/35; 5.7%) in uveal melanomas with monosomy 3, which are associated with poor prognosis. Resequencing of 13 uveal melanomas with partial monosomy 3 identified 8 tumors with a mutation in either SF3B1 (7; 54%) or EIF1AX (1; 8%). All EIF1AX mutations caused in-frame changes affecting the N terminus of the protein, whereas 17 of 19 SF3B1 mutations encoded an alteration of Arg625. Resequencing of ten uveal melanomas with disomy 3 that developed metastases identified SF3B1 mutations in three tumors, none of which targeted Arg625."
https://openalex.org/W2074983857,"Branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1, the enzyme that initiates the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, is involved in glioma pathogenesis, making it a potential therapeutic target. Here we show that glioblastoma express high levels of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), the enzyme that initiates the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Expression of BCAT1 was exclusive to tumors carrying wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes and was highly correlated with methylation patterns in the BCAT1 promoter region. BCAT1 expression was dependent on the concentration of α-ketoglutarate substrate in glioma cell lines and could be suppressed by ectopic overexpression of mutant IDH1 in immortalized human astrocytes, providing a link between IDH1 function and BCAT1 expression. Suppression of BCAT1 in glioma cell lines blocked the excretion of glutamate and led to reduced proliferation and invasiveness in vitro, as well as significant decreases in tumor growth in a glioblastoma xenograft model. These findings suggest a central role for BCAT1 in glioma pathogenesis, making BCAT1 and BCAA metabolism attractive targets for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to treat patients with glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2115948084,"Transcription of the mammalian genome is pervasive, but productive transcription outside of protein-coding genes is limited by unknown mechanisms. In particular, although RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates divergently from most active gene promoters, productive elongation occurs primarily in the sense-coding direction. Here we show in mouse embryonic stem cells that asymmetric sequence determinants flanking gene transcription start sites control promoter directionality by regulating promoter-proximal cleavage and polyadenylation. We find that upstream antisense RNAs are cleaved and polyadenylated at poly(A) sites (PASs) shortly after initiation. De novo motif analysis shows PAS signals and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognition sites to be the most depleted and enriched sequences, respectively, in the sense direction relative to the upstream antisense direction. These U1 snRNP sites and PAS sites are progressively gained and lost, respectively, at the 5' end of coding genes during vertebrate evolution. Functional disruption of U1 snRNP activity results in a dramatic increase in promoter-proximal cleavage events in the sense direction with slight increases in the antisense direction. These data suggest that a U1-PAS axis characterized by low U1 snRNP recognition and a high density of PASs in the upstream antisense region reinforces promoter directionality by promoting early termination in upstream antisense regions, whereas proximal sense PAS signals are suppressed by U1 snRNP. We propose that the U1-PAS axis limits pervasive transcription throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2076124986,"Despite advances in sequencing, the goal of obtaining a comprehensive view of genetic variation in populations is still far from reached. We sequenced 180 lines of A. thaliana from Sweden to obtain as complete a picture as possible of variation in a single region. Whereas simple polymorphisms in the unique portion of the genome are readily identified, other polymorphisms are not. The massive variation in genome size identified by flow cytometry seems largely to be due to 45S rDNA copy number variation, with lines from northern Sweden having particularly large numbers of copies. Strong selection is evident in the form of long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as in LD between nearby compensatory mutations. Many footprints of selective sweeps were found in lines from northern Sweden, and a massive global sweep was shown to have involved a 700-kb transposition."

https://openalex.org/W2117130856,"Existing data are consistent with a role for the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) either in regulating emotion and enhancing behavioral flexibility or in updating valuations on the basis of motivational states. Here the authors show that excitotoxic lesions of OFC impair value updating but do not alter either behavioral flexibility or emotion regulation and that previous observations may have been the result of damage to nearby fiber tracts. Two ideas have dominated neuropsychology concerning the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). One holds that OFC regulates emotion and enhances behavioral flexibility through inhibitory control. The other ascribes to OFC a role in updating valuations on the basis of current motivational states. Neuroimaging, neurophysiological and clinical observations are consistent with either or both hypotheses. Although these hypotheses are compatible in principle, we present results supporting the latter view of OFC function and arguing against the former. We found that excitotoxic, fiber-sparing lesions confined to OFC in monkeys did not alter either behavioral flexibility, as measured by object reversal learning, or emotion regulation, as assessed by fear of snakes. A follow-up experiment indicated that a previously reported loss of inhibitory control resulted from damage to nearby fiber tracts and not from OFC dysfunction. Thus, OFC has a more specialized role in reward-guided behavior and emotion than has been thought, a function that includes value updating."
https://openalex.org/W2060424507,"Neuropathic pain is a refractory disease characterized by maladaptive changes in gene transcription and translation in the sensory pathway. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new players in gene regulation, but how lncRNAs operate in the development of neuropathic pain is unclear. Here we identify a conserved lncRNA, named Kcna2 antisense RNA, for a voltage-dependent potassium channel mRNA, Kcna2, in first-order sensory neurons of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Peripheral nerve injury increased Kcna2 antisense RNA expression in injured DRG through activation of myeloid zinc finger protein 1, a transcription factor that binds to the Kcna2 antisense RNA gene promoter. Mimicking this increase downregulated Kcna2, reduced total voltage-gated potassium current, increased excitability in DRG neurons and produced neuropathic pain symptoms. Blocking this increase reversed nerve injury-induced downregulation of DRG Kcna2 and attenuated development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. These findings suggest endogenous Kcna2 antisense RNA as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2031676034,"In the mouse whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1), respectively, are differentially activated during distinct whisker-based behavioural tasks; sensory stimulus features alone do not elicit these differences, suggesting that selective transmission of S1 information to S2 and M1 is driven by behaviour. In order to understand one's environment, it is necessary to know both the identity and the location of the objects within it. It is thought that in the visual system these two properties are processed in separate streams, but how different stimulus aspects are represented in the somatosensory system is less clear. Fritjof Helmchen and colleagues now show that in rats, distinct and largely non-overlapping projections from primary somatosensory cortex to secondary cortex and motor cortex are active during different tasks, demonstrating how information within an area can be segregated into separate outputs. In the mammalian neocortex, segregated processing streams are thought to be important for forming sensory representations of the environment1,2, but how local information in primary sensory cortex is transmitted to other distant cortical areas during behaviour is unclear. Here we show task-dependent activation of distinct, largely non-overlapping long-range projection neurons in the whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in awake, behaving mice. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored neuronal activity in anatomically identified S1 neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex in mice using their whiskers to perform a texture-discrimination task or a task that required them to detect the presence of an object at a certain location. Whisking-related cells were found among S2-projecting (S2P) but not M1-projecting (M1P) neurons. A higher fraction of S2P than M1P neurons showed touch-related responses during texture discrimination, whereas a higher fraction of M1P than S2P neurons showed touch-related responses during the detection task. In both tasks, S2P and M1P neurons could discriminate similarly between trials producing different behavioural decisions. However, in trials producing the same decision, S2P neurons performed better at discriminating texture, whereas M1P neurons were better at discriminating location. Sensory stimulus features alone were not sufficient to elicit these differences, suggesting that selective transmission of S1 information to S2 and M1 is driven by behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2027524220,"A genome-wide RNA interference analysis identifies the septin family of cytoskeletal filaments as important regulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry into the cell; septins are shown to organize plasma membrane microdomains important in STIM1 and ORAI1 signalling, and may also be relevant in membrane microdomains underlying other signalling processes. Cellular Ca2+ signalling is regulated by STIM (stromal interaction molecule) proteins, which are Ca2+ sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum that connect Ca2+ store depletion to the opening of the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane. ORAI proteins are the pore subunits of the CRAC channel and control the opening of this channel. Here Sharma et al. present a genome-wide RNA interference analysis designed to identify essential regulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry. They find that the septin family of cytoskeletal filaments are important regulators of this process, acting via the association between ORAI1 and STIM1. The STIM1–ORAI1 pathway of store-operated Ca2+ entry is an essential component of cellular Ca2+ signalling1. STIM1 senses depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in response to physiological stimuli, and relocalizes within the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma-membrane-apposed junctions, where it recruits and gates open plasma membrane ORAI1 Ca2+ channels. Here we use a genome-wide RNA interference screen in HeLa cells to identify filamentous septin proteins as crucial regulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Septin filaments and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (also known as PtdIns(4,5)P2) rearrange locally at endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions before and during formation of STIM1–ORAI1 clusters, facilitating STIM1 targeting to these junctions and promoting the stable recruitment of ORAI1. Septin rearrangement at junctions is required for PtdIns(4,5)P2 reorganization and efficient STIM1–ORAI1 communication. Septins are known to demarcate specialized membrane regions such as dendritic spines, the yeast bud and the primary cilium, and to serve as membrane diffusion barriers and/or signalling hubs in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cell polarity and cytokinesis2,3,4. Our data show that septins also organize the highly localized plasma membrane domains that are important in STIM1–ORAI1 signalling, and indicate that septins may organize membrane microdomains relevant to other signalling processes."
https://openalex.org/W1980864858,"Although transitions of sex-determination mechanisms are frequent in species with homomorphic sex chromosomes, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are thought to represent a terminal evolutionary stage owing to chromosome-specific adaptations such as dosage compensation or an accumulation of sex-specific mutations. Here we show that an autosome of Drosophila, the dot chromosome, was ancestrally a differentiated X chromosome. We analyse the whole genome of true fruitflies (Tephritidae), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) and soldier flies (Stratiomyidae) to show that genes located on the dot chromosome of Drosophila are X-linked in outgroup species, whereas Drosophila X-linked genes are autosomal. We date this chromosomal transition to early drosophilid evolution by sequencing the genome of other Drosophilidae. Our results reveal several puzzling aspects of Drosophila dot chromosome biology to be possible remnants of its former life as a sex chromosome, such as its minor feminizing role in sex determination or its targeting by a chromosome-specific regulatory mechanism. We also show that patterns of biased gene expression of the dot chromosome during early embryogenesis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis resemble that of the current X chromosome. Thus, although sex chromosomes are not necessarily evolutionary end points and can revert back to an autosomal inheritance, the highly specialized genome architecture of this former X chromosome suggests that severe fitness costs must be overcome for such a turnover to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1963992886,"The aggregation of the 42-residue amyloid β-protein (Aβ42) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Numerous flavonoids exhibit inhibitory activity against Aβ42 aggregation, but their mechanism remains unclear in the molecular level. Here we propose the site-specific inhibitory mechanism of (+)-taxifolin, a catechol-type flavonoid, whose 3',4'-dihydroxyl groups of the B-ring plays a critical role. Addition of sodium periodate, an oxidant, strengthened suppression of Aβ42 aggregation by (+)-taxifolin, whereas no inhibition was observed under anaerobic conditions, suggesting the inhibition to be associated with the oxidation to form o-quinone. Because formation of the Aβ42-taxifolin adduct was suggested by mass spectrometry, Aβ42 mutants substituted at Arg(5), Lys(16), and/or Lys(28) with norleucine (Nle) were prepared to identify the residues involved in the conjugate formation. (+)-Taxifolin did not suppress the aggregation of Aβ42 mutants at Lys(16) and/or Lys(28) except for the mutant at Arg(5). In addition, the aggregation of Aβ42 was inhibited by other catechol-type flavonoids, whereas that of K16Nle-Aβ42 was not. In contrast, some non-catechol-type flavonoids suppressed the aggregation of K16Nle-Aβ42 as well as Aβ42. Furthermore, interaction of (+)-taxifolin with the β-sheet region in Aβ42 was not observed using solid-state NMR unlike curcumin of the non-catechol-type. These results demonstrate that catechol-type flavonoids could specifically suppress Aβ42 aggregation by targeting Lys residues. Although the anti-AD activity of flavonoids has been ascribed to their antioxidative activity, the mechanism that the o-quinone reacts with Lys residues of Aβ42 might be more intrinsic. The Lys residues could be targets for Alzheimer disease therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2078678532,"Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease that leads to renal failure in childhood or adolescence. Most NPHP gene products form molecular networks. Here we identify ANKS6 as a new NPHP family member that connects NEK8 (NPHP9) to INVS (NPHP2) and NPHP3. We show that ANKS6 localizes to the proximal cilium and confirm its role in renal development through knockdown experiments in zebrafish and Xenopus laevis. We also identify six families with ANKS6 mutations affected by nephronophthisis, including severe cardiovascular abnormalities, liver fibrosis and situs inversus. The oxygen sensor HIF1AN hydroxylates ANKS6 and INVS and alters the composition of the ANKS6-INVS-NPHP3 module. Knockdown of Hif1an in Xenopus results in a phenotype that resembles loss of other NPHP proteins. Network analyses uncovered additional putative NPHP proteins and placed ANKS6 at the center of this NPHP module, explaining the overlapping disease manifestation caused by mutation in ANKS6, NEK8, INVS or NPHP3."
https://openalex.org/W2093405266,"The authors show that reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in select amygdalar and cortical regions and systemic or central amygdalar inhibition of mTORC1 during reconsolidation disrupts alcohol-associated memories, leading to a long-lasting suppression of relapse, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to prevent relapse. Relapse to alcohol abuse is an important clinical issue that is frequently caused by cue-induced drug craving. Therefore, disruption of the memory for the cue-alcohol association is expected to prevent relapse. It is increasingly accepted that memories become labile and erasable soon after their reactivation through retrieval during a memory reconsolidation process that depends on protein synthesis. Here we show that reconsolidation of alcohol-related memories triggered by the sensory properties of alcohol itself (odor and taste) activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in select amygdalar and cortical regions in rats, resulting in increased levels of several synaptic proteins. Furthermore, systemic or central amygdalar inhibition of mTORC1 during reconsolidation disrupts alcohol-associated memories, leading to a long-lasting suppression of relapse. Our findings provide evidence that the mTORC1 pathway and its downstream substrates are crucial in alcohol-related memory reconsolidation and highlight this pathway as a therapeutic target to prevent relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2088787411,"Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging of a bacterial glutamate transporter reveals how the transport domains move. Glutamate transporters have a central role in neural transmission by maintaining low concentrations of neurotransmitter within synapses in the brain. The mechanism of transport involves transitions between extracellular- and intracellular-facing conformations, whereby substrate-binding sites become accessible to the opposite sides of the plasma membrane. Two papers in this issue of Nature report the use of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging to directly observe large-scale transport domain movements in bacterial/archaeal homologues of glutamate transporters. Nurunisa Akyuz et al. find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence (reflecting stable conformations that closely resemble crystal structures of the outward- and inward-facing states) and periods of rapid transition (reflecting transmembrane movements of individual transport domains). Guus Erkens et al. show that the three GltPh subunits undergo conformational changes stochastically, and independently of each other. Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse neurotransmitter uptake from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glial cells and neurons1. Their mechanism of action involves transitions between extracellular (outward)-facing and intracellular (inward)-facing conformations, whereby substrate binding sites become accessible to either side of the membrane2. This process has been proposed to entail transmembrane movements of three discrete transport domains within a trimeric scaffold3. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging4, we have directly observed large-scale transport domain movements in a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters. We find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions, reminiscent of bursting patterns first recorded in single ion channels using patch-clamp methods5,6. We propose that the switch to the dynamic mode in glutamate transporters is due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold, which precedes domain movements across the bilayer. This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2003562985,"Although the contribution of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in cancer progression is emerging, their potential roles in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unclear. Here, we showed that PCa cells could recruit BM-MSCs and consequently the metastatic ability of PCa cells was increased. We also found that the increased metastatic ability of PCa cells could be due to the increased PCa stem cell population. Mechanism dissection studies found that the upregulation of Chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) expression in BM-MSCs and PCa cells, after MSCs infiltrated into the PCa cells, subsequently downregulated androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which was due to inhibition of AR nuclear translocation. Interruption of such signaling led to suppression of the BM-MSCs-induced PCa stem cell population increase and thereby inhibited the metastatic ability of PCa cells. The PCa stem cell increase then led to the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, ZEB-1, CD133 and CXCR4 molecules, and enhanced the metastatic ability of PCa cells. Therefore, we conclude that the BM-MSCs-mediated increased metastatic ability of PCa cells can be due to the PCa stem cell increase via alteration of the CCL5-AR signaling pathway. Together, these results uncover the important roles of BM-MSCs as key components in the prostate tumor microenvironment to promote PCa metastasis and may provide a new potential target to suppress PCa metastasis by blocking BM-MSCs infiltration into PCa."
https://openalex.org/W1977441749,"Finding sought visual targets requires our brains to flexibly combine working memory information about what we are looking for with visual information about what we are looking at. To investigate the neural computations involved in finding visual targets, we recorded neural responses in inferotemporal cortex (IT) and perirhinal cortex (PRH) as macaque monkeys performed a task that required them to find targets in sequences of distractors. We found similar amounts of total task-specific information in both areas; however, information about whether a target was in view was more accessible using a linear read-out or, equivalently, was more untangled in PRH. Consistent with the flow of information from IT to PRH, we also found that task-relevant information arrived earlier in IT. PRH responses were well-described by a functional model in which computations in PRH untangle input from IT by combining neurons with asymmetric tuning correlations for target matches and distractors."
https://openalex.org/W1980879721,"Following exocytosis, the rate of recovery of neurotransmitter release is determined by vesicle retrieval from the plasma membrane and by recruitment of vesicles from reserve pools within the synapse, which is dependent on mitochondrial ATP. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL also regulates neurotransmitter release and recovery in part by increasing ATP availability from mitochondria. We now find, that Bcl-xL directly regulates endocytic vesicle retrieval in hippocampal neurons through protein–protein interaction with components of the clathrin complex. Our evidence suggests that, during synaptic stimulation, Bcl-xL translocates to clathrin-coated pits in a calmodulin-dependent manner and forms a complex with the GTPase Drp1, Mff and clathrin. Depletion of Drp1 produces misformed endocytic vesicles. Mutagenesis studies suggest that formation of the Bcl-xL–Drp1 complex is necessary for the enhanced rate of vesicle endocytosis produced by Bcl-xL, thus providing a mechanism for presynaptic plasticity. Recovery of neurotransmitter involves the endocytic retrieval of vesicles from the plasma membrane. Jonas and colleagues show that in hippocampal synapses, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL enhances the recovery of a vesicle pool. It does this independently of its mitochondrial function, through its calmodulin-stimulated translocation to clathrin-coated pits and recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Drp1."
https://openalex.org/W2017435800,"The precise splicing of genes confers an enormous transcriptional complexity to the human genome. The majority of gene splicing occurs cotranscriptionally, permitting epigenetic modifications to affect splicing outcomes. Here we show that select exonic regions are demarcated within the three-dimensional structure of the human genome. We identify a subset of exons that exhibit DNase I hypersensitivity and are accompanied by 'phantom' signals in chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) that result from cross-linking with proximal promoter- or enhancer-bound factors. The capture of structural features by ChIP-seq is confirmed by chromatin interaction analysis that resolves local intragenic loops that fold exons close to cognate promoters while excluding intervening intronic sequences. These interactions of exons with promoters and enhancers are enriched for alternative splicing events, an effect reflected in cell type-specific periexonic DNase I hypersensitivity patterns. Collectively, our results connect local genome topography, chromatin structure and cis-regulatory landscapes with the generation of human transcriptional complexity by cotranscriptional splicing."

The immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses of vertebrates depend on exquisitely controlled and marshaled patterns of gene expression. Among the central regulators of these coordinated events are members of the NF-κB family of nuclear transcription factors (1.Baldwin A.S.

In their resting or inactive state, NF-κB factors exist as cytoplasmic complexes with members of the NF-κB inhibitor protein family, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ. These interactions prevent translocation of NF-κB proteins to the nucleus and restrain them from binding to cognate sites on DNA and stimulating the transcription of target genes. The multisubunit protein kinase IKK 5The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; hIKKβ, human IKKβ; KD, kinase domain; ULD, ubiquitin-like domain; SDD, scaffold/dimerization domain; xIKKβ, Xenopus laevis IKKβ. regulates NF-κB activation (5.Israël A. The IKK complex, a central regulator of NF-κB activation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000158Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial, or viral products, or various types of stress lead to IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκB inhibitor proteins, an event that activates the canonical NF-κB pathway. Phosphorylation permits IκB proteins to be polyubiquitinated and then catabolized by the proteasome. Liberation from their inhibitors leaves NF-κB factors free to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of genes encoding proteins that participate in the immune and inflammatory response, cell adhesion, growth control, and protection against apoptosis. A subset of inducers can also stimulate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, in which IKK-mediated phosphorylation of the IκB-like domain in the NF-κB2 protein leads to activation of that transcription factor (6.Scheidereit C. IκB kinase complexes: gateways to NF-κB activation and transcription.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). IKK is a multiprotein complex that contains two possible kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory subunit, NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) (7.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T.

NEMO is essential for the activation and substrate specificity of IKK (9.Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A.

Cell. 2012; 47: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both IKKα and IKKβ contain an N-terminal kinase domain (KD, residues 15–308 in hIKKβ), a leucine zipper region (residues 458–479), and a helix-loop-helix region (residues 603–642) (11.Zandi E.

Each kinase has a NEMO binding domain at its carboxyl terminus (residues 737–742). IKKβ also has an additional ULD domain after the KD, which is absent in IKKα. The novel ULD domain is required for the functional activity of IKKβ and important for its substrate specificity (12.May M.J. Larsen S.E. Shim J.H. Madge L.A. Ghosh S.

Two IKK-related kinases, IKKϵ (or IKK-I) and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase) (14.Häcker H. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) also contribute to immune responses but mediate different signal pathways (15.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J.

Of the principal kinases, IKKα and IKKβ seem to have very distinct functions: IKKβ is a more potent NF-κB activator and plays a major role in the canonical NF-κB pathway responsible for immune responses, whereas IKKα is more important in the non-canonical pathway required for developmental processes (16.Hatada E.N.

Because of its importance in many human diseases, hIKKβ has been viewed widely as a potential therapeutic target (4.Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B.

Nuclear factor-κB in cancer development and progression.Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). The first crystal structures of an IKKβ, reported for the phosphomimetic mutant of Xenopus laevis IKKβ, xIKKβ(S177E/S181E), have greatly advanced our understanding of IKK (13.Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X. Jiang X. Dreano M. Karin M. Wu H. Crystal structure of inhibitor of κB kinase β.Nature. 2011; 472: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similar structural elucidation of IKKβ in an active phosphorylated state has been hampered by the inherent kinase heterogeneity due to phosphorylation. We have produced and isolated a near full-length human IKKβ wild type protein, which was phosphorylated at the activation loop and retained kinase activity. We then co-crystallized this protein with the staurosporine analog K252a. Here, we report the resulting 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of a phosphorylated hIKKβ dimer and delineate its mechanistic similarities and distinctions from that of the unphosphorylated xIKKβ dimer. In addition, compared with the reported structures of xIKKβ determined at 3.6 and 4.0 Å resolution, respectively (13.Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X. Jiang X. Dreano M. Karin M. Wu H. Crystal structure of inhibitor of κB kinase β.Nature. 2011; 472: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the present hIKKβ structure resolves many new additional details at a sufficiently high resolution to permit structure based drug design. We complement our data with biochemical analysis of the dimer formation and mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphorylation state. A construct encoding a hexahistidine tag followed by residues 1–664 of hIKKβ was cloned into a pBacPAK vector (Clontech) to enable its expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells. As a result of cloning, the hIKKβ(1–664) sequence was extended with the vector-derived residues SPGRPLN at its C terminus. The vector was then transfected into Sf9 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech), and a clonal isolate was amplified in suspension culture using shake flasks (Invitrogen). A multiplicity of infection of 0.5 pfu/cell was used to infect Sf9 cells at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. The amplified virus was then used to infect Sf21 cells at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml with a multiplicity of infection of ∼2.0 pfu/cell. The cells were harvested at 72 h post infection, pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sf21 cell pellets expressing hIKKβ(1–664) were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed using a Parr Bomb, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed extensively with the lysis buffer, after which hIKKβ(1–664) was step-eluted with lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The nickel column eluate was diluted 4-fold with buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm DTT) and loaded onto a heparin affinity column. The column was developed with a NaCl gradient to 1.0 m, and hIKKβ-containing fractions were combined and diluted 3-fold with buffer A before being loaded onto a MonoQ HR10/10 column (Pharmacia). The MonoQ column was washed extensively with buffer A, and the column was developed with a NaCl gradient to 1.0 m. Fractions containing pure hIKKβ were identified by a SDS-PAGE 4–12% gel and concentrated before loading onto a TSK G3000 gel filtration column equilibrated with the SEC running buffer (25 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). The hIKKβ peak was collected and used for subsequent studies. The His-tagged hIKKβ (1–664) protein was crystallized using the hanging drop method. Crystallization drops were formed by mixing protein at 6 mg/ml in the presence of 2-fold molar excess of the staurosporine analog K252a with an equal volume of a precipitant solution of 22% PEG 3350 and 120 mm trilithium citrate. Crystals were soaked briefly in a cryoprotectant solution of the precipitant solution containing 20% PEG 400 before being flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of hIKKβ were of the P21 space group. The best crystallographic data set was collected on a single crystal which diffracted to 2.8 Å at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, California) and was processed with program HKL2000 (21.Otwinowski Z.

Extensive model rebuilding was carried out using Coot (24.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar), and refinements were carried out using program Buster with TLS options (25.Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Dynamic light scattering experiments were conducted using a DynaPro DLS instrument for each sample to determine the hydrodynamic radius of the protein. Protein samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a desktop microfuge at 4 °C prior to the reading at 18 °C. Measurements were based on the average of triplicate runs, with each run involving a minimum of 20 readings. Two protein constructs of hIKKβ were prepared and analyzed for crystallization trials: full-length N-FLAG-IKKβ (data not shown) and N-His6-hIKKβ (1–664). Full-length hIKKβ was heterogeneously phosphorylated at 6–19 sites owing to inclusion of the C-terminal NEMO binding domain region, which is prone to heavy phosphorylation (data not shown). With the same region absent, N-His6 hIKKβ(1–664) was phosphorylated at only one to three sites (Fig. 1A). These two recombinant forms of the kinase were shown to have similar specific activities (data not shown). In addition, several commercially available kinase inhibitors exhibited similar IC50 values against the full-length hIKKβ and hIKKβ(1–664). Among these inhibitors, the staurosporine analog K252a showed the best potency. Furthermore, analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B) and dynamic light scattering (data not shown) indicated that both forms of the enzyme existed as dimers in solution. Crystallization screens produced crystal hits for both protein forms, the full-length hIKKβ (1–742) and the truncated form N-His6-hIKKβ(1–664). However, only the truncated form of the protein, consistent with its protein heterogeneity profile, yielded crystals that were suitable for structure determination and that diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution. We refer to this construct as hIKKβ throughout the text, except when otherwise noted. There are two hIKKβ molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit, and consistent with the biochemical studies, they form a dimer around a quasi-2-fold rotational axis (Fig. 2A). Similar to its xIKKβ homolog, each hIKKβ monomer has a trimodular linear architecture: the N-terminal kinase domain, KD(1–309), the central ubiquitin-like domain, ULD(310–404), and the C-terminal dimerization domain, SDD(408–664). The KD has a typical bilobal kinase fold, the ULD has the ubiquitin fold (20.Karin M. Nuclear factor-κB in cancer development and progression.Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar), and the SDD has a helical blade structure consisting of six α-helices, α1s–α6s (Fig. 2B). The overall interdomain architecture of xIKKβ is largely maintained in hIKKβ, with the first two domains, KD and ULD, tightly aligned along the N-terminal end of the third SDD domain (Fig. 3). This arrangement is stabilized by van der Waals and hydrogen bond contacts between all three domains, with a major contribution from the KD-ULD interactions (Fig. 3). Most of the residues involved in interdomain interactions are conserved among different IKKβ species (supplemental Fig. S1), highlighting the biological significance of this arrangement. In contrast to the xIKKβ crystal structure, in which eight independent representations of the IKKβ molecule are similar (13.Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X. Jiang X. Dreano M. Karin M. Wu H. Crystal structure of inhibitor of κB kinase β.Nature. 2011; 472: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the two hIKKβ protomers are less alike. In particular, protomer A exhibits a higher level of structural disorder compared with protomer B (Fig. 2C) and differs in a way that appears functionally significant, as discussed in detail below. Pairwise comparison of the two hIKKβ protomers based on superimposition of their KDs gives the root mean square deviation of 0.58 Å for 262 Cα pairs and an root mean square deviation value of 1.22 Å for 541 Cα pairs of the whole protomer structure (Fig. 2C). The observed differences result mainly from variations in orientation of the C-terminal part of the SDD relative to the rest of the molecule, which is reflected in a slightly more bent (∼6°) structure of protomer B (Fig. 2C). Thus, the two hIKKβ protomers on the whole assume slightly different conformations, one more extended (and more similar to xIKKβ) and the other bent. hIKKβ in our crystal form presents two versions of the kinase domain, one with the activation loop phosphorylated (protomer B) and the other not (protomer A). When the two KD structures are compared, the most significant differences occur in the N-terminal lobe and at the activation loop. The ATP-binding pockets in both KDs are occupied by the staurosporine analog inhibitor K252a. It binds in a similar fashion to staurosporine, making hydrogen bond contacts from the lactam ring to the hinge backbone and an additional hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-149 (Fig. 4A). The presence of this additional hydrogen bond explains the higher affinity of K252a compared with staurosporine (data not shown). The glycine-rich loop in protomer B is well structured with the tip of the loop protruding from the ATP site. This loop in the structure of protomer A is partially disordered (Fig. 4B). The entire N-terminal lobe of protomer A has weaker electron density in general compared with protomer B and some regions of completely missing density. The activation loop in protomer B (residues 166–194) assumes a conformation characteristic of an active kinase (Fig. 4C), with three residues missing (residues 174–176) due to disorder. The corresponding region in protomer A is less well defined. It has 10 residues disordered (residues 170–179) and adopts a conformation that is not compatible with protein substrate binding (Fig. 4B). Because the inhibitor binding mode is identical in both domains, we conclude that the apparent differences in kinase flexibility and conformation are solely due to the differences in phosphorylation state between the two domains. These differences are unlikely to be caused by crystal packing effects, as both protomers, A and B, make wide ranging contacts with crystal symmetry mates and pack equally tightly. Phosphorylation of the activation loop at two sites, Ser-177 and Ser-181, was reported to be required for the activation of IKKβ (8.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Goeddel D.V. IκB kinase-β: NF-κB activation and complex formation with IκB kinase-α and NIK.Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In protomer B, both sites are phosphorylated. The electron density for the phosphate group at Ser-181 is strong, and at Ser-177, it is clearly observed but weaker. All three phosphate oxygen atoms of phospho-Ser-181 make direct ionic interactions with the cationic cluster formed by Arg-144 from the catalytic loop and Lys-171 from the activation loop. Additionally, one of the phosphate oxygen hydrogen bonds to the main chain amide nitrogens of phospho-Ser-181 and the preceding Thr-180 (Fig. 4, B and C). As in many active kinase structures, these phosphate-mediated interactions provide a direct link to the catalytic center, helping to stabilize the correct orientation of the catalytic base Asp-145 (Asp-135 in TBK1) and allow for the formation of the polypeptide substrate pocket (Fig. 4C). Ser-177, although phosphorylated, is completely exposed to solvent with no apparent direct role in the stabilization of the observed active conformation. Although phospho-Ser-177 may play a role in long range electrostatic interactions, differences in the dispositions of phospho-Ser-181 and phospho-Ser-177 suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-181 alone may be sufficient for hIKKβ activation. Indeed, the IKKβ S177A mutant was shown to be fully active, whereas the S177A/S181A double mutant was inactive (28.Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. NF-κB-inducing kinase activates IKK-α by phosphorylation of Ser-176.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This is akin to the observation that monophosphorylation at Ser-172 in TBK1, a residue equivalent to Ser-181 in hIKKβ (supplemental Fig. S1), is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of the active conformation of TBK1 (29.Ma X.

In contrast, in protomer A both Ser-177 and Ser-181 are more mobile, with fewer intramolecular interactions, and appear to be unphosphorylated. The activation loop segment on which Ser-181 resides rearranges into a short α-helical segment (residues 180–188) and relocates to a new position (Fig. 4B). Here, Ser-181 is ordered, but displaced by ∼19 Å from its phosphorylated counterpart position. There is clearly no density for the phosphate group at Ser-181 and residue Ser-177 is completely disordered. When compared with those in the peptide-bound active kinase structures (31.Davies T.G.

Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the unphosphorylated activation loop is clearly in the “off” conformation as it sterically occludes substrate access to the catalytic site. Besides these differences, the rest of the unphosphorylated KD in hIKKβ shows features of an active kinase. As such, the αC helix is positioned correctly, placing Glu-61 (Glu-55 in TBK1) for hydrogen bonding with the catalytic lysine 44 (Lys-38 in TBK1), a bond required for catalysis (Fig. 4B). The hIKKβ and TBK1 crystal structures (29.Ma X. Helgason E. Phung Q.T. Quan C.L. Iyer R.S. Lee M.W. Bowman K.K. Starovasnik M.A. Dueber E.C.

The structure of xIKKβ is no exception. The xIKKβ activation loop harboring the S177E/S181E double mutation appears in yet another off conformation (13.Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X.

https://openalex.org/W2041746617,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma associated with infection by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). (+)-JQ1 and I-BET151 are two recently described novel small-molecule inhibitors of BET bromodomain chromatin-associated proteins that have shown impressive preclinical activity in cancers in which MYC is overexpressed at the transcriptional level due to chromosomal translocations that bring the MYC gene under the control of a super-enhancer. PEL cells, in contrast, lack structural alterations in the MYC gene, but have deregulated Myc protein due to the activity of KSHV-encoded latent proteins. We report that PEL cell lines are highly sensitive to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitors-induced growth inhibition and undergo G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and cellular senescence, but without the induction of lytic reactivation, upon treatment with these drugs. Treatment of PEL cell lines with BET inhibitors suppressed the expression of MYC and resulted in a genome-wide perturbation of MYC-dependent genes. Silencing of BRD4 and MYC expression blocked cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, while ectopic expression of MYC from a retroviral promoter rescued cells from (+)-JQ1-induced growth arrest. In a xenograft model of PEL, (+)-JQ1 significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. Taken collectively, our results demonstrate that the utility of BET inhibitors may not be limited to cancers in which genomic alterations result in extremely high expression of MYC and they may have equal or perhaps greater activity against cancers in which the MYC genomic locus is structurally intact and c-Myc protein is deregulated at the post-translational level and is only modestly overexpressed."
https://openalex.org/W2014920593,"Accumulating evidence suggests that Notch signaling is active at multiple points during hematopoiesis. Until recently, the majority of such studies focused on Notch signaling in lymphocyte differentiation and knowledge of individual Notch receptor roles has been limited due to a paucity of genetic tools available. In this manuscript we generate and describe animal models to identify and fate-map stem and progenitor cells expressing each Notch receptor, delineate Notch pathway activation, and perform in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies dissecting Notch signaling in early hematopoiesis. These models provide comprehensive genetic maps of lineage-specific Notch receptor expression and activation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, they establish a previously unknown role for Notch signaling in the commitment of blood progenitors toward the erythrocytic lineage and link Notch signaling to optimal organismal response to stress erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2037601979,"The progressive loss of motor control due to reduction of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and decreased striatal dopamine levels are the classically described features of Parkinson disease (PD). Neuronal damage also progresses to other regions of the brain, and additional non-motor dysfunctions are common. Accumulation of environmental toxins, such as pesticides and metals, are suggested risk factors for the development of typical late onset PD, although genetic factors seem to be substantial in early onset cases. Mutations of DJ-1 are known to cause a form of recessive early onset Parkinson disease, highlighting an important functional role for DJ-1 in early disease prevention. This study identifies human DJ-1 as a metal-binding protein able to evidently bind copper as well as toxic mercury ions in vitro. The study further characterizes the cytoprotective function of DJ-1 and PD-mutated variants of DJ-1 with respect to induced metal cytotoxicity. The results show that expression of DJ-1 enhances the cells' protective mechanisms against induced metal toxicity and that this protection is lost for DJ-1 PD mutations A104T and D149A. The study also shows that oxidation site-mutated DJ-1 C106A retains its ability to protect cells. We also show that concomitant addition of dopamine exposure sensitizes cells to metal-induced cytotoxicity. We also confirm that redox-active dopamine adducts enhance metal-catalyzed oxidation of intracellular proteins in vivo by use of live cell imaging of redox-sensitive S3roGFP. The study indicates that even a small genetic alteration can sensitize cells to metal-induced cell death, a finding that may revive the interest in exogenous factors in the etiology of PD."

https://openalex.org/W2032240256,"Enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity has been strongly linked to breast cancer progression and mediators of EGFR endocytosis may well be involved. We developed a semi-automated high-content fluorescence microscopy-based EGFR endocytosis screen to identify proteins that mediate EGFR endocytosis in human HBL100 breast cancer cells. Knockdown of 172 individual endocytosis and actin-regulatory genes with small interfering RNAs led to the identification of 14 genes of which the contribution to EGFR endocytosis in breast cancer is until now poorly defined, including DNAJC6, GDI2, FGD6, HAX1, NECAP2 and AnxA2. We show that depletion of the actin and endocytosis regulatory protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) in a panel of four triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines affected EGFR endocytosis. Depletion of AnxA2 in the aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line resulted in the inhibition of EGFR transport beyond the early endosomes. This inhibition coincided with enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migration and downstream signaling via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt. Moreover, AnxA2 knockdown increased lung metastasis formation in mice. The effect of AnxA2 knockdown on EGFR endocytosis in MDA-MB-231 was related to dephosphorylation/activation of the actin-severing protein cofilin, as re-expression of an inactive S3E-cofilin mutant, but not an active S3A-cofilin mutant, re-established EGFR endocytosis to control levels. Together, our data provide evidence for AnxA2 as a mediator of EGFR endocytosis and signaling in breast cancer via regulation of cofilin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2128803932,"Early life exposure to adverse environments can lead to a variety of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in offspring. We hypothesize that female reproductive function may also be affected, with subsequent implications for fertility. We used an established maternal low-protein model where animals are born small but undergo rapid postnatal catch-up growth by suckling a control-fed dam (recuperated offspring). Markers of oxidative stress and cellular aging in reproductive tract tissues were assessed at 3 and 6 mo of age. Recuperated offspring had lower birth weight than controls (P<0.01) but caught up during lactation. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4HNE; an indicator of oxidative stress) was increased in recuperated animals compared with controls in both ovaries and oviducts at 6 mo. At 3 and 6 mo, ovaries and oviducts of recuperated offspring had increased mitochondrial (mt)DNA copy number (P<0.01). By contrast, germ-line cells showed no difference in mtDNA copy number, suggesting they were protected from suboptimal maternal nutrition. Oviduct and somatic ovarian telomere length declined more rapidly with age in recuperated animals. This accelerated cellular aging was associated with a declined ovarian reserve in developmentally programmed animals. These findings have significant clinical implications in light of worldwide trends to delayed childbearing.—Aiken, C. E., Tarry-Adkins, J. L., Ozanne, S.

Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a pioneer colonizer of the upper aerodigestive tract of man. In the establishment of the ecological niche of the organism, it relies upon an array of virulence determinants, one of which is a leukotoxin (LtxA) that selectively kills human immune cells (1.Taichman N.S.

Five genes are required for successful translation and secretion of LtxA (the structural toxin gene product) in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Four of the genes, ltxCABD (in transcriptional order) are located in the leukotoxin operon. A fifth gene, tdeA (6.Crosby J.A. Kachlany S.C.

Prior to secretion, Gram-negative bacterial protein toxins are translated as protoxins and must be post-translationally modified to achieve biological activity. This modification takes various forms with bacterial protein toxins. In the case of RTX toxins, the RTXC protein, an acylase, catalyzes the attachment of fatty acyl chains to internal lysine residues of the toxin (7.Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

The hydrophobic domain (residues 1–420) contains a preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids and suggests an involvement in membrane insertion. Secondary structure predictions of the region show that half of the residues form either amphipathic or hydrophobic α-helices, which are often associated with toxin-target cell membrane interactions. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of LtxA with other RTX toxins, such as Escherichia coli α-hemolysin (HlyA) and Mannheimia hemolytica LktA, show a remarkable concordance in the clustering of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues among the three toxins in this area (35.Kyte J.

The central domain (residues 421–730) is composed largely of hydrophilic residues, and the conservation of structure among the various RTX toxins is less strong. Located within the central region are the two acylated lysine residues (Lys562 and Lys687) that are necessary for biological activity (10.Fong K.P. Tang H.Y. Brown A.C. Kieba I.R. Speicher D.W.

Oral Microbiol. 2011; 26: 262-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, red circles labeled A). The repeat region (residues 730–900) contains a series of 14 repeated nonapeptides with the consensus sequence of GGXG(N/D)DX(L/I/F)X (where X represents any amino acid), which together form a unique calcium-binding structure that is called a parallel β-helix or parallel β-roll (39.Baumann U.

Periodontal Res. 1991; 26: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally the C-terminal domain (positions 901–1055) is required for secretion (42.Jarchau T. Chakraborty T. Garcia F. Goebel W. Selection for transport competence of C-terminal polypeptides derived from Escherichia coli hemolysin. The shortest peptide capable of autonomous HlyB/HlyD-dependent secretion comprises the C-terminal 62 amino acids of HlyA.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The RTX toxins are known to be secreted into the aqueous solution but also to be membrane-interacting proteins (11.Bakás L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L. Goñi F.M.

Neither the water-soluble nor the membrane-embedded structures of these toxins (and LtxA in particular) have been solved; however, it has been proposed that this family of toxins undergoes a conformational change upon membrane association (12.Lear J.D.

We have recently shown that LtxA undergoes distinct lipid-specific secondary structure changes upon binding to or disruption of lipid bilayers (13.Walters M.J. Brown A.C. Edrington T.C. Baranwal S.

The cleavage of talin frees LFA-1 from the cytoskeleton and allows lateral movement of the LFA-1·LtxA complex to lipid rafts (14.Fong K.P. Pacheco C.M. Otis L.L. Baranwal S. Kieba I.R. Harrison G. Hersh E.V. Boesze-Battaglia K. Lally E.T. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin requires lipid microdomains for target cell cytotoxicity.Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1753-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although talin cleavage and release of LFA-1 is the initial step in toxin/integrin-driven raft clustering, the process that moves the LtxA·LFA-1 complex to the raft and subsequently maintains them in the raft is not clear. This observation has led us to hypothesize that LtxA has an affinity for cholesterol, a primary raft component, and this interaction may be responsible for the LtxA·LFA-1 clustering observed in intoxicated cells. NaCl, CaCl2, NaN3, HEPES, cholesterol, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), and KH2PO4 were purchased from Sigma. Lipids, including 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Ergosterol was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Peptides were synthesized and purified (98% purity) by Biomatik (Wilmington, DE).

The chloroform was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the residual chloroform was removed under vacuum, creating a thin lipid film on the glass surface. Liposomes were created by hydrating the lipid film with liposome buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm NaN3, pH 7.4). Large unilamellar vesicles were formed by extruding the liposome solutions through a 200-nm polycarbonate membrane (24.Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R.

The liposomes were composed of DMPC with 0, 20, 40, or 60% cholesterol (or ergosterol). At room temperature, DMPC with 0% cholesterol exists in a non-raft-like state (liquid disordered); at 40 and 60% cholesterol, DMPC exists in a raft-like state (liquid ordered); and at 20% cholesterol, both phases coexist (27.Brown A.C.

The extent of unfolding of LtxArenatured was determined using CD spectroscopy. Three LtxA samples were prepared at a concentration of 7 μm. 1) Native LtxAwt was suspended in liposome buffer, 2) LtxAdenatured was prepared as described above (12.Lear J.D. Karakelian D. Furblur U.

CD spectroscopy analysis was performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, as discussed in our previous studies (13.Walters M.J. Brown A.C. Edrington T.C. Baranwal S. Du Y. Lally E.T. Boesze-Battaglia K. Membrane association and destabilization by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin requires changes in secondary structures.Mol.

The samples were analyzed at 25 °C in a 0.2-mm-path length quartz cell using the step-scanning mode from 260 to 200 nm, with a 1-nm wavelength step, 10-s averaging time, and 1-nm bandwidth. The spectra were recorded under identical conditions for an n = 3 for each sample. Liposomes were tethered to an L1 Biacore chip by flowing them over the chip at a rate of 5 μl/min, until a mass corresponding to ∼1000 response units (∼5 μl) had been added to the surface (30.Besenicar M.P. Anderluh G. Preparation of lipid membrane surfaces for molecular interaction studies by surface plasmon resonance biosensors.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 627: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A small volume of NaOH (5 μl) was added to remove unbound liposomes. For kinetic analysis, the flow rate was increased to 30 μl/min before the toxin injection was initiated. Each toxin injection was 60 μl, followed by a 180-μl dissociation of buffer only. The surface was regenerated with an injection of 65 μl of 0.5% SDS. The 10 toxin concentrations ranged from 0 to 500 nm in a 1:2 dilution series. All SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore® 3000, and the data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation® software. The data were fit using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), as well as the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rates, where KD is given by the following equation. KD=kdka(eq.1) For steady state competition analysis, liposomes containing 40% cholesterol were tethered to an L1 chip. The flow rate was set at 5 μl/min, and 50 μl of toxin was injected, followed by a 25-μl dissociation of buffer only. The surface was regenerated with SDS, as described above. In the CRAC peptide competition experiments, the toxin, at a concentration of 1000 nm, was incubated with an equal volume of peptide at concentrations of 0, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 nm (molar LtxA:peptide ratios of 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4). The inhibition was defined as follows, %inhibition=RULtxA/peptideRULtxA×100(eq.2) where RLtxA is the response units of the LtxA-only run, and RULtxA/peptide is the response units of each run containing LtxA and peptide. Response units represent the surface coverage. The response units were measured at the end of the injection, just before the dissociation was initiated, at the same time point for each experiment. In the comparison of binding to cholesterol-containing liposomes by the acylation mutant toxins, LtxACS001 and LtxASM003, at concentrations of 250 nm, were injected over liposomes containing 40% cholesterol that had been tethered to the L1 chip. The DSC experiments were performed as described previously (31.Brown A.C. Boesze-Battaglia K. Du Y. Stefano F.P. Kieba I.R. Epand R.F. Kakalis L. Yeagle P.L. Epand R.M. Lally E.T.

Approximately 1 mg of the dried peptide was resuspended in 100 μl of methanol and added to a solution of SOPC with or without cholesterol in chloroform:methanol (2:1) to give the desired final ratio of peptide to lipids. The solvent was removed under nitrogen gas, and the final traces of solvent were removed in a vacuum desiccator. The films were hydrated with PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, adjusted to pH 7.4) and vortexed extensively. The suspension was degassed and loaded into the sample cell of a Nano II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimeter Sciences Corp., Lindon, UT). Buffer was placed in the reference cell. Successive heating and cooling scans were run between 0 and 45 °C, at a scan rate of 1°/min. A trypan blue cytotoxicity assay was used to measure cell viability (32.Brogan J.M. Lally E.T. Poulsen K.

https://openalex.org/W2135869825,"Chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium serves as a final common pathway in progressive renal disease. Circumstantial evidence suggests that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 in the ischemic tubules may be functionally inhibited in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) milieu. In this study, we hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, impairs the cellular hypoxic response. In human kidney (HK-2) proximal tubular cells, IS reduced the hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes. This effect was not associated with quantitative changes in the HIF-1α protein, but with functional impairment of the HIF-1α C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD). Among factors that impeded the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the HIF-1αCTAD, IS markedly up-regulated Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2) through a mechanism of post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization involving the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway. In vivo, disproportionate expression of HIF target genes was demonstrated in several CKD models, which was offset by an oral adsorbent, AST-120. Furthermore, administration of indole reduced the induction of angiogenic, hypoxia-inducible genes in rats with experimental heart failure. Results of these studies reveal a novel role of IS in modulating the transcriptional response of HIF-1 and provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying progressive nephropathies as well as cardiovascular complications.— Tanaka, T., Yamaguchi, J., Higashijima, Y., Nangaku, M., Indoxyl sulfate signals for rapid mRNA stabilization of Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2) and suppresses the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes in experimental CKD and uremia.

https://openalex.org/W2027447321,"Whole chromosome instability (CIN) is a common feature of cancer cells and has been linked to increased tumor evolution and metastasis. Several studies have shown that the loss of the pRB tumor suppressor causes mitotic defects and chromosome mis-segregation. pRB is inactivated in many types of cancer and this raises the possibility that the loss of pRB may be a general cause of CIN in tumors. Paradoxically, retinoblastoma tumor cells have a relatively stable karyotype and currently the circumstances in which pRB inactivation causes CIN in human cancers are unclear. Here we utilize a fluorescence in situ hybridization-based approach to score numerical heterogeneity in chromosome copy number as a readout of CIN. Using this technique, we show that high levels of CIN correlate with the combined inactivation of pRB and p53 and that this association is evident in two independent panels of cancer cell lines. Retinoblastoma cell lines characteristically retain a wild-type TP53 gene, providing an opportunity to test the relevance of this functional relationship. We show that retinoblastoma cell lines display mitotic defects similar to those seen when pRB is depleted from non-transformed cells, but that the presence of wild-type p53 suppresses the accumulation of aneuploid cells. A similar synergy between pRB and p53 inactivation was observed in HCT116 cells. These results suggest that the loss of pRB promotes segregation errors, whereas loss of p53 allows tolerance and continued proliferation of the resulting, genomically unstable cancer cells. Hence, it is the cooperative effect of inactivation of both pRB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways that promotes CIN."
https://openalex.org/W2036729022,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system. An important feature of these receptors is their capacity for allosteric regulation by small molecules, such as zinc, which bind to their amino-terminal domain (ATD). Zinc inhibition through high affinity binding to the ATD has been examined through functional studies; however, there is no direct measurement of associated conformational changes. We used luminescence resonance energy transfer to show that the ATDs undergo a cleft closure-like conformational change upon binding zinc, but no changes are observed in intersubunit distances. Furthermore, we find that the ATDs are more closely packed than the related AMPA receptors. These results suggest that the stability of the upper lobe contacts between ATDs allow for the efficient propagation of the cleft closure conformational change toward the ligand-binding domain and transmembrane segments, ultimately inhibiting the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2158748404,"Specific aminoacylation of the phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) with alanine (or with lysine) was shown to render various organisms less susceptible to antimicrobial agents and environmental stresses. In this study, we make use of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to decode ORF PA0919-dependent lipid homeostasis. Analysis of the polar lipid content of the deletion mutant ΔPA0919 indicated significantly enlarged levels of alanyl-PG. The resulting phenotype manifested an increased susceptibility to several antimicrobial compounds when compared with the wild type. A pH-dependent PA0919 promoter located within the upstream gene PA0920 was identified. Localization experiments demonstrated that the PA0919 protein is anchored to the periplasmic surface of the inner bacterial membrane. The recombinant overproduction of wild type and several site-directed mutant proteins in the periplasm of Escherichia coli facilitated a detailed in vitro analysis of the enzymatic PA0919 function. A series of artificial substrates (p-nitrophenyl esters of various amino acids/aliphatic acids) indicated enzymatic hydrolysis of the alanine, glycine, or lysine moiety of the respective ester substrates. Our final in vitro activity assay in the presence of radioactively labeled alanyl-PG then revealed hydrolysis of the aminoacyl linkage, resulting in the formation of alanine and PG. Consequently, PA0919 was termed alanyl-PG hydrolase. The elucidated enzymatic activity implies a new regulatory circuit for the appropriate tuning of cellular alanyl-PG concentrations."

Here, we examined the role of α3β1-integrin in ErbB2-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (3D lr-ECM). Depletion of α3β1 in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells suppressed growth and restore cell polarity in 3D lr-ECM. The phenotype of α3β1-depleted cells was reproduced upon depletion of tetraspanin CD151 and mirrored that of the cells treated with Herceptin, an established ErbB2 antagonist. Breast cancer cells expressing the α3β1–CD151 complex have higher steady-state phosphorylation of ErbB2 and show enhanced dimerization of the protein when compared with α3β1-/CD151-depleted cells. Furthermore, Herceptin-dependent dephosphorylation of ErbB2 was only observed in α3β1–CD151-expressing cells. Importantly, the inhibitory activity of Herceptin was more pronounced when cells expressed both α3β1 and CD151. We also found that the level of active RhoA was increased in α3β1- and CD151-depleted cells and that Rho controls dimerization of ErbB2. Expression of α3β1 alone did not have significant prognostic value in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. However, expression of α3β1 in combination with CD151 represented a more stringent indicator of poor survival than CD151 alone. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the α3β1–CD151 complex has a critical regulatory role in ErbB2-dependent signalling and thereby may be involved in breast cancer progression."

Significance: Oligomerization may represent a mechanism to regulate DHHC enzyme activity. Palmitoylation is the posttranslational addition of long-chain fatty acids such as palmitate to cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester linkage. In contrast to other lipid modifications, palmitoylation is reversible and, thus, is a dynamic process that regulates protein subcellular localization, trafficking, stability, and activity. Genetic and biochemical studies have established that palmitoylation of proteins on the cytoplasmic face of cell membranes is catalyzed by a family of integral membrane proteins with a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif embedded in a cysteine-rich domain (reviewed in Ref. 1.Linder M.E.

Links to schizophrenia (DHHC8), tumorigenesis (DHHC9, 11, and 14), and metastasis (DHHC2) have also been reported. Accordingly, elucidating the mechanism and regulation of the DHHC proteins is important for understanding how palmitoylation manifests in physiology and pathophysiology.

Sequence homology of the DHHC proteins is limited outside the DHHC cysteine-rich domain. Most DHHC proteins have a predicted topology of four transmembrane domains with the N- and C termini exposed to the cytoplasm.

One hypothesis is that DHHC proteins function as oligomers and that mixed oligomers of the wild-type and mutant enzyme are inactive (13.Fang C. Deng L. Keller C.A. Fukata M. Fukata Y. Chen G.

Support for this argument comes from coimmunoprecipitation experiments that suggest that DHHC3 (also named GODZ (Golgi-specific DHHC zinc finger protein)) forms homomultimers and heteromultimers with DHHC7 (13.Fang C.

A protease inhibitor mixture of leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (0.2 mm), Pepstain A (2 μM), and aprotinin (Sigma, catalog no. A6279, 1:2000) was prepared from stock solutions and used at the final concentrations indicated. HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were transfected with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. TriEXTM insect cells were cultured in TriEXTM insect cell medium (Novagen) at 27 °C. BRET constructs were fusions with humanized Renilla luciferase (RLuc) or YFP. A linker sequence encoding -GGGGS was introduced between the protein of interest and RLuc or YFP. For DHHC3-RLuc and DHHC2-RLuc, murine DHHC3 or human DHHC2 cDNA was subcloned into pRLuc(h)N2 or pRLuc(h)N3 (BRET2TM, BioSignal Packard). For DHHC3-YFP and DHHC2-YFP, the YFP coding sequence was first cloned into pCDNA3.1A(-)myc-his as a BamHI-HindIII fragment to generate a vector for C-terminal YFP fusion proteins (pML1676). Murine DHHC3 or human DHHC2 cDNA was subcloned into pML1676. To generate constructs for N-terminal YFP fusion proteins, the coding sequence of YFP was subcloned into pCDNA3.1A(-)myc-his, yielding pML1675. The murine DHHC3 cDNA, the C-terminal domain of human Golgin 84 (amino acids 569–731, PCR-amplified from HeLa cells), or human DHHC2 cDNA was subcloned into pML1675. The plasmids pCDNA3.1-GABABR2-YFP, pEAK10 HA-FLAG-CXCR4-hRLuc, and pIRES puro3 FLAG-CXCR4-Venus were gifts from Dr. Michel Bouvier (16.Hamdan F.F. Percherancier Y. Breton B. Bouvier M. Monitoring protein-protein interactions in living cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2006; (Chapter 5, Unit 5.23)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For FLAG-DHHC3 and FLAG-G84, the murine DHHC3 cDNA or C-terminal domain of human Golgin 84 (amino acids 569–731) was subcloned into the pCMV5-FLAG vector. For DHHC3-GFP, the murine DHHC3 cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). Plasmids for murine myrLckNT, mouse DHHC3-FLAG-His6, DHHS3-FLAG-His6, and DHHC2-FLAG-His6 were described previously (15.Jennings B.C. Nadolski M.J. Ling Y. Baker M.B. Harrison M.L. Deschenes R.J. Linder M.E. 2-Bromopalmitate and 2-(2-hydroxy-5-nitro-benzylidene)-benzo[b]thiophen-3-one inhibit DHHC-mediated palmitoylation in vitro.J.

The plasmids encoding catalytically inactive DHHC2(C156S) and DHHC3(C157S) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange). To construct a tandem DHHC3 dimer, the DHHC3 coding sequence was amplified with PCR primers to generate an XhoI and BamHI fragment that encodes DHHC3 flanked by a FLAG epitope at the N terminus and a thrombin cleavage site at the C terminus. The fragment was inserted into a plasmid in-frame with a linker sequence (GGGGS) fused to DHHC3. The integrity of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. BRET assays were conducted following published protocols (17.Achour L. Kamal M. Jockers R. Marullo S. Using quantitative BRET to assess G protein-coupled receptor homo- and heterodimerization.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 756: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells seeded on 12-well dishes were transfected with 5 ng of luciferase donor plasmid (DHHC3-RLuc, DHHC2-RLuc, DHHS3-RLuc, or DHHS2-RLuc) and increasing amounts of acceptor plasmid (DHHC3-YFP, YFP-DHHC3, YFP-G84, DHHC2-YFP, YFP-DHHC2, GABABR2-YFP, DHHS3-YFP, or DHHS2-YFP). Transfections were supplemented with empty vector to normalize total DNA added. For BRET control experiments with CXCR4, 100 ng of CXCR4-RLuc and 0–400 ng of CXCR4-Venus were used. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were detached from the plates with PBS-EDTA (5 min at 37 °C), transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were suspended in PBS-CaCl2/MgCl2 and 40 μl (∼25,000 cells) was dispensed into each well of a white 96-well plate (Costar 3912). After adding 10 μl of 25 μM coelenterazine h solution, the samples in the plate were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Emission was detected using a Biotek Gen5 plate reader equipped with the appropriate BRET filter set (460/40 nm and 528/20 nm). The BRET signal was calculated by the ratio of emission at 528 nm to emission at 460 nm minus the BRET in the absence of the acceptor. Luciferase expression was determined after 10 min of adding coelenterazine h. For YFP expression measurements, 40 μl of the cell suspension was distributed into black 96-well plates (Costar 3915), and readings were detected by excitation at 485/20 nm and emission at 528/20 nm. Background fluorescence measured in cells not expressing the acceptor (YFP0) was subtracted from fluorescence values measured in cells expressing the increasing amounts of acceptor (YFP) to obtain YFP-YFP0 values. BRET ratios were then plotted as a function of (YFP-YFP0)/LUC (luciferase) values. The data for saturation curves are fit using a nonlinear regression equation with a single binding site (GraphPad Prism) (17.Achour L. Kamal M. Jockers R. Marullo S. Using quantitative BRET to assess G protein-coupled receptor homo- and heterodimerization.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 756: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). BRET curves with DHHC proteins coexpressed with Golgin84 (Fig. 2A) or GABABR2 (C) were fit to a straight line. For BRET experiments in cell membranes, cells were transfected with 5 ng of donor plasmid (DHHC3-RLuc or DHHS3-RLuc) and 200 ng of acceptor plasmid (DHHC3-YFP or DHHS3-YFP). For CXCR4 control experiment, 100 ng of CXCR4-RLuc and 200 ng of CXCR4-Venus plasmids were used. Cells expressing donor alone were used to calculate the BRET background. The cells were collected as described above, suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH7.4), 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors), and broken using a ball bearing cell homogenizer on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the membrane pellet was suspended in buffer A, and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Membranes (40 μg) were incubated with different concentration of palmitoyl-CoA for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were used immediately for the BRET assay as described above. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing DHHC2 and DHHC3 were described previously. DHHC2-FLAG-His was expressed in insect Sf 9 cells and sequentially purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal chelate and FLAG affinity chromatography as described (15.Jennings B.C. Nadolski M.J.

For the PAT assay in Fig. 1, HEK-293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNA (400 ng). After 48 h, the cells were collected, and membrane fractions prepared as above. The membrane pellet was suspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, protease inhibitors), and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Membranes (22.5 μg in 15 μl) were incubated with 5 μl of myrLckNT (final concentration, 0.5 μM) and 30 μl of reaction mix (250 mm MES, 1.8 μM [3H]palm-CoA) at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 5× gel loading buffer with 10 mm TCEP and heated for 1 min at 50 °C. Reactions were divided for two SDS-PAGE gels and processed for fluorography or scintillation counting using established methods. For the PAT assay in Fig. 6, the cross-linked enzyme preparations (plus or minus TCEP) were diluted in 5 μl of enzyme dilution buffer (50 mm MES (pH6.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM). Final assay concentrations were 25 nm DHHC2, 1 μM [3H]palm-CoA, and 0.5 μM myrLckNT in a total of 25 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive palmitate incorporated into the protein substrate was quantified by scintillation counting. HEK-293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmids encoding fusion proteins (400 ng each) for 48 h. The cells were collected and solubilized by adding 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% DDM, protease inhibitors), followed by an incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 400 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG resin (equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 0.1% DDM) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% DDM. Protein was eluted from the resin with 80 μl of 1.5× gel loading buffer with 30 mm DTT, incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. After heating to 50 °C for 1 min, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting. DHHC2-FLAG-His-6 protein was purified by sequential nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal chelate and FLAG affinity chromatography. Protein was eluted from the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel in buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 0.25 μg/μL FLAG peptide. The purified proteins were incubated with DTSSP in 80 μl at 25 °C for 30 min. The final DHHC2 concentration was 1 μm. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4) to 50 mm final concentration and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. For the samples plus TCEP, a TCEP stock (100 mm TCEP dissolved in 1 m Tris (pH7.4), 0.1% DDM) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. For the samples minus TCEP, the same volume of buffer (1 m Tris (pH7.4), 0.1% DDM) was added. All samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min prior to PAT assay or immunoblot analyses. Blue native PAGE was performed as described, with minor modifications (19.Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized DHHC3-FLAG-His-6 or DHHS3-FLAG-His-6 purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal chelate chromatography (20 μl) was mixed with 6 μl of 50% glycerol and 1 μl of 5% (w/v) Brilliant Blue G (Sigma). Half of the samples were supplemented with SDS (final concentration of 0.2%) to denature native protein complexes. The samples were applied to a 3–13% native gel and electrophoresed on ice, first in cathode buffer B (50 mm Tricine, 7.5 mm imidazole, 0.02% Brilliant blue G) for 30 min at 100 V, and then in cathode buffer B/10 (50 mm Tricine, 7.5 mm imidazole, 0.002% Brilliant blue G) for 40 min at 200 V. The gels were scanned, and the ratio of dimer and monomer bands were quantified using ImageJ. HEK-293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-DHHC3 or FLAG-DHHC3-thrombin cleavage site-DHHC3. After 48 h, the cells were collected and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% DDM, protease inhibitors), followed by an incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 600 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG resin (equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 0.1% DDM) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% DDM. Protein was eluted from the resin by 500 ng/μl FLAG peptide. The purified proteins were incubated with thrombin at a 1:25 ratio at 25 °C. At different time points, the treatment was stopped by gel loading buffer for SDS-PAGE or used immediately for an in vitro PAT assay. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. For comparisons between two groups, Student's t test (two-tailed) was used. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine whether DHHC proteins exist as dimers or higher-order oligomers in living cells, BRET was used to detect homomeric interactions of DHHC palmitoyltransferases in living cells. The bioluminescent enzyme Renilla luciferase was fused to the C terminus of DHHC2 or DHHC3 (DHHC2-RLuc, DHHC3-RLuc). YFP fusions at the N terminus and at the C terminus were generated. Control fusion proteins included GABABR2-YFP, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for GABA, and YFP-Golgin 84, a tail-anchored Golgi structural protein (20.Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. An essential cytoplasmic domain for the Golgi localization of coiled-coil proteins with a COOH-terminal membrane anchor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The constructs were designed so that luciferase and YFP were exposed to the cytoplasm. Following transfection in HEK-293 cells, all of the fusion proteins were expressed at the appropriate molecular weights (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom two panels). PAT activity of the DHHC fusion proteins was confirmed by in vitro assays using an N-terminal fragment of N-myristoylated Lck as a substrate (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels). Catalytically inactive DHHC protein fusions were generated by mutation of the DHHC cysteine to serine and are designated as DHHS2 and DHHS3 (Fig. 1). BRET saturation curves were generated to determine whether DHHC proteins oligomerize. A constant amount of DHHC3-RLuc plasmid was transfected with increasing amounts of DHHC3-YFP, YFP-DHHC3, or YFP-Golgin 84 plasmid. DHHC3-RLuc displayed saturable BRET signals irrespective of whether the YFP moiety was appended at the N- or C-terminus (Fig. 2A). Because BRET is a measure of proximity, proteins that are colocalized on the same membrane may display a BRET signal because of random collisions, but the signal is typically smaller than that driven by protein-protein interaction and does not saturate with increasing expression. DHHC3 is localized at the Golgi apparatus. As a control for random interactions of DHHC3 with other Golgi-localized proteins, we tested DHHC3-RLuc with the integral membrane protein YFP-Golgin 84. Consistent with their proximity in Golgi membranes, DHHC3-RLuc and YFP-Golgin 84 coexpression resulted in a BRET signal. However, the signal was lower than that seen with DHHC3 pairs and was linear with respect to increasing ratios of YFP:RLuc expression (Fig. 2A). A competition assay was used to confirm the specificity of the protein interaction suggested by the BRET saturation curves. In this experiment, increasing amounts of DHHC3 tagged with the FLAG epitope were coexpressed with DHHC3-RLuc and DHHC3-YFP. The BRET signal was decreased with increasing expression of the FLAG-tagged DHHC3 construct, whereas expression of FLAG-Golgin 84 had a minimal effect (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments were performed with DHHC2 to determine whether the propensity to oligomerize was found in other DHHC proteins. Although DHHC2 and DHHC3 share similar membrane topologies, their sequence homology is only 21%, and they are localized in different membrane compartments. Although DHHC3 is localized in the Golgi, DHHC2 is found in recycling endosomes and at the plasma membrane. DHHC2-RLuc displayed saturable BRET interactions with YFP-DHHC2 and DHHC2-YFP (Fig. 2C). For a random collision control, the GPCR GABABR2-YFP was assayed with DHHC2-RLuc. The positive BRET signal for DHHC2 and the GABA receptor indicated proximity in the same membrane compartment, but this BRET pair did not display saturation kinetics (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the maximal BRET values for both DHHC2 and DHHC3 were higher with the YFP appended to the C terminus versus the N terminus, demonstrating that the orientation of the proteins has an effect on BRET signals (Fig. 2, A and C). We sought to determine whether enzyme activity influenced the oligomerization status of DHHC2 and DHHC3. BRET assays were performed to compare DHHC3 or DHHC2 with their respective catalytically inactive DHHS mutant proteins. The BRET signal for the DHHS mutants of DHHC3 and DHHC2 was significantly higher than that of the wild-type proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). When DHHC3-RLuc was expressed with catalytically inactive DHHS3-YFP,"
https://openalex.org/W2093266648,"The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming α-subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel in the heart, which plays a critical role in cardiac action potential repolarization. Dysfunction of IKr causes long QT syndrome, a cardiac electrical disorder that predisposes affected individuals to fatal arrhythmias and sudden death. The homeostasis of hERG channels in the plasma membrane depends on a balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Our recent data indicate that hERG channels undergo enhanced endocytic degradation under low potassium (hypokalemia) conditions. The GTPase Rab4 is known to mediate rapid recycling of various internalized proteins to the plasma membrane. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Rab4 on the expression level of hERG channels. Our data revealed that overexpression of Rab4 decreases the expression level of hERG in the plasma membrane. Rab4 does not affect the expression level of the Kv1.5 or EAG K(+) channels. Mechanistically, our data demonstrate that overexpression of Rab4 increases the expression level of endogenous Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin ligase that targets hERG but not Kv1.5 or EAG channels for ubiquitination and degradation. Nedd4-2 undergoes self- ubiquitination and degradation. Rab4 interferes with Nedd4-2 degradation, resulting in an increased expression level of Nedd4-2, which targets hERG. In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel pathway for hERG regulation; Rab4 decreases the hERG density at the plasma membrane by increasing the endogenous Nedd4-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1983335650,"The mitochondrial ATP binding cassette transporter ABCB6 has been associated with a broad range of physiological functions, including growth and development, therapy-related drug resistance, and the new blood group system Langereis. ABCB6 has been proposed to regulate heme synthesis by shuttling coproporphyrinogen III from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. However, direct functional information of the transport complex is not known. To understand the role of ABCB6 in mitochondrial transport, we developed an in vitro system with pure and active protein. ABCB6 overexpressed in HEK293 cells was solubilized from mitochondrial membranes and purified to homogeneity. Purified ABCB6 showed a high binding affinity for MgATP (Kd = 0.18 μM) and an ATPase activity with a Km of 0.99 mM. Reconstitution of ABCB6 into liposomes allowed biochemical characterization of the ATPase including (i) substrate-stimulated ATPase activity, (ii) transport kinetics of its proposed endogenous substrate coproporphyrinogen III, and (iii) transport kinetics of substrates identified using a high throughput screening assay. Mutagenesis of the conserved lysine to alanine (K629A) in the Walker A motif abolished ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport. These results suggest a direct interaction between mitochondrial ABCB6 and its transport substrates that is critical for the activity of the transporter. Furthermore, the simple immunoaffinity purification of ABCB6 to near homogeneity and efficient reconstitution of ABCB6 into liposomes might provide the basis for future studies on the structure/function of ABCB6."

https://openalex.org/W2020290535,"The mannose-binding lectin associated-protease-3 (MASP-3) is a member of the lectin pathway of the complement system, a key component of human innate and active immunity. Mutations in MASP-3 have recently been found to be associated with Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech, and Michels (3MC) syndrome, a severe developmental disorder manifested by cleft palate, intellectual disability, and skeletal abnormalities. However, the molecular basis for MASP-3 function remains to be understood. Here we characterize the substrate specificity of MASP-3 by screening against a combinatorial peptide substrate library. Through this approach, we successfully identified a peptide substrate that was 20-fold more efficiently cleaved than any other identified to date. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutant forms of the enzyme associated with 3MC syndrome were completely inactive against this substrate. To address the structural basis for this defect, we determined the 2.6-Å structure of the zymogen form of the G666E mutant of MASP-3. These data reveal that the mutation disrupts the active site and perturbs the position of the catalytic serine residue. Together, these insights into the function of MASP-3 reveal how a mutation in this enzyme causes it to be inactive and thus contribute to the 3MC syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2038356680,"Aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthases (aaPGSs) are enzymes that transfer amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to form aa-PG in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. aa-PGs provide bacteria with resistance to a range of antimicrobial compounds and stress conditions. Enterococcus faecium encodes a triple-specific aaPGS (RakPGS) that utilizes arginine, alanine, and lysine as substrates. Here we identify a novel hydrolase (AhyD), encoded immediately adjacent to rakPGS in E. faecium, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of aa-PG. The genetic synteny of aaPGS and ahyD is conserved in >60 different bacterial species. Deletion of ahyD in E. faecium resulted in increased formation of Ala-PG and Lys-PG and increased sensitivity to bacitracin. Our results suggest that AhyD and RakPGS act together to maintain optimal levels of aa-PG in the bacterial membrane to confer resistance to certain antimicrobial compounds and stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1996375656,"Ultraviolet B (UVB) light is the principal aetiological factor associated with non-melanoma skin cancer, the most prevalent group of malignancies in the Caucasian population. Exposure to environmental chemicals has also been shown to promote skin carcinogenesis and, as for UVB, this is associated with the acquisition of genomic DNA damage. Cells respond to DNA damage by inducing cell cycle arrest to facilitate DNA repair, although apoptosis will occur if the damage is excessive. Oncogenes may drive carcinogenesis by disrupting the balanced control of cell cycle progression, DNA repair and apoptosis, allowing for the propagation of cells with damaged DNA. The transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2 have been implicated in both the initiation and progression of several cancers, including basal cell carcinoma. Here we show that GLI1 and an active mutant of GLI2 (ΔNGLI2) promote apoptotic resistance in N/TERT human keratinocytes upon exposure to UVB and the DNA-alkylating chemicals such as methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea. Compared with control and untreated N/TERT-GLI1 and -GLI2 cells, those that survived genotoxic insult formed significantly more colonies in soft agar and were significantly more invasive when grown in three-dimensional organotypic collagen gel cultures. Indeed, surviving N/TERT-GLI1 and -GLI2 cells expressed higher levels of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers Snail and vimentin, and a subpopulation of MMS-treated cells displayed an elongated fibroblast-like morphology with decreased levels of E-cadherin. Finally, whereas Bcl2 was strongly increased in N/TERT-GLI2 cells, the level of induction was weak in N/TERT-GLI1 cells, indicating that GLI1 may activate anti-apoptotic mechanisms(s) independently of Bcl2. In summary, our results show that GLI1 and GLI2 facilitate the propagation of cells with damaged DNA, and thus their expression may be naturally higher in cells that form the earliest precursor tumour lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2058820326,"Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 increases cardiovascular deaths. Identifying a biomarker of COX-2 is desirable but difficult, since COX-1 and COX-2 ordinarily catalyze formation of an identical product, prostaglandin H2. When acetylated by aspirin, however, COX-2 (but not COX-1) can form 15(R)-HETE, which is metabolized to aspirin-triggered lipoxin (ATL), 15-epi-lipoxin A4. Here we have used COX-1- and COX-2-knockout mice to establish whether plasma ATL could be used as a biomarker of vascular COX-2 in vivo. Vascular COX-2 was low but increased by LPS (10 mg/kg; i.p). Aspirin (10 mg/kg; i.v.) inhibited COX-1, measured as blood thromboxane and COX-2, measured as lung PGE2. Aspirin also increased the levels of ATL in the lungs of LPS-treated wild-type C57B16 mice (vehicle: 25.5±9.3 ng/ml; 100 mg/kg: 112.0±7.4 ng/ml; P<0.05). Despite this, ATL was unchanged in plasma after LPS and aspirin. This was true in wild-type as well as COX-1–/– and COX-2–/– mice. Thus, in mice in which COX-2 has been induced by LPS treatment, aspirin triggers detectable 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in lung tissue, but not in plasma. This important study is the first to demonstrate that while ATL can be measured in tissue, plasma ATL is not a biomarker of vascular COX-2 expression.—Kirkby, N. S., Chan, M. V., Lundberg, M.

In Escherichia coli K-12, Ugd is important for biosynthesis of the environmentally regulated exopolysaccharide known as colanic acid, whereas in other E. coli isolates, the same enzyme is required for production of the constitutive group 1 capsular polysaccharides, which act as virulence determinants. Recent studies have implicated tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of Ugd from E. coli K-12, although it is not known if this is a feature shared by bacterial Ugd proteins. The activities of Ugd from E. coli K-12 and from the group 1 capsule prototype (serotype K30) were compared. Surprisingly, for both enzymes, site-directed Tyr → Phe mutants affecting the previously proposed phosphorylation site retained similar kinetic properties to the wild-type protein. Purified Ugd from E. coli K-12 had significant levels of NAD substrate inhibition, which could be alleviated by the addition of ATP and several other nucleotide triphosphates. Mutations in a previously identified UDP-glucuronic acid allosteric binding site decreased the binding affinity of the nucleotide triphosphate.

UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) 2The abbreviations used are: UDPGA, UDP-glucuronic acid; AMPPNP, 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; CPS, capsular polysaccharide; PDB, Protein Data Bank; UDPG, UDP-glucose; Ugd, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; BY-kinase, bacterial tyrosine kinase. is an essential substrate for biosynthesis of several important glycoconjugates. In multicellular eukaryotes, UDPGA is a precursor for the synthesis of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (1.Clarkin C.E. Allen S. Kuiper N.J. Wheeler B.T. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Pitsillides A.A. Regulation of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase is sufficient to modulate hyaluronan production and release, control sulfated GAG synthesis, and promote chondrogenesis.J. Cell Physiol. 2011; 226: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, UDPGA is a substrate in the production of many bacterial surface glycostructures, including capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), secreted exopolysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and teichuronic acids. Bacterial surface glycoconjugates are often critical virulence factors, so UDPGA synthesis can have a direct effect on bacterial pathogenicity. For instance, UDPGA is essential for the formation of hexuronic acid-containing CPSs that often protect bacteria from phagocytosis (2.Alvarez D. Merino S. Tomás J.M. Benedí V.J. Albertí S.

It is also required to synthesize 4-aminoarabinose, which is used to modify the lipid A core of some bacterial LPSs, resulting in resistance to polycationic compounds (4.Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Lipid A modification systems in Gram-negative bacteria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugd) is the enzyme responsible for generating the activated nucleotide sugar from UDP-glucose (UDPG), coincident with the reduction of NAD (5.Strominger J.L. Kalckar H.M.

The enzyme is conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (6.Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase: structure and function of a potential drug target.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human Ugd forms a hexameric ternary complex (7.Egger S. Chaikuad A. Kavanagh K.L. Oppermann U. Nidetzky B. Structure and mechanism of human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase.J. Biol.

Struct. Biol. 2011; 175: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In recent years, the structures of a few bacterial homologs of Ugd have been determined, and the kinetics and modes of regulation have been investigated. In the context of this study, the structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae Ugd (Fig. 1B), in complex with substrate and cofactor (11.Chen Y.Y. Ko T.P. Lin C.H. Chen W.H. Wang A.H.

Biol. 2011; 175: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is particularly important. One form of regulation that has come under scrutiny is activation of bacterial Ugd by tyrosine phosphorylation by bacterial tyrosine kinases (BY-kinase) (12.Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Deutscher J. Mijakovic I. Tyrosine phosphorylation: an emerging regulatory device of bacterial physiology.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Bacterial BY-kinases are frequently found as part of the machinery catalyzing the assembly of a large and diverse subset of extracellular polysaccharides (12.Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Deutscher J.

They are sometimes found as a domain of a subfamily of polysaccharide co-polymerase proteins associated with capsular and exopolysaccharide production systems. These proteins possess a transmembrane modulator domain and a cytoplasmic catalytic domain with tyrosine kinase activity. In Escherichia coli, these two domains are consolidated into a single polypeptide (designated Wzc) (15.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Gene products required for surface expression of the capsular form of the group 1 K antigen in Escherichia coli (O9a: K30).Mol.

Organization of the Escherichia coli K-12 gene cluster responsible for production of the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid.J.

Mijakovic I. Tyrosine phosphorylation: an emerging regulatory device of bacterial physiology.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In E. coli capsule systems, the polysaccharide co-polymerase protein transmembrane domain interacts with an octameric outer membrane channel (Wza) to form part of the export system for completed polysaccharides (17.Collins R.F. Beis K. Dong C. Botting C.H. McDonnell C. Ford R.C. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H.

Wza the translocon for E. coli capsular polysaccharides defines a new class of membrane protein.Nature. 2006; 444: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The purified BY-kinase domains from Bacillus subtilis (YwqC, the transmembrane modulator, and PtkA, the kinase) have been reported to phosphorylate the B. subtilis Ugd homolog (UgdBs) in vitro, resulting in an ∼2-fold increase in UgdBs activity (19.Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Boël G. Mazé A. Gillet S. Jamet E. Decottignies P. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Le Maréchal P. Deutscher J. Transmembrane modulator-dependent bacterial tyrosine kinase activates UDP-glucose dehydrogenases.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4709-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This result led to the proposal that phosphorylated UgdBs is the active form of the enzyme. Similar experiments implicated phosphorylation in the regulation of Ugd activity in E. coli K-12 (20.Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. Autophosphorylation of the Escherichia coli protein kinase Wzc regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Ugd, a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39323-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). E. coli isolates may contain two BY-kinases. The Wzc protein is part of the assembly pathway for serotype-specific group 1 capsular polysaccharides, or colanic acid, which is produced by isolates lacking group 1 capsules, including E. coli K-12 (21.Whitfield C. Biosynthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Colanic acid is an environmentally regulated exopolysaccharide, which is activated by the Rcs regulon (22.Majdalani N. Gottesman S. The Rcs phosphorelay: a complex signal transduction system.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Group 1 CPSs are constitutively expressed virulence determinants (23.Rahn A. Whitfield C. Transcriptional organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli K30 group 1 capsule biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and are encoded by gene clusters that occupy the same chromosomal location as the colanic acid genes (24.Rahn A. Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Conserved organization in the cps gene clusters for expression of Escherichia coli group 1 K antigens: relationship to the colanic acid biosynthesis locus and the cps genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2307-2313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, possession of colanic acid and group 1 capsule assembly machinery appears to be mutually exclusive. The second BY-kinase, Etk, is encoded at an unlinked locus that is not expressed in all isolates (25.Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. Protein tyrosine kinases in bacterial pathogens are associated with virulence and production of exopolysaccharide.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but can contribute to the formation of group 1 CPSs (26.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. Phosphorylation of Wzc, a tyrosine autokinase, is essential for assembly of group 1 capsular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Etk and Wzc are structural homologs (27.Bechet E. Gruszczyk J. Terreux R. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Vigouroux A. Obadia B. Cozzone A.J. Nessler S. Grangeasse C. Identification of structural and molecular determinants of the tyrosine kinase Wzc and implications in capsular polysaccharide export.Mol.

Structure of Escherichia coli tyrosine kinase Etk reveals a novel activation mechanism.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1758-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ugd gene is located near the colanic acid/group 1 CPS locus. It has been proposed that Ugd from E. coli K-12 (UgdK-12) can be phosphorylated by either Etk or Wzc (29.Lacour S. Bechet E. Cozzone A.J. Mijakovic I. Grangeasse C. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli is at the crossroads of colanic acid synthesis and polymyxin resistance.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); phosphorylation by Wzc is correlated with production of colanic acid, whereas phosphorylation by Etk promotes the synthesis of 4-aminoarabinose for lipid A modification. This study was initially undertaken to investigate the possible role of Ugd phosphorylation in the production of a constitutively expressed CPS. In vitro characterization indicated a significant difference in the activities of the two Ugd homologs; UgdK-12 displays significant levels of NAD substrate inhibition, although Ugd from E. coli serotype K30 (UgdK30) does not. We could not establish an obvious role for phosphorylation in modulating activity of Ugd, but kinetic analyses revealed a novel mechanism of activation that is NTP-dependent. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth media (30.Bertani G. Studies on lysogenesis. I. The mode of phage liberation by lysogenic Escherichia coli.J.

Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11176) Google Scholar) in a multistep process. Each gene was first completely replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette, and then the cassette was excised using the pCP20 helper plasmid (32.Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene disruption in Escherichia coli: TcR and KmR cassettes with the option of Flp-catalyzed excision of the antibiotic resistance determinant.Gene. 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), before subsequent genes were deleted. The kanamycin resistance cassette was not removed from the chromosome in the final mutant strain as the marker had no bearing on subsequent experiments. Gene deletions were confirmed by PCR. Mutation of ugd in E. coli serotype K30 affected growth of the organism, presumably due to the accumulation of incomplete capsular polysaccharide repeat units. This led to the accumulation of second-site suppressor mutants, as seen in comparable biosynthetic systems (33.Xayarath B. Yother J. Mutations blocking side chain assembly, polymerization, or transport of a Wzy-dependent Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule are lethal in the absence of suppressor mutations and can affect polymer transfer to the cell wall.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34.Yuasa R. Levinthal M. Nikaido H. Biosynthesis of cell wall lipopolysaccharide in mutants of Salmonella. V. A mutant of Salmonella typhimurium defective in the synthesis of cytidine diphosphoabequose.J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 433-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make CWG875, an E. coli serotype K30 (strain E69) derivative with a ugd deletion, the galE gene was first deleted to generate a strain where K30 capsular polysaccharide production was conditional. GalE (UDP-galactose-4-epimerase) is required for synthesis of the precursor for the galactose residues for the K30 repeat units, one of which is the first sugar of the repeat unit (35.Whitfield C. Paiment A. Biosynthesis and assembly of group 1 capsular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and related extracellular polysaccharides in other bacteria.Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The deletion of galE stops the synthesis of the CPS at the initial step of building the repeat unit on a carrier lipid thereby preventing the production of any synthesis intermediates whose accumulation could affect cell fitness and/or survival. To provide permissive conditions for K30 antigen production, the absence of GalE is overcome by addition of galactose to the growth medium (36.Boels I.C. Ramos A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Functional analysis of the Lactococcus lactis galU and galE genes and their impact on sugar nucleotide and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3033-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The galE gene was replaced with the kanamycin resistance cassette using the λRed recombinase system, and the cassette was excised, as above. The ugdK30 gene was disrupted with a gentamicin resistance cassette, using a suicide delivery vector (pWQ173), using a method reported elsewhere (23.Rahn A. Whitfield C. Transcriptional organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli K30 group 1 capsule biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Under nonpermissive conditions for CPS synthesis, the ugd mutation was tolerated. This provided a background where function of plasmid-encoded Ugd proteins could be tested in vivo based on their ability to restore CPS production under permissive conditions. The ugdK-12 gene was PCR-amplified from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA with primers JB2 and JB6 that incorporate the coding sequence for an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pBAD24 to generate pWQ729. The ugdK30 gene was amplified from pWQ629 (37.Jayaratne P. Bronner D. MacLachlan P.R. Dodgson C. Kido N. Whitfield C. Cloning and analysis of duplicated rfbM and rfbK genes involved in the formation of GDP-mannose in Escherichia coli O9:K30 and participation of rfb genes in the synthesis of the group I K30 capsular polysaccharide.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3126-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), incorporating the His6 tag and cloned into pBAD24, generating pWQ730. The QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene/Agilent Technologies) was used to make site-directed mutants of UgdK-12 and UgdK30. Mutagenic primer pairs (primer sequences available upon request) were synthesized by Sigma, and DNA was amplified using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene/Agilent Technologies). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Advanced Analysis Centre (University of Guelph). DNA fragments encoding His6-tagged UgdK-12 and UgdK30 were excised from pWQ729 and pWQ730, respectively, by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and then cloned into pBAD33 producing pWQ738 and pWQ739, respectively. These pBAD33-based plasmids were compatible with the rcsA-containing pWQ500 for co-transformations of W3110. His6-tagged UgdK-12 and UgdK30 proteins were expressed and purified primarily from CWG876 (exceptions to this are noted where relevant). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into 1 liter of lysogeny broth media and grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.4–0.6, at which time arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02%. After 3 more hours of growth at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics), RNase (0.375 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics), and DNase (0.375 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics). The cells were then lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g) to remove cell debris and unbroken cells, the lysate was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 1 h with mixing at 4 °C. The resin was poured into a column, and the flow-through was collected. Loosely bound proteins were removed with sequential washes of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (10 and 40 mm). Ugd was then eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The elution buffer in the protein samples was replaced with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) by passage over a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using protein assay (Bio-Rad). The UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity of Ugd was measured using a version of a spectrophotometric assay (38.Pagni M. Lazarevic V. Soldo B. Karamata D. Assay for UDPglucose-6-dehydrogenase in phosphate-starved cells: gene tuaD of Bacillus subtilis 168 encodes the UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase involved in teichuronic acid synthesis.Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), modified to facilitate the use of 96-well plates. The dehydrogenase reaction contained Buffer C (100 mm glycine, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol). NAD and UDPG were varied as required (maximal concentrations were 5 mm for both). Reactions were monitored by absorbance at 340 nm in a temperature-controlled BMG FLUOStar OPTIMA plate reader. Km, Ksi, and Vmax values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism4 software program (GraphPad Software, Inc.), by fitting the data to the equation Y = Vmax·X (Km + X·(1 + X/Ksi)), where Y is the enzyme velocity; X is the substrate concentration; Vmax is the maximum enzyme velocity; Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and Ksi is the substrate inhibition constant. Km and Ksi values are expressed in the same units as the substrate concentration (X). Reactions were performed in triplicate (unless otherwise noted). For pretreatment with kinase, nucleotides, and/or cation additives, purified Ugd (1 μg of Ugd per 125 μl reaction) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the appropriate additive in the presence of Buffer B. To measure the dehydrogenase activity, 30 μl of the pretreatment reactions (or an equivalent concentration of Ugd) was combined with reaction mixture in a final volume of 200 μl. Proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE using 10% resolving gels. K30 CPS production was monitored by immunoblotting of proteinase K-treated whole-cell lysates (39.Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. Morphological heterogeneity among Salmonella lipopolysaccharide chemotypes in silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-K30 antibodies (40.Dodgson C. Amor P. Whitfield C. Distribution of the rol gene encoding the regulator of lipopolysaccharide O-chain length in Escherichia coli and its influence on the expression of group I capsular K antigens.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described pre"

However, the appearance of asymptomatic secondary vCJD infection in individuals with a PRNP codon 129 genotype other than M/M and transmission studies using animal models have raised the concern that all humans might be susceptible to vCJD prions, especially via secondary infection. To reevaluate this possibility and to analyze in detail the transmission properties of vCJD prions to transgenic animals carrying distinct codon 129 genotype, we performed intracerebral inoculation of vCJD prions to humanized knock-in mice carrying all possible codon 129 genotypes (129M/M, 129M/V, or 129V/V). All humanized knock-in mouse lines were susceptible to vCJD infection, although the attack rate gradually decreased from 129M/M to 129M/V and to 129V/V. The amount of PrP deposition including florid/amyloid plaques in the brain also gradually decreased from 129M/M to 129M/V and to 129V/V. The biochemical properties of protease-resistant abnormal PrP in the brain and transmissibility of these humanized mouse-passaged vCJD prions upon subpassage into knock-in mice expressing bovine PrP were not affected by the codon 129 genotype. These results indicate that individuals with the 129V/V genotype may be more susceptible to secondary vCJD infection than expected and may lack the neuropathological characteristics observed in vCJD patients with the 129M/M genotype. Besides the molecular typing of protease-resistant PrP in the brain, transmission studies using knock-in mice carrying bovine PrP may aid the differential diagnosis of secondary vCJD infection, especially in individuals with the 129V/V genotype.Background: Secondary vCJD infection may occur in all human PRNP genotypes, but its clinicopathological and biochemical phenotype is uncertain.Results: The biochemical characteristics and transmission properties of the newly generated vCJD prions are not affected by the host PRNP genotypes.Conclusion: Secondary vCJD infection can be adequately diagnosed by biochemical analysis and experimental transmission.Significance: Effective means to identify secondary vCJD infection are presented.
