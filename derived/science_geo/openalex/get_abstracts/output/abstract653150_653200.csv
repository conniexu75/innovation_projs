https://openalex.org/W3027865872,"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a valuable tool for detecting causal effects by using genetic variant associations. Opportunities to apply MR are growing rapidly with the increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing MR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated, leading to false positives. Correlated horizontal pleiotropy, which arises when variants affect both traits through a heritable shared factor, remains a particularly challenging problem. We propose a new MR method, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE), that accounts for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropic effects. We demonstrate, in simulations, that CAUSE avoids more false positives induced by correlated horizontal pleiotropy than other methods. Applied to traits studied in recent GWAS studies, we find that CAUSE detects causal relationships that have strong literature support and avoids identifying most unlikely relationships. Our results suggest that shared heritable factors are common and may lead to many false positives using alternative methods."
https://openalex.org/W3026266297,"Understanding of the factors governing immune responses in cancer remains incomplete, limiting patient benefit. In this study, we used mass cytometry to define the systemic immune landscape in response to tumor development across five tissues in eight mouse tumor models. Systemic immunity was dramatically altered across models and time, with consistent findings in the peripheral blood of patients with breast cancer. Changes in peripheral tissues differed from those in the tumor microenvironment. Mice with tumor-experienced immune systems mounted dampened responses to orthogonal challenges, including reduced T cell activation during viral or bacterial infection. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mounted weaker responses in this context, whereas promoting APC activation rescued T cell activity. Systemic immune changes were reversed with surgical tumor resection, and many were prevented by interleukin-1 or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor blockade, revealing remarkable plasticity in the systemic immune state. These results demonstrate that tumor development dynamically reshapes the composition and function of the immune macroenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3027857492,"Summary The evolutionary features and molecular innovations that enabled plants to first colonize land are not well understood. Here, insights are provided through our report of the genome sequence of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum, a member of the Zygnematophyceae, the sister lineage to land plants. The genome has a high proportion of repeat sequences that are associated with massive segmental gene duplications, likely facilitating neofunctionalization. Compared with representatives of earlier diverging algal lineages, P. margaritaceum has expanded repertoires of gene families, signaling networks, and adaptive responses that highlight the evolutionary trajectory toward terrestrialization. These encompass a broad range of physiological processes and protective cellular features, such as flavonoid compounds and large families of modifying enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, assembly, and remodeling. Transcriptome profiling further elucidated adaptations, responses, and selective pressures associated with the semi-terrestrial ecosystems of P. margaritaceum, where a simple body plan would be an advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3028293850,"The prognosis of colon cancer (CC) is dictated by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including follicular helper T (TFH) cells and the efficacy of chemotherapy-induced immune responses. It remains unclear whether gut microbes contribute to the elicitation of TFH cell-driven responses. Here, we show that the ileal microbiota dictates tolerogenic versus immunogenic cell death of ileal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the accumulation of TFH cells in patients with CC and mice. Suppression of IEC apoptosis led to compromised chemotherapy-induced immunosurveillance against CC in mice. Protective immune responses against CC were associated with residence of Bacteroides fragilis and Erysipelotrichaceae in the ileum. In the presence of these commensals, apoptotic ileal IECs elicited PD-1+ TFH cells in an interleukin-1R1- and interleukin-12-dependent manner. The ileal microbiome governed the efficacy of chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade in CC independently of microsatellite instability. These findings demonstrate that immunogenic ileal apoptosis contributes to the prognosis of chemotherapy-treated CC. Local microbiome composition influences treatment efficacy of chemotherapy in colon cancer via modulation of tolerogenic versus immunogenic ileal intestinal epithelial cell death, which in turn influences follicular helper T cell priming."
https://openalex.org/W3027186100,"Abstract The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib is FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA -mutated breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Olaparib inhibits PARP1/2 enzymatic activity and traps PARP1 on DNA at single-strand breaks, leading to replication-induced DNA damage that requires BRCA1/2-dependent homologous recombination repair. Moreover, DNA damage response pathways mediated by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases are hypothesised to be important survival pathways in response to PARP-inhibitor treatment. Here, we show that olaparib combines synergistically with the ATR-inhibitor AZD6738 (ceralasertib), in vitro, leading to selective cell death in ATM-deficient cells. We observe that 24 h olaparib treatment causes cells to accumulate in G2-M of the cell cycle, however, co-administration with AZD6738 releases the olaparib-treated cells from G2 arrest. Selectively in ATM -knockout cells, we show that combined olaparib/AZD6738 treatment induces more chromosomal aberrations and achieves this at lower concentrations and earlier treatment time-points than either monotherapy. Furthermore, single-agent olaparib efficacy in vitro requires PARP inhibition throughout multiple rounds of replication. Here, we demonstrate in several ATM-deficient cell lines that the olaparib and AZD6738 combination induces cell death within 1–2 cell divisions, suggesting that combined treatment could circumvent the need for prolonged drug exposure. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo combination activity of olaparib and AZD6738 in xenograft and PDX mouse models with complete ATM loss. Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic understanding of combined PARP and ATR inhibition in ATM-deficient models, and support the clinical development of AZD6738 in combination with olaparib."
https://openalex.org/W3027029189,"Neuronal activation induces rapid transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) and longer-term chromatin remodeling around secondary response genes (SRGs). Here, we use high-resolution chromosome-conformation-capture carbon-copy sequencing (5C-seq) to elucidate the extent to which long-range chromatin loops are altered during short- and long-term changes in neural activity. We find that more than 10% of loops surrounding select IEGs, SRGs, and synaptic genes are induced de novo during cortical neuron activation. IEGs Fos and Arc connect to activity-dependent enhancers via singular short-range loops that form within 20 min after stimulation, prior to peak messenger RNA levels. By contrast, the SRG Bdnf engages in both pre-existing and activity-inducible loops that form within 1-6 h. We also show that common single-nucleotide variants that are associated with autism and schizophrenia are colocalized with distinct classes of activity-dependent, looped enhancers. Our data link architectural complexity to transcriptional kinetics and reveal the rapid timescale by which higher-order chromatin architecture reconfigures during neuronal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3028468154,"At various stages of the visual system, visual responses are modulated by arousal. Here, we find that in mice this modulation operates as early as in the first synapse from the retina and even in retinal axons. To measure retinal activity in the awake, intact brain, we imaged the synaptic boutons of retinal axons in the superior colliculus. Their activity depended not only on vision but also on running speed and pupil size, regardless of retinal illumination. Arousal typically reduced their visual responses and selectivity for direction and orientation. Recordings from retinal axons in the optic tract revealed that arousal modulates the firing of some retinal ganglion cells. Arousal had similar effects postsynaptically in colliculus neurons, independent of activity in the other main source of visual inputs to the colliculus, the primary visual cortex. These results indicate that arousal modulates activity at every stage of the mouse visual system."
https://openalex.org/W3027987756,"Posterior fossa A (PFA) ependymomas are lethal malignancies of the hindbrain in infants and toddlers. Lacking highly recurrent somatic mutations, PFA ependymomas are proposed to be epigenetically driven tumors for which model systems are lacking. Here we demonstrate that PFA ependymomas are maintained under hypoxia, associated with restricted availability of specific metabolites to diminish histone methylation, and increase histone demethylation and acetylation at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27). PFA ependymomas initiate from a cell lineage in the first trimester of human development that resides in restricted oxygen. Unlike other ependymomas, transient exposure of PFA cells to ambient oxygen induces irreversible cellular toxicity. PFA tumors exhibit a low basal level of H3K27me3, and, paradoxically, inhibition of H3K27 methylation specifically disrupts PFA tumor growth. Targeting metabolism and/or the epigenome presents a unique opportunity for rational therapy for infants with PFA ependymoma."
https://openalex.org/W3026410170,"Tissue stem cells are the cell of origin for many malignancies. Metabolites regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, but whether endogenous metabolic pathways or nutrient availability predispose stem cells towards transformation remains unknown. Here, we address this question in epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs), which are a cell of origin for squamous cell carcinoma. We find that oncogenic EpdSCs are serine auxotrophs whose growth and self-renewal require abundant exogenous serine. When extracellular serine is limited, EpdSCs activate de novo serine synthesis, which in turn stimulates α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that remove the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and activate differentiation programmes. Accordingly, serine starvation or enforced α-ketoglutarate production antagonizes squamous cell carcinoma growth. Conversely, blocking serine synthesis or repressing α-ketoglutarate-driven demethylation facilitates malignant progression. Together, these findings reveal that extracellular serine is a critical determinant of EpdSC fate and provide insight into how nutrient availability is integrated with stem cell fate decisions during tumour initiation."

https://openalex.org/W3028324116,"Genetic diversity among metastases is poorly understood but contains important information about disease evolution at secondary sites. Here we investigate inter- and intra-lesion heterogeneity for two types of metastases that associate with different clinical outcomes: lymph node and distant organ metastases in human colorectal cancer. We develop a rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying metastatic phylogenetic diversity. Distant metastases are typically monophyletic and genetically similar to each other. Lymph node metastases, in contrast, display high levels of inter-lesion diversity. We validate these findings by analyzing 317 multi-region biopsies from an independent cohort of 20 patients. We further demonstrate higher levels of intra-lesion heterogeneity in lymph node than in distant metastases. Our results show that fewer primary tumor lineages seed distant metastases than lymph node metastases, indicating that the two sites are subject to different levels of selection. Thus, lymph node and distant metastases develop through fundamentally different evolutionary mechanisms. Analysis of metastases using a mathematical framework and multi-region sampling data shows that lymph node metastases have higher levels of intratumor heterogeneity than distant metastases, and that these form via different evolutionary mechanisms."

Here, we determined whether VTA-glutamate or -GABA neurons play a role in innate defensive behavior. By VTA cell-type-specific genetic ablation, we found that ablation of glutamate, but not GABA, neurons abolishes escape behavior in response to threatening stimuli. We found that escape behavior is also decreased by chemogenetic inhibition of VTA-glutamate neurons and detected increases in activity in VTA-glutamate neurons in response to the threatening stimuli.

In addition, some VTA neurons co-release several neurotransmitters, either from the same or from different synaptic compartments (Berrios et al., 2016Berrios J. Stamatakis A.M. Kantak P.A.

Afjei S.A. Pollak Dorocic I. Peck J.R. Liu C. Kim C.K. Tian L. Deisseroth K. Lammel S. A neural circuit mechanism for encoding aversive stimuli in the mesolimbic dopamine system.Neuron. 2019; 101: 133-151.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition to VTA-dopamine neurons, both VTA-GABA and VTA-glutamate neurons have been shown to play a role in mediating aversion. Initial optogenetic studies demonstrated that VTA photoactivation of GABA neurons induces avoidance behavior by inhibiting neighboring dopamine neurons (Tan et al., 2012Tan K.R. Yvon C. Turiault M. Mirzabekov J.J. Doehner J. Labouèbe G. Deisseroth K. Tye K.M. Lüscher C. GABA neurons of the VTA drive conditioned place aversion.Neuron. 2012; 73: 1173-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In a more recent circuit-based study, it was demonstrated that place avoidance mediated by VTA-GABA neurons is regulated by lateral hypothalamus (LH) glutamatergic inputs, and activation of these inputs results in the suppression of dopamine release in nAcc (Nieh et al., 2016Nieh E.H. Vander Weele C.M. Matthews G.A. Presbrey K.N. Wichmann R. Leppla C.A. Izadmehr E.M. Tye K.M. Inhibitory input from the lateral hypothalamus to the ventral tegmental area disinhibits dopamine neurons and promotes behavioral activation.Neuron. 2016; 90: 1286-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that nAcc photoactivation of VTA-VGluT2 inputs drives aversion by a mechanism in which glutamate release from VTA-VGluT2 inputs induces the firing of local parvalbumin GABA-interneurons, resulting in inhibition of neighboring nAcc medium spiny neurons (Qi et al., 2016Qi J. Zhang S. Wang H.L. Barker D.J. Miranda-Barrientos J. Morales M. VTA glutamatergic inputs to nucleus accumbens drive aversion by acting on GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, aversion is also promoted by lateral habenula photoactivation of VTA-VGluT2 inputs (Root et al., 2014bRoot D.H. Mejias-Aponte C.A. Qi J. Morales M. Role of glutamatergic projections from ventral tegmental area to lateral habenula in aversive conditioning.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 13906-13910Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown by in vivo recordings that the firing rate of a large subpopulation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons increases in response to aversive stimuli (Root et al., 2018Root D.H. Estrin D.J. Morales M. Aversion or salience signaling by ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons.iScience. 2018; 2: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we determined whether VTA-VGluT2 and VTA-GABA neurons play a role in innate defensive responses. To examine the role of VTA-VGluT2 neurons in innate escape behavior, we expressed the apoptosis-inducing protein, caspase-3 (Casp3) in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in VGluT2::Cre mice (Figure 1A). By RNAscope VTA cellular detection of VGluT2 mRNA, we confirmed the ablation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons (Figures 1B–1F).

In a second test, we measured escape latency to exposure of the synthetic predator odor trimethylthiazoline (10% TMT; Rosen et al., 2015Rosen J.B. Asok A. Chakraborty T. The smell of fear: innate threat of 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, a single molecule component of a predator odor.Front.

Locomotor activity was not affected by ablation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons (Figures S1A–S1C). These findings suggest a role of VTA-VGluT2 neurons in innate escape behaviors. Given that previous studies have shown a role in aversion by VTA-GABA neurons (Tan et al., 2012Tan K.R. Yvon C. Turiault M. Mirzabekov J.J. Doehner J. Labouèbe G. Deisseroth K. Tye K.M. Lüscher C.

As for VTA-VGluT2 neuronal ablation, we genetically ablated VTA-GABA neurons by Casp3 expression into the VTA of VGaT::Cre mice (Figure 1I) and by RNAscope detection of VGaT mRNA confirmed their ablation (Figures 1J–1N). We found that both control and VTA-VGaT ablated mice showed similar number of runs in response to looming stimulus (Figure 1O) and similar escape latencies in response to TMT exposure (Figure 1P), without affecting locomotor activity (Figures S1D–S1F). These results indicate that, in contrast to VTA-VGluT2 neurons, VTA-VGaT neurons do not seem to be involved in escape behavior in response to looming or odor-threatening stimuli. By in vivo fiber photometry, we tested the participation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons in innate escape behavior. We expressed GCaMP6s in VTA-VGluT2 neurons of VGluT2::Cre mice and recorded Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in response to a looming stimulus (Figures 2A and S2A–S2C). We detected significant increases in Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in response to a looming stimulus when compared with pre-stimulus baseline (Figures 2B and 2C). We observed that these increases in Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons were long lasting (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting that they were not just reflecting responses to sensory events. Given that there is the possibility that increases in Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in response to the looming stimulus may reflect responses to visual events, we next recorded Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in response to both a neutral odor (10% lemon odor) and to TMT odor (10%; Figures 2D–2F). Although both odors increased Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons, the increases were greater in response to TMT (Figures 2E and 2F), suggesting that VTA-VGluT2 neurons were tuned to the threatening stimuli. By in vivo recordings, we have shown that some VTA-VGluT2 neurons increase their firing rate in response to sucrose delivery (Root et al., 2018Root D.H. Estrin D.J. Morales M. Aversion or salience signaling by ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons.iScience. 2018; 2: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that different subpopulations of VTA-VGluT2 neurons respond differentially to appetitive or aversive stimuli. To test this possibility, we recorded Ca2+ activity in VTA-VGluT2 neurons while mice were eating standard chow or palatable sucrose pellets (Figures S2C and S2G). Although we observed increases in Ca2+ activity for both foods, the responses were not significantly different from baseline (Figures S2H–S2J). In the same experiment, we next recorded Ca2+ activity while lightly grabbing mice from the tail and lifting them from the ground, a condition in which mice display escape responses. We detected significant increases in Ca2+ activity in response to mouse lift, suggesting that VTA-VGluT2 neurons’ response is greater to threatening versus appetitive stimuli (Figures S2H–S2K). To determine a causal role for VTA-VGluT2 neurons in innate escape behavior, we studied TMT-induced escape behavior in mice expressing hM4D (inhibitory Gi-coupled designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs [DREADDs]) in VTA-VGluT2 neurons (Figures 2G, S2D, and S2E). We found that VTA-VGluT2 neuronal chemogenetic inactivation by peripheral injection of the hM4D ligands clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Figure 2H) or JHU 37160 (J60; Figure 2I) increased the escape latency to TMT odor presentation when compared with vehicle injection. We did not observe changes in mice locomotor activity induced by CNO or J60 (Figures S2F and S2L). In another set of mice expressing hM4D-mCherry in VTA-VGluT2 neurons, we examined effects of intra-VTA injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or J60 in response to cat litter containing either water or cat urine. We observed that, when mice received intra-VTA aCSF injections, they escaped faster when presented with cat urine than when presented with water, but intra-VTA J60 injections significantly increased cat-urine-induced escape latency, without affecting the response to water presentation (Figures 2J and S2M). These findings from chemogenetic inhibition indicate that VTA-VGluT2 neurons mediate innate escape behaviors. We next looked for possible sources of glutamatergic synaptic inputs to induce activation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons. Tracing studies have shown that LH-VGluT2 neurons provide a major glutamatergic input to VTA (Geisler et al., 2007Geisler S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Zahm D.S. Glutamatergic afferents of the ventral tegmental area in the rat.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5730-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and rabies-virus-based trans-synaptic retrograde tracing studies have suggested that LH provides a major monosynaptic input to VTA-VGluT2 neurons (Faget et al., 2016Faget L. Osakada F. Duan J. Ressler R. Johnson A.B. Proudfoot J.A. Yoo J.H. Callaway E.M. Hnasko T.S.

Gao X.J. Xie S. DeLoach K.E. Malenka R.C. Luo L. Topological organization of ventral tegmental area connectivity revealed by viral-genetic dissection of input-output relations.Cell Rep. 2019; 26: 159-167.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, we next determine the extent to which monosynaptic inputs to VTA-VGluT2 neurons derived from LHA-VGluT2 neurons. By VTA injection of retrograde tract tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) (Figure S3A), we found the highest concentration of FG neurons within LHA (349.3 ± 91.5 neurons), fewer FG neurons in neighboring ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (2.0 ± 1.0 neurons), anterior hypothalamic area (anterior part; 2.3 ± 1.2 neurons), anterior hypothalamic area (posterior part; 8.0 ± 3.2 neurons), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (ventral part; 21.3 ± 9.3 neurons), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (42.7 ± 11.0 neurons), and posterior hypothalamic area (77.3 ± 27.7 neurons; Figures S3F, S3G, and S3I). By in situ hybridization (Figures S3B–S3E″), we found that, within the total population of LHA FG neurons, ≈40% (40.3% ± 2.3%; 466/1,231 FG neurons) co-expressed VGluT2 mRNA and ≈60% (59.7% ± 2.3%; 765/1,231 FG neurons) lacked VGluT2 mRNA (Figure S3H). Although we observed FG neurons co-expressing VGluT2 mRNA throughout rostral (−1.22 bregma), medial (−1.58 bregma), and caudal (−1.94 bregma) aspects of the LHA (Figure S3J), FG neurons lacking VGluT2 mRNA were concentrated in medial and caudal aspects of the LHA (Table S1). These findings indicate that VTA receives a major input from LHA-VGluT2 neurons. Next, we determined the extent to which LHA-VGluT2 neurons synapse on VTA-VGluT2 neurons in mice that expressed mCherry in LHA-VGluT2 neurons and eYFP in VTA-VGluT2 neurons (Figure 3A). We confirmed the distribution of VGluT2 neurons expressing mCherry in LHA perifornical area (Figures S4A–S4E), identified in VTA mCherry axons intermixed with VGluT2-eYFP neurons (Figures 3B and 3C), and determined that mCherry-axon terminals co-expressed VGluT2-protein (Figure 3C). By ultrastructural analysis, we found that, from the total population of LHA-VGluT2-mCherry-axon terminals establishing synapses, 46.6% ± 4.2% made asymmetric synapses on both dendrites and soma of VTA-VGluT2-eYFP neurons (n = 1,420 terminals; Figures 3D–3K, S5A, S5C, and S5C′). Moreover, we determined that multiple LHA-VGluT2-mCherry-axon terminals established synapses on a single VTA-VGluT2-eYFP dendrite (Figure 3D). These ultrastructural synaptic findings indicate that LHA-VGluT2 neurons provide a major excitatory regulation on single VTA-VGluT2 neurons. By ultrastructural analysis, we also examined the synaptic connectivity of LHA-VGluT2 axon terminals on VTA-TH neurons and found that, from the total population of LHA-VGluT2-mCherry axon terminals establishing synapses, 31.5% ± 3.3% made asymmetric synapses on TH-dendrites (n = 1,690 terminals; Figures 3K and S5B). Although we did not detect LHA-VGluT2-mCherry terminals making synapses on somas containing only TH, we detected LHA-VGluT2-mCherry terminals making synapses on somas of VGluT2 neurons co-expressing TH (Figure 3C). The ultrastructural synaptic findings showing that LHA-VGluT2 neurons establish multiple synapses on single VTA-VGluT2 dendrites and somas but few synapses on single VTA-TH dendrites and never on somas of TH-only neurons indicate that glutamate release from LHA-VGluT2 fibers has a stronger excitatory influence on VTA-VGluT2 neurons than on VTA-dopamine-only neurons. To further confirm the monosynaptic excitatory nature of the synapses established by LHA-VGluT2 terminals on VTA-VGluT2 neurons, we prepared VTA slices from mice expressing eYFP in local VGluT2 neurons and mCherry in fibers from LHA-VGluT2 neurons. By voltage clamp recordings of VTA-VGluT2-eYFP neurons, we detected excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by photoactivation of LHA-VGluT2-mCherry fibers (Figure 3L). The amplitude of the EPSCs was not significantly affected by bath application of GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, but it was abolished by AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (Figures 3L–3O). EPSCs amplitude was also blocked by bath application of tetrodotoxin (Figures 3N and 3O) and restored by 4-aminopyridine (Figures 3N and 3O), demonstrating monosynaptic glutamatergic transmission from LHA-VGluT2 fibers to VTA-VGluT2 neurons. In current clamp recordings, we detected a single action potential firing in VTA-VGluT2-eYFP neurons in response to a single pulse of photoactivation of LHA-VGluT2 fibers (Figure S5D) and observed burst firing in VTA-VGluT2 neurons in response to repetitive 20-Hz, 1-s photostimulation of LHA-VGluT2 fibers (Figure S5E). These findings indicate that VTA release of glutamate from LHA-VGluT2 fibers drives the firing of VTA-VGluT2 neurons via activation of their glutamatergic receptors. We next determined the extent to which activation of LHA-VGluT2 inputs induced VTA expression of c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) in mice with LHA-VGluT2 neuronal expression of ChR2-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP mice; Figures S6A and S6B) or eYFP (eYFP mice; Figures S6A–S6F). After VTA photostimulation, we detected 2.5 times more c-Fos neurons in the VTA of ChR2-eYFP mice (279.7 ± 58.7 neurons) than in the VTA of eYFP mice (109.3 ± 11.2 neurons; Figures 4A–4D). By phenotyping VTA c-Fos-positive neurons, we found 10 times less c-Fos-VGaT neurons (16.67 ± 6.89 neurons; Figures 4E–4G) than c-Fos-VGluT2 neurons (169.33 ± 13.38 neurons) and determined that these c-Fos-VGluT2 neurons were more abundant in rostro-linear, parabrachial pigmented and rostral VTA nuclei (Table S2). These c-Fos findings further indicate that inputs from LHA-VGluT2 neurons to VTA preferentially activate VGluT2 neurons. Given that previous viral-based mapping studies have shown that LH provides a major monosynaptic input to VTA-TH neurons (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012Watabe-Uchida M. Zhu L. Ogawa S.K. Vamanrao A. Uchida N. Whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2012; 74: 858-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we examined the connectivity ratio by VTA photostimulation of LHA-VGluT2 fibers on VGluT2 and TH neurons by slice electrophysiology. We used TH::Cre transgenic mice for recordings of VTA-TH neurons after confirming selective expression of TH mRNA in transfected neurons (Figure S7). After VTA photostimulation, we found a higher proportion of VGluT2 responsive neurons than TH responsive neurons (Figures 4H–4K). These electrophysiological findings, together with the synaptic ultrastructural observations, indicate a preferential synaptic connectivity between LHA-VGluT2 and VTA-VGluT2 neurons. To test the participation of LHA-VGluT2 fibers projecting to VTA in response to a looming stimulus, we tested mice that, in LHA-VGluT2 neurons, expressed ChR2-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP mice), eYFP (control mice), or halorhodopsin (Halo-eYFP mice; Figure S6). In the absence of VTA laser stimulation, we detected in all tested mice similar increases in the number of runs (Figure 5A) and speed (Figure S8; Table S3) in response to a looming stimulus, without changes in movement direction. In contrast, we found that VTA photostimulation of LHA-VGluT2 fibers increased the number of runs and speed in ChR2-eYFP, but not in eYFP mice (Figures 5A and S8). Conversely, VTA photoinhibition of LHA-VGluT2 fibers blocked looming-induced runs and speed (Figures 5A and S8). We next examined the possible contribution of LHA-VGluT2 inputs to VTA in innate hiding responses, given that a recent study has proposed a role for VTA-GABA neurons in mediating flight-to-nest responses (Zhou et al., 2019Zhou Z. Liu X. Chen S. Zhang Z. Liu Y. Montardy Q. Tang Y. Wei P. Liu N.

We tested responses to a looming stimulus under conditions in which a shelter was available for mice to hide and determined that, regardless of the presence or absence of a looming stimulus, mice spent long periods of time inside the shelter (Figure 5B).

Our genetic analyses revealed a function of dynamin in propelling invasive membrane protrusions during myoblast fusion in vivo. Using biochemistry, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we show that dynamin bundles actin while forming a helical structure. At its full capacity, each dynamin helix captures 12-16 actin filaments on the outer rim of the helix. GTP hydrolysis by dynamin triggers disassembly of fully assembled dynamin helices, releasing free dynamin dimers/tetramers and facilitating Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization. The assembly/disassembly cycles of dynamin promote continuous actin bundling to generate mechanically stiff actin super-bundles. Super-resolution and immunogold platinum replica electron microscopy revealed dynamin along actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse. These findings implicate dynamin as a unique multifilament actin-bundling protein that regulates the dynamics and mechanical strength of the actin cytoskeletal network."
https://openalex.org/W3027864372,"There is considerable inter-individual variability in susceptibility to weight gain despite an equally obesogenic environment in large parts of the world. Whereas many studies have focused on identifying the genetic susceptibility to obesity, we performed a GWAS on metabolically healthy thin individuals (lowest 6th percentile of the population-wide BMI spectrum) in a uniquely phenotyped Estonian cohort. We discovered anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as a candidate thinness gene. In Drosophila, RNAi mediated knockdown of Alk led to decreased triglyceride levels. In mice, genetic deletion of Alk resulted in thin animals with marked resistance to diet- and leptin-mutation-induced obesity. Mechanistically, we found that ALK expression in hypothalamic neurons controls energy expenditure via sympathetic control of adipose tissue lipolysis. Our genetic and mechanistic experiments identify ALK as a thinness gene, which is involved in the resistance to weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W3026064095,"The circumsporozoite protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSP) is the main target of antibodies that prevent the infection and disease, as shown in animal models. However, the limited efficacy of the PfCSP-based vaccine RTS,S calls for a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the development of the most potent human PfCSP antibodies and identification of their target epitopes. By characterizing 200 human monoclonal PfCSP antibodies induced by sporozoite immunization, we establish that the most potent antibodies bind around a conserved (N/D)PNANPN(V/A) core. High antibody affinity to the core correlates with protection from parasitemia in mice and evolves around the recognition of NANP motifs. The data suggest that the rational design of a next-generation PfCSP vaccine that elicits high-affinity antibody responses against the core epitope will promote the induction of protective humoral immune responses. Characterization of 200 antibodies that bind a malaria parasite protein provides insights that could enable better vaccine design."

Here we report that, in a reversal of their effect on Alzheimer's disease, the APOE4 and APOE2 variants confer favorable and poor outcomes in melanoma, respectively. Mice expressing the human APOE4 allele exhibited reduced melanoma progression and metastasis relative to APOE2 mice. APOE4 mice exhibited enhanced anti-tumor immune activation relative to APOE2 mice, and T cell depletion experiments showed that the effect of APOE genotype on melanoma progression was mediated by altered anti-tumor immunity. Consistently, patients with melanoma carrying the APOE4 variant experienced improved survival in comparison to carriers of APOE2. Notably, APOE4 mice also showed improved outcomes under PD1 immune checkpoint blockade relative to APOE2 mice, and patients carrying APOE4 experienced improved anti-PD1 immunotherapy survival after progression on frontline regimens. Finally, enhancing APOE expression via pharmacologic activation of liver X receptors, previously shown to boost anti-tumor immunity4, exhibited therapeutic efficacy in APOE4 mice but not in APOE2 mice. These findings demonstrate that pre-existing hereditary genetics can impact progression and survival outcomes of a future malignancy and warrant prospective investigation of APOE genotype as a biomarker for melanoma outcome and therapeutic response."

https://openalex.org/W3027108698,"Organisms must learn new strategies to adapt to changing environments. Activity in different neurons often exhibits synchronization that can dynamically enhance their communication and might create flexible brain states that facilitate changes in behavior. We studied the role of gamma-frequency (~40 Hz) synchrony between prefrontal parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mice learning multiple new cue–reward associations. Voltage indicators revealed cell-type-specific increases of cross-hemispheric gamma synchrony between PV interneurons when mice received feedback that previously learned associations were no longer valid. Disrupting this synchronization by delivering out-of-phase optogenetic stimulation caused mice to perseverate on outdated associations, an effect not reproduced by in-phase stimulation or out-of-phase stimulation at other frequencies. Gamma synchrony was specifically required when new associations used familiar cues that were previously irrelevant to behavioral outcomes, not when associations involved new cues or for reversing previously learned associations. Thus, gamma synchrony is indispensable for reappraising the behavioral salience of external cues. Learning new associations that reappraise the behavioral significance of previously irrelevant cues requires gamma-frequency synchronization between parvalbumin interneurons in the left and right prefrontal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W3026122184,"Cyclic changes of the human endometrium, such as proliferation, secretion, and decidualization, occur during regular menstrual cycles. Heart– and neural crest derivatives–expressed transcript 2 (HAND2) is a key transcription factor in progestin-induced decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). It has been suggested that HAND2 regulates interleukin 15 (IL15), a key immune factor required for the activation and survival of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. Activated uNK cells can promote spiral artery remodeling and secrete cytokines to induce immunotolerance. To date, no studies have evaluated the transcription factors that regulate IL15 expression in human ESCs. In the present study, we examined whether HAND2 controls IL15 transcriptional regulation in human ESCs. Quantitative RT-PCR and histological analyses revealed that HAND2 and IL15 levels increase considerably in the secretory phase of human endometrium tissues. Results from ChIP-quantitative PCR suggested that HAND2 binds to a putative HAND2 motif, which we identified in the upstream region of the human IL15 gene through in silico analysis. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that the upstream region of the human IL15 gene up-regulates reporter gene activities in response to estradiol and a progestin representative (medroxyprogesterone) in ESCs. The upstream region of the human IL15 gene also exhibited increasing responsiveness to transfection with a HAND2 expression vector. Of note, deletion and substitution variants of the putative HAND2 motif in the upstream region of IL15 did not respond to HAND2 transfection.

In the absence of an implantation, the endometrium sheds, is repaired, proliferates, and terminally differentiates to prepare for subsequent embryo implantation (1Cha J. Sun X. Dey S.K.

During the proliferative phase, human endometrial epithelial cells and stromal cells (ESCs) increase in response to E2, leading to a thickening of the stratum functionalis of the endometrium. After ovulation, under P4 dominance, the endometrium, which is regulated by autocrine, paracrine, and transcription factors, transitions from the proliferative to the secretory phase (4Patel B.

Steril. 2014; 101 (24745730): 1781-1790.e1-510.1016/j.fertnstert.2014.03.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that IL15 transcription is directly or indirectly regulated by HAND2. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated transcription factors directly affecting IL15 in human ESCs. We have applied in silico analysis here to identify HAND2 motifs (CHTCTGG) (17Boeva V. Louis-Brennetot C. Peltier A. Durand S. Pierre-Eugène C. Raynal V. Etchevers H.C. Thomas S. Lermine A. Daudigeos-Dubus E. Geoerger B. Orth M.F. Grünewald T.G.P. Diaz E. Ducos B. et al.Heterogeneity of neuroblastoma cell identity defined by transcriptional circuitries.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 (28740262): 1408-141310.1038/ng.3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and found candidate sequences in the upstream and intronic region of the human IL15 locus. The present study aimed to examine whether HAND2 participates in IL15 transcriptional regulation in human ESCs. First, we examined whether HAND2 and IL15 were up-regulated in the human endometrium as well as cultured ESCs. During the secretory phase (days 15–28 from previous menstruation, n = 12), HAND2 and IL15 were significantly increased compared with the proliferative phase (days 6–11 from previous menstruation, n = 8) (HAND2: 6.08 ± 5.40 (mean ± S.D.) versus 2.00 ± 0.73, p < 0.05; IL15: 6.86 ± 4.63 versus 2.47 ± 1.34, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). There is a significant correlation between HAND2 and IL15 in the human endometrium (r2 = 0.4239, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). In the endometrium sections (Fig. 2), pseudostratification of the nuclei in the glandular epithelium was observed as the proliferative phase unfolded. In the secretory phase, glandular epithelium transformed to a secretory form in the glands as monolayer cubic epithelium. ESCs in the endometrium transformed from fibroblast-like in the proliferative phase to epithelium-like with cytoplasmic expansion, large pale nuclei, and rounding of cells in the secretory phase as predecidua. Similar to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, histological analysis indicated that HAND2 protein and IL15 mRNA increased in the secretory phase in the endometrium compared with the proliferative phase (Fig. 2). Although both are estimated to be expressed in ESCs, HAND2 and IL15 mRNA were observed in many, but not all, ESCs in the endometrium during the secretory phase (Fig. 2). HALO analysis shows that during the secretory phase, there are 390.7 ± 50.3 (312–464) HAND2-positive cells/0.1 mm2 (Fig. S1). Cells with IL15 signals exhibited 100% merge with HAND2 signals in the secretory phase. Conversely, cells with HAND2 signals did not always merge with IL15 signals; the results demonstrated that 60.3 ± 6.4 (48.9–70.3)% of HAND2-positive cells were merged with the IL15, suggesting a time lag for IL15 transcription start by HAND2. Similar regions within 2 kbp upstream regions from transcription start sites between human IL15 and mouse, rat, or monkey IL15 gene were analyzed using VISTA (18Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. VISTA: visualizing global DNA sequence alignments of arbitrary length.Bioinformatics. 2000; 16 (11159318): 1046-104710.1093/bioinformatics/16.11.1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 19Frazer K.A.

IL15 upstream regions between humans and mice or humans and rats are not conserved, but regions between humans and monkeys are well-conserved. Among them, the positions from −439 to −1 in the human IL15 upstream region are not conserved (Fig. S2). Next, a homology search among Homo sapiens, Macaca fascicularis, and Mus musculus was performed using ClustalW version 2.1 (Fig. 3A). We found the putative consensus sequence for HAND2 binding (17Boeva V. Louis-Brennetot C. Peltier A. Durand S. Pierre-Eugène C. Raynal V. Etchevers H.C. Thomas S. Lermine A. Daudigeos-Dubus E. Geoerger B. Orth M.F. Grünewald T.G.P. Diaz E. Ducos B. et al.Heterogeneity of neuroblastoma cell identity defined by transcriptional circuitries.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 (28740262): 1408-141310.1038/ng.3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in the well-conserved upstream region and intronic regions of human IL15 locus using in silico analysis. Putative HAND2 motifs are denoted as CCTCTGG at position −1628/−1622, relative to the transcription start site, in the upstream region of the human IL15 gene (Fig. 3, A and B). One putative HAND2 motif was also found in the first intron of the human IL15 locus and is denoted as CATCTGG at position intervening sequences (IVS)1_16239/16245 (Fig. 3B). Introns have been shown to affect gene expression by a number of known and unknown mechanisms, collectively known as intron-mediated enhancement (IME) (20Mascarenhas D. Mettler I.J. Pierce D.A. Lowe H.W. Intron-mediated enhancement of heterologous gene expression in maize.Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15 (2103480): 913-92010.1007/BF00039430Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, introns must be within 1 kbp of the transcription start to exert an effect via IME. Because the length of exon 1 in the human IL15 gene is 153 nucleotides, it has been suggested that the putative HAND2 motif at IVS1_16239/16245 is involved in IME. Therefore, ChIP-PCR analysis was performed using primers specific to the human IL15 upstream region around the upstream putative motif, the putative motif in intron 1, negative control primers (pair −1110F and −933R and pair −1937F and −1761R) (Fig. 3B), and immunoprecipitated purified DNA. ChIP-PCR analysis using the −1687F and −1515R primer pair revealed a positive reaction for the human IL15 upstream region around the putative HAND2 motif (Fig. 3C). An additional positive reaction was found in the experiment using the −1649F and −1405R primer pair (Fig. 3C). PCR against the putative HAND2 motif included in intron 1 with the IVS1_16153F and IVS1_16346R primer pair or the IVS1_16002F and IVS1_16253R primer pair showed no positive amplifications. No amplification was detected from purified DNA incubated with normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 3C) or water, which were used as negative control templates, or negative control experiments with the −1110F and −933R primer pair and the −1937F and −1761R primer pair (Fig. 3C). We also confirmed the binding of HAND2 to the HAND2 motifs at −1628/−1622 using ChIP-qPCR with ESC immunoprecipitated chromatin samples from three independent patients (Fig. 3D). Even in ChIP-qPCR, HAND2 recognized the CCTCTGG sequence at position −1628/−1622 of the IL15 upstream region without the CATCTGG at position IVS1_16239/16245 and the negative control region (Fig. 3D). Subsequently, to clarify the significance of the 1.8-kbp upstream region, including the position at −1628/−1622 of the IL15 gene on IL15 transcription in ESCs, we performed a luciferase reporter assay with IL15ups/pGL4.10 (Fig. 4A) under treatment with E2 and MPA. No significant responses were observed between pGL4.10 with/without E2 and MPA treatment (1.19 ± 0.09/1.00 ± 0.38) (Fig. 4B), indicating an absence of confounding ESCs endogenous transcriptional regulatory elements in the pGL4.10 plasmid. Additionally, there are no significant responses between pGL4.10 and IL15ups/pGL4.10 without treatment (1.35 ± 0.35), but E2 and MPA treatment significantly increased luciferase activity of IL15ups/pGL4.10 (6.78 ± 1.06, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B) compared with no treatment. Even in ESCs, from a different patient with the estimated secretory phase, E2 and MPA stimulation significantly increased luciferase activity (18.79 ± 2.20, p < 0.05; Fig. S3) compared with no stimulation. It is suggested that the upstream region of the IL15 gene can regulate IL15 transcription in ESCs under E2 and MPA stimulation in isolation, without intronic sequence. Alternatively, in this different patient’s ESCs, IL15ups/pGL4.10 showed significant elevation in luciferase activities without E2 and MPA stimulation (5.47 ± 0.67, p < 0.05; Fig. S3) compared with pGL4.10 without E2 and MPA stimulation (1.00 ± 0.06) (Fig. S3), suggesting the presence of an endogenous transcription factor for IL15 prior to E2 and MPA stimulation in this ESCs. Thereafter, we examined whether HAND2 regulates IL15 transcription via the 1.8-kbp upstream region of IL15, including the position at −1628/−1622, in ESCs. Co-transfection of the pGL4.10 plasmid with the pIRES2-AcGFP1 (1.00 ± 0.36) or HAND2/pIRES2 (1.26 ± 0.42) vectors exhibited similar luciferase expression in ESCs (Fig. 4C). Luciferase activity from IL15ups/pGL4.10 with the pIRES2-AcGFP1 vector (mock) exhibited no significant increase compared with the pGL4.10 and pIRES2-AcGFP1 vector (mock) (1.27 ± 0.26) in ESCs (Fig. 4C). Activity in the IL15ups/pGL4.10 group increased significantly via co-transfection with the HAND2/pIRES2 vector compared with mock in ESCs (2.76 ± 0.88; p < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Subsequently, the luciferase activity of deletion (ΔH2_motif/pGL4.10) (Fig. 4A) and substitution (CTGtoGAC/pGL4.10) (Fig. 4A) mutants of the putative HAND2 motif were examined. The luciferase activity from IL15ups/pGL4.10 with HAND2/pIRES2 (3.25 ± 0.85) was significantly up-regulated in estimated secretory phase ESCs from different patients compared with pIRES2-AcGFP1 (1.64 ± 0.51, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that there is no individual difference in HAND2-induced IL15 up-regulation in each ESC series. Conversely, the ΔH2_motif/pGL4.10 (2.05 ± 0.65, p < 0.05) or CTGtoGAC/pGL4.10 (2.08 ± 0.74, p < 0.05) with pIRES2-AcGFP1 showed significant promoter activity compared with pGL4.10 with pIRES2-AcGFP1 (1.00 ± 0.25) (Fig. 4D). There are no responses against HAND2/pIRES2 in the ΔH2_motif/pGL4.10 (1.80 ± 0.30) and CTGtoGAC/pGL4.10 (1.74 ± 0.39). To examine whether HAND2 effect against IL15 transcription is specific in ESCs, we conducted a reporter assay using IL15ups/pGL4.10 in HEK293T cells (Fig. S4). Although the IL15ups/pGL4.10 showed higher luciferase activities in HEK293T cells than in ESCs, no reactivity was observed in the 1.8-kbp IL15 upstream region against HAND2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. S4). This suggests that HAND2 effect against IL15 transcription might be specific in ESCs, or the 1.8-kbp IL15 upstream region might be suppressed, and this suppression might be released by HAND2 in ESCs. In our previous siRNA experiments against HAND2 (16Shindoh H. Okada H. Tsuzuki T. Nishigaki A. Kanzaki H. Requirement of heart and neural crest derivatives-expressed transcript 2 during decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells in vitro.Fertil. Steril. 2014; 101 (24745730): 1781-1790.e1-510.1016/j.fertnstert.2014.03.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), FOXO1 expression was synchronized with HAND2 expression. This may suggest that FOXO1 transcription is regulated by HAND2 and that FOXO1 coordinately regulates IL15 transcription in ESCs. We have also identified putative FOXO1 motifs (TGTTTT) (21Rose A.B.

Therefore, we examined whether IL15 was indeed regulated by FOXO1 in ESCs. ChIP-qPCR analysis was performed using primers to the putative FOXO1 motif at −1131/−1137 (Fig. 3B) and at −1993/−1998 (Fig. S5) and immunoprecipitated purified DNA. ChIP-qPCR analysis using the −1286F and −1114R, −2065F to −1916R, and −2051F to −1907R primer pairs showed no significant difference between the immunoprecipitated-DNA with normal rabbit IgG and FOXO1 antibody (Fig. 3D and Fig. S5), indicating no recruitment of FOXO1 to the IL15 upstream region in our ESCs as reported in previous ChIP-sequencing analysis with FOXO1 antibody and decidualizing ESCs (25Vasquez Y.M. Mazur E.C. Li X. Kommagani R. Jiang L. Chen R. Lanz R.B. Kovanci E. Gibbons W.E. DeMayo F.J. FOXO1 is required for binding of PR on IRF4, novel transcriptional regulator of endometrial stromal decidualization.Mol. Endocrinol. 2015; 29 (25584414): 421-43310.1210/me.2014-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that FOXO1 binds to human IGFBP1 enhancer region in ESCs with decidualization (26Tamura I. Jozaki K. Sato S. Shirafuta Y. Shinagawa M. Maekawa R. Taketani T. Asada H. Tamura H. Sugino N. The distal upstream region of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 enhances its expression in endometrial stromal cells during decidualization.J. Biol.

FOXO1 antibody significantly immunoprecipitated the human IGFBP1 enhancer region, including in our ESCs (Fig. S5), indicating the effect of FOXO1 antibody. FOXO1 protein was indeed expressed in this study and was recruited to IGFBP1 upstream region under our E2 and MPA treatment. To further confirm the FOXO1 effects against 1.8 kbp of the IL15 upstream region, we performed a reporter assay. HAND2 significantly increased the luciferase activities even in the 1.8-kbp IL15 upstream region in these new ESCs obtained from a distinct patient; however, there is no reactivity found against FOXO1 (Fig. S6). We also examined the possibility of FOXO1 functioning as a repressor in the IL15 upstream region but found no effect of FOXO1 as the variants in the FOXO1 motif had no reactivity against FOXO1 (Fig. S6). Unlike HAND2, FOXO1 is unlikely to be involved in the transcriptional modulation of the 1.8-kbp upstream region of IL15 following E2 and MPA stimulation. This report is the first to clearly demonstrate that HAND2 is a transcription factor that directly regulates IL15 expression in human ESCs. We have identified a CCTCTGG sequence in the proximal region of the human IL15 gene as a putative HAND2 motif using ChIP-PCR analysis and a luciferase reporter assay, using a human IL15 upstream region and its mutants in ESCs. Our results suggest a functional connection between HAND2 and this putative HAND2 motif (CCTCTGG) in regulating human IL15 transcription. We did not find any functional association between FOXO1 and IL15 expression as reported previously (25Vasquez Y.M. Mazur E.C. Li X. Kommagani R. Jiang L. Chen R. Lanz R.B. Kovanci E. Gibbons W.E. DeMayo F.J. FOXO1 is required for binding of PR on IRF4, novel transcriptional regulator of endometrial stromal decidualization.Mol. Endocrinol. 2015; 29 (25584414): 421-43310.1210/me.2014-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). VISTA analysis showed no significant similar region between rodents and primates with a criterion of 70% per 100 nucleotides. Unlike the human endometrium, rodent endometrium does not induce thickening of the stratum functionalis without embryo implantation. In actuality, decidualization of the endometrium is under maternal control in a handful of species, which includes higher primates (humans, apes, and Old World monkeys), some bats, and the elephant shrew (5Gellersen B. Brosens J.J. Cyclic decidualization of the human endometrium in reproductive health and failure.Endocr. Rev. 2014; 35 (25141152): 851-90510.1210/er.2014-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Therefore, the upstream regions are not conserved between rodents and primates, and whole transcriptional regulation of IL15 might be distinct among them. However, because ClustalW multiple alignment indicated that the HAND2 motif in the upstream region of the IL15 gene is well-conserved (Fig. 3C), the relationship between HAND2 and IL15 transcription in ESCs might be conserved even in rodents. A chimeric motif is supposed to have been generated by connecting forward and backward sequences around the putative HAND2 motif in the deletion mutant. Further, the deletion mutant altered positional relations of all known and unknown motifs in the upstream region of the IL15 gene. For instance, we previously found that nuclear receptor subfamily 6, group A, member 1 (NR6A1), a DNA-binding factor, down-regulates hypocretin expression through an 18-bp nuclear receptor response element (NurRE) in the upstream region of the hypocretin gene (27Tanaka S. Kodama T. Nonaka T. Toyoda H. Arai M. Fukazawa M. Honda Y. Honda M. Mignot E. Transcriptional regulation of the hypocretin/orexin gene by NR6A1.).Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 403 (21056546): 178-18310.1016/j.bbrc.2010.11.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We then cloned a single copy or three copies of NurRE into the upstream region of the TATA box in pTAL-luc reporter plasmid to investigate whether the NurRE exerted transcriptional modulator activity (enhancer, silencer, or insulator). In the condition with the NR6A1 expression vector, three copies were surprisingly activated, although a single copy was repressed. This switching mode might be induced by a generated chimeric binding site connecting each NurRE to other motifs or the change with proximity of NurRE to the promoter. Therefore, we have examined the activities of not only a deletion mutant, but also a substitution mutant, to confirm that the putative HAND2 motif in the human IL15 transcription functions appropriately in ESCs. CTG changed to GAC at −1623/−1625 (purine base to pyrimidine base or pyrimidine base to purine base), but the length from the transcription start site and locations of the other putative motifs might not differ in this substitution mutant. Among these examinations, both mutants showed no response against HAND2. Therefore, HAND2 could regulate IL15 transcription via the putative HAND2 motif at −1628/−1622 in the upstream region of the IL15 gene in ESCs. A recent single-cell analysis reported that a subclass of ESCs express IL15, ruling out IL15 expression by all ESCs (28Vento-Tormo R. Efremova M. Botting R.A. Turco M.Y. Vento-Tormo M. Meyer K.B. Park J.-E. Stephenson E. Polański K. Goncalves A. Gardner L. Holmqvist S. Henriksson J. Zou A.

Therefore, two possibilities exist—either HAND2 transcription is different in each ESC, or HAND2 is expressed at a similar level in all ESCs, but the susceptibility (epigenetic alterations, such as methylation) of the IL15 locus against HAND2 is different for each ESC. Our immunohistochemical results show that HAND2 is not expressed in all ESCs; therefore, HAND2 may be regulated by different mechanisms in each ESC. Interestingly, lack of expression of IL15 might indicate no requirement of uNK around them, suggesting that a local prevalence of uNK cells could trigger IL15 expression.

The actin cytoskeleton receives, integrates, and responds to intra- and extracellular signaling events by changing its organization. Changes in actin organization are driven by the regulated assembly of globular actin (G-actin) into filamentous actin (F-actin), the formation of distinct higher-order F-actin structures, such as bundles, and the coordinated disassembly of F-actin to G-actin (4Pollard T.D.

Unifying features of these cytoskeletal structures are thick actin bundles that assemble and disassemble in a strictly controlled manner. How ASAP1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton is not fully understood. ASAP1 is a multifunctional scaffolding and signaling protein (Fig. 1A) that interacts through its C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain with actin cytoskeleton effectors, such as focal adhesion kinase (13Liu Y.

The N-terminal N-BAR domain mediates ASAP1 dimerization and interacts with the actin-based molecular motor nonmuscle myosin-2A (11Chen P.W. Jian X. Heissler S.M. Le K. Luo R. Jenkins L.M. Nagy A.

The central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain regulates the catalytic GAP domain, which converts Arf·GTP to Arf·GDP (5Randazzo P.A. Inoue H. Bharti S.

PI(4,5)P2 binding to the PH domain activates ASAP1 GAP activity (15Jian X. Tang W.K. Zhai P. Roy N.S. Luo R. Gruschus J.M. Yohe M.E. Chen P.W. Li Y. Byrd R.A. Xia D. Randazzo P.A.

Overexpression of ASAP1 is reported in several mammalian cancers and associated with enhanced cellular migration or invasion rates that promote metastasis (16Hou T. Yang C. Tong C. Zhang H. Xiao J.

We investigated the possibility that ASAP1 functions not only as a scaffolding hub protein for well-described regulators of the actin cytoskeleton at the cytoskeleton-membrane interface but also as an F-actin binding protein. The data presented here reveal the direct interaction between ASAP1 and F-actin: the ASAP1 N-BAR domain directly binds F-actin and aligns it into predominantly unipolar bundles in vitro. Binding of ASAP1 to F-actin protects actin bundles from depolymerization and reduces the spontaneous polymerization of G-actin in vitro. In vivo, overexpression of ASAP1BARPH induces long cellular projections in fibroblasts, underlining its essential role at the cytoskeleton–plasma membrane interface. In summary, ASAP1BARPH inhibits actin turnover likely by stabilizing F-actin bundles, as they are found in focal adhesions and invadopodia, structures that are of importance in cancer cell migration and progression (19Stevenson R.P. Veltman D. Machesky L.M. Actin-bundling proteins in cancer progression at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22492983): 1073-107910.1242/jcs.093799Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Considering the pivotal role of ASAP1 in F-actin-rich structures, such as circular dorsal ruffles, focal adhesions, invadopodia, and podosomes, we investigated whether ASAP1 could directly interact with F-actin. To test for a potential interaction between ASAP1 and F-actin, we used high-speed centrifugation assays in which soluble binding proteins (Fig. 1, A–B and D–H) will cosediment with F-actin (Fig. 1C). As a control for a positive binding event, we used the well-characterized tail domain of vinculin (VTail) that binds to F-actin under the assay conditions (Fig. 1H; ∼78% at 25 μm F-actin). We first addressed whether ASAP1FL would interact and cosediment with F-actin. Increasing concentrations of F-actin resulted in the sedimentation of ∼20% ASAP1FL at 25 μm F-actin (Fig. 1I). Next, we tested ASAP1BARPZA, which contains the three domains that support regulated catalysis and the N-BAR domain, in actin cosedimentation assays. Similar to ASAP1FL, ∼20% ASAP1BARPZA sedimented at 25 μm F-actin (Fig. 1G). To test whether this low extent of binding would be indicative for weak F-actin binding properties of ASAP1FL and ASAP1BARPZA or may be caused by autoinhibition (20Jian X. Brown P. Schuck P. Gruschus J.M. Balbo A. Hinshaw J.E. Randazzo P.A. Autoinhibition of Arf GTPase-activating protein activity by the BAR domain in ASAP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19017632): 1652-166310.1074/jbc.M804218200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we tested a fragment of ASAP1 lacking the N-BAR domain but containing all domains necessary for ASAP1 GTPase-activating (GAP) activity, ASAP1PZA. ASAP1PZA did not sediment with F-actin to an appreciable extent compared with ASAP1BARPZA (Fig. 1F). This observation led us to test ASAP1BARPH, a short and catalytically inactive ASAP1 fragment. In contrast to ASAP1BARPZA and ASAP1PZA, ASAP1BARPH strongly bound to F-actin and showed saturated binding at substoichiometric concentrations (Fig. 1D, ∼86% at 25 μm F-actin). ASAP1PH, which lacks the N-BAR domain, did not bind F-actin to an appreciable extent under the same assay conditions (Fig. 1E). The isolated ASAP1 N-BAR domain is refractory to purification and could not be tested (11Chen P.W. Jian X. Heissler S.M. Le K. Luo R. Jenkins L.M. Nagy A. Moss J. Sellers J.R. Randazzo P.A. The Arf GTPase-activating protein, ASAP1, binds nonmuscle myosin 2A to control remodeling of the actomyosin network.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26893376): 7517-752610.1074/jbc.M115.701292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The densitometric analysis of the sedimentation data is shown in Fig. 1 and reveals the extent of binding in the following order: ASAP1BARPH > ASAP1FL ≈ ASAP1BARPZA > ASAP1PH ≈ ASAP1PZA. To investigate the specificity and reversibility of the interaction between ASAP1BARPH and F-actin, we performed cosedimentation assays as a function of the ionic strength. Increasing [NaCl] led to a decreased extent of complex formation between ASAP1BARPH and F-actin (Fig. S1A). A similar behavior was observed for the interaction between F-actin and VCFP,Tail (Fig. S1B). ASAP1BARPH and VCFP,Tail did not show a salt dependence in their sedimentation behavior and remained soluble in the absence of F-actin (Fig. S1, C–D). Taken together, the cosedimentation data reveal a direct interaction between ASAP1 and F-actin that is mediated by the amino-terminal N-BAR domain of ASAP1. Our previous biochemical characterization showed that the ASAP1 N-BAR domain forms antiparallel homodimers (21Nie Z. Hirsch D.S. Luo R. Jian X. Stauffer S. Cremesti A. Andrade J. Lebowitz J. Marino M. Ahvazi B. Hinshaw J.E. Randazzo P.A. A BAR domain in the N terminus of the Arf GAP ASAP1 affects membrane structure and trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16 (16431365): 130-13910.1016/j.cub.2005.11.069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, a crescent-shaped structure was observed for ASAP1BARPH in negative-stain EM (Fig. 2A). Class averages revealed that the central BAR dimer is 4–5 nm wide and 15–16 nm long (Fig. 2B). The global average and variance images shown in Fig. 2B indicate that the PH domain is flexibly linked to the N-BAR domain. The length of the molecule extended to 26–27 nm in cases where the PH domain was directly in line with the N-BAR domains. A more systematic classification of the ASAP1BARPH fragment is shown in Fig. S2. Homology modeling of ASAP1BARPH (Fig. 2C) and superimposition with the obtained electron micrographs showed that the ASAP1PH domains extend from both ends of the molecule. Homology modeling and sequence analysis of ASAP1BARPH further indicated that the concave surface formed by the N-BAR domains contains clusters of positively charged amino acids (Fig. 2C, bottom). Based on the salt dependence of the actoASAP1BARPH interaction (Fig. S1A) and the results from previous studies on the F-actin binding properties of the F-BAR protein pacsin2 and PICK1 (22Kostan J. Salzer U. Orlova A. Toro I. Hodnik V. Senju Y. Zou J. Schreiner C. Steiner J. Merilainen J. Nikki M. Virtanen I. Carugo O. Rappsilber J. Lappalainen P. et al.Direct interaction of actin filaments with F-BAR protein pacsin2.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15 (25216944): 1154-116210.15252/embr.201439267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Rocca D.L. Martin S. Jenkins E.L. Hanley J.G. Inhibition of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 regulates neuronal morphology and AMPA receptor endocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (18297063): 259-27110.1038/ncb1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that electrostatic interactions between positively charged clusters on the concave surface of the ASAP1 N-BAR domain mediate binding to the negatively charged surface of F-actin. Homodimerization of ASAP1BARPH by means of its N-terminal BAR domain creates a protein complex with potentially two F-actin binding sites that may cross-link F-actin into bundles. The cosedimentation assays shown in Fig. 1, D–H do not distinguish between F-actin binding and bundling activity, as both single actin filaments and bundles sediment at high speeds. To test the hypothesis that ASAP1BARPH bundles F-actin, we incubated F-actin with a series of ASAP1 fragments and used EM to visualize the protein complexes. The electron micrograph in Fig. 2D shows the filamentous structure of actin alone as a reference. In contrast, the reconstituted actoASAP1BARPH complex formed straight, axially aligned dense bundles (Fig. 2E) that resemble actoVTail bundles in their ultrastructure (Fig. 2J). F-actin bundling was also observed for ASAP1FL (Fig. 2G) and ASAP1BARPZA (Fig. 2I) but to a reduced extent compared with that of ASAP1BARPH (Fig. 2E), in agreement with the reduced binding properties observed in F-actin cosedimentation assays (Fig. 1, I and G). Unlike ASAP1BARPH and ASAP1BARPZA (Fig. 2, E and I), ASAP1PH (Fig. 2F) and ASAP1PZA (Fig. 2H) did not significantly bind and bundle F-actin. Notably, the dense, three-dimensional higher-order F-actin bundles did not allow the determination of the binding mode of ASAP1 fragments in the bundle. To explore the actoASAP1BARPH bundles and their polarity in more detail, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. First, we observed the ASAP1BARPH-induced bundling of F-actin in an endpoint assay in which ATTO488-labeled G-actin was polymerized in the presence of increasing concentrations of ASAP1BARPH. The resulting actin structures were analyzed after 10 min (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown in Fig. 3A, increasing concentrations of ASAP1BARPH aligned actin filaments in dense bundles that contain up to a maximum ∼6 actin filaments under the experimental conditions (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the actoASAP1BARPH bundles are of mixed or uniform polarity, the polymerization of ATTO488-labeled G-actin into filaments in the presence of ASAP1BARPH was observed with TIRF microscopy. Bundling events of two polymerizing filaments were identified and the polarity of the bundle determined. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, unipolar and bipolar fusion events were observed. We also observed that in the presence of ASAP1BARPH, polymerizing actin filaments often originated from small bundles with unipolar polarity (Fig. 3E), leading to the hypothesis that ASAP1BARPH preferentially aligns actin filaments into unipolar bundles. The same trend was observed in EM, where the orientation of individual actin filaments in short, actoASAP1BARPH bundles was determined by labeling the actin barbed end with a gelsolin cap prior to bundle formation (Fig. 3F). Gelsolin is an F-actin-severing protein that remains attached to the barbed end of the actin filament as a cap after severing (24Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. Gelsolin, a multifunctional actin regulatory protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (10559185): 33179-3318210.1074/jbc.274.47.33179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The presence of a gelsolin cap was used to determine the polarity of the shortened actin filaments. Quantification of n = 77 filaments showed that 92.2% (n = 71) of the filaments in actin bundles are parallel and 7.8% antiparallel (n = 6). The observed, predominantly unipolar polarity of actoASAP1BARPH bundles agrees with the polarity of actin found in focal adhesions and cellular structures where ASAP1 and F-actin colocalize (25Hotulainen P. Lappalainen P. Stress fibers are generated by two distinct actin assembly mechanisms in motile cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173 (16651381): 383-39410.1083/jcb.200511093Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In the absence of gelsolin, ASAP1BARPH paired actin filaments and promoted the formation of thick bundles. The presence of fully bundled and individual actin filaments indicates a cooperative binding mode (Fig. 3G) that agrees with the small actin bundles observed in TIRF microscopy (Fig. 3, A and E). Under saturating conditions, ASAP1BARPH completely aligned actin into thick unipolar bundles that can associate laterally into higher-order bipolar arrangements (Fig. 3H). ASAP1 localizes to thick F-actin bundles in circular dorsal ruffles and focal adhesions (11Chen P.W. Jian X. Heissler S.M. Le K. Luo R. Jenkins L.M. Nagy A. Moss J. Sellers J.R. Randazzo P.A. The Arf GTPase-activating protein, ASAP1, binds nonmuscle myosin 2A to control remodeling of the actomyosin network.J. Biol.

To test whether ASAP1BARPH would stabilize F-actin within these bundles, we investigated its effect on the dilution-induced depolymerization of F-actin. Increasing concentrations of ASAP1BARPH inhibited the depolymerization of F-actin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The same behavior was observed for the VTail but not the isolated ASAP1PH domain (Fig. 4, B and C), which were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. In summary, the data show that substoichiometric concentrations of ASAP1BARPH stabilize F-actin bundles against depolymerization in vitro. Several F-actin binding and bundling proteins alter actin polymerization (26dos Remedios C.G. Chhabra D. Kekic M. Dedova I.V. Tsubakihara M. Berry D.A. Nosworthy N.J. Actin binding proteins: regulation of cytoskeletal microfilaments.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (12663865): 433-47310.1152/physrev.00026.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To test whether ASAP1BARPH affects the polymerization of G-actin to F-actin, we studied its influence on the spontaneous polymerization of G-actin in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4D, increasing concentrations of ASAP1BARPH decreased the polymerization kinetics of pyrene-labeled G-actin in a concentration-dependent manner. No significant effect on G-actin polymerization was observed for ASAP1PH, whereas the presence of VTail slightly decreased the actin polymerization kinetics (Fig. 4, E and F). In agreement with the bulk kinetic assays, increasing concentrations of ASAP1BARPH also decreased actin polymerization rates in TIRF microscopy assays in which the elongation of actin filaments was observed in real time (Fig. 4G). The presence of 500 nm ASAP1BARPH decreased the actin elongation rate around 50% compared with the control (Fig. 4H). We also observed that individual polymerizing actin filaments are straighter and less dynamic in the presence of ASAP1BARPH, indicating a stabilizing effect on the actin filament. After we examined the effect of ASAP1BARPH on actin dynamics in vitro, we tested whether F-actin regulates the ASAP1 GAP activity, which is important for the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small GTPase Arf1 during cytoskeletal reorganization (27Randazzo P.A. Nie Z. Miura K. Hsu V.W. Molecular aspects of the cellular activities of ADP-ribosylation factors.Sci.

The N-BAR domain of ASAP1 has been shown to autoinhibit its GAP activity, whereas other N-BAR domain-binding proteins, such as FIP3 and nonmuscle myosin-2A, stimulate the GAP activity of recombinant ASAP1 proteins containing the N-BAR domain by 10- to 20-fold (11Chen P.W.

Unlike FIP3 and nonmuscle myosin-2A, F-actin had no detectable effect on the GAP activity of ASAP1BARPZA (Fig. 4I).

To examine the effect of ASAP1 on actin structures in cells, we transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts with various Flag-tagged ASAP1 constructs. Overexpression of ASAP1FL, ASAP1BARPH, or ASAP1BARPZA was sufficient to induce substantial actin remodeling in cells. The most noticeable change was the formation of long actin-filled cellular projections (Fig. 5A). In contrast, ASAP1ΔBARPH, a construct that lacks the BAR-PH tandem, failed to induce these structures (Fig. 5, A and B). We quantified the potency of ASAP1FL, ASAP1BARPZA, ASAP1ΔBARPH, and ASAP1BARPH to induce the formation of actin-filled projections by scoring the percentage of cells exhibiting at least 10 actin projections longer than 5 μm (Fig. 5B). We found that the extent to which these projections were induced correlates with the extent to which the ASAP1 fragments bind F-actin in vitro (Fig. 1J). This observation suggests that ASAP1 affects actin remodeling in cells, possibly through a direct interaction between the N-BAR domain and F-actin. We further characterized the cellular projections induced by the overexpression of ASAP1FL and ASAP1BARPH. We found that the overexpression of ASAP1FL and ASAP1BARPH induced the formation of longer actin-filled projections than a vector control (Fig. 5C). Further, cells overexpressing ASAP1BARPH had a higher total number of projections than cells overexpressing ASAP1FL or a vector control (Fig. 5D). We noticed that the projections induced by the overexpression of ASAP1BARPH displayed vesicular structures at the tip where ASAP1BARPH was concentrated. In contrast, vesicular structures were less frequent in projections induced by the overexpression of ASAP1FL (Fig. 5A). We further measured the length of the projection induced by ASAP1FL or ASAP1BARPH by anti-Flag immunostaining and found that projections induced by ASAP1BARPH were longer than those induced by ASAP1FL"

A total of 584 polymorphic fragments were identified and used to investigate the genetic structure of BPSG through analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), principal components analysis (PCA), a Bayesian method using STRUCTURE software, genetic dissimilarity and phylogenetic tree. AMOVA showed a moderate genetic differentiation between ancestors and improved accessions, 0.14, and the molecular variance was higher within populations than among populations, with values of 86%, 95% and 97% when constrasting improved with ancestors, foreign with ancestors and improved with foreign, respectively. The PCA approach suggests clustering in according with evolutionary and Brazilian breeding sugarcane history, since improved accessions from older generations were positioned closer to ancestors than improved accessions from recent generations. This result was also confirmed by STRUCTURE analysis and phylogenetic tree. The Bayesian method was able to separate ancestors of the improved accessions while the phylogenetic tree showed clusters considering the family relatedness within three major clades; the first being composed mainly by ancestors and the other two mainly by improved accessions. This work can contribute to better management of the crosses considering functional regions of the sugarcane genome."
https://openalex.org/W3027652091,"Liver fibrosis is a manifestation of chronic liver injury. It leads to hepatic dysfunction and is a critical element in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) plays a central role in liver fibrogenesis of different etiologies. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon, it is important to analyze the changes in gene expression that accompany the HSC activation process. In this study, we isolated quiescent and activated HSCs from control mice and mice with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, respectively, and performed RNA sequencing to compare the differences in gene expression patterns between the two types of HSCs. We also reanalyzed public gene expression data for fibrotic liver tissues isolated from patients with HBV infection, HCV infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to investigate the gene expression changes during liver fibrosis of these three etiologies. We detected 146 upregulated and 18 downregulated genes in activated HSCs, which were implicated in liver fibrosis as well. Among the overlapping genes, seven transcription factor-encoding genes, ARID5B, GATA6, MITF, PBX1, PLAGL1, SOX4, and SOX9, were upregulated, while one, RXRA, was downregulated. These genes were suggested to play a critical role in HSC activation, and subsequently, in the promotion of liver fibrosis. We undertook the RNA sequencing of quiescent and activated HSCs and analyzed the expression profiles of genes associated with HSC activation in liver fibrotic tissues from different liver diseases, and also aimed to elucidate the changes in gene expression patterns associated with HSC activation and liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3027721286,"There are several studies on oxidative stress of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but in these cases there is no study to measure oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity at the same time or studies considering childhood development. Therefore, this study comprehensively assessed the level of oxidative stress in ASD children by simultaneously measuring reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and biological antioxidant potential (BAP). The subjects were Japanese, 77 typical development (TD) children, 98 ASD children, samples were plasma. The subjects were divided into age groups: toddlers/preschool age (2–6 years) and school age (7–15 years), to compare the relationships among the d-ROMs levels and BAP/d-ROMs ratios. Furthermore, the correlations between the Parent-interview ASD Rating Scales (PARS) scores and the measured values were analyzed. The levels of d-ROMs were significantly higher in the ASD (7–15 years) than in TD (7–15 years). The PARS scores were significantly higher in the ASD and were significantly correlated with d-ROMs levels. These results suggested that d-ROMs and BAP/d-ROMs ratios could be objective, measured indicators that could be used in clinical practice to assess stress in ASD children."
https://openalex.org/W3027632119,"Intestinal bacterial dysbiosis is evident in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and intestinal viruses may be contributory, given their influence on bacterial species diversity and biochemical cycles. We performed a prospective, case-control study on children with CF and age and gender matched healthy controls (HC), to investigate the composition and function of intestinal viral communities. Stool samples were enriched for viral DNA and RNA by viral extraction, random amplification and purification before sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Taxonomic assignment of viruses was performed using Vipie. Functional annotation was performed using Virsorter. Inflammation was measured by calprotectin and M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). Eight CF and eight HC subjects were included (50% male, mean age 6.9 ± 3.0 and 6.4 ± 5.3 years, respectively, p = 0.8). All CF subjects were pancreatic insufficient. Regarding the intestinal virome, no difference in Shannon index between CF and HC was identified. Taxonomy-based beta-diversity (presence-absence Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) was significantly different between CF and HC (R2 = 0.12, p = 0.001). Myoviridae, Faecalibacterium phage FP Taranis and unclassified Gokushovirinae were significantly decreased in CF compared with HC (q<0.05). In children with CF (compared to HC), the relative abundance of genes annotated to (i) a peptidoglycan-binding domain of the peptidoglycan hydrolases (COG3409) was significantly increased (q<0.05) and (ii) capsid protein (F protein) (PF02305.16) was significantly decreased (q<0.05). Picornavirales, Picornaviridae, and Enterovirus were found to positively correlate with weight and BMI (r = 0.84, q = 0.01). Single-stranded DNA viruses negatively correlated with M2-PK (r = -0.86, q = 0.048). Children with CF have an altered intestinal virome compared to well-matched HC, with both taxonomic and predicted functional changes. Further exploration of Faecalibacterium phages, Gokushovirinae and phage lysins are warranted. Intestinal viruses and their functions may have important clinical implications for intestinal inflammation and growth in children with CF, potentially providing novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3028547272,"Along with the developing world, Bangladesh has made a tremendous improvement in declining total fertility rate, however, this declining trend is not uniform to all the socio-demographic stratum. Incongruities exist between the numbers of children that women bearing and what they actually desired which refers to unmet fertility desire. This study aims to elicit women's perception of ideal number of children and predictors of unmet fertility desire in Bangladesh.This study analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 data. A two-stage stratified random sampling technique was used while a total of 17,863 ever-married women were interviewed between June and November 2014. A total of 10,912 eligible women were included in the analysis. Poisson regression analysis and logistic regression models were used to measure women's perception of the ideal number of children and to determine the influencing factors of unmet fertility desires.The mean value of the perceived ideal number of children was 2.22 (SD ± 0.73) and the majority of women (71.2%) expect to have two children in their lifetime. Approximately 46% of mothers reported bearing more children than they desired. The perceived ideal number of children was significantly higher among women who were living in rural areas, from Sylhet division, Muslim, unemployed, and experienced child death and those who justified beating. Findings revealed that several factors such as place of residence, geographic location, religion, wealth index, maternal age and education, partners' education, experiencing child death, and other empowerment-related indicators were significantly associated with unmet fertility desires.Perceived ideal number of children differs among women's socioeconomic and demographic strata. Unmet fertility desire was also found which indicates that reproductive knowledge and health care services are still necessary for some socio-demographically disadvantaged/vulnerable people and this group should be regularly monitored to control population growth."

Pathological angiogenesis is particularly prominent in the retina in the settings of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, in which it can lead to permanent loss of vision. In this study, by bioinformatics analyses, we provide evidence for elevated expression of actin-binding protein PFN1 (profilin1) in the retinal vascular endothelial cells (VECs) of individuals with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, findings further supported by gene expression analyses for PFN1 in experimentally induced abnormal retinal neovascularization in an oxygen-induced retinopathy murine model.

Angiogenesis, a process of new blood vessel generation from pre-existing blood vessels, is a fundamental process for vascular expansion during development and vascular regeneration in tissue repair. However, aberrant angiogenesis lies at the heart of a wide range of pathologies including those involving the retina such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), wet age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. In particular, PDR is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Elevated signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is most often involved in neovascularization-associated eye diseases. Although antiangiogenic therapies targeting VEGF signaling are generally effective in some of these disease contexts, spontaneous or acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapies continues to be a significant problem in a substantial percentage of the patient population (∼30% in DR and ∼10% in wet age-related macular degeneration) because of involvement of other proangiogenic mediators in disease progression (1Paulus Y.M.

Hence, identification of alternative mediators of retinal angiogenesis could potentially pave the way for novel therapeutic avenues in neovascularization-associated ocular diseases. During angiogenesis, a certain population of VECs are selected in response to proangiogenic growth factors (such as VEGF and fibroblast growth factor) to become tip cells that extend actin-rich filopodial protrusions and assume a highly motile phenotype to invade the stroma and guide the vascular outgrowth. In a highly orchestrated manner, VECs trailing behind (known as stalk cells) proliferate to elongate the vessel sprouts (10Stapor P. Wang X. Goveia J. Moens S. Carmeliet P. Angiogenesis revisited: role and therapeutic potential of targeting endothelial metabolism.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25179598): 4331-434110.1242/jcs.153908Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Dynamic regulation of actin cytoskeletal assembly is essential for cell migration. A common structural feature of major actin-assembly factors, such as proteins belonging to the WASP (e.g. N-WASP (Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and WAVE (WASP-associated verprolin-homology protein)), Mena/VASP (e.g. Mena (mammalian enabled), VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), and Evl (enabled/VASP-like)), and formin families (we collectively refer to these actin nucleation-promoting and elongating factors as NPEFs from hereon), is the presence of multiple polyproline (PLP) domains. These domains allow NPEFs to interact with G-actin–binding protein PFN1 (profilin1, the abundant isoform of the PFN family of proteins that acts as a major nucleotide exchange factor of G-actin) and in turn enhance their ability to recruit polymerization-competent actin monomers to stimulate actin polymerization (reviewed in Ref. 11Ding Z. Bae Y.H. Roy P. Molecular insights on context-specific role of profilin-1 in cell migration.Cell Adh. Migr. 2012; 6 (23076048): 442-44910.4161/cam.21832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

PFN1 is involved in VASP-mediated regulation of actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells, membrane protrusion, and cell motility in vitro (14Gau D. Veon W. Shroff S.G. Roy P.

WAVE’s cooperative action with VASP on Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly in vitro and cell motility during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis requires a functional PLP domain of VASP, further implicating PFN1’s role in this process (15Havrylenko S.

PFN1 also synergizes with formin-family protein Dia2 (diaphanous 2) to promote gastrulation cell movement in zebrafish embryos (16Lai S.L. Chan T.H. Lin M.J. Huang W.P. Lou S.W. Lee S.J.

These actions of PFN1 are consistent with reduced migratory ability and of most normal cells including VECs upon either depletion of the overall expression or disruption of either of two key molecular interactions (actin or PLP ligands) of PFN1 (17Ding Z.

Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PFN1 is a common denominator of multiple actin-assembly pathways and underscore PFN1 as an important mediator of actin-regulated processes in cells.

Other studies established a role of a site-specific post-translational modification of PFN1 in stimulating angiogenesis in vivo (23Fan Y. Arif A. Gong Y. Jia J. Eswarappa S.M. Willard B. Horowitz A. Graham L.M. Penn M.S. Fox P.L. Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of profilin-1 in angiogenesis.Nat.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16 (24747440): 445-45610.1038/ncb2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, proangiogenic growth factor (such as VEGF) stimulation of VECs elicits Src-mediated phosphorylation of PFN1 on its Tyr129 residue. This phosphorylation stimulates PFN1–actin interaction and VEC motility, as well as angiocrine factor production through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1, a major activator of VEGF transcription. Blockade of Tyr129 phosphorylation ability of PFN1 led to reduced angiogenesis associated with tissue repair and tumor progression but interestingly had no discernible effect on developmental angiogenesis in mouse retina (23Fan Y. Arif A. Gong Y. Jia J. Eswarappa S.M. Willard B. Horowitz A. Graham L.M. Penn M.S. Fox P.L. Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of profilin-1 in angiogenesis.Nat.

However, because abrogating Tyr129 phosphorylation does not inhibit the basal actin interaction or interfere with other molecular interactions (such as those involving PLP ligands or membrane phosphoinositides) of PFN1, it could not rule out PFN1’s role in physiological angiogenesis. Therefore, the impact of complete LOF of PFN1 on angiogenesis in vivo, whether physiological or pathological, remains unclear. In this study, we for the first time provide evidence for PFN1 up-regulation in retinal VECs in PDR patients, PFN1’s important role in tip cell activity and vascular sprouting during developmental retinal angiogenesis, and the ability of a small molecule investigative compound targeting the PFN1–actin interaction to attenuate abnormal retinal neovascularization in vivo. Previous studies established PFN1’s link with vascular-related pathology in diabetes. Specifically, PFN1 expression is elevated in VECs in diabetes and in response to factors that promote diabetes-associated pathology (e.g. atherosclerosis, advanced glycation end products) in vitro and in vivo (including human patients). PFN1 elevation exacerbates VEC dysfunction in diabetic milieu, and conversely, PFN1 depletion offers protection against oxidative damage, inflammation, obesity-induced glucose tolerance, and VEC dysfunction in diabetic animals in vivo (25Pae M.

Whether PFN1 expression is altered in retinal vasculature in PDR (a later stage of DR that is associated with abnormal retinal neovascularization) is not known. We performed bioinformatics analyses to probe for Pfn1 gene expression in a previously published study that compared transcriptome profiles of CD31+ VECs from fibrovascular membranes from patients with PDR (seven patients) versus four control retinal samples (Gene Expression Omnibus Database data set GSE94019) (35Lam J.D.

Although the sample size was small, these analyses revealed a highly significant (false discovery rate = 8.3E-09; p = 1.98E-11) 10.2-fold increase in the average mRNA expression of endothelial PFN1 in the retina of PDR patients relative to the retina of normal subjects (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the Pfn1 gene is transcriptionally up-regulated in retinal VECs in PDR patients. We next asked whether the clinical observation of elevated PFN1 expression in retinal VECs in PDR patients is reproducible in animal models. Most genetic and drug-induced mouse models of diabetes reproduce the early stage of DR (basement membrane thickening and vascular leakage) but fail to evoke neo-angiogenesis in the retina as occurs in PDR. Murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a well-established experimental model that captures the hypoxia-induced proliferative phase of abnormal neovascularization in the retina and has been widely used to model abnormal angiogenesis aspects of PDR and retinopathy of prematurity in humans (36Selvam S.

In this model, newborn mice are subjected to hyperoxia (75% O2) from P7–P12 and then returned to normoxic condition for an additional 5 days before the animals are sacrificed for retinal evaluation on P17. Exposure to high O2 leads to loss of immature retinal vessels and retards normal vascular development resulting in vaso-obliteration (VO) in the central retina, whereas the hyperoxia-to-normoxic transition creates a relative ischemia triggering both normal vascular regrowth and abnormal neovascularization (NV) (see Fig. 6). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of P17 mouse retina showed ∼40% higher PFN1 mRNA level in the OIR pups relative to the control pups that were maintained in a normoxic condition throughout (Fig. 1B). These data provide evidence for elevation of retinal PFN1 expression associated with abnormal angiogenesis in vivo, further qualitatively supporting our clinical correlation data in PDR patients (possible reasons underlying the quantitative discrepancy between the order of PFN1 up-regulation in the OIR model versus PDR patients are discussed later). Unlike humans, developmental retinal vascularization in rodents occurs postnatally. During this process, retinal vessels grow radially outward in a reproducible temporal and spatial pattern predominantly through sprouting angiogenesis mechanism involving tip cell invasion and stalk cell proliferation from the center of the retina forming the superficial vascular plexus that reaches the retinal periphery by P8–P10 developmental age. The exact time course of normal vascular development in mice is, however, strain-specific. Subsequent vertical sprouting of superficial capillaries first gives rise to the deep and then intermediate vascular plexi of the retina (36Selvam S. Kumar T. Fruttiger M. Retinal vasculature development in health and disease.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2018; 63 (29129724): 1-1910.1016/j.preteyeres.2017.11.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Stahl A. Connor K.M.

Our previous study showed that in an ex vivo setting, aortic segments from mice with VEC-specific heterozygous deletion of the Pfn1 gene at the embryonic level display reduced sprouting angiogenesis compared with those isolated from their WT Pfn1 littermates. However, we were unable to obtain live birth of mice with homozygous deletion of the Pfn1 gene, suggesting that the total loss of PFN1 in VECs at the embryonic level might be lethal (22Gau D. Veon W. Capasso T.L. Bottcher R. Shroff S. Roman B.L. Roy P. Pharmacological intervention of MKL/SRF signaling by CCG-1423 impedes endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.Angiogenesis. 2017; 20 (28638990): 663-67210.1007/s10456-017-9560-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we generated Pfn1flox/flox:CDH5-CreERT mice to allow for tamoxifen-induced expression of Cre (under the control of VE-cadherin promoter) and excision of the Pfn1 gene selectively in VECs (Cre-negative mice of any PFN1 genotypes served as the control). In our first set of experiments, the pups were subjected to three successive rounds of tamoxifen injection on days P2–P4, and P9 retinae were harvested for staining with FITC-lectin; a subset of retinae of each genotype were also stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to assess the impact of endothelial loss of PFN1 on actin cytoskeleton. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of the Pfn1 gene was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA prepared from the kidney (a vascular-rich organ) using primer sets 1 and 3, which produces a 700-bp amplicon when the floxed exon1 of Pfn1 is cleaved (Fig. 2A). By P9, the superficial vascular plexus reached the periphery of the retina in 6 of 6 (100%) and 4 of 6 (66%) of Pfn1WT and Pfn1KO retinae, respectively. Although there was considerable zonal variation in the vascular density, the overall vascular density of Pfn1KO retinae was significantly lower (by ∼45 ± 15%) than Pfn1WT retinae (Fig. 2, B and C). These data provided an initial indication of PFN1-dependent changes in retinal vascular architecture. The average fluorescent intensity of phalloidin (labels F-actin) in the lectin-positive regions of the retina was also less intense in Pfn1KO retinae compared with Pfn1WT retinae, indicative of a reduced level of actin polymerization upon the loss of PFN1 in retinal VECs in vivo (Fig. 2, D and E) (note that this average phalloidin fluorescence value is not affected by vascular density). These data suggest that PFN1 promotes actin assembly in retinal VECs in vivo. P9 retina is developmentally too late to capture the active angiogenesis in the superficial layer of the retina. Therefore, to better capture the effect of LOF of PFN1 on tip cell behavior and sprouting angiogenesis during vascular development, in our subsequent set of experiments, we disrupted Pfn1 gene function by injecting tamoxifen in the pups on days P0–P2 and characterized angiogenesis phenotypes in retinae isolated from Pfn1WT and Pfn1KO mice at an earlier developmental time point (P6). These experiments showed a robust effect of Pfn1 deletion on developmental retinal angiogenesis. Essentially, Pfn1KO retinae exhibited hypovascularization marked by reduced radial outgrowth of blood vessels (suggesting a defect in tip cell invasion) as measured by the overall VEC-covered retinal area (by ∼36 ± 13%), average number of vascular sprouts/field (by ∼62 ± 16%), and vascular density (by ∼55 ± 5%) compared with PFN1WT retinae (Fig. 3, A–E). Because there was no significant difference in the average weight between P6 Pfn1WT (4.07 ± 0.12g) and Pfn1KO (4.12 ± 0.14g) mice, retinal hypovascularization in Pfn1KO mice is not a consequence of global growth defect. Filopodia (a hallmark of tip cells) are crucial for sensing of the environment and guided tip cell invasion at the growing vascular front during sprouting angiogenesis. Filopodia in tip cells can be easily visualized in whole-mount lectin staining of retina, as done previously in a number of studies (39Sakabe M. Fan J. Odaka Y. Liu N. Hassan A. Duan X. Stump P.

https://openalex.org/W3026479385,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent neoplasia comprising approximately 20% of lymphomas. FL is generally considered incurable, with a median survival exceeding 10 years. A subset of FL patients experiences histological transformation (HT) to a more aggressive lymphoma, resulting in markedly poorer clinical outcome, with a reduced median survival after transformation of 1-2 years. Early, reliable prediction of HT would be valuable in the clinical setting, allowing pre-emptive therapeutic intervention. We previously used proteomics to identify the glycolytic enzymes fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (aldolase A) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as candidate predictors of FL transformation. Now, we use immunohistochemistry to evaluate expression of these enzymes in paired primary FLs from patients with (n = 41) or without subsequent HT (n = 49), to test their value as predictive biomarkers. At initial FL diagnosis, patients with subsequent HT had significantly higher expression of aldolase A and GAPDH (p<0.001 and p<0.01) compared with patients without HT. Furthermore, high expression of aldolase A and GAPDH was associated with significantly shorter transformation free survival (p = 0.018, p = 0.001). These data suggest that high expression of aldolase A and GAPDH, may indicate increased metabolic turnover, and that these enzymes may be useful biomarkers in primary FL for predicting the risk of subsequent lymphoma transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3028561505,"Backgroud Fabry disease (OMIM #301 500), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by enzymatic defects in alpha-galactosidase A (GLA gene; Xq22.1). Fabry disease has historically been characterized by progressive renal failure, early stroke and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a diminished life expectancy. A nonclassical phenotype has been described with an almost exclusive cardiac involvement. Specific therapies with enzyme substitution or chaperone molecules are now available depending on the mutation carried. Numerous clinical and fundamental studies have been conducted without stratifying patients by phenotype or severity, despite different prognoses and possible different pathophysiologies. We aimed to identify a simple and clinically relevant way to classify and stratify patients according to their disease severity. Methods Based on data from the French Fabry Biobank and Registry (FFABRY; n = 104; 54 males), we applied unsupervised multivariate statistics to determine clusters of patients and identify clinical criteria that would allow an effective classification of adult patients. Thanks to these criteria and empirical clinical considerations we secondly elaborate a new score that allow the severity stratification of patients. Results We observed that the absence of acroparesthesia or cornea verticillata is sufficient to classify males as having the nonclassical phenotype. We did not identify criteria that significantly cluster female patients. The classical phenotype was associated with a higher risk of severe renal (HR = 35.1; p <10−3) and cardiac events (HR = 4.8; p = 0.008) and a trend toward a higher risk of severe neurological events (HR = 7.7; p = 0.08) compared to nonclassical males. Our simple, rapid and clinically-relevant FFABRY score gave concordant results with the validated MSSI. Conclusion Acroparesthesia and cornea verticillata are simple clinical criteria that efficiently stratify Fabry patients, defining 3 different groups: females and males with nonclassical and classical phenotypes of significantly different severity. The FFABRY score allows severity stratification of Fabry patients."
https://openalex.org/W3027982948,"HIV self-testing (HIVST), which allows people to test in private, is an innovative testing strategy that has been shown to increase HIV testing among men. Delivering HIVST kits to men via women is one promising assisted partner service strategy. Little research has been conducted on HIVST secondary distribution to men by women living with HIV (WLWH) in the Caribbean and other settings. The purpose of this study was to assess the perspectives of WLWH, their male partners, and healthcare professionals on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of HIVST, and recommendations for implementing HIVST in Haiti, with a focus on secondary distribution of HIVST to men by WLWH. Sixteen key informant interviews and nine focus groups with 44 healthcare workers, 31 Option B+ clients, and 13 men were carried out in Haiti. Key informants were representatives of the Ministry of Health and of a non-governmental agency involved in HIV partner services. Focus group members included program leads and staff members from the HIV care and treatment program, the Option B+ program, the community health service program, and the HIV counseling and testing services from 2 hospitals. Perceived HIVST advantage included an increase in the number of people who would learn their HIV status and start treatment. The perceived disadvantages were lack of support to ensure self-testers initiate treatment, uncertainty about male partner’s reaction, risk of violence towards women delivering HIVST kits after receiving an HIVST kit from a woman, and the inability of women to counsel a man in case his self-test result is positive. Recommendations for integrating HIVST and secondary distribution of HIVST by WLWH included coupling HIVST distribution with public information, education, and communication through media and social marketing, relying on community health workers to mediate use of HIVST and ensure linkage to care, piloting HIVST programs on a small scale. HIVST is an appropriate and feasible strategy HIV prevention for men and women; however, more research is needed on how best to implement different strategies for this approach in the Caribbean."

Here, we outline considerations and opportunities toward striking a good balance between maintaining and redefining research priorities. Researchers around the globe have been mounting, accelerating, and redeploying efforts across disciplines and organizations to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. However, humankind continues to be afflicted by numerous other devastating diseases in increasing numbers. Here, we outline considerations and opportunities toward striking a good balance between maintaining and redefining research priorities. The world is currently facing a global pandemic without precedence within our lifetime, and there is an urgent need of research breakthroughs. It is encouraging and exciting to observe how leading research organizations and scientists across all disciplines are actively redeploying efforts to help identify and implement solutions, bringing a constellation of the brightest minds working on the COVID-19 acute societal challenge together. The importance of such global effort has also catalyzed rapid mobilization of funding bodies in support of these operations, accelerated eagerly anticipated changes in research culture, and brought about a beautiful manifestation of exercising research freedom. Across the world, leading scientists and research organizations are united in the joint fight against the devastating threat we are all currently facing. Many research centers have redeployed trained personnel to actively join in helping at local hospitals and health departments, in addition to providing instruments and reagents to colleagues in need of those to better fight the pandemic and repurposing research facilities to accelerate translational impact. Virologists, immunologists, geneticists, molecular biologists, lung biologists, epidemiologists, and computational biologists, among others from all fields of biomedical sciences, together with clinicians of numerous disciplines are working feverishly to answer COVID-19-related questions, accelerate diagnostic testing, and enable development of vaccines and therapeutics. Scientists across the board, from early-career trainees to seasoned department heads, are rolling up their sleeves to make a scientific contribution that may help overcome the crisis sooner with fewer casualties and less societal damage. There is no question that this historic worldwide effort is impressive and should enforce society’s trust in science while inspiring the next generation of budding scientists to find their calling. It is clear that experts with appropriate training and long-accrued experience in fighting pandemics ought to be and are indeed leading the way in our current challenge and also that they ought to be ably supported and assisted by scientists worldwide in their monumental efforts. Along those lines, new approaches from basic research can plug in fast for innovative therapeutics, such as Cas-based technology. In addition, widely adopted digital tools such as smartphone applications are now being rapidly developed, deployed, and used to track contact and symptoms. Population-based biobanks and epidemiological cohorts across the world are joining forces to empower large-scale surveillance and research in infection trajectories, pathophysiology, outcomes, and underlying genomics. These approaches benefit from an interdisciplinary approach and have started to make progress in understanding transmission patterns in recent weeks, for example. However, widespread redeployment of world-class expertise from other areas into the current acute phase of COVID-19 research can lead to substantial loss of focus. A longer-term diversion of resources runs the risk of stifling much-needed new basic research and technological breakthroughs that have the potential to revolutionize biomedicine. For example, the development of CRISPR-Cas genome and transcriptional engineering tools has the potential to considerably transform biomedicine (including the fight against COVID-19). Therefore, similar basic research breakthroughs with major potential for transformative societal benefits should not be prevented, risked, or delayed. A refocus on COVID-19 research activities is likely to engender adverse effects on society’s clear and urgent need for sustained research into major diseases, which will continue to afflict humankind and remain leading causes of death and disability well beyond the end of the acute COVID-19 challenge. Such a dynamic carries the risk of hindering breakthroughs and can dilute, delay, and disrupt ongoing team efforts to tackle these equally devastating health challenges. Clearly, this is neither the time to be divided nor to act without decisiveness. However, as a global research community, it is important to keep an eye on the fact that, worldwide, people (including children) are still dying of diseases other than COVID-19. These numbers will go up for a long time to come if clinical, translational, and basic researchers shift their focus away from fighting these killers. It is impossible to predict in detail what this hiatus could mean for grand challenges we have collectively been striving to combat for decades. Here, we comment on societal threats and research challenges using the representative examples of cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, which will continue to plague humankind in the future (Figure 1). We further highlight lessons to be learned from the current acute response to the COVID-19 threat and outline opportunities not to be missed for accelerating, rather than hampering, progress for biomedical research more widely. Importantly, beneficial developments like international teams working together rather than in competition, faster processing by regulatory bodies, and fast sharing of data are all positive developments likely to speed up translation of research results in the future. Obesity is still imposing a major global threat to human health. Obesity numbers continue to grow exponentially across the globe, thus making metabolic dysfunction a long-term challenge for global health care systems. The immense impact of obesity on population health is illustrated by both the fact that the consequences of over-nutrition have bypassed under-nutrition as a leading global burden to human health and by the role of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction as a risk factor for further long-term cardiovascular complications (Finucane et al., 2011Finucane M.M. Stevens G.A. Cowan M.J. Danaei G. Lin J.K. Paciorek C.J. Singh G.M. Gutierrez H.R. Lu Y. Bahalim A.N. et al.Global Burden of Metabolic Risk Factors of Chronic Diseases Collaborating Group (Body Mass Index)National, regional, and global trends in body-mass index since 1980: systematic analysis of health examination surveys and epidemiological studies with 960 country-years and 9·1 million participants.Lancet. 2011; 377: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). Most notably, type 2 diabetes affects more than 400 million people worldwide today, and the closely correlated cardiovascular diseases remain the main cause of death in Western societies, with a similar upward trajectory in low- and middle-income countries commensurate with recent demographic shifts (WHO, 2016WHOGlobal Report on Diabetes. World Health Organization, 2016Google Scholar). Halting or slowing down scientists’ and clinicians’ efforts to predict, treat, and eventually cure metabolic complications may thus endanger direly needed progress in (1) defining diabetic sub-populations with specified requirements for treatment and complications prevention, (2) developing personalized therapeutic strategies to counteract diabetic metabolic dysfunction and their long-term (cardiovascular) complications, and (3) employing pancreatic beta cell regeneration and functional restoration to finally overcome the disease. Of note, beyond the classical obesity- and diabetes-related complications, recent global research has further highlighted that defects in energy homeostasis serve as prime risk factors for many cancers, thereby rendering obesity and diabetes prevention and therapy into a critical measure to protect against malignant diseases in the long run (García-Jiménez et al., 2016García-Jiménez C. Gutiérrez-Salmerón M. Chocarro-Calvo A. García-Martinez J.M. Castaño A. De la Vieja A. From obesity to diabetes and cancer: epidemiological links and role of therapies.Br. J. Cancer. 2016; 114: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, the mutual impact of metabolism and immune responses (“immuno-metabolism”) has gained significant attention by the global research community. Indeed, numerous examples have been discovered on how metabolism in obesity and/or diabetes affect the recruitment and function of immune cells and vice versa. Decades of research on immuno-metabolic pathways will support our fight against long-term chronic metabolic dysfunction (Li et al., 2020Li C. Spallanzani R.G. Mathis D. Visceral adipose tissue Tregs and the cells that nurture them.Immunol. Rev. 2020; 295: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Even if it is not as front and center in the pubic media or our minds today, we cannot afford to lose this fight, as it concerns hundreds of millions of patients with numbers constantly and rapidly increasing. Diverting focus or support away from the important long-term efforts to fight cardiometabolic diseases has consequences that will certainly be as devastating and as lethal as the COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide, the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients will increase from 18 million today to approximately 30 million in the year 2040, posing a substantial challenge to cancer care systems and to cancer research (https://gco.iarc.fr/today/). Most of this growth will occur in low- and medium-income countries, but the number of cancer cases will continue to rise at least in the coming decade in high-income countries as well. The reasons for this alarming forecast are a growing world population, increasing life expectancy with a cancer risk that increases with age in a number of countries, and higher exposure to unhealthy lifestyle factors. For example, about 40% of all cancers could be prevented if all currently known risk factors were avoided by all citizens (https://www.who.int/). Importantly, many of these risk factors also contribute to other widespread health threats. In addition, non-malignant diseases such as chronic inflammation, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, diabetes, and a range of different infections may per se be a causative factor for cancer—calling for joint research across different fields of health sciences (de Martel et al., 2020de Martel C. Georges D. Bray F. Ferlay J. Clifford G.M. Global burden of cancer attributable to infections in 2018: a worldwide incidence analysis.Lancet Glob. Health. 2020; 8: e180-e190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, Gallagher and LeRoith, 2015Gallagher E.J. LeRoith D.

Rath D. et al.Platelet GPIbα is a mediator and potential interventional target for NASH and subsequent liver cancer.Nat. Med. 2019; 25: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another important concern of oncologists and cancer researchers is the growing number of cancer survivors, which already represents a multiple of the number of new cancer cases and will continue to grow as cancer care improves (Shapiro, 2018Shapiro C.L. Cancer Survivorship.N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379: 2438-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cancer survivors are exposed for very long times, if not for life, to the risk of recurrence, secondary cancer, morbidity caused by neoplastic disease or therapeutic interventions, psychological sequelae, and reduced quality of life as well as socioeconomic disparities. A growing challenge is also that the average age of cancer patients will increase in the coming years. Translational and clinical cancer research has in the past mainly been performed in small, selected cohorts of relatively fit younger and elderly patients, which may not be representative of the more frail and multimorbid cancer populations to be treated in the future (Overgaard, 2015Overgaard J. Radiotherapy. Gazing at the crystal ball of European radiotherapy.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 12: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As a final example, the majority of cancer patients in the future will live in countries that have so far been heavily underrepresented in both preclinical and clinical cancer research. This carries substantial risk that new strategies might lead to unexpected results. To address these and other challenges, research of the biology of cancer and healthy tissues at risk of side effects must be conducted together with population sciences, and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches needs to be performed in populations that reflect the future global cancer burden. The results of this research are expected to feed into three major anti-cancer strategies: (1) primary prevention as the only option to reduce the burden of new cancer cases, (2) early detection of cancer at stages that are curable with therapies are already at hand, and (3) improved diagnostic-therapeutic interventions that widen the therapeutic window between tumor control and damage to healthy tissues or impairment of quality of life. Pronounced biological heterogeneity exists between tumors of the same type in different patients, as well as between subvolumes of the same tumor and primary tumors and metastases. Tumor biology also changes over the course of tumor progression and therapy. Additional heterogeneity exists between healthy organs of different patients. Therefore, all anti-cancer strategies mandate an increasingly personalized approach (Baumann et al., 2016Baumann M. Krause M. Overgaard J. Debus J. Bentzen S.M. Daartz J. Richter C. Zips D. Bortfeld T. Radiation oncology in the era of precision medicine.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 234-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, Dagogo-Jack and Shaw, 2018Dagogo-Jack I. Shaw A.T. Tumour heterogeneity and resistance to cancer therapies.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 15: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Personalized bioassay-based oncology, mainly in the field of drug-based cancer treatment, has in many aspects paved the way for personalized medicine in general. This approach must be strengthened by global networking and should also be extended toward personalized primary prevention and early detection beyond the few examples already established today. A translational framework covering the continuum from discovery research to outcome and population research appears to be best suited to address the very substantial challenges that cancer and other major diseases will pose on our societies in the decades to come (Eggermont et al., 2019Eggermont A.M.M. Apolone G. Baumann M. Caldas C. Celis J.E. de Lorenzo F. Ernberg I. Ringborg U. Rowell J. Tabernero J. et al.Cancer Core Europe: A translational research infrastructure for a European mission on cancer.Mol.

To be successful on a global scale, the vast disparities existing in the world need to be taken into account. It is therefore of paramount importance that the COVID-19 pandemic is not interpreted as a calling to refocus but as a calling to unite and a unique chance to learn lessons toward integrating, balancing, and improving biomedical research programs across disciplines. The COVID-19 crisis has engendered a rapid shift in research focus and culture. Biomedical research going forward ought to capitalize on this disruptive effect. There exist several areas of these recent changes that can stand the wider biomedical science field in good stead going forward. Indeed, success in global mobilization of research endeavors can and should be co-opted and adapted to speed progress for research on cancer, diabetes, and other big societal health challenges. Open data sharing and implementation of the FAIR principles have become common goals and are in fact increasingly mandated. Rapid peer review and publication of results has served the community well. Regulatory processes by institutional review boards and authorities, sometimes a hurdle to fast translational successes, have been rapidly adapted to more efficient workflows. Global collaboration has flourished, with shared resources, exchange of materials, expertise and technologies, open communication, and transparency allowing for quicker, better, more impactful research insights. Hospital departments and research labs have quickly worked hand in hand in a bidirectional translation approach, which was often not pragmatic only few months ago. Interdisciplinary teams have formed and quickly learned to understand each other’s languages, with excellent examples of success stories emerging already. Harmonization of efforts to enable meaningful meta-analysis is leading to better-powered research and impactful outcomes. The requirement for social distancing, which also holds true for scientists all over the world, together with the suddenly increased pressure to come up with novel solutions to new and old challenges, has culminated in innovative digitization of scientific processes. Forced integration of data science tools (apps), real-world studies (new cohorts), artificial intelligence, and cutting-edge laboratory research into one rapidly adaptive global research program constitutes developments that will not be reversed but rather will accelerate progress across disciplines long after the COVID-19 pandemic has been brought under control. Further, we need to understand why certain diseases—cancer, obesity, and diabetes among them—appear to be predisposing to more serious progression of COVID-19 cases. This could indeed lead to improvements in precision prevention and personalized therapy of virus infections and additionally offer insights into aspects of metabolic disease, of which scientists were previously not aware, thus providing a better understanding of mechanisms that underpin co-morbidity across the board. Perhaps the most significant change catalyzed by the pandemic has been raised societal and political awareness of three basic pillars underpinning the promise of improving human health for all. First, the usefulness, safety, and ultimately also economic value of investing in long-term basic research and medical science including population studies and technology platforms have come into focus. Second, the importance of prevention medicine tools such as vaccines and vaccine development platforms has deservedly returned to the fore. Finally, the need for functioning and balanced public-private partnerships, effectively translating academic insights into approved drugs in quality and amounts capable of stopping worldwide threats, has been recognized as a sine qua non in delivering solutions at a global and equitable scale. The world is currently facing a research challenge of unprecedented proportions in living memory. The pandemic has deservedly attracted resources and has brought scientists together in order to tackle this huge societal challenge. However, research strategies, programs, and resources built over decades to prevent or eradicate even bigger and equally urgent health threats are at risk of experiencing a major setback with potential dire implications for our society. The research community must decide carefully how to best fight the terrible pandemic that currently paralyzes much of our lives, while protecting the expertise and knowledge base accrued longitudinally, and how to maximize output from infrastructural and research development investments to also protect society from diseases that may feel comparably familiar but remain just as lethal. We are currently being made aware, again, of what a valuable commodity health is and that a well-functioning health system can also be an economic advantage. Scientists, society, and those in power must realize that the challenge posed by the pandemic offers opportunity to improve health care in a sustainable way that pays off in the long term. In the past, we have failed to fully capitalize on similar opportunities, such as the development of new rapidly adaptable vaccine platforms following epidemics such as Ebola or avian flu. While this should not happen again now, we categorically cannot let the pendulum swing in the opposite direction and neglect research focusing on preventing and eradicating other major diseases. Instead, based on what we have learned during the current COVID-19 crisis, smart, lasting, balanced, and joint investments in improving our health as one global society are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3028210674,"Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis produces crystal inclusions composed of three-domain Cry proteins and cytolytic Cyt toxins, which are toxic to different mosquito larvae. A key component is the Cyt toxin, which synergizes the activity of the other Cry toxins, thereby resulting in high toxicity. The precise mechanism of action of Cyt toxins is still debated, and two models have been proposed: the pore formation model and the detergent effect. Here, we performed a systematic structural characterization of the Cyt toxin interaction with different membranes, including in Aedes aegypti larval brush border membrane vesicles, small unilamellar vesicle liposomes, and rabbit erythrocytes. We examined Cyt1Aa insertion into these membranes by analyzing fluorescence quenching in solution and in the membrane-bound state. For this purpose, we constructed several Cyt1Aa variants having substitutions with a single cysteine residue in different secondary structures, enabling Cys labeling with Alexa Fluor 488 for quenching analysis using I-soluble quencher in solution and in the membrane-bound state. We identified the Cyt1Aa residues exposed to the solvent upon membrane insertion, predicting a possible topology of the membrane-inserted toxin in the different membranes. Moreover, toxicity assays with these variants revealed that Cyt1Aa exerts its insecticidal activity and hemolysis through different mechanisms. We found that Cyt1Aa exhibits variable interactions with each membrane system, with deeper insertion into mosquito larva membranes, supporting the pore formation model, whereas in the case of erythrocytes and small unilamellar vesicles, Cyt1Aa's insertion was more superficial, supporting the notion that a detergent effect underlies its hemolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3028535409,"This study assesses the respiratory dynamics related to stress parameters and resting time before slaughter, in the quality of surubim (Pseudopatystoma spp.) fillets. A completely randomized design was conducted using five treatments: resting time before slaughter of 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours, with 15 fish sampled per treatment. Time 0 corresponded to the treatment without resting time, where the fish were slaughtered immediately after arriving at the processing plant. The resting time did not affect the electrolyte balance, hemoglobin, plasma, hepatic glycogen, myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) and water holding capacity (WHC) of surubins. However, with increased resting time, there was a significant decrease in muscle glycogen and an increase in blood pH and blood bicarbonate levels. Additionally, respiratory parameters showed an increase in pO2 and, consequently, in O2 saturation and a decrease in pCO2.The hematocrit and MCV values of the surubins after 24 hours of resting decreased significantly. In the first hours of resting, the highest values of erythrocytes and CHCM were observed. The lowest level of stress was observed for fish having 24 hours of resting. Fish having longer resting periods (8 and 24 hours) presented fillets with a higher pH (P <0.05) and the rigor mortis establishment time was shorter for the first 2 hours and 24 hours of resting time. There was a linear decrease in fillet lightness and an increase in the intensity of red (CIE a*) color up to 24 hours when resting was increased. In CIE b*, a linear decrease (P <0.05) of the yellow intensity of the fillets was observed as the surubim resting time increased. A resting time of 4 to 8 hours before slaughter is effective in reestablishing homeostasis after transporting surubim, providing fillets with higher quality and a greater length of the pre-rigor mortis period."
https://openalex.org/W3026168473,"The purpose of this paper is to characterize the skin deterministic damage due to the effect of proton beam irradiation in mice occurred during a long-term observational experiment. This study was initially defined to evaluate the insurgence of myelopathy irradiating spinal cords with the distal part of a Spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted highlighting high grades of skin injury at the dose used in this paper. Nevertheless these effects occurred. In this regard, the experimental evidence of significant insurgence of skin injury induced by protons using a SOBP configuration will be shown. Skin damages were classified into six scores (from 0 to 5) according to the severity of the injuries and correlated to ED50 (i.e. the radiation dose at which 50% of animals show a specific score) at 40 days post-irradiation (d.p.i.). The effects of radiation on the overall animal wellbeing have been also monitored and the severity of radiation-induced skin injuries was observed and quantified up to 40 d.p.i."
https://openalex.org/W3026483160,"In response to injury, adult Schwann cells (SCs) re-enter the cell cycle, change their expression profile, and exert repair functions important for wound healing and the re-growth of axons. While this phenotypical instability of SCs is essential for nerve regeneration, it has also been implicated in cancer progression and de-myelinating neuropathies. Thus, SCs became an important research tool to study the molecular mechanisms involved in repair and disease and to identify targets for therapeutic intervention. A high purity of isolated SC cultures used for experimentation must be demonstrated to exclude that novel findings are derived from a contaminating fibroblasts population. In addition, information about the SC proliferation status is an important parameter to be determined in response to different treatments. The evaluation of SC purity and proliferation, however, usually depends on the time consuming, manual assessment of immunofluorescence stainings or comes with the sacrifice of a large amount of SCs for flow cytometry analysis. We here show that rat SC culture derived cytospins stained for SC marker SOX10, proliferation marker EdU, intermediate filament vimentin and DAPI allowed the determination of SC identity and proliferation by requiring only a small number of cells. Furthermore, the CellProfiler software was used to develop an automated image analysis pipeline that quantified SCs and proliferating SCs from the obtained immunofluorescence images. By comparing the results of total cell count, SC purity and SC proliferation rate between manual counting and the CellProfiler output, we demonstrated applicability and reliability of the established pipeline. In conclusion, we here combined the cytospin technique, a multi-colour immunofluorescence staining panel, and an automated image analysis pipeline to enable the quantification of SC purity and SC proliferation from small cell aliquots. This procedure represents a solid read-out to simplify and standardize the quantification of primary SC culture purity and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3027178507,"Our study goal was to evaluate a set of nutritional indicators among adults with confirmed or suspected active tuberculosis disease in southern India, given the limited literature on this topic. Study objectives were to assess the: I) double burden of malnutrition at individual and population levels; II) relative performance of anthropometric indicators (body mass index, waist circumference) in diabetes screening; and III) associations between vitamin D and metabolic abnormalities.Cross-sectional study.Hospital in rural southern India.Among adult patients (n = 834), we measured anthropometry, body composition, and biomarkers (vitamin D, glycated hemoglobin, hemoglobin) of nutritional status. Subsets of participants provided blood and sputum samples.Among participants, 91.7% had ≥ 1 malnutrition indicator; 34.6% had both undernutrition and overnutrition indicators. Despite the fact that >80% of participants would be considered low-risk in diabetes screening based on low body mass index and waist circumference, approximately one-third had elevated glycated hemoglobin (≥ 5.7%). The lowest quintile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with an increased risk of glycated hemoglobin ≥ 5.7% (adjusted risk ratio 1.61 [95% CI 1.02, 2.56]) compared to the other quintiles, adjusting for age and trunk fat.Malnutrition and diabetes were prevalent in this patient population; since both can predict poor prognosis of active tuberculosis disease, including treatment outcomes and drug resistance, this emphasizes the importance of dual screening and management of under- and overnutrition-related indicators among patients with suspected or active tuberculosis disease. Further studies are needed to determine clinical implications of vitamin D as a potential modifiable risk factor in metabolic abnormalities, and whether population-specific body mass index and waist circumference cut-offs improve diabetes screening."
https://openalex.org/W3027335161,"Bayesian inference is the process of narrowing down the hypotheses (causes) to the one that best explains the observational data (effects). To accurately estimate a cause, a considerable amount of data is required to be observed for as long as possible. However, the object of inference is not always constant. In this case, a method such as exponential moving average (EMA) with a discounting rate is used to improve the ability to respond to a sudden change; it is also necessary to increase the discounting rate. That is, a trade-off is established in which the followability is improved by increasing the discounting rate, but the accuracy is reduced. Here, we propose an extended Bayesian inference (EBI), wherein human-like causal inference is incorporated. We show that both the learning and forgetting effects are introduced into Bayesian inference by incorporating the causal inference. We evaluate the estimation performance of the EBI through the learning task of a dynamically changing Gaussian mixture model. In the evaluation, the EBI performance is compared with those of the EMA and a sequential discounting expectation-maximization algorithm. The EBI was shown to modify the trade-off observed in the EMA."
https://openalex.org/W3026747974,"Aegle marmelos L. (Bael) is a native tree fruit species in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Bael is a popular fruit because of its significant nutritional and medicinal properties. However, bael is an underutilized fruit species in Sri Lanka. Thus, Fruit Crop Research and Development Station of the Department of Agriculture of Sri Lanka has selected five elite bael accessions (Beheth Beli, Paragammana, Mawanella, Rambukkana, and Polonnaruwa-Supun). We assessed these five accessions for the variation of the fruit size, pulp, organoleptic preference, elemental properties, genetic diversity, and evolutionary history. The fruits at the golden-ripe stage were collected during the peak fruiting seasons in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The fruit size, pulp, shell thickness, and seed size were measured and subjected to the General Linear Model (GLM) and Principal Component (PC) Analyses. The fruit pulp was distributed among a group of 30 taste-panelists to rank for the parameters: external appearance, flesh color, aroma, texture, sweetness, and overall preference. The rank data were subjected to association and PC analyses. The elemental contents of the fruit pulp samples were measured using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and subjected to GLM and PC analyses. We observed a significant diversity in fruit size, organoleptic preference, and elemental contents among bael accessions. Rambukkana and Polonnaruwa-Supun yield the biggest and most preferred fruits. We used trnH-psbA, atpB-rbcL spacer, matk-trnT spacer, and trnL markers to construct phylogenies. Sri Lankan bael split from an Indian counterpart, approximately 8.52 MYA in the Pliocene epoch. However, broader germplasm of Indian bael must be assessed to see the presence of any independent evolution within Sri Lanka."

https://openalex.org/W3026966452,"Precise regulation of chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis is of vital importance to mammalian reproduction. Anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is reported to play an important role in metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Here we report that cell division cycle 23 (Cdc23, also known as APC8) plays a critical role in regulating the oocyte chromosome separation. Cdc23 localized on the meiotic spindle, and microinjection of Cdc23 siRNA caused decreased ratios of metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Loss of Cdc23 resulted in abnormal spindles, misaligned chromosomes, errors of homologous chromosome segregation, and production of aneuploid oocytes. Further study showed that inactivation of spindle assembly checkpoint and degradation of Cyclin B1 and securin were disturbed after Cdc23 knockdown. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting spindle assembly checkpoint protein Msp1 partly rescued the decreased polar body extrusion and reduced the accumulation of securin in Cdc23 knockdown oocytes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Cdc23 is required for the chromosome segregation through regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint activity, and cyclin B1 and securin degradation in meiotic mouse oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3026971984,"Over two million men, women, and youth are incarcerated in the United States. This large and ethnically diverse population has, in general, more limited exposure to education, particularly in scientific fields, than the general public. Formal educational programs for the incarcerated can be expensive and logistically difficult to initiate and maintain, but informal science education (ISE) approaches have the potential to significantly improve inmates' view of science and of themselves as science learners. However, ""dosage effects""-how repeated exposure to educational experiences may affect listeners-are poorly documented. In this study, we evaluated the longitudinal effects of an ISE program in Utah, which provided a monthly lecture series delivered by academic scientists on a range of science topics. Science content knowledge, self-perception as a science learner, interest in science, and a desire to seek out more scientific information all significantly improved for inmates attending lectures. We also found that seeing a greater number of lectures is positively associated with a desire to seek out additional information. We documented an inverse relationship between education background and the increase in a desire to learn more, suggesting that those with more limited exposure to science manifest the greatest increase in seeking out more information. These results suggest that ISE for the incarcerated significantly improves their knowledge of, and relationship with, science; that some of these effects carry over across months or years; and that ISE programs can have the largest impact by focusing on those with more limited prior exposure to science."
https://openalex.org/W3028043013,"Suspected bacterial urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common cause of overuse and misuse of antimicrobials. A bedside diagnostic test that could accurately predict urine culture results would prevent antimicrobial overuse, but accurate biomarkers have not yet been identified in veterinary medicine. The objective of this study was to evaluate urine myeloperoxidase (uMPO) as a rapidly available, accurate marker to predict urine culture results. We hypothesized that uMPO would be higher in dogs with a positive urine culture than in dogs with a negative urine culture, and that uMPO could be used to aid in the accurate diagnosis of significant bacteriuria. Urine samples were collected from a veterinary university clinical pathology lab. uMPO concentration was measured using a commercially available canine myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following validation, samples from 98 dogs that had a urinalysis and urine culture performed as part of their diagnostic investigation were included. Forty-seven dogs had a negative urine culture and fifty-one dogs had a positive urine culture. uMPO levels were significantly higher in samples that had a positive culture (median 2.13 ng/ml; IQR 0.98-7.07) versus samples that had a negative culture (median 1.07 ng/ml; IQR 0.52-1.84)(p < 0.005). Based on receiver-operator characteristic, a cutoff of 0.55 ng/ml was chosen to maximize sensitivity and specificity. Using a cutoff of 0.55 ng/ml, uMPO had a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 69% to determine the presence of a positive culture. However, the degree of overlap between groups may preclude the use of this test as a surrogate for urine culture in a clinical setting."

https://openalex.org/W3028312228,"Birthing centres (BC) in Nepal are mostly situated in rural areas and provide care for women without complications. However, they are often bypassed by women and their role in providing good quality maternity services is overlooked. This study evaluated an intervention to increase access and utilisation of perinatal care facilities in community settings.This longitudinal cross-sectional study was conducted over five years in four villages in Nepal and included two BCs. An intervention was conducted in 2014-2016 that involved supporting the BCs and conducting a health promotion programme with local women. Population-based multi-stage sampling of women of reproductive age with a child below 24 months of age was undertaken. Household surveys were conducted (2012 and 2017) employing trained enumerators and using a structured validated questionnaire. The collected data were entered into SPSS and analysed comparing pre- and post-intervention surveys.The intervention was associated with an increase in uptake in facility birth, with an increase in utilisation of perinatal services available from BCs. The post-intervention survey provided evidence that women were more likely to give birth at primary care facilities (OR 5.60, p-value <0.001) than prior to the intervention. Similarly, the likelihood of giving birth at a health facility increased if decision for birthplace was made jointly by women and family members for primary care facilities (OR 1.76, p-value 0.023) and hospitals/tertiary care facilities (OR 1.78, p-value 0.020. If women had less than four ANC visits, then they were less likely to give birth at primary care facilities (OR 0.39, p-value <0.001) or hospitals/tertiary care facilities (OR 0.63, p-value 0.014). Finally, women were less likely to give birth at primary care facilities if they had only primary level of education (OR 0.49, p-value 0.014).BCs have the potential to increase the births at health facilities and decrease home births if their services are promoted by the local health promoters. In addition, socio-economic factors including women's education, the level of women's autonomy and having four or more ANC visits affect the utilisation of perinatal services at the health facility."
