https://openalex.org/W1979012159,"Female song sparrows, primed with implants of estradiol, gave the solicitation display for copulation in response to acoustic stimulation with song. This technique demonstrated that female song sparrows respond more strongly to conspecific song than to alien songs, that they discriminate on the basis of both overall temporal pattern and syllabic structure, that they respond more to several song types than to repetitions of one song, and that they are most responsive to several song types if the songs are organized in bouts of a single type, as they are normally delivered by a male song sparrow. These results demonstrate a substantial correspondence between the structure and programming of the singing behavior of male birds and female responsiveness to song."

The adventitious shoots of four common boreal forest trees contain significantly higher concentrations of terpene and phenolic resins than the mature-growth-form twigs of the same species. These resins are experimentally shown to be repellent to snowshoe hares and appear to explain the avoidance of adventitious shoots by hares. The production of adventitious shoots after intense hare browsing and the avoidance of these shoots by hares may play an important role in the 10-year hare cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1984946091,"Several important groups of fungicides and insecticides are specific inhibitors of chitin synthesis in a Phycomyces enzyme system and in insect organ cultures. The recently discovered benzoylphenylurea insecticides, which prevent chitin synthesis in insect tissues, are apparently not direct-acting chitin synthetase inhibitors. These insecticides may prevent insect chitin synthesis by interfering with the proteolytic activation of the chitin synthetase zymogen."

Silicate measurements indicate that this flow usually consists of southern-source (Antarctic) bottom water. These measurements confirm the existence of a second and deeper western boundary flow that was earlier inferred from geological observations."
https://openalex.org/W2147418012,"Somatic hybrid plants of Nicotiana nesophila and N. stocktonii with N. tabacum (cultivated tobacco) were produced by protoplast fusion. These combinations cannot be achieved with conventional sexual hybridization, yet are important in that the wild Nicotiana species are resistant to numerous diseases. Hybridity was verified by chromosome number, isoenzyme analysis, morphological characteristics, and genetic behavior. Local lesion-type resistance to tobacco mosaic virus has been observed in leaves of these somatic hybrid plants."
https://openalex.org/W2087554970,"The origin of Indian corn remains controversial. Its closest wild relative is teosinte, with which it hybridizes freely to produce fertile progeny. Teosinte ears are smaller and simpler than those of corn. Searches for a more likely living ancestor have failed, but nine of its assumed pollen grains have been recovered in deep drillcore samples obtained from a stratum of soil under Mexico City, which is believed to antedate man in the Western Hemisphere. These nine largest grains are indistinguishable from pollen of modern corn. It has been assumed to be that of a postulated wild corn other than that of teosinte, but this does not account for the possibility that the pollen grains are those of a tetraploid teosinte-producing pollen with two sets of chromosomes. This likelihood has been examined by treating modern teosinte plants with colchicine, which induces tetraploidy. The result has been many teosinte pollen grains indistinguishable in size from modern corn. In interpreting thrs outcome it is important also to know that heat treatment of corn and other plants induces polyploidy, and that the deep drill-core pollen was recovered in a stratum of volcanic clay indicating the high temperature known to favor doubling of corn pollen volumes."

https://openalex.org/W2073288102,"Stromatoporoids are major contributors to framework construction in Paleozoic reefs. The Devonian species Parallellostroma densilaminata (Fagerstrom), P. winchelli (Galloway and Ehlers), and Stictostroma sp. form large rhythmically structured colonies that competitively overgrow corals. Their competitive interactions and important role as reef builders place considerable value on growth rate information. Identification of common growth periods in these interacting species provides a methodfor quantifying vertical and lateral stromatoporoid growth and a means for identifying an annual periodicity of calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2115178020,"The age of the universe based on abundances of isotopes is in the range 10 billion to 15 billion years. This is consistent with the age range 12 billion to 20 billion years calculated from the evolution of the oldest galactic stars. A third estimate of the age of the universe is based on the Hubble relation between the velocities of galaxies and their distances from us, where the inverse of the Hubble parameter H is a measure of the age of a uniformly expanding universe. Evidence that has been accumulating over the past few years indicates that the expansion of the universe may exhibit a rather large local perturbation due to the gravitational attraction of the Virgo supercluster. Different types of observations still produce conflicting evidence about the velocity with which the Local Group of galaxies (of which our Milky Way system is a member) is falling into the Virgo cluster. The results to date indicate that this velocity lies somewhere in the range 0 to 500 kilometers per second. The resulting ambiguity in the flow pattern for relatively nearby galaxies makes values of H derived from galaxies with radial velocities less than 2000 kilometers per second particularly uncertain, and this restricts determinations of H to distant galaxies, for which distances are particularly uncertain. The best that can be said at present is that Hâ€“1 yields a maximum time scale in the range 10 billion to 20 billion years."

https://openalex.org/W4255965514,"In the news story ""A firing over formaldehyde"" (News and Comment, 7 August 1981, p. 630), the subheadline attributed to Peter F. Infante (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) the position that formaldehyde is a human carcinogen whereas, in fact, his belief is that it is an animal carcinogen. The story also incorrectly reported that mobile home residents are exposed to levels of formaldehyde as high as 10 parts per million (column one, line 28, p. 631). According to a National Academy of Sciences report, the correct level is 4.2 parts per million."
