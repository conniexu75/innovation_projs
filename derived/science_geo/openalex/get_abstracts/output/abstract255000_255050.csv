https://openalex.org/W2142017607,"IL-17-producing T lymphocytes have been recently shown to comprise a distinct lineage of proinflammatory T helper cells, termed Th17 cells, that are major contributors to autoimmune disease. We show here that the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat is the key transcription factor that orchestrates the differentiation of this effector cell lineage. RORgammat induces transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and the related cytokine IL-17F in naïve CD4(+) T helper cells and is required for their expression in response to IL-6 and TGF-beta, the cytokines known to induce IL-17. Th17 cells are constitutively present throughout the intestinal lamina propria, express RORgammat, and are absent in mice deficient for RORgammat or IL-6. Mice with RORgammat-deficient T cells have attenuated autoimmune disease and lack tissue-infiltrating Th17 cells. Together, these studies suggest that RORgammat is a key regulator of immune homeostasis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2159793493,"We present rna22, a method for identifying microRNA binding sites and their corresponding heteroduplexes. Rna22 does not rely upon cross-species conservation, is resilient to noise, and, unlike previous methods, it first finds putative microRNA binding sites in the sequence of interest, then identifies the targeting microRNA. Computationally, we show that rna22 identifies most of the currently known heteroduplexes. Experimentally, with luciferase assays, we demonstrate average repressions of 30% or more for 168 of 226 tested targets. The analysis suggests that some microRNAs may have as many as a few thousand targets, and that between 74% and 92% of the gene transcripts in four model genomes are likely under microRNA control through their untranslated and amino acid coding regions. We also extended the method's key idea to a low-error microRNA-precursor-discovery scheme; our studies suggest that the number of microRNA precursors in mammalian genomes likely ranges in the tens of thousands."
https://openalex.org/W2133452478,"This paper reports the observation of quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state in a gaseous spinor Bose–Einstein condensate. The formation of ferromagnetic domains and domain walls is observed, and spin vortices (containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current) detected in situ. A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the exploration of quantum phases of matter—in particular, how the universal characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature. Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose–Einstein condensates1,2,3 (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current4."
https://openalex.org/W2021943756,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone critical for plant growth, development, and adaptation to various stress conditions. Plants have to adjust ABA levels constantly to respond to changing physiological and environmental conditions. To date, the mechanisms for fine-tuning ABA levels remain elusive. Here we report that AtBG1, a beta-glucosidase, hydrolyzes glucose-conjugated, biologically inactive ABA to produce active ABA. Loss of AtBG1 causes defective stomatal movement, early germination, abiotic stress-sensitive phenotypes, and lower ABA levels, whereas plants with ectopic AtBG1 accumulate higher ABA levels and display enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress. Dehydration rapidly induces polymerization of AtBG1, resulting in a 4-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Furthermore, diurnal increases in ABA levels are attributable to polymerization-mediated AtBG1 activation. We propose that the activation of inactive ABA pools by polymerized AtBG1 is a mechanism by which plants rapidly adjust ABA levels and respond to changing environmental cues."
https://openalex.org/W2103358704,"Many pathogenic organisms produce pore-forming toxins as virulence factors. Target cells however mount a response to such membrane damage. Here we show that toxin-induced membrane permeabilization leads to a decrease in cytoplasmic potassium, which promotes the formation of a multiprotein oligomeric innate immune complex, called the inflammasome, and the activation of caspase-1. Further, we find that when rendered proteolytic in this context caspase-1 induces the activation of the central regulators of membrane biogenesis, the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs), which in turn promote cell survival upon toxin challenge possibly by facilitating membrane repair. This study highlights that, in addition to its well-established role in triggering inflammation via the processing of the precursor forms of interleukins, caspase-1 has a broader role, in particular linking the intracellular ion composition to lipid metabolic pathways, membrane biogenesis, and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2066845053,"Type Ia supernovae are used as cosmological distance indicators. It is through them that the accelerating expansion of the Universe was detected, and with it the implied existence of dark energy. Their presumed reliability as 'standard candles' stems from the fact they have a fixed amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears 1.4 solar masses, the 'Chandrasekhar' mass. Howell et al. now show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb does not play by these rules: its exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy imply a super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. So future cosmological studies may need to consider possible contamination from such events when calculating distances. The high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy, which both imply a super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. The accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the need for dark energy, were inferred from observations1,2 of type Ia supernovae. There is a consensus that type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions that destroy carbon–oxygen white dwarf stars that have accreted matter from a companion star3, although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. These supernovae are thought to be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears the Chandrasekhar mass4 of 1.4 solar masses (M⊙). Here we show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae should occur preferentially in a young stellar population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that overluminous type Ia supernovae occur only in ‘young’ environments5,6. As this supernova does not obey the relations that allow type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as standard candles, and as no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology studies will have to consider possible contamination from such events."
https://openalex.org/W2073850595,"Ca(2+) binding to synaptotagmin 1 triggers fast exocytosis of synaptic vesicles that have been primed for release by SNARE-complex assembly. Besides synaptotagmin 1, fast Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis requires complexins. Synaptotagmin 1 and complexins both bind to assembled SNARE complexes, but it is unclear how their functions are coupled. Here we propose that complexin binding activates SNARE complexes into a metastable state and that Ca(2+) binding to synaptotagmin 1 triggers fast exocytosis by displacing complexin from metastable SNARE complexes. Specifically, we demonstrate that, biochemically, synaptotagmin 1 competes with complexin for SNARE-complex binding, thereby dislodging complexin from SNARE complexes in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Physiologically, increasing the local concentration of complexin selectively impairs fast Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis but retains other forms of SNARE-dependent fusion. The hypothesis that Ca(2+)-induced displacement of complexins from SNARE complexes triggers fast exocytosis accounts for the loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes of complexins and provides a molecular explanation for the high speed and synchronicity of fast Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2088970299,"Interruption of mTOR-dependent signaling by rapamycin is known to stimulate autophagy, both in mammalian cells and in yeast. Because activation of AMPK also inhibits mTOR-dependent signaling one would expect stimulation of autophagy by AMPK activation. According to the literature, this is true for yeast but, unexpectedly, not for mammalian cells on the basis of the use of AICAR, a pharmacological activator of AMPK. In the present study, carried out with hepatocytes, HT-29 cells, and HeLa cells, we have reexamined the possible role of AMPK in the control of mammalian autophagy. Inhibition of AMPK activity by compound C or by transfection with a dominant negative form of AMPK almost completely inhibited autophagy. These results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by AICAR is not related to its ability to activate AMPK. We conclude that in mammalian cells, as in yeast, AMPK is required for autophagy.

During macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a small part of the cytoplasm is sequestered by a double isolation membrane, presumably derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, to form an autophagosome. This autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome and the sequestered macromolecular material, including proteins, is degraded. The process is activated by various stress situations, including nutrient depletion. Under these conditions, autophagy provides the constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for survival (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 2Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). An example is that of the mammalian liver in which autophagy is accelerated during fasting to provide amino acids for gluconeogenesis to meet the energy requirements of the brain and of erythrocytes. In many cell types, including liver cells, autophagy is inhibited by amino acids, in synergy with insulin, and this inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by mTOR 3The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; AICAR, AICA riboside, imidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-ribofuranoside; ZMP, AICAR monophosphate; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; p70S6K, p70S6 kinase; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; CC, compound C; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; GFP, green fluorescent protein; gdw, gram dry weight of cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Met, metformin. -dependent signaling (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type and the conditions, other signaling pathways, such as the ras/raf/MAPK signaling pathway, may also participate in amino acid control of autophagy (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In addition, autophagy is controlled by phosphatidylinositol phospholipids. The process is inhibited by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the product of PI3K class I, a lipid kinase located upstream of mTOR in the insulin signaling pathway. By contrast, PI(3)P, the product of PI3K class III, is essential for autophagy (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 3Kihara A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). This requirement for PI(3)P explains why PI3K inhibitors are also autophagy inhibitors. Indeed, the classical autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (5Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) turned out to be a PI3K inhibitor (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). After the original observation in 1995 that amino acids can stimulate mTOR-dependent signaling (6Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), it is now generally accepted that the mTOR pathway acts as a sensor of amino acids (7Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). A few years ago we, and others, discovered that mTOR can also sense changes in the cellular energy state via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of this protein kinase inhibits mTOR-dependent signaling and inhibits protein synthesis (8Meijer A.J. Dubbelhuis P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which is consistent with AMPK function of switching off ATP-dependent processes (9Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Inhibition of mTOR by AMPK, like that caused by addition of rapamycin (1Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 2Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar), may be expected to increase autophagy. However, in the literature there is controversy on this issue. In yeast, activation of AMPK stimulates autophagy (10Wang Z. Wilson W.A. Fujino M.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5742-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of AMPK by addition of the cell-permeable nucleotide analogue AICA riboside (AICAR) in hepatocytes strongly inhibits autophagy (11Samari H.R. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23758-23763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the present study, using different mammalian cell types, we have examined the possible role of AMPK in the control of autophagy in more detail. Our data indicate that AMPK, like in yeast, is required for autophagy. Cell culture products were from Invitrogen. Insulin, rapamycin, AICAR (AICA riboside, imidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-ribofuranoside), the chemicals for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), BCA kits, Ponceau red, metformin and protease inhibitors mixture were from Sigma.

The FuGENE 6™ transfection kit was from Roche Applied Science (Basel, Switzerland) and the Lipofectamine™ 2000 was from Invitrogen. l-[U-14C]Valine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and l-valine was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultima Gold™ scintillation fluid was from Packard Biosciences. Phosphospecific antibodies against protein kinase B (Ser473), AMPK (Thr172), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser79) were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Leusden, The Netherlands).

Minty (Sanofi Elf Biorecherche, Labege, France). Rapamycin and compound C were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final Me2SO concentration did not exceed 0.25% (v/v), which did not affect the processes that were studied. cDNAs encoding the c-Myc-tagged constitutively active AMPK-α1312 (T172D) (AMPKCA) and the c-Myc-tagged dominant-negative-AMPK-α1 (K45R) (AMPKDN) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Carling (Cellular Stress Group, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK). cDNA encoding for the GFP-tagged LKB1 was a generous gift from Dr M. Billaud (CNRS UMR 5201, Lyon, France). cDNA encoding for FLAG-tagged STRAD (12Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. H. C. Clevers (Utrecht, The Netherlands). Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats (250–300 g) starved for 16–20 h by collagenase perfusion (6Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (5 mg dry weight/ml) were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in minimal medium (Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer plus 10 mm Na+-Hepes, pH 7.4, and 20 mm glucose) plus the components as indicated in the legends. The final incubation volume was 2 ml. The gas atmosphere was O2/CO2 (19:1, v/v). At the end of the incubations, hepatocytes were collected for gel analysis by centrifugation in 5 volumes of an ice-cold solution of 150 mm NaCl plus 10 mm sodium Hepes (pH 7.4) for 5 s in an Eppendorf centrifuge. For the SDS-PAGE procedures, the pellet was lysed by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and subsequently incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. For determination of ATP, lactate, and amino acids, an aliquot of the incubated cell suspension was acidified with HClO4 (final concentration, 3%, m/v). After removal of the precipitated protein by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (1 min; 10,000 × g), the clear supernatant was neutralized to pH 7 with a small volume of a mixture of 2 m KOH plus 0.3 m MOPS. HT-29 human colon cancer cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Medium was replaced three times per week, and cells were passaged at confluency. The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C. Cells were plated and grown to 50–80% confluency before treatment for different times with vehicle or adequate concentrations of amino acids (4×), rapamycin (100 nm), metformin (1–10 mm), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (10 mm), IL-13 (30 ng/ml), and AICAR (0.1–1 mm). ATP was determined fluorimetrically with NADP+, glucose, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (13Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 200-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lactate was measured spectrophotometrically with NAD+ and lactate dehydrogenase (13Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 200-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AICAR and ZMP were measured by HPLC as described by Samari and Seglen (11Samari H.R. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23758-23763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The expression constructs pEGFP-C1-LKB1wt, pcDNA3-FLAG-STRAD, pcDNA3-Myc-AMPKCA, pcDNA3-Myc-AMPKDN, and control vectors were introduced into HT-29 cells and HeLa cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 and the FuGENE 6™ Reagent transfection kit, respectively. Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 48 h before use for the different experiments. Expression levels of each construct were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis using the relevant Tag antibody. After SDS-PAGE resolution, the proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 100 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (diluted in TBST-5% BSA), followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution in TBST-5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-actin was used at 1:2500 dilution in TBST-5% BSA. All other total antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution in TBST-5% BSA, and anti-phosphoantibodies were diluted at 1:1000 in TBST-1% BSA. The anti-c-Myc were used at 1:200 dilution in TBST-5% BSA. The anti-FLAG was used at 1:1000 dilution. To quantify the different spots of immunoblotting, we used the freeware Scion Imaging. Amino Acid Analysis—Amino acids were analyzed with HPLC exactly as described by (14Wu G.Y. Bazer F.W. Tuo W.B. Flynn S.P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Of the branched chain amino acids, the valine peak in the amino acid spectrum was contaminated with a compound of unknown origin, and was therefore not used. [14C]Chloroquine Accumulation—Accumulation of the divalent weak base chloroquine, which monitors changes in the pH of intracellular acidic compartments, mainly lysosomes, was measured exactly as described elsewhere (15Luiken J.J. Aerts J.M. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the hepatocyte concentration was 1 mg dw/ml, the concentration of chloroquine was <1 μm and the amount of radioactivity was 0.025 μCi/ml of incubation medium. Measurement of the Degradation of Long-lived Proteins— Proteolysis was determined as described previously (16Pattingre S. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16667-16674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 0.05 μCi/ml of l-[U-14C]valine. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were incubated in complete medium, supplemented with 10 mm cold valine throughout the pre-chase period. After 1 h of pre-chase, the medium was removed by three rinses with PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS+) and a complete mixture of amino acids in which each amino acid was present at four times its concentration in the portal vein of a 24-h-fasted rat (for composition, see (6Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar)), rapamycin (100 nm), metformin (2 mm), AICAR (250 μm), 3-MA (10 mm), or IL-13 (30 ng/ml) in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in the absence of fetal calf serum), HBSS or Hanks balanced saline solution, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine were added at the beginning of the chase period. During the prechase, the short-lived proteins were being degraded. The chase continued for 4 h. Cells and radiolabeled proteins from the 4-h chase medium were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10% (w/v) at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, pellets were dissolved in 0.2 n NaOH. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein degradation was calculated by dividing the acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and medium by the radioactivity contained in the precipitated proteins from both cells and medium. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) Staining—MDC staining was performed as previously described (17Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18384-18391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on microscope coverglasses. After 3 days, cells were treated for 2 h in appropriate mediums, and during the last 10 min 0.1 μm MDC was added. Cells were then washed by three rinses with PBS+ and fixed with a solution of 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The microscope cover glasses were washed again by three rinses with PBS+, and put on microscope slides with Mowiol. The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C and observed in the epifluorescence microscope. Only cells expressing GFP-LKB1 were counted for MDC staining. Statistics—Data were summarized as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Effect of Pharmacological Modulators of AMPK Activity on Autophagic Proteolysis in Isolated Rat Hepatocytes—When hepatocytes are incubated in the absence of amino acids, autophagic proteolytic flux is maximal. As previously reported in Ref. 11Samari H.R. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23758-23763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, addition of the AMPK activator AICAR under these conditions strongly inhibited autophagy, as indicated by the large reduction in the appearance of the branched chain amino acids isoleucine and leucine (which are not further catabolized in rat liver) (Fig. 1, A and B). This was also accompanied by reductions in the major gluconeogenic amino acids aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, and alanine (Fig. 1, C–F). It should be stressed that these experiments were carried out in the presence of a low concentration of cycloheximide (10 μm) to prevent reincorporation of the proteolytically formed amino acids into protein. The inhibition of proteolysis by AICAR was similar to that observed with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and also to that observed with the acidotropic agent methylamine, which inhibits lysosomal function by raising the lysosomal pH (Fig. 1, A and B). Administration of the antidiabetic agent metformin is another way to stimulate AMPK activity (18Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar). The effects of AICAR and metformin on AMPK phosphorylation are compared in Fig. 2. In the presence of AICAR (250 μm), phosphorylation of AMPK was rapid but decreased after 40 min, presumably because continuous intracellular accumulation of ZMP results in ZMP levels high enough to inhibit AMPK (19Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of 2 mm metformin, AMPK phosphorylation was initially slow (at 40 min it was similar to that seen with AICAR at 20 min) and increased with time to a maximum at 80 min. Even though 2 mm metformin was more potent than AICAR in stimulating AMPK phosphorylation, the ability of metformin to inhibit autophagic production of the branched-chain amino acids was less than that observed with AICAR (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, production of glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate was not significantly affected by metformin while that of alanine was even substantially increased (Fig. 1, C–F), presumably because glycolytic flux increased in the presence of metformin (see below). While AICAR and metformin are AMPK activators, we also wanted to study the effect of inhibition of AMPK activity on autophagy. Compound C has been reported as a specific inhibitor of AMPK (18Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar), and we examined its efficacy in this regard. Metformin-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK was reversed by compound C (Fig. 3). Compound C did not inhibit AICAR-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation unless amino acids were also present (Fig. 4) (see “Discussion”). The same was true for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is a substrate for AMPK (Fig. 4). It was shown previously that compound C, in addition to its action as an inhibitor of AMPK (18Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4472) Google Scholar), can also inhibit AMPK activity by competing with AICAR transport across the plasma membrane, thus affecting intracellular conversion of AICAR to ZMP (20Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in Table 1 showing that 40 μm compound C partly inhibited both AICAR consumption and ZMP production. Interestingly, ZMP formation was also inhibited by amino acid addition, but in this case without significant effect on AICAR consumption so that the amino acid effect must have been intracellular rather than at the level of AICAR transport. The presence of both compound C and amino acids inhibited ZMP production by about 90% (Table 1). This accounts for the low AMPK phosphorylation and AMPK activity, as indicated by acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation (Fig. 4), under these conditions (see further “Discussion”).FIGURE 4Effect of AICAR, compound C, and rapamycin on the phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, p70S6k, and protein kinase B, in the absence and presence of amino acids in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were incubated with 20 mm glucose for 100 min in the absence or presence of 250 μm AICAR, 100 nm rapamycin, or 40 μm CC, or combinations thereof. A complete mixture of amino acids (21Dubbelhuis P.F. Meijer A.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (AA), if present, was added at 30 min. Insulin (10–7 m), if present, was added 5 min before the end of the incubation. eIF4E was used to check for the loading of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Inhibition by compound C and by amino acids of ZMP production from AICAR in hepatocytes-ΔAICARZMPμmol/gdwμmol/gdwControl37.1 ± 1.824.2 ± 1.44AA40.5 ± 2.110.6 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 versus control.CC25.5 ± 1.8ap < 0.05 versus control.11.6 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus control.4AA + CC27.9 ± 2.3ap < 0.05 versus control.3.6 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 versus control.a p < 0.05 versus control. Open table in a new tab AICAR inhibited amino acid-stimulated, rapamycin-sensitive, phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, in agreement with our earlier observations (21Dubbelhuis P.F. Meijer A.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This effect was largely prevented by 40 μm compound C (Fig. 4). AICAR alone slightly stimulated p70S6 kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 4), in agreement with the data of Moller et al. (22Moller M.T. Samari H.R. Seglen P.O. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 82: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) who showed that this phosphorylation was rapamycin-insensitive. Having thus established that compound C can inhibit AMPK activity in intact hepatocytes, whether by a direct effect on the enzyme or indirectly by competing with AICAR for transport into the cells (20Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we tested its effect on autophagy. If AMPK activation inhibits autophagy as suggested (11Samari H.R. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23758-23763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), one would expect compound C to be able to reverse the inhibition of autophagy by metformin. Unexpectedly, however, compound C inhibited autophagic proteolysis when added alone and the effect was not additive with either that of metformin, AICAR, or 3-methyladenine (Fig. 1, A and B). To rule out the possibility that compound C inhibited the lysosomal proton pump, we tested its effect on the intracellular accumulation of [14C]chloroquine, a divalent weak base, which when present at low concentrations greatly accumulates in acidic intracellular compartments, mainly lysosomes (15Luiken J.J. Aerts J.M. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a control, the effect of 5 mm methylamine was also tested. Chloroquine accumulation was not affected by compound C (Fig. 5), but methylamine greatly reduced it, as expected. AICAR significantly decreased chloroquine accumulation although not to the same extent as methylamine, whereas metformin had no significant effect. We also examined whether variations in glycolysis were in some way associated with the observed changes in autophagic proteolysis, but this was not the case. Omission of glucose did not affect autophagic proteolysis (Fig. 1, A and B) and lactate was not formed under these conditions (Fig. 1G). ATP levels and AMPK phosphorylation were not affected by glucose depletion (not shown), presumably because mitochondrial oxidation of endogenous fatty acids provided sufficient energy. Metformin stimulated, while both AICAR and 3-methyladenine strongly inhibited production of lactate; compound C, on the other hand, had no effect on lactate formation (Fig. 1G). The effect of metformin on the production of lactate is consistent with the ability of this compound to act as a weak inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (23Leverve X.M. Guigas B. Detaille D. Batandier C. Koceir E.A. Chauvin C. Fontaine E. Wiernsperger N.F. Diabetes Metab. 2003; 29: 6S88-6S94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed a decrease in intracellular ATP levels from 11.2 ± 0.9 to 6.2 ± 0.2 μmol/g dry weight of cells after 90 min of incubation in the presence of 2 mm metformin (n = 5; p < 0.05) (data not shown). The inhibition of glycolysis by AICAR and 3-methyladenine is in agreement with previous observations in hepatocytes (25Caro L.H. Plomp P.J. Wolvetang E.J. Kerkhof C. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Vincent M.F. Bontemps F. Van den Berghe G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the course of our experiments, we noted that AICAR inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase B, which was prevented by amino acids but not by compound C (Fig. 4). These data indicate that, in addition to activating AMPK, AICAR may have other effects (see “Discussion”). Inhibition of AMPK Activity Blocks Autophagic Proteolysis in Human Cell Lines—We have previously shown that autophagic proteolysis is stimulated when the human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells are incubated in nutrient-free medium (4Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Pilot experiments showed that metformin and AICAR were able to activate AMPK in HT-29 cells, as determined by its phosphorylation at position Thr172 and phosphorylation of its substrate ACC at position Ser79, with a maximal effect at 250 μm AICAR and 2 mm metformin (Fig. 6A and data not shown). Whatever the concentration used, cell viability was greater than 95% under the experimental conditions used in this study. Following on with these results, we next investigated the effect of AICAR and metformin on the degradation of long-lived [14C]valine-labeled proteins. Both compounds inhibited the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled proteins in nutrient-free medium to the same extent (Fig. 6B). However, only a partial inhibition of proteolysis was observed when compared with 3-MA, amino acids or interleukin 13, known inhibitors of autophagic proteolysis in HT-29 cells (4Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). To correlate these findings with the state of AMPK activation, HT-29 cells were transfected with a constitutively active form of AMPK (AMPKCA). As previously shown (27Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), AMPK activity was increased, as determined here by the phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate ACC, in cells expressing AMPKCA (Fig. 7A). Next, we have analyzed the rate of degradation of long-lived [14C]valine-labeled proteins in cells expressing AMPKCA. As shown in Fig. 7B, the rate of degradation of long-lived [14C]valine-labeled proteins and its sensitivity to autophagy inhibitors were similar to that observed in untransfected HT-29 cells (Fig. 6B) and in cells transfected with an empty vector (data not shown) when incubated in nutrient-free medium. From these findings we reasoned that the inhibition of AMPK activity should inhibit the rate of autophagic proteolysis in cells incubated in nutrient-free medium. For this purpose, we used two approaches. In a first approach, cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding a dominant-negative form of AMPK (AMPKDN). In a second approach, cells were treated with compound C. According to previous results (27Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarch"

https://openalex.org/W2061376674,"A new survey of the Greenland ice sheet using fluctuations in the gravitational field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites reveals a dramatic acceleration in the rate of loss of ice mass. There was a more-than twofold increase in the rate of mass loss during May 2004–April 2006, relative to the two previous years. This acceleration occurred mainly in the southern part of the ice sheet. These findings are in line with an independent analysis of the GRACE data and with recent suggestions that the ice sheet responds more quickly to climate perturbations than previously thought. In 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected the contribution to sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet to be between -0.02 and +0.09 m from 1990 to 2100 (ref. 1). However, recent work2,3,4 has suggested that the ice sheet responds more quickly to climate perturbations than previously thought, particularly near the coast. Here we use a satellite gravity survey by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) conducted from April 2002 to April 2006 to provide an independent estimate of the contribution of Greenland ice mass loss to sea level change. We detect an ice mass loss of 248 ± 36 km3 yr-1, equivalent to a global sea level rise of 0.5 ± 0.1 mm yr-1. The rate of ice loss increased by 250 per cent between the periods April 2002 to April 2004 and May 2004 to April 2006, almost entirely due to accelerated rates of ice loss in southern Greenland; the rate of mass loss in north Greenland was almost constant. Continued monitoring will be needed to identify any future changes in the rate of ice loss in Greenland."

https://openalex.org/W1974550153,"Entanglement is recognized as a key resource for quantum computation and quantum cryptography. For quantum metrology, the use of entangled states has been discussed and demonstrated as a means of improving the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, entangled states have been used in experiments for efficient quantum state detection and for the measurement of scattering lengths. In quantum information processing, manipulation of individual quantum bits allows for the tailored design of specific states that are insensitive to the detrimental influences of an environment. Such 'decoherence-free subspaces' (ref. 10) protect quantum information and yield significantly enhanced coherence times. Here we use a decoherence-free subspace with specifically designed entangled states to demonstrate precision spectroscopy of a pair of trapped Ca+ ions; we obtain the electric quadrupole moment, which is of use for frequency standard applications. We find that entangled states are not only useful for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in frequency measurements--a suitably designed pair of atoms also allows clock measurements in the presence of strong technical noise. Our technique makes explicit use of non-locality as an entanglement property and provides an approach for 'designed' quantum metrology."

Autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a secreted signaling molecule originally identified in studies of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, regulates quorum-sensing responses and allows communication between different bacterial species. AI-2 signal transduction in V. harveyi requires the integral membrane receptor LuxPQ, comprised of periplasmic binding protein (LuxP) and histidine sensor kinase (LuxQ) subunits. Combined X-ray crystallographic and functional studies show that AI-2 binding causes a major conformational change within LuxP, which in turn stabilizes a quaternary arrangement in which two LuxPQ monomers are asymmetrically associated. We propose that formation of this asymmetric quaternary structure is responsible for repressing the kinase activity of both LuxQ subunits and triggering the transition of V. harveyi into quorum-sensing mode.

We propose that formation of this asymmetric quaternary structure is responsible for repressing the kinase activity of both LuxQ subunits and triggering the transition of V. harveyi into quorum-sensing mode. Quorum sensing is a bacterial cell-cell communication process driven by secreted signaling molecules called autoinducers (Waters and Bassler, 2005Waters C.M. Bassler B.L. Quorum sensing: cell-to-cell communication in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar). At low cell density, in the absence of appreciable amounts of autoinducers, bacteria act as individuals. At high cell density, bacteria respond to the accumulation of autoinducers by synchronizing the gene expression of the community. Thus, quorum sensing allows groups of bacteria to act in unison. Typically, acylated homoserine lactones are used by Gram-negative bacteria, and modified oligopeptides are used by Gram-positive bacteria, as autoinducers. A quorum-sensing signal called autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is unusual both in its chemical structure (a furanosyl borate diester), and in that it is produced and detected by many different species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, allowing interspecies cell-cell communication (Bassler et al., 1993Bassler B.L.

Interference with AI-2-mediated bacterial cell-cell communication.Nature. 2005; 437: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). AI-2 signaling has been most extensively studied in Vibrio harveyi (Pappas et al., 2004Pappas K.M. Weingart C.L. Winans S.C.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). V. harveyi is a bioluminescent marine bacterium that controls light production, as well as other behaviors, through quorum sensing (Bassler et al., 1993Bassler B.L. Wright M. Showalter R.E.

Quorum sensing regulates type III secretion in Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3794-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The V. harveyi AI-2 receptor is composed of two polypeptides, LuxP and LuxQ (Bassler et al., 1994Bassler B.L. Wright M. Silverman M.R. Multiple signalling systems controlling expression of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi: sequence and function of genes encoding a second sensory pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). LuxP is a periplasmic binding protein that binds AI-2 by clamping it between two domains (Chen et al., 2002Chen X. Schauder S. Potier N. Van Dorsselaer A. Pelczer I. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Structural identification of a bacterial quorum-sensing signal containing boron.Nature. 2002; 415: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), whereas LuxQ is an integral membrane protein of the two-component sensor kinase family (Bassler et al., 1994Bassler B.L. Wright M. Silverman M.R. Multiple signalling systems controlling expression of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi: sequence and function of genes encoding a second sensory pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The periplasmic domain of LuxQ associates with LuxP (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region of LuxQ includes both a histidine kinase domain and a receiver domain. Although not previously demonstrated, it is likely that LuxQ, similar to other two-component sensor kinases, is constitutively dimeric (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar). At low cell density, when AI-2 concentrations are low, LuxPQ acts as a kinase, autophosphorylating a conserved histidine that lies within the LuxQ histidine kinase domain (Figure 1, left). This phosphoryl group is shuttled sequentially from the histidine to an aspartic acid residue in the LuxQ receiver domain, then to a histidine in the phosphotransferase protein LuxU, and finally to an aspartic acid in the transcriptional regulator LuxO (Freeman and Bassler, 1999aFreeman J.A. Bassler B.L. A genetic analysis of the function of LuxO, a two-component response regulator involved in quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi.Mol.

Sequence and function of LuxU: a two-component phosphorelay protein that regulates quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LuxO phosphate represses quorum-sensing responses by repressing production of the transcription factor LuxR (Lenz et al., 2004Lenz D.H. Mok K.C. Lilley B.N. Kulkarni R.V. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L. The small RNA chaperone Hfq and multiple small RNAs control quorum sensing in Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio cholerae.Cell. 2004; 118: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). By contrast, when cell population density— and hence AI-2 concentration— is high, the binding of AI-2 to the LuxPQ receptor appears to switch it from a kinase to a phosphatase (Figure 1, right). As a consequence, the concentration of LuxO-phosphate declines and quorum-sensing responses are derepressed. Autoinducer-1 (AI-1), an acyl homoserine lactone that serves as a species-specific quorum-sensing signal, also regulates the levels of LuxO phosphate, but through a distinct two-component sensor kinase, LuxN (Bassler et al., 1993Bassler B.L.

We previously determined the structures of LuxP bound to AI-2 and of a complex containing LuxP and the periplasmic domain of LuxQ (LuxPQp) without bound AI-2 (Chen et al., 2002Chen X. Schauder S.

Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here, we present crystal structures of the isolated periplasmic domain of LuxQ (LuxQp) and of LuxPQp bound to AI-2. These structures reveal ligand-induced conformational changes resulting in strikingly asymmetric (LuxPQp)2 dimers. To examine the functional significance of these structural observations, we performed extensive in vivo genetic analyses. Our results are consistent with a model in which alteration in the quaternary arrangement of LuxPQ periplasmic domains plays a pivotal role in determining the level of cytoplasmic kinase activity. These findings also provide a mechanism for coupling ligand binding by a periplasmic binding protein to two-component signal transduction across the bacterial membrane. Genetic, biochemical, and structural evidence from many two-component sensor kinases suggests that the members of this family function in vivo as dimers (Khorchid and Ikura, 2006Khorchid A. Ikura M. Bacterial histidine kinase as signal sensor and transducer.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar). Although we have not been able to isolate full-length LuxQ protein, the histidine kinase dimerization domain itself is indeed dimeric, as judged by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (R.C.K., B. Kokona, R. Fairman, and F.M.H., unpublished data). To determine whether LuxQ functions as a dimer in vivo, we attempted to “poison” wild-type LuxQ by introducing inactive LuxQ mutants, predicting a dominant negative effect if LuxQ, like other sensor kinases, functions by trans-phosphorylation within homodimers (Heermann et al., 1998Heermann R.

To achieve precise control over AI-2 concentration, we used a strain lacking the AI-2 synthase, LuxS. AI-2 was generated in situ by adding boric acid and synthetically prepared 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentane dione (DPD), which combine to form V. harveyi AI-2 (Miller et al., 2004Miller S.T. Xavier K.B.

An expeditious synthesis of DPD and boron binding studies.Org. Lett. 2005; 7: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To avoid the confounding effects of AI-1 signaling, we deleted the gene encoding the AI-1 receptor LuxN (see Figure 1). The control experiment (Figure 2A[a], left bar) shows that the luxN−, luxPQ+, luxS− strain is dark in the absence of AI-2 because LuxQ functions as a kinase, repressing bioluminescence. In the presence of AI-2, the strain is bright because LuxQ kinase activity is inhibited, derepressing bioluminescence (Figure 2A[a], right bar). To assay dimerization, we introduced a truncated LuxQ (residues 1–704) lacking an intact histidine kinase catalytic domain as well as the receiver domain. LuxQ1–704 was dominant negative for kinase activity, conferring a bright (kinase-off) phenotype in the presence and absence of AI-2 (Figure 2A[b]). Thus, the kinase activity of wild-type LuxQ is poisoned by coexpression of truncated LuxQ, and we conclude that kinase activity requires dimers (or conceivably higher-order oligomers) of wild-type LuxQ. We observed a slight residual AI-2 responsiveness in Figure 2A[b], which we attribute to a small proportion of wild-type LuxQ dimers. We note that LuxN kinase activity is dominant over LuxQ1–704. Thus, the effect of LuxQ1–704 on bioluminescence is due to poisoned LuxQ dimers and not to nonspecific interactions with LuxN or other signaling components. LuxQ functions in conjunction with the periplasmic AI-2 binding protein LuxP. Previously, we showed that LuxP and LuxQ are constitutively associated (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the entire periplasmic domain of the LuxPQ receptor is dispensible for kinase activity. For these experiments, we engineered a V. harveyi strain lacking the AI-1 receptor (LuxN), the AI-2 receptor (LuxPQ), and the AI-2 synthase (LuxS). This strain (FED119), because it lacks both LuxN and LuxQ kinases, is bright (Figure 2B, vector). Introduction of wild-type LuxPQ on a plasmid restores AI-2 responsiveness (Figure 2B[a]). Introduction of LuxQ only, without LuxP, produces a dark (kinase-on) phenotype (Figure 2B[c]), confirming the earlier finding that LuxQ is intrinsically a kinase (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Introduction of LuxP in combination with LuxQΔp, a LuxQ deletion lacking the entire periplasmic domain, also generates a dark (kinase-on) phenotype (Figure 2B[d]). Thus, removing either LuxP or the periplasmic domain of LuxQ results in a constitutively active LuxQ kinase, demonstrating that no part of the periplasmic region is needed for kinase activity. Taken together, these results strongly imply that the function of the periplasmic region of LuxPQ is to shut off kinase activity in response to AI-2. We also tested whether LuxQ displays phosphatase activity and, if so, whether this activity is regulated by AI-2. To facilitate examination of LuxQ phosphatase activity, we eliminated its kinase function by changing His-492, the presumed target of the kinase reaction, to alanine. As expected, cells bearing LuxQH492A were bright (kinase-off; Figure 2B[e]). This construct enabled us to test whether LuxQH492A possesses phosphatase activity because we could exploit the unusual circuitry of the AI-1/AI-2 pathways, driving phosphoryl groups in with LuxN and testing whether various LuxQ constructs could pull them out (Figure 2C, left panel). Introduction of LuxQH492A into a luxN+, luxPQ−, luxS+ strain caused an approximately 40-fold increase in light production (Figure 2C, compare vector and [e]), demonstrating that LuxQH492A is capable of acting as a phosphatase and counteracting the AI-1-pathway-driven accumulation of LuxO phosphate. The LuxQH492A phosphatase activity is insensitive to the presence or absence of AI-2 or LuxP (Figure 2[e and f ]). Therefore, the phosphatase activity of LuxQ does not appear to be regulated by AI-2. This phosphatase activity resides within the receiver domain of LuxQ since expression of the receiver domain alone (Figure 2C[g] had essentially the same effect as expression of full-length LuxQH492A. Overall, these findings reinforce the conclusion that the periplasmic domain of LuxPQ functions to bind AI-2 and shut off kinase activity. Our results indicate that the functional unit for LuxPQ is the (LuxPQ)2 dimer. The periplasmic domains cannot be essential for dimerization, however, because they are dispensible for kinase activity, which requires dimerization (Figure 2B). Indeed, no evidence of an interaction between LuxPQ periplasmic domains has been reported. To investigate further, we performed dynamic light-scattering experiments on the purified periplasmic domain of LuxPQ (LuxPQp) in the presence and absence of AI-2. To our surprise, these measurements suggested that AI-2 binding promotes dimerization of the periplasmic domain (i.e., formation of [LuxPQp]2). The hydrodynamic radius (RH), a measure of molecular size and shape, was 3.4 ± 0.1 nm in the absence of AI-2 but increased to 3.8 ± 0.1 nm in the presence of AI-2. While the RH of unliganded LuxPQp is in excellent agreement with calculations based on the crystal structure (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the RH after AI-2 addition is significantly larger. The measured value (3.8 nm) is intermediate between those predicted for LuxPQp monomers (3.4 nm) and (LuxPQp)2 dimers (∼4.3 nm) and probably reflects an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers. After deleting five residues from the N terminus of LuxP, a modification shown to stabilize the AI-2 bound state in vivo (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), liganded LuxPQp displayed a hydrodynamic radius of 4.0 ± 0.1 nm. These experiments, while preliminary, provided the first indication that AI-2 binding promotes interaction between the periplasmic regions of a (LuxPQ)2 dimer. We note that the interaction between AI-2 bound periplasmic domains could be much stronger in vivo if, as seems likely, the domains were held in proximity and oriented relative to one another by dimeric interactions occurring elsewhere in LuxQ. If indeed the periplasmic domains of LuxPQ dimerize upon AI-2 binding, it is of interest both to determine the structure of these dimers and to evaluate their physiological significance. As a first step, we crystallized AI-2 bound LuxPQp, after first deleting five residues from the N terminus of LuxP (see above). Crystals were improved by deleting, from the termini of LuxQp, those residues that were poorly ordered in the previously determined AI-2-free LuxPQp crystal structure (Neiditch et al., 2005Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Regulation of LuxPQ receptor activity by the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The 2.3 Å resolution structure (Figures 3A–3C) was determined using phases obtained by molecular replacement (see Experimental Procedures, as well as Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The structure indeed contains two similar LuxPQp complexes, as discussed below. We also crystallized LuxQp alone and determined its structure to 1.7 Å resolution (Table S1). Comparing AI-2-free and AI-2 bound structures of the LuxPQp receptor reveals that the LuxP subunit, as anticipated, undergoes a major conformation change upon ligand binding (Figure 3D). The observed domain closure is similar to that observed for other periplasmic binding proteins binding to their ligands (Bjorkman and Mowbray, 1998Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. Multiple open forms of ribose-binding protein trace the path of its conformational change.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Miller et al., 2004Miller S.T. Xavier K.B. Campagna S.R. Taga M.E. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Salmonella typhimurium recognizes a chemically distinct form of the bacterial quorum-sensing signal AI-2.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large movements within LuxP, the LuxQp subunit undergoes only minor conformational changes upon AI-2 binding (Figure 3E). Indeed, in three separate crystal structures—LuxQp alone, LuxQp complexed with unliganded LuxP, and LuxQp complexed with ligand bound LuxP—LuxQp displayed almost identical tertiary structures (rms d for Cα carbons = 0.7–1.0 Å for all pairwise comparisons). Thus, although LuxP undergoes a major conformational change upon binding AI-2, this change is apparently not transmitted to the periplasmic domain of the histidine sensor kinase subunit LuxQ. Furthermore, within each LuxPQp receptor, the subunit interface between LuxP and LuxQp is relatively unchanged. The most striking effect of AI-2 binding observed in the crystal structures is the induction of LuxPQp-LuxPQp dimerization (Figures 3A–3C). Crystals grown in the presence of AI-2 contain two LuxPQp monomers per asymmetric unit, denoted LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′. LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′ are related to one another by an approximately 140° rotation around an axis between them (Figure 3C). Nearest the rotation axis lie the two LuxQp subunits, interacting with one another, while the two AI-2 bound LuxP subunits are situated more peripherally. Importantly, the four LuxQp termini, each of which would be attached to a transmembrane anchor in vivo, are located close to one another on the same face of the LuxPQp-LuxP′Qp′ dimer (Figure 3A). This observation suggests that the LuxPQp-LuxP′Qp′ dimer observed crystallographically is plausible topologically and that, in vivo, the face containing all four LuxQp termini would be oriented toward the bacterial inner membrane. Formation of LuxPQp-LuxP′Qp′ dimers coincides with the formation of a large, asymmetric interface between LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′ (Figures 3B and 3C). When LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′ interact, 4176 Å2 of previously solvent accessible surface area is buried; 60% of this total is attributable to a new interface between LuxP and LuxQp′. The new LuxP-LuxQp′ interaction appears to be triggered by the closure of the LuxP subunit around AI-2, which creates a new surface to which LuxQp′ binds (Figure 3D). As a result, LuxP interacts with both LuxQp and LuxQp′. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments (below) identified a set of four LuxP residues important for LuxQp′ binding: Thr138, Arg139, Phe143, and Trp167 (see Figure 4A, lower left panel). All four residues (red in Figure 3D) lie in the LuxP domain that rotates 29° (relative to the remainder of LuxPQp) upon AI-2 binding. This rotation is essential to make room for LuxQp′; without it, LuxQp′ would clash sterically with LuxQp and therefore be unable to bind LuxP. The AI-2 bound (LuxPQp)2 dimer is strongly asymmetric: LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′ are related by a 140° rotation (Figure 3C). In a symmetric complex, LuxPQp and LuxP′Qp′ would be related by a 180° rotation, so the magnitude of the observed asymmetry can be thought of as 40°. Because of this asymmetry, LuxP′ and LuxQp are separated by approximately 10 Å and make no direct contact with one another (Figure 3C, bottom left). The large asymmetry in the AI-2 bound configuration is likely important in the inhibition of kinase activity. To test whether the LuxPQp-LuxP′Qp′ interface observed crystallographically in the presence of AI-2 is important for signal transduction in vivo, we systematically substituted interfacial residues with alanine. Nine alanine substitutions were made (one at a time) in LuxP, and 20 alanine substitutions were made in LuxQ (Table 1). The genes encoding each mutant AI-2 receptor were introduced into V. harveyi FED119, and, in all cases, normal levels of the mutant LuxP and LuxQ subunits were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). To evaluate the in vivo activity of the mutant receptors, bioluminescence was measured as a function of autoinducer concentration. Although 17 of the alanine substitutions (gray in Figure 4A) did not cause a significant change in AI-2 responsiveness, all but one of the remaining 12 alanine substitutions (red in Figure 4A) desensitized the cells to AI-2 (Figure 4B). The single sensitizing mutation (L59A; green in Figure 4A) is discussed below. The proportion of alanine substitutions causing a significant phenotype (about 40%) is typical for large protein:protein interfaces (see, for example, Bogan and Thorn, 1998Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2149063573,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate cellular responses to a variety of stimuli, but how specific responses are regulated has been elusive, as the types of GPCRs vastly outnumber the classes of G protein heterotrimers available to initiate downstream signaling. In our analysis of signaling proteins containing DEP domains ( approximately 90 residue sequence motifs first recognized in fly Dishevelled, worm EGL-10, and mammalian Pleckstrin), we find that DEP domains are responsible for specific recognition of GPCRs. We examined the yeast regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein Sst2 and demonstrate that the DEP domains in Sst2 mediate binding to its cognate GPCR (Ste2). DEP-domain-mediated tethering promotes downregulation by placing the RGS protein in proximity to its substrate (receptor-activated Galpha subunit). Sst2 docks to the Ste2 cytosolic tail, but only its unphosphorylated state, allowing for release and recycling of this regulator upon receptor desensitization and internalization. DEP-domain-mediated targeting of effectors and regulators to specific GPCRs provides a means to dictate the nature, duration, and specificity of the response."
https://openalex.org/W2066718767,"Flavonoids have been suggested to exert human health benefits by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether and by what mechanisms dietary flavonoids inhibit expression of cellular adhesion molecules, which is relevant to inflammation and atherosclerosis. We found that the capacity of flavonoids to inhibit tumor necrosis factor α-induced adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells was dependent on specific structural features of the flavonoids. The 5,7-dihydroxyl substitution of a flavonoid A-ring and 2,3-double bond and 4-keto group of the C-ring were the main structural requirements for inhibition of adhesion molecule expression. In striking contrast, hydroxyl substitutions of the B- and C-rings but not the A-ring were essential for antioxidant activity. Hence, only hydroxyl flavones, such as apigenin and chrysin, and flavonols, such as galangin, kaempferol, and quercetin, were able to inhibit endothelial adhesion molecule expression, whereas flavone, chromone, the flavanone, naringenin, and the flavanol, (-)-epicatechin, were ineffectual. At low concentrations, the active flavonoids significantly attenuated expression of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. In addition, exposure of apigenin and kaempferol to cultured hepatocytes, mimicking first pass metabolism, greatly diminished the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression. We conclude that the effect of dietary flavonoids on endothelial adhesion molecule expression depends on their molecular structure, concentration, and metabolic transformation but not their antioxidant activity.

We conclude that the effect of dietary flavonoids on endothelial adhesion molecule expression depends on their molecular structure, concentration, and metabolic transformation but not their antioxidant activity. Epidemiological studies indicate that an increased intake of dietary flavonoids is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases (1Arts I.C. Hollman P.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 317S-325SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Knekt P. Kumpulainen J. Jarvinen R. Rissanen H. Heliovaara M. Reunanen A. Hakulinen T. Aromaa A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, mainly through oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein, which initiates vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion formation (3Diaz M.N. Frei B. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Because of the high antioxidant capacity of flavonoids in vitro, it has been suggested that flavonoids act as antioxidants in human plasma and other extracellular fluids and protect low density lipoprotein from oxidation. However, studies of ex vivo oxidation of plasma and low density lipoprotein obtained from human subjects before and after short or long term consumption of flavonoid-rich foods have yielded conflicting results (4Lotito S.B. Frei B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, flavonoids are poorly absorbed and extensively metabolized (5Manach C. Scalbert A. Morand C. Remesy C. Jimenez L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 79: 727-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (5521) Google Scholar), which may limit or alter their antioxidant and biological activities (6Spencer J.P. Abd-el-Mohsen M.M. Rice-Evans C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Williamson G. Barron D. Shimoi K. Terao J. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the health benefits of dietary flavonoids are explained merely by their antioxidant activity in plasma or low density lipoprotein.Beyond the traditional view of atherosclerosis as a build-up of oxidized lipids in the arterial wall, it is now well established that activation of the vascular endothelium plays a key role in the initiation and progression of the disease. Arterial leukocyte recruitment is an important initiating step in atherogenesis (8Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6890) Google Scholar). Leukocyte-endothelial interactions and leukocyte emigration to the subendothelium in response to cytokines and chemokines are mediated by adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cells, such as E- and P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), 2The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (9Blankenberg S. Barbaux S. Tiret L. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 170: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The expression of these adhesion molecules is regulated by reduction/oxidation (redox)-sensitive transcription factors, in particular NF-κB (10Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Hence, the purported cardiovascular benefits of dietary flavonoids may be explained by a local antioxidant effect on endothelial cells and subsequent modulation of intracellular redox environment, cell signaling, and gene expression.Therefore, in this work we investigated whether and by what mechanisms flavonoids attenuate the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. In particular, we characterized: (i) the effect of different flavonoids on adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC); (ii) the relation of this effect to the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoids; (iii) the dependence on the flavonoid concentration; and (iv) the effect on HAEC of flavonoids that had been previously incubated with primary hepatocytes. We found that the attenuation of adhesion molecules by flavonoids was strictly dependent on their molecular structure and was not related to their reducing activity. The dose-response analysis suggested a saturable mechanism for the attenuation of adhesion molecule expression, following a hyperbole-type dependence with the concentration, in contrast to the linear response with respect to NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, we observed that exposure of flavonoids to hepatocytes, a simulation of first pass metabolism, strongly attenuated the subsequent inhibitory effect of the flavonoids on adhesion molecule expression in HAEC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Flavonoids (apigenin, chrysin, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, kaempferol, and galangin) and caffeic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chromone and flavone were obtained from Indofine (Hillsborough, NJ). TNFα was purchased from Roche Applied Science. All of the other chemicals were of the highest grade available.Endothelial Cells—Human aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) at third passage. Upon receipt, the cells were seeded at a ratio of 1:3 in 75-cm2 flasks (precoated with 1% bovine gelatin; Sigma) and grown at 37 °C, under 5% CO2, and in a humidified atmosphere in endothelial cell growth medium (Clonetics-Cambrex) containing bovine brain extract, human epithelial growth factor, hydrocortisone, amphotericin B, gentamicin sulfate, and 2% fetal bovine serum. The medium was periodically renewed until the cells reached 70-90% confluence, at which point they were treated with trypsin-EDTA (Sigma). Subsequently, the cells were expanded in 75-cm2 precoated flasks at a ratio of 1:5 until passages 5 and 6, when they were plated, and the experiments were carried out.Experiments—Human aortic endothelial cells were plated in 96-well plates (precoated with 1% gelatin) at an average density of 5 × 104 cells/ml medium. The medium consisted of Medium 199 (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma), and 1 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Applied Science). The HAEC were allowed to attach to the plates overnight (18 h), after which they were washed with Hanks' salt-balanced solution (Sigma), and the medium was renewed. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, under 5% CO2, and in a humidified atmosphere until they reached confluence, typically 24-48 h after seeding.For experiments, HAEC were incubated with medium (100 μl) containing different concentrations of the various flavonoids (5-50 μm) for 18 h prior to the inflammatory challenge (100 units/ml TNFα). The solutions were freshly prepared by dissolving the flavonoids in Me2SO and subsequent dilution in culture medium containing 20% serum. The final concentration of Me2SO in the medium did not exceed 0.1%. Proper controls with the vehicle Me2SO were carried out. In addition, to eliminate potential effects of artificially generated reactive oxygen species, catalase (0.1 μm) and/or superoxide dismutase (3 μm) were added, and phenol red-free medium was used. For comparative purposes, we also preincubated cells for 30 min before TNFα addition with the irreversible inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation (IC50 =∼10 μm), BAY 11-7821 (Tocris, Ellisville, MI), which leads to decreased NF-κB activation and subsequent decreased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells (11Pierce J.W.

No changes in cell morphology were observed with any of the treatments. Cell viability was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, using a Cell Proliferation Kit I, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science).Adhesion Molecule Expression—Surface expression of adhesion molecules (E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1) was determined by ELISA performed on HAEC monolayers in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Following treatment, the cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde. For cell ELISA, the plates were blocked at 37 °C for 1 h with 5% skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody to either E-selection, ICAM-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or VCAM-1 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The plates were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1 h. The expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 was assessed by the addition of o-phenylendiaminehydrochloride (Sigma). The absorbance at 492 nm was recorded in a plate reader spectrophotometer (Spectromax 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Hepatocyte-conditioned Medium—Rat hepatocytes (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were seeded in 12-well collagen-coated plates, and the cultures were established for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 18-24 h with apigenin or kaempferol, as follows. The flavonoids were freshly prepared in Me2SO and further diluted in hepatocyte medium, consisting of hepatocyte basic medium (Clonetics) supplemented with human epithelial growth factor, gentamicin, ascorbic acid, and insulin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clonetics). The hepatocytes were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 1 ml of medium or incubated with 1 ml of medium containing 30 or 100 μm apigenin or kaempferol. After 18-24 h, this “hepatocyte-conditioned medium” was removed and immediately frozen until further analysis or use in experiments. The cells were washed and replenished with 1 ml of fresh medium, and their viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. None of the treatments affected cell viability.As control, 1 ml of medium, or 1 ml of medium containing 30 or 100 μm apigenin or kaempferol was incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the absence of hepatocytes. After 18-24 h, this “control conditioned medium” was removed and immediately frozen until further analysis. The final concentration of Me2SO was ≤0.1% in all of the incubations.Experiments Using Hepatocyte-conditioned Medium—HAEC were plated in 96-well gelatin-coated plates as described above. The cells were maintained for 8 h in medium consisting of hepatocyte basic medium (supplemented with epithelial growth factor, ascorbic acid, gentamicin, and insulin) diluted 1:1 with complete Medium 199 (phenol red-free Medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics, as described above). Subsequently, HAEC were incubated overnight (15 h) with hepatocyte-conditioned medium (prepared as described above) diluted 1:1 with complete Medium 199 (100 μl of total volume/well). As control, HAEC were incubated with control conditioned medium (prepared as described above) diluted 1:1 with complete Medium 199. The final concentration of fetal bovine serum in these incubations was 10%. Following these overnight incubations, 100 units/ml TNFα was added, the cells were incubated for 5 h, and surface expression of ICAM-1 was determined by ELISA.Ferric-reducing Antioxidant Parameter—The antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and culture media was evaluated by their iron reducing capacity. In this assay, antioxidants act as reductants of Fe3+ to Fe2+, which is chelated by tripyridyltriazine to form a colored complex (12Benzie I.F. Strain J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14916) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of flavonoid-containing solutions or culture medium were mixed in a 96-well plate with 300 μl of reagent solution containing 1.7 mm FeCl3 and 0.8 mm tripyridyltriazine in 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.6. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 593 nm was recorded in a plate reader spectrophotometer (Spectromax 190). The results were compared with a standard curve prepared with different concentrations of the antioxidant trolox and are expressed as “trolox equivalents.”Measurement of Kaempferol—The concentration of kaempferol in medium was determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection, using a C-18 column (150 × 4.6 mm) (Sigma). The mobile phase, delivered at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, consisted of solvent A (0.1% acetic acid in water, pH 3) and solvent B (methanol), using a linear gradient from 40% to 70% B in 10 min. Kaempferol was quantitated by amperometric detection at +0.6 V (BAS-LC4; Bioanalytical Systems Inc., West Lafayette, IN).Statistical Analysis—The results shown are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments (involving three to five observations for each treatment), using HAEC from at least three different donors and three different sets of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance. If statistical significance was reached for analysis of variance (p < 0.05), Tukey-Kramer was applied as post-hoc test. For paired samples, the Student's t test was applied.RESULTSStructure-related Effect of Flavonoids on Endothelial Adhesion Molecule Expression—To identify flavonoids that can affect endothelial function, we screened various structurally related flavonoids (Fig. 1) for their effectiveness to inhibit adhesion molecule expression in primary human aortic endothelial cells. Confluent HAEC were incubated with flavonoids (10-50 μm) for 18 h in medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and then incubated with 100 units/ml (1 ng/ml) TNFα for another 7 h. Cell surface expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 was assessed by ELISA. We found that hydroxyl flavones and flavonols, i.e. apigenin, chrysin, kaempferol, and galangin, significantly inhibited TNFα-induced adhesion molecule expression (Fig. 2), as did quercetin (see Fig. 5A).FIGURE 2Dose-response effect of flavones and flavonols on adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells. The HAEC were incubated for 18 h without or with 10-50 μm apigenin, kaempferol, chrysin, or galangin and then challenged with 100 units/ml TNFα. E-selectin (black bars), ICAM-1 (light gray bars), and VCAM-1 (dark gray bars) were measured by ELISA. The values are expressed as percentages of TNFα stimulation. Control cells incubated in the absence of flavonoids and TNFα are also shown. The data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.

A, the HAEC were incubated for 18 h without or with 5-30 μm quercetin and then challenged with 100 units/ml TNFα. B, the HAEC were incubated for 30 min without or with 5-20 μm BAY 11-7821 and then challenged with 100 units/ml TNFα. E-selectin and ICAM-1 were measured by ELISA. The percentage of inhibition of the expression of E-selectin (closed diamonds) and ICAM-1 (open diamonds) was calculated as explained in the legend to Fig. 4. The data are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest that the basic structure required for inhibition of adhesion molecule expression is 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (chrysin), regardless of substitutions of the B-ring (Fig. 1). Interestingly, naringenin, which is structurally identical to apigenin except for the absence of the 2,3-double bond in the C-ring (Fig. 1), was ineffectual at inhibiting adhesion molecule expression (data not shown). Caffeic acid, whose structure partially resembles that of a flavone or flavonol containing the 2,3-double bond and 4-keto group of the C-ring and a catechol group in the B-ring (Fig. 1), also did not show any inhibitory activity (data not shown). In addition, flavanol, (-)-epicatechin, which is structurally related to quercetin but lacks the C-ring double bond and keto group, and flavone, which lacks any hyroxyl substitutions of the A- and C-rings, and the related compound, chromone (Fig. 1), were all ineffectual (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the C-ring double bond and keto group and the A-ring 5,7-dihydroxyl groups but not the B-ring per se are required for flavonoids to inhibit TNFα-induced adhesion molecule expression in HAEC.With respect to the dose dependence of the effects of the active flavonoids, statistically significant inhibition of the expression of at least one type of adhesion molecule was observed at concentrations ≥10 μm for chrysin and galangin, ≥30 μm for apigenin, and 50 μm for kaempferol (Fig. 2). In general, expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin was more strongly inhibited than VCAM-1. In fact, only 50 μm apigenin (Fig. 2) significantly inhibited VCAM-1 expression.Structure-related Antioxidant Capacity of Flavonoids—To evaluate whether the above observed anti-inflammatory effect of specific flavonoids was related to their antioxidant capacity, the ferric-reducing antioxidant parameter was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, the flavones apigenin and chrysin and the flavanone naringenin exerted no antioxidant activity, in contrast to flavonoids substituted with a hydroxyl group in the 3-position of the C-ring, i.e. flavonols and flavanols (Fig. 1). Flavonols were differentially active, with quercetin exhibiting the strongest antioxidant capacity (2.53 ± 0.31 μm trolox equivalents) followed by kaempferol (1.40 ± 0.17 μm) and then galangin (0.95 ± 0.02 μm). These data indicate that the presence of hydroxyl groups in the B-ring (Fig. 1) enhances the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoid. This conclusion is buttressed by the antioxidant capacity of (-)-epicatechin (2.24 ± 0.09 μm), which is similar to that of quercetin (Fig. 3). Caffeic acid exhibited an antioxidant capacity (1.58 ± 0.07 μm) similar to that of kaempferol. Thus, the reducing activity of the tested compounds appears to be determined by the hydroxyl substitutions of the C- and B-rings but not the A-ring (Fig. 1). Importantly, no correlation was found between the reducing activity of the various flavonoids and their inhibitory effect on endothelial adhesion molecule expression (compare Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 3Iron-reducing capacity of flavonoids and related compounds. The ferric-reducing antioxidant parameter was measured according to Benzie and Strain (12Benzie I.F. Strain J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14916) Google Scholar) and is expressed as μm trolox equivalent/1 μm of the test compound. The data are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Flavonoid Concentration on Endothelial Adhesion Molecule Expression—The dose dependence of the effect of flavonoids on adhesion molecule expression was carefully evaluated in the physiologically relevant concentration range of 5-30 μm. The HAEC were incubated without (control) or with flavonoids and challenged with TNFα as described above, and the results were analyzed as the percentage of inhibition of E-selectin or ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 4). We found that the response was nonlinear in the concentration range of the flavonoids tested. The experimental data of inhibition of E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression by apigenin and kaempferol (Fig. 4, A and C) were best fitted by a hyperbola-type function of the following equation: % Inhibition = % Maximal Inhibition [Flavonoid]/([Flavonoid] + K). Expression of E-selectin was inhibited by 30-40% by 30 μm kaempferol and apigenin, and ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by ∼30 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 4, A and C). A similar pattern was observed for the inhibition of E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression by the structurally related flavonoids chrysin and galangin (Fig. 4, B and D), with the hyperbola-type dose-response curve particularly evident for E-selectin (Fig. 4B). VCAM-1 expression was not inhibited by any of the flavonoids at concentrations ≤30 μm (Fig. 2).FIGURE 4Dose-response effect of flavones and flavonols on E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression in human aortic endothelial cells. The HAEC were incubated for 18 h without or with 5-30 μm apigenin (closed circles), kaempferol (open circles) (A and C), chrysin (closed triangles), or galangin (open triangles) (B and D) and then challenged with 100 units/ml TNFα. E-selectin and ICAM-1 were measured by ELISA. The percentage of inhibition of the expression of E-selectin (A and B) and ICAM-1 (C and D) was calculated for each experiment as follows: 100 - [(treated - control)/(100 - control)] × 100. The data are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the same set of experiments, we also tested the effect of 5-30 μm of the flavonol, quercetin, on endothelial adhesion molecule expression. Quercetin strongly and dose-dependently inhibited E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 5A). The dose-response curve for the inhibition of ICAM-1 expression followed the hyperbola-type function observed for other flavonoids (Fig. 4). Quercetin concentrations as low as 5-10 μm inhibited ICAM-1 expression by as much as 50-60%, which was close to the maximal inhibition described by the function (Fig. 5A). In contrast, a linear dose-response curve was observed for the effect of the irreversible inhibitor of TNFα-stimulated IκBα phosphorylation, BAY 11-7821 (5-20 μm), on the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1 (Fig. 5B), and VCAM-1 (data not shown).Effect of Hepatocyte-exposed Flavonoids on Endothelial Adhesion Molecule Expression—To investigate the effect of first pass metabolism on the biological activity of flavonoids, apigenin and kaempferol were incubated with hepatocytes prior to evaluating the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoids and the inhibitory effect on TNFα-induced endothelial adhesion molecule expression. As shown in Fig. 6A, after exposure to hepatocytes, medium originally containing 30 μm kaempferol exhibited a significantly lower ferric-reducing activity (9.1 ± 6.2 μm) than control medium containing the same concentration of kaempferol but incubated in the absence of hepatocytes (31.8 ± 6.6 μm). Similar results were obtained when the medium originally contained 100 μm kaempferol (56.6 ± 12.2 μm versus 99.6 ± 12.9 μm in the presence and absence of hepatocytes, respectively) (Fig. 6A). After only6hof incubation with hepatocytes, the concentration of kaempferol in the medium was not detectable (from originally 30 μm) or greatly diminished (from 100 μm), as measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection (Fig. 6, B and C, respectively).FIGURE 6Characterization of conditioned medium containing kaempferol. A, the changes in the ferric-reducing antioxidant parameter of the medium, originally containing 30 or 100 μm kaempferol, were measured after conditioning in the absence of rat hepatocytes (black bars, control conditioned medium) or their presence (gray bars, hepatocyte-conditioned medium). The data are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The results were compared using Student's paired t test, and the p values are given in the figure. B and C, the concentration of kaempferol was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The chromatographic traces are shown for medium originally containing 30 μm (B) or 100 μm kaempferol (C) after conditioning for 6 h in the absence (-) or presence (+) of rat hepatocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HAEC were then incubated for 15 h with either 1:1 diluted hepatocyte-conditioned medium or 1:1 diluted control conditioned medium, with both media originally containing 30 or 100 μm apigenin or kaempferol. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 5 h with 100 units/ml TNFα, and ICAM-1 expression was evaluated by ELISA. Control conditioned medium originally containing 30 μm apigenin or kaempferol attenuated TNFα-induced expression of ICAM-1 by 46 or 36%, respectively (Fig. 7). In contrast, hepatocyte-conditioned medium originally containing 30 μm apigenin or kaempferol failed to inhibit ICAM-1 expression in HAEC (Fig. 7). Furthermore, control conditioned medium containing 100 μm apigenin or kaempferol attenuated TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression by 63 and 54%, whereas hepatocyte-conditioned medium only and nonsignificantly inhibited by 36 and 30%, respectively. These data indicate that the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on endothelial adhesion molecule expression is greatly diminished by prior exposure of the flavonoids to hepatocytes, suggesting substantial first pass hepatic metabolism.FIGURE 7Effect of apigenin and kaempferol from hepatocyte-conditioned medium on ICAM-1 expression in human aortic endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2044844305,"Stimulation of a site on the brain's left hemisphere prompts the creepy feeling that somebody is close by. The strange sensation that somebody is nearby when no one is actually present has been described by psychiatric and neurological patients, as well as by healthy subjects, but it is not understood how the illusion is triggered by the brain. Here we describe the repeated induction of this sensation in a patient who was undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, as a result of focal electrical stimulation of the left temporoparietal junction: the illusory person closely 'shadowed' changes in the patient's body position and posture. These perceptions may have been due to a disturbance in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporoparietal junction."
https://openalex.org/W2161465643,"In meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and II. Disjunction of maternal from paternal centromeres during meiosis I depends on the attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules emanating from the same pole. In budding yeast, monopolar attachment requires recruitment to kinetochores of the monopolin complex. How monopolin promotes monopolar attachment was unclear, as its subunits are poorly conserved and lack similarities to proteins with known functions. We show here that the monopolin subunit Mam1 binds tightly to Hrr25, a highly conserved casein kinase 1 δ/ɛ (CK1δ/ɛ), and recruits it to meiosis I centromeres. Hrr25 kinase activity and Mam1 binding are both essential for monopolar attachment. Since CK1δ/ɛ activity is important for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis I also in fission yeast, phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by CK1δ/ɛ might be an evolutionary conserved process required for monopolar attachment.

Accurate transmission of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis depends on attachment of microtubules to chromosomal DNA via a proteinaceous interface called the kinetochore. The production of genetically identical daughter cells during mitosis requires the attachment of kinetochores on sister chromatids to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles (Hauf and Watanabe, 2004Hauf S. Watanabe Y. Kinetochore orientation in mitosis and meiosis.Cell. 2004; 119: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This bipolar attachment or biorientation relies on sister chromatid cohesion mediated by the cohesin complex, which holds sister DNAs together from DNA replication until anaphase, possibly by trapping DNAs inside a tripartite ring formed between its Smc1, Smc3, and kleisin subunits (Nasmyth, 2005Nasmyth K. How might cohesin hold sister chromatids together?.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sister chromatid cohesion ensures that the tension necessary to stabilize kinetochore-associated microtubules is only generated when sister kinetochores have attached in a bipolar manner. The Ipl1/aurora B kinase eliminates erroneous attachments that fail to generate tension (Dewar et al., 2004Dewar H. Tanaka K. Nasmyth K. Tanaka T.U. Tension between two kinetochores suffices for their bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle.Nature. 2004; 428: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At the onset of anaphase, a protease called separase cleaves cohesin's kleisin subunit Scc1 along the entire length of chromosomes, which causes cohesin's dissociation from chromosomes and segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles (Uhlmann et al., 2000Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cleavage of cohesin by the CD clan protease separin triggers anaphase in yeast.Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Activation of separase depends on degradation of its inhibitor Pds1/securin, which is triggered through ubiquitinylation by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Alternate rounds of chromosome duplication and segregation ensure that chromosome numbers remain constant during mitotic cell cycles. In meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation (called meiosis I and II), which enables diploid germ cells to give rise to haploid gametes. Meiosis I differs from mitosis in four important aspects (Petronczki et al., 2003Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Un menage a quatre: the molecular biology of chromosome segregation in meiosis.Cell. 2003; 112: 423-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). First, reciprocal recombination (crossovers) between homologous nonsister chromatids creates the chiasmata that link maternal and paternal chromosomes and produce bivalent chromosomes. Homologs are held together by sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms distal to crossovers. Consequently, the tension that stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule interactions can be created by pulling maternal sister centromeres in the opposite direction of their paternal homologs. Second, sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from the same pole (Hauf and Watanabe, 2004Hauf S. Watanabe Y. Kinetochore orientation in mitosis and meiosis.Cell. 2004; 119: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This monopolar attachment or mono-orientation ensures that maternal and paternal centromeres of bivalents are pulled in opposite directions. Third, chiasmata are resolved by cleavage of cohesin's kleisin subunit Rec8 along chromosome arms but not at centromeres (Buonomo et al., 2000Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I depends on proteolytic cleavage of the meiotic cohesin Rec8 by separin.Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, Kitajima et al., 2003Kitajima T.S. Miyazaki Y. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Rec8 cleavage by separase is required for meiotic nuclear divisions in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5643-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and this triggers segregation of homologous chromosomes to opposite poles. Cohesin at centromeres is protected from separase at the onset of anaphase I by a complex of the Sgo1/shugoshin protein with protein phosphatase 2A (Kitajima et al., 2006Kitajima T.S. Sakuno T. Ishiguro K. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kawashima S.A. Watanabe Y.

Sister chromatid cohesion along arms and at centromeres.Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lastly, meiosis I is not followed by DNA replication but by a second round of chromosome segregation during which the cohesion between sister centromeres is used to biorient sister kinetochores (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K.

Nurse P. Cohesin Rec8 is required for reductional chromosome segregation at meiosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Destruction of this cohesion by a second round of separase activation triggers the disjunction of sister centromeres and the formation of haploid gametes. Some of these meiosis-specific processes require replacement of cohesin's mitotic Scc1 subunit by the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8. Cohesin containing Rec8 is essential for the processing of recombinogenic double-strand breaks and for the resistance of centromeric cohesion to cleavage by separase in anaphase I (Petronczki et al., 2003Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Un menage a quatre: the molecular biology of chromosome segregation in meiosis.Cell. 2003; 112: 423-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rec8-like proteins are required for mono-orientation of sister centromeres during meiosis I in plants and fission yeast (Chelysheva et al., 2005Chelysheva L. Diallo S. Vezon D. Gendrot G. Vrielynck N. Belcram K. Rocques N. Marquez-Lema A. Bhatt A.M. Horlow C. et al.AtREC8 and AtSCC3 are essential to the monopolar orientation of the kinetochores during meiosis.J.

Functional redundancy in the maize meiotic kinetochore.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for suppressing sister kinetochore biorientation in meiosis I remains poorly understood. Thus far, two classes of proteins have been implicated in promoting mono-orientation: orthologs of Rec8 and meiosis I-specific kinetochore proteins. Mono-orientation in fission yeast depends on Rec8-mediated sister chromatid cohesion at the inner core of centromeres where microtubules attach to chromatin (Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005Yokobayashi S. Watanabe Y. The kinetochore protein moa1 enables cohesion-mediated monopolar attachment at meiosis I.Cell. 2005; 123: 803-817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cohesin containing the mitotic kleisin Rad21/Scc1 cannot substitute, possibly because it is excluded from this region of the chromosome (Watanabe et al., 2001Watanabe Y. Yokobayashi S. Yamamoto M. Nurse P. Pre-meiotic S phase is linked to reductional chromosome segregation and recombination.Nature. 2001; 409: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Yokobayashi et al., 2003Yokobayashi S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, both Rec8- and Scc1-containing cohesin complexes are clearly recruited to the central core of centromeres in budding yeast (Riedel et al., 2006Riedel C.G. Katis V.L. Katou Y. Mori S. Itoh T. Helmhart W. Galova M. Petronczki M. Gregan J. Cetin B. et al.Protein phosphatase 2A protects centromeric sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis I.Nature. 2006; 441: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and can support mono-orientation in meiosis I (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Centromeric cohesion cannot, however, suffice for mono-orientation because it is required also for biorientation of sister kinetochores in meiosis II (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K.

Nurse P. Cohesin Rec8 is required for reductional chromosome segregation at meiosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Indeed, mono-orientation depends on meiosis I-specific functions, which require the Moa1 protein in fission yeast (Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005Yokobayashi S. Watanabe Y. The kinetochore protein moa1 enables cohesion-mediated monopolar attachment at meiosis I.Cell. 2005; 123: 803-817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the monopolin proteins Mam1, Lrs4, and Csm1 in budding yeast (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Kinetochore recruitment of two nucleolar proteins is required for homolog segregation in meiosis I.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Whereas Mam1 is a meiosis I-specific protein, Csm1 and Lrs4 form a nucleolar protein complex in mitotic cells, which is released from the nucleolus at metaphase I and, together with Mam1, localizes to kinetochores. Mam1, Csm1, and Lrs4 interact in vitro and are recruited to kinetochores in an interdependent manner. Orthologs of these proteins have only been identified in a few fungi, and their sequences do not provide clues to their molecular function. We show here that Hrr25, the highly conserved casein kinase 1 δ/ɛ of budding yeast, is a hitherto unknown subunit of monopolin. Hrr25 associates with centromeres at metaphase I, and its catalytic activity as well as its interaction with Mam1 are essential for mono-orientation of sister kinetochores in meiosis I. Our finding of a protein kinase as part of the monopolin complex implies that the molecular mechanism behind sister kinetochore mono-orientation will eventually be revealed by identification of the kinase's substrates at kinetochores. To identify novel proteins associated with monopolin, we used the tandem affinity purification (TAP) strategy (Rigaut et al., 1999Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar) to isolate Mam1 and Lrs4 from extracts of diploid strains that had been arrested in metaphase I due to meiotic depletion of the APC/C activator Cdc20. Purified proteins were detected on gels stained with silver (Figure 1A, left and middle). In parallel, samples were digested in solution with trypsin and subjected to peptide identification by mass spectrometry (M.S.). Proteins associated with Mam1 or Lrs4 but absent from control purifications were ranked by peptide coverage, an approximate measure of protein abundance (Figure 1A, right). Mam1 was associated with high levels of a 60 kDa protein that M.S. identified as Hrr25, the budding yeast ortholog of casein kinase 1 δ/ɛ (CK1δ/ɛ). M.S. confirmed that Lrs4 and Csm1 also copurified with Mam1, albeit with much lower stoichiometry. Lrs4 was associated with high levels of its nucleolar companion Csm1 and with smaller amounts of both Mam1 and Hrr25. Interestingly, Lrs4 also bound to the nucleolar anchor protein Net1/Cfi1 and its partner, the Cdc14 phosphatase (Visintin and Amon, 2000Visintin R. Amon A. The nucleolus: the magician's hat for cell cycle tricks.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 752Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Hrr25 belongs to the highly conserved δ/ɛ group of CK1s (Figure S1A) and is the sole budding yeast CK1 lacking a lipid membrane anchor. It has been implicated in DNA repair, stress signaling, and membrane traffic (Knippschild et al., 2005Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Lohler J. Stoter M. The casein kinase 1 family: participation in multiple cellular processes in eukaryotes.Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To identify proteins associated with Hrr25, a TAP-tagged version was purified from metaphase I-arrested cells (Figure 1B). Silver staining and M.S. revealed a multitude of copurifying proteins, including proteins involved in spore formation, cohesin subunits (Smc1, Smc3, and Rec8), the monopolin Mam1, and smaller amounts of Mam1's partners Csm1 and Lrs4. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitations from meiotic HRR25-myc9 MAM1-ha6 and MAM1-ha6 cells confirmed that the interaction between Hrr25 and Mam1 is specific (Figure 1C). In summary, our results imply the existence of two high affinity complexes, namely Csm1/Lrs4 and Mam1/Hrr25, which together form with lower efficiency a quaternary complex at metaphase I (Figure 1E). To test whether Hrr25 and Mam1 interact directly, we incubated in vitro translated Mam1 with beads coupled to recombinant Csm1 and Hrr25 proteins. Mam1 bound, with similar efficiency, to Hrr25- and Csm1-containing beads but not to control beads (Figure 1D, lanes 2–4). Hrr25's N-terminal kinase domain was both necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Mam1 (Figure 1D, lanes 5–9), while its C-terminal P/Q rich domain had no role. These data demonstrate that Mam1 binds directly to Hrr25's kinase domain and indicate that Hrr25 associates with Csm1/Lrs4 indirectly, via Mam1's interaction with Csm1 (Figure 1E). Though not lethal, deletion of HRR25 causes cells to grow extremely slowly (Hoekstra et al., 1991Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C. DeMaggio A.J. Burbee D.G. Heffron F. HRR25, a putative protein kinase from budding yeast: association with repair of damaged DNA.Science. 1991; 253: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which makes meiotic analysis impossible. To circumvent this problem, we first created a version of the kinase that can be inactivated conditionally. We introduced an I82G mutation that enlarges Hrr25's ATP binding cleft and renders it sensitive to kinase inhibition by the adenine analog 1NM-PP1 (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. et al.A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase.Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Cells carrying this analog-sensitive hrr25-as allele grew normally in the absence of 1NM-PP1 but very poorly in its presence (Figure 2B). Growth of hrr25-as cells in the presence of 1NM-PP1 was restored by wild-type HRR25 (HRR25-WT) but not by the “kinase-dead” hrr25-KD allele (Figures 2A and 2B). This suggests that 1NM-PP1 specifically blocks Hrr25-as's kinase activity. 1NM-PP1 blocked formation of spores by hrr25-as but not HRR25-WT diploid cells (Figure S2A). Staining of the prospore membrane marker Don1 (Knop and Strasser, 2000Knop M. Strasser K. Role of the spindle pole body of yeast in mediating assembly of the prospore membrane during meiosis.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) revealed that prospore membrane precursors did not concentrate at spindle-pole bodies in metaphase II and therefore failed to engulf chromatin during anaphase II (Figure S2B). To assess the effect of Hrr25 inhibition on meiotic chromosome segregation, we used strains whose two chromosome V homologs were marked at the URA3 locus by GFP (homozygous URA3-GFP). In HRR25-WT cells treated with 1NM-PP1, meiosis II spindle elongation produced four equal DNA masses and caused segregation of a single copy of URA3-GFP to each of the four spindle poles (Figure 2C). In hrr25-as cells, meiosis II spindle elongation failed to produce individualized nuclei due to the absence of prospore membranes. Interestingly, the four spindle poles were associated with very unequal amounts of chromatin, and in 47% of cells, at least one pole lacked a GFP signal (Figure 2C). This suggests that Hrr25's kinase activity is required for correct chromosome segregation during meiosis as well as for spore formation. Assuming that Hrr25 has a key role in meiosis I mono-orientation, we next sought to generate HRR25 mutants that specifically affect this process without compromising vegetative growth or spore formation. We took advantage of the finding that inactivation of monopolin rescues the lethality of spores produced by spo11Δ spo12Δ cells (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Kinetochore recruitment of two nucleolar proteins is required for homolog segregation in meiosis I.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A pool of plasmids carrying randomly mutagenized HRR25 alleles was transformed into spo11Δ spo12Δ hrr25Δ cells and selected for alleles that restore spore viability (Figure S1B). Sequencing of the isolated HRR25 alleles revealed frequent mutation of H25 and E34 (Table S1). These residues are positioned close to each other on the surface of Hrr25's kinase domain near the ATP binding cleft (Figure 2A) but are not involved in enzyme catalysis. As these residues might be crucial for monopolar attachment, we combined the mutations H25R and E34K to generate the allele hrr25-zo (Figure 2A). hrr25-zo supported normal vegetative growth (Figure 2D) and, like deletion of MAM1, restored the viability of spo11Δ spo12Δ spores (Figure 2E). To assess the effect of hrr25-zo on meiotic chromosome segregation in a wild-type background, we analyzed strains homozygous for URA3-GFP. hrr25-zo cells underwent meiosis and formed spores with normal efficiency. However, while HRR25-WT spores contained equal amounts of DNA and a single GFP signal, most hrr25-zo spores contained unequal amounts of DNA and more than one or no GFP signal at all (Figures 2F and S1C). Our data imply that hrr25-zo causes massive chromosome missegregation resulting in the production of inviable spores. In summary, the analysis of hrr25-as and hrr25-zo cells shows that kinase activity and two specific surface residues of Hrr25 are essential for correct meiotic chromosome segregation. To investigate Hrr25's role in meiotic chromosome segregation, we transferred HRR25-WT and hrr25-as (both +1NM-PP1) as well as HRR25-WT and hrr25-zo cells to sporulation medium (SPM). To follow meiotic events, all strains had one chromosome V homolog marked by GFP 35 kb from the centromere at URA3 (heterozygous URA3-GFP) and expressed a Myc18-tagged version of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1. In HRR25-WT cells, the metaphase I-to-anaphase I transition is accompanied by the disappearance of Pds1, spindle elongation, division of chromosomal DNA into two equal masses, and cosegregation of sister URA3 sequences to the same pole (Figures 3B and 3C). These binucleate cells then reaccumulate Pds1 and form a pair of meiosis II spindles. The metaphase II-to-anaphase II transition is accompanied by a second round of Pds1 destruction, segregation of URA3-GFP sequences to opposite poles, and formation of four distinct nuclei (Figure 3B). 1NM-PP1 had no effect on the timing of these events in HRR25-WT cells (Figure 3A). It also had no effect on DNA replication or meiotic spindle pole body duplication in hrr25-as cells (Figure S2C). Furthermore, both hrr25-as (+1NM-PP1) and hrr25-zo strains formed normal-looking metaphase I cells containing short bipolar spindles and tightly associated sister URA3-GFP signals (Figure 3B, middle and lower panel). This suggests that neither Hrr25 inhibition nor the hrr25-zo mutation affect sister chromatid cohesion. The first obvious effect of hrr25 mutations was the abnormal accumulation of mononucleate cells containing a bipolar spindle and low levels of Pds1 (Figures 3B and 3C). These Pds1-negative mutant cells contained stretched but undivided chromatin and, unlike HRR25-WT cells, often split URA3 sequences precociously along their meiosis I spindle axis (hrr25-as, 25%; hrr25-zo, 28%) (Figure 3B). Despite this massive failure at meiosis I, hrr25-as and hrr25-zo cells proceeded to form a pair of metaphase II spindles within a single nucleus. Upon Pds1 destruction at the onset of anaphase II, the chromatids within the undivided nucleus segregated simultaneously to four spindle poles (Figure 3B). Sister chromatids were frequently segregated along different spindle axes, presumably because they had been separated precociously. In addition, inhibition of Hrr25-as delayed disassembly of meiosis II spindles, which might be caused by the lack of spore formation (Figure 3A). hrr25 mutants might fail to perform the meiosis I division due to a defect in the cleavage of Rec8 on chromosome arms, which would prevent the resolution of chiasmata (Buonomo et al., 2000Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I depends on proteolytic cleavage of the meiotic cohesin Rec8 by separin.Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Detection of Rec8 on chromosome spreads revealed, however, that neither the hrr25-as (+1NM-PP1) nor the hrr25-zo mutation affected the kinetics of Rec8's chromosomal association, removal from chromosome arms, or retention at centromeres following onset of anaphase I (Figure 3E). Nevertheless, most of the spreads with centromeric Rec8 were mononucleate in hrr25-as (+1NM-PP1) and hrr25-zo cells but binucleate in HRR25-WT cells (Figure S2D). These data suggest that the failure of hrr25 mutants to undergo the meiosis I division is not caused by a defect in the removal of Rec8 from chromosome arms. The phenotype of hrr25-as and hrr25-zo cells closely resembles that of monopolin mutants (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Kinetochore recruitment of two nucleolar proteins is required for homolog segregation in meiosis I.Dev.

Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These fail to undergo meiosis I because cells attempt to pull sister kinetochores toward opposite poles upon initiation of anaphase but are prevented from disjoining them by the protection from separase of centromeric cohesion. The precocious splitting of some sister URA3 sequences upon Pds1 degradation is thought to be due to spindle forces sometimes winning the tug of war with pericentric sister-chromatid cohesion. To confirm that the meiosis I division requires Hrr25's kinase activity, we expressed Hrr25-WT-myc9 or a kinase-dead version in hrr25-as cells treated with 1NM-PP1. The wild-type but not the kinase-dead allele rescued their failure to undergo nuclear division and to form spores (Figures 3D and S2E). We conclude that Hrr25's kinase activity as well as residues H25 and E34 are required for the segregation of homologous centromeres to opposite poles in meiosis I but not for destruction of Pds1 or removal of cohesin from chromosome arms. Bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores in monopolin mutants causes the splitting of some sister centromeres during metaphase I (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To test whether this also occurs in hrr25 mutants, we analyzed Pds1-positive metaphase I cells in which one chromosome V homolog was marked with GFP 1.5 kb from the centromere (heterozygous CEN5-GFP). Whereas sister centromeres remained tightly associated in HRR25-WT cells, they frequently split along spindle axes in hrr25-as (+1NM-PP1) and hrr25-zo cells (Figure 4A). We conclude that Hrr25 like Mam1 prevents splitting of sister centromeres at metaphase I. If meiosis I nuclear division fails in hrr25 mutants due to erroneous biorientation of sister kinetochores and persistent centromeric cohesion, the following two predictions should hold true. First, abolishing chiasmata formation between homologous chromosomes should not alleviate the division block. Second, elimination of centromeric cohesion at the onset of anaphase I should do so and allow hrr25 mutants to undergo an equational meiosis I division. To prevent formation of chiasmata we eliminated Spo11, the endonuclease that initiates recombination. We compared spo11Δ hrr25-as with spo11Δ HRR25-WT cells (+1NM-PP1) and spo11Δ hrr25-zo with spo11Δ HRR25-WT cells, all of which contained Pds1-myc18 and heterozygous URA3-GFP. In the absence of chiasmata homolog segregation no longer depends on Pds1 destruction and removal of arm cohesion. Mono-orientation of sister kinetochores, however, is not affected by deleting SPO11 in wild-type cells (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Accordingly, most spo11Δ HRR25-WT cells underwent meiosis I nuclear division prior to Pds1 destruction, while sister URA3 sequences invariably cosegregated to the same pole (Figure 4B, left). In contrast, at least 80% of spo11Δ hrr25-as and spo11Δ hrr25-zo cells failed"
https://openalex.org/W2012349627,"Phosphorylation and spatial reorganization of the vimentin network have been implicated in mediating smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, and mitosis. In this study, stimulation of cultured smooth muscle cells with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induced PAK1 phosphorylation at Thr-423 (an indication of p21-activated kinase (PAK) activation). Treatment with PAK led to disassembly of wild-type (but not mutant S56A) vimentin filaments as assessed by an in vitro filament assembly assay. Furthermore, stimulation with 5-HT resulted in the dissociation of Crk-associated substrate (CAS; an adapter protein associated with smooth muscle force development) from cytoskeletal vimentin. Expression of mutant S56A vimentin in cells inhibited the increase in phosphorylation at Ser-56 and in the ratios of soluble to insoluble vimentin (an index of vimentin disassembly) and the dissociation of CAS from cytoskeletal vimentin in response to 5-HT activation compared with cells expressing wild-type vimentin. Because CAS may be involved in PAK activation, PAK phosphorylation was evaluated in cells expressing the S56A mutant. Expression of mutant S56A vimentin depressed PAK phosphorylation at Thr-423 induced by 5-HT. Expression of the S56A mutant also inhibited the spatial reorientation of vimentin filaments in cells in response to 5-HT stimulation. Our results suggest that vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 may inversely regulate PAK activation possibly via the increase in the amount of soluble CAS upon agonist stimulation of smooth muscle cells. Additionally, vimentin phosphorylation at this position is critical for vimentin filament spatial rearrangement elicited by agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1986506019,"X-ray crystal structures of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen-related receptor-γ (ERRγ) were determined that describe this receptor in three distinct states: unliganded, inverse agonist bound, and agonist bound. Two structures were solved for the unliganded state, the ERRγ LBD alone, and in complex with a coregulator peptide representing a portion of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140). No significant differences were seen between these structures that both exhibited the conformation of ERRγ seen in studies with other coactivators. Two structures were obtained describing the inverse agonist-bound state, the ERRγ LBD with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), and the ERRγ LBD with 4-OHT and a peptide representing a portion of the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone action protein (SMRT). The 4-OHT structure was similar to other reported inverse agonist bound structures, showing reorientation of phenylalanine 435 and a displacement of the AF-2 helix relative to the unliganded structures with little other rearrangement occurring. No significant changes to the LBD appear to be induced by peptide binding with the addition of the SMRT peptide to the ERRγ plus 4-OHT complex. The observed agonist-bound state contains the ERRγ LBD, a ligand (GSK4716), and the RIP140 peptide and reveals an unexpected rearrangement of the phenol-binding residues. Thermal stability studies show that agonist binding leads to global stabilization of the ligand binding domain.

Amino acid sequence alignment identifies several conserved regions within the NRs: a central, highly conserved DNA binding domain that allows for the sequence-specific recognition of DNA in the promoter region of the genes; a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) that is able to bind small, lipophilic molecules and influence the interaction with cofactors involved in transcriptional regulation; and a poorly conserved N-terminal domain. X-ray crystallography has revealed that the canonical NR LBD is composed of 10-13 α-helices arranged in a three-layered sandwich, the interior of which varies in volume and functional character to define the molecular basis of ligand specificity. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ, or NR3B1, NR3B2, and NR3B3, respectively) define a subfamily of three orphan NRs most closely related to the classic estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). Because of high sequence conservation within the DNA binding domains of the two subfamilies, the classic ERs and orphan ERRs are able to recognize common DNA binding sites (also known as response elements) proximal to target genes (1Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For example, the orphan ERRs have demonstrated control over classic ER target genes in breast (2Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761PubMed Google Scholar) and bone (3Vanacker J.M. Delmarre C. Guo X. Laudet V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar). Although the ERs and ERRs show a degree of sequence identity across their LBDs, a significant difference in ligand binding is observed: the ERs bind with high affinity to phenolic steroids such as estradiol, whereas the ERRs are not activated by classic estrogens even at concentrations several orders of magnitude above physiological levels. ERRγ, like ERRα and ERRβ, shows transcriptional activation of target genes in the absence of an added ligand and has been designated a constitutively active orphan NR. An x-ray crystal structure of the unliganded (apo) receptor shows the LBD in an active conformation with the C-terminal AF-2 helix oriented to allow for coactivator binding (4Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The ligand binding pocket is extremely small, measuring 280 Å3 in volume compared with 370 Å3 available in the classic ERα pocket (5Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). An endogenous small molecule ligand has yet to be identified for ERRγ (6Horard B. Vanacker J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Instead, the fasting-induced coactivator protein PGC-1α has been shown to activate the receptor (7Hentschke M. Susens U. Borgmeyer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4086-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Kamei Y. Ohizumi H. Fujitani Y. Nemoto T. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Kawada T. Miyoshi M. Ezaki O. Kakizuka A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12378-12383Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations have led to speculation that the endogenous activity of the receptor may be controlled by coactivator concentration rather than a small molecule hormone. Although a natural ligand remains to be found, several synthetic ligands have been identified that bind to and influence the functional activity of ERRγ. The classic high affinity ER ligands (see Fig. 1) diethylstilbestrol (1Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (2, 4-OHT) profile as ERRγ inverse agonists (10Coward P. Lee D. Hull M.V. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8880-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of 1 and 2 bound to ERRγ have been reported, and both structures are consistent with the observed inverse agonism (11Greschik H. Flaig R. Renaud J.P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Due to the small volume of the ligand pocket, the receptor undergoes a large conformational change upon binding 1 or 2 that displaces the AF-2 helix resulting in a loss of coactivator binding. The global conformational change is similar to that observed when 4-OHT binds to ERα, where 4-OHT also inhibits receptor activity; however, in the more restricted ERRγ ligand binding space, the small ERα agonist diethylstilbestrol requires rearrangement within the ERRγ ligand binding pocket and profiles as an inverse agonist. We recently reported the discovery of the first small molecule ERR agonist, GSK4716 (shown in Fig. 1 as compound 3) through a combination of diversity screening and structureguided array synthesis (12Zuercher W.J. Gaillard S. Orband-Miller L.A. Chao E.Y. Shearer B.G. Jones D.G. Miller A.B. Collins J.L. McDonnell D.P. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3107-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The acyl hydrazone is a micromolar ERRγ agonist that is able to activate the receptor to the same degree as the protein ligand PGC-1α. Radioligand competition binding assays show that GSK4716 is more than 50-fold selective for binding to ERRγ compared with the classic ERs (12Zuercher W.J. Gaillard S. Orband-Miller L.A. Chao E.Y.

Given that unliganded ERRγ resides in a transcriptionally active conformation, we sought an understanding of the molecular basis of ERRγ activation by GSK4716. Herein we report x-ray crystal structures involving ERRγ in three distinct states: unliganded, inverse agonist-bound, and agonist-bound. These structures and associated studies reveal the origin of the binding selectivity and functional activity of GSK4716. Protein Expression and Purification—Human ERRγ LBD (229-458) was cloned into pRSET vector as a His6-tagged protein and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Following cell growth in Circle Grow (Bio 101 system) media containing 100 mg/ml carbenicillin, cells were pelleted and stored at -80 °C. Cell pellets were lysed by resuspension and sonication in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50 mm. The protein solution was filtered and loaded onto a 50-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. Bound protein was eluted with a 50 mm to 500 mm imidazole linear gradient in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl over 13 column volumes, and the ERRγ-containing fractions were pooled according to SDS-PAGE analysis. The pooled material was diluted 5-fold with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% propanediol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Diluted protein was loaded onto a 50-ml Poros HQ 50 column (PerSeptive Biosystems) and eluted with a 25 to 250 mm NaCl gradient over 18 column volumes. Pooled material was further purified using an S-75 column with an elution buffer containing 5% propanediol, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to 8 mg/ml. The final material was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C in the S-75 column buffer. CD Spectroscopy—Purified ERRγ LBD was buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, using G-25 gel-filtration chromatography for use in CD experiments. Ligands were dissolved in ethanol, and synthetic peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, before being dispensed into the protein solution to achieve referenced concentrations. Ellipticity was measured for samples in rectangular quartz cuvettes with 1.0-mm path lengths using an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a four-position Peltier temperature-controlled sample turret. For thermal sensitivity experiments, the temperature was varied and measured in the sample compartment at approximately one-degree increments, generally from 25 °C to 70 °C, and ellipticity at 222 nm (bandwidth = 1 nm) was measured. Samples were equilibrated for 30 s at each temperature before data were collected at 0.1-s intervals and averaged over 2-5 s. All thermal transitions observed for ERRγ LBD led to irreversible precipitation of the protein, so the loss of ellipticity with increasing temperature was monitoring a combination of secondary structural unfolding, aggregation, and precipitation from solution. Nonetheless, certain compounds and peptides did have an effect on the observed thermal transition of ERRγ LBD indicating that this observation of thermal sensitivity was reflective of complex formation, and thereby related to the stabilization of the protein by ligand or peptide binding. Thermal transitions were analyzed using nonlinear regression to the Boltzmann equation, ΘT=Θmin+Θmax-Θmin1+e(T-T1/2)/dx where ΘT is the ellipticity at 222 nm measured at each temperature, T, Θmin is the minimal ellipticity, Θmax is the maximal ellipticity, T1/2 is the midpoint of the thermal transition, and dx is the slope of the transition. Crystallization—Purified ERRγ protein in S-75 purification buffer was complexed with a 3-fold molar excess of compounds 4-OHT or GSK4716 (50 mm stock in Me2SO) for 1.5 h at room temperature (with or without an equimolar amount of 1.5 mg/ml of peptide). The resulting protein or protein complexes were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to crystallization to remove any precipitated material. Crystallization trials using commercial screens for each protein complex were carried out using a hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in which drops containing 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of mother liquor solution were equilibrated above a 1-ml mother liquor reservoir. Different temperatures and conditions were required to optimize the crystal growth for each protein complexes. The optimal crystallization condition found for unliganded ERRγ protein was at 22 °C with a well buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mm CaCl2, 30% (w/v) PEG600, and 2% (w/v) PEG35K. The ERRγ complex containing a peptide representing residues 366-390 of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) was grown from 14% (w/v) PEG3350 and 0.2 m sodium formate at 22 °C. Cocrystallization of ERRγ·GSK4716·RIP140 peptide was carried out at 22 °C with a well buffer of 9%(w/v) PEG20K, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5. Cocrystals of ERRγ with 4-OHT were grown in 36% (w/v) PEG600, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1% zwittergent 3-16 at 10 °C. Cocrystals of a complex between ERRγ, 4-OHT, and a 21-residue peptide representing residues 1316-1337 of the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone action protein (SMRT) were grown from 0.2 m LiOAc and 7% (w/v) PEG3350. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—The unliganded ERRγ protein crystals and the cocrystals of ERRγ with 4-OHT were directly mounted onto cryoloops and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the remaining ERRγ complexes were harvested and placed in depression slides containing their respective well buffers at 4 °C. The ethylene glycol concentration of the well buffers was slowly increased in a stepwise fashion for cryopreservation of the crystals to a maximum concentration of 23% to 42% before these crystals were then mounted onto cryoloops and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at Sector 17 of Argonne National Laboratory on a MarCCD-165 detector and processed with HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The unliganded ERRγ structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Amore (14Navaza J. Gover S. Wolf W. Dodson E.J. Molecular Replacement: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury, UK1992: 87-90Google Scholar) using a search model composed of residues 306-329, 341-406, 426-455, 471-492, and 503-520 from the ERα LBD (pdb code 3ERT) (15Shiau A.K.

The protein was built with the program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The remaining structures were solved by molecular replacement using the unliganded ERRγ structure as the search model and were built and refined in a similar manner. Final refinements of all structures were carried out by the program Refmac5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar) and final building and validation was carried out with the Coot molecular graphics program (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar). Cavity and Ligand Volumes Calculations—Cavities were defined with the program MVP (21Lambert M.H. Charifson P.S. Practical Application of Computer-Aided Drug Design. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 243-303Google Scholar) by filling the pockets and covering the protein with layers of closely spaced water-sized spheres, and then using cluster analysis to identify distinct cavities. The cluster analysis defines the boundary between interior and exterior water-sized spheres by considering the degree to which the protein occludes the solid angle from the position of each sphere. Cavity volumes were then calculated using the program GRASP (22Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar) with a 0.2-Å grid, where the exterior water-sized spheres were included in the calculation to “cap” openings to the cavities. Explicit hydrogen atoms were added to the protein and ligand prior to sphere placement and volume calculations. X-ray Crystallography—Crystal structures of the ERRγ LBD were determined in three functional states: unliganded (both in the presence and absence of an LXXLL motif cofactor peptide from RIP140), bound to the agonist GSK4716 (with the same RIP140 peptide), and bound to inverse agonist 4-OHT (both in the presence and absence of a SMRT peptide). 3K.

ERRγ LBD adopts the canonical three-layered α-helical sandwich observed in other NR structures. In complex with a fragment of NR cofactor RIP140, apo-ERRγ crystallizes with one molecule per asymmetric unit, however, the same dimer is formed by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The crystal structures of unliganded ERRγ LBD in the presence or absence of the RIP140 fragment are similar (r.m.s.d. of Cα positions = 0.36 Å), and in both cases no density was observed in the pocket indicating that no small molecules (either carried along during the protein purification or from the crystallization buffer) were specifically bound. The RIP140 peptide is highly ordered between residues 378 and 386, which spans the region containing the NR-box LXXLL motif. The coactivator interacts via a charge clamp comprising Lys-284 on helix 3 and Glu-452 on the AF-2 helix. The ERRγ·RIP140 complex is similar to the previously reported apo-ERRγ·SRC1 complex (4Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An overlay of the Cα traces results in an r.m.s.d. of 0.38 Å for the Cα atoms in the ligand binding domains, and 0.39 Å for the Cα atoms in the two LXXLL peptides. Although most of the residues lining the ligand binding pocket are identical between the classic ERα and orphan ERRγ, a few changes in corresponding residues lead to the decrease in volume available for ligand binding. The most significant difference is ERRγ Phe-435, which corresponds to ERα Leu-525 and defines one side of the ERRγ pocket, preventing ERRγ from binding to common steroidal estrogens. More subtle changes that affect the available volume for ligand binding and ligand binding pocket topology include Ala-431 and Phe-450, which correspond to ERα Gly-521 and Leu-540, respectively. The volume of this apo-ERRγ ligand binding pocket, which is the pocket on the lower left in Fig. 2, was calculated with the GRASP/MVP procedure as 280 Å3. For comparison, the ERα ligand binding pocket has a volume of 480 Å3, as calculated with the same procedure. The GRASP/MVP procedure uses a fine grid and tends to return slightly higher calculated volumes than some other procedures, which may account for the differences in pocket volumes to those previously reported for these proteins. It is conceivable that small, phenol-containing molecules could bind to ERRγ, because the key phenol binding residues are conserved between the receptors (ERRγ Glu-275 and Arg-316 and ERα Glu-353 and Arg-394). Aside from the ligand binding pocket, there is also another pocket, toward the upper right in Fig. 2, with a volume of 390 Å3. This pocket is separated from the ligand binding pocket by Glu-275 and Arg-316. Inverse Agonist Complexes—The complex of ERRγ with the inverse agonist 4-OHT was crystallized with 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit but still forms a homodimer across a 2-fold axis in the crystal. Electron density for the 4-OH ligand is shown in Fig. 3A. The receptor adopts the canonical NR fold, and there are no significant conformational changes in helices 1-10 when compared with the apo crystal structures. However, the inverse agonist ligand binding significantly affects the end of helix 10 and the AF-2 helix. Phe-435 adopts a conformation different from that in the apo-ERRγ structure. The rotation of Phe-435 leads to a steric clash with Leu-454 and Phe-450 on the AF-2 helix. As a result, the AF-2 helix is displaced from its position capping the ligand binding pocket and appears to be partially disordered. The major AF-2 helix conformation visible in the electron density is closely related to that previously observed in the ERα·4-OHT structure, but it appears to exist in that conformation at no more than a 60% occupancy level. The displacement of the AF-2 helix would block the binding of any NR-box coactivator peptides. A previously reported structure of ERRγ·4-OHT involves similar placement of AF-2 helix. As in the ERα·4-OHT crystal structure, Glu-275 and Arg-316 (ERα Glu-353 and Arg-394) interact with the 4-hydroxy group of the ligand, confirming the functional conservation of the phenol binding site between the classic ERs and orphan ERRs. The complex between ERRγ, 4-OHT, and a SMRT peptide consists of six molecules in the asymmetric unit which effectively forms three homodimers. All six of the LBDs contain the 4-OHT ligand, which interacts as observed in the ERRγ·4-OHT complex. The electron density for one of the ligand molecules is shown in Fig. 3B. The AF-2 helix is significantly displaced from its position capping the binding pocket, with one molecule in each dimer having the AF-2 helix completely disordered. The other molecule in each dimer has a well ordered AF-2 helix, which interacts across a 2-fold axis with a molecule in a neighboring homodimer that has a disordered AF-2 helix. This interaction of the two homodimers in this fashion effectively makes a tetramer tied together by the interactions of the two AF-2 helices (Fig. 4). The 2-fold axis that relates these molecules is noncrystallographic for two of the homodimers in the asymmetric unit and crystallographic for the third homodimer, which forms a tetramer with a symmetry copy of itself in a neighboring asymmetric unit. One LBD from each of the homodimers binds the ordered region of a SMRT peptide (residues 1319 and 1330). The peptide interacts with the LBD in a manner similar to that seen in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-SMRT complex with the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix lying across the LBD near the ligand in a manner that would be prohibited by the AF-2 helix if it were in the agonist conformation (23Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Lys-284 from ERRγ provides a single “charge clamp” to the end of the SMRT helix via the backbone carbonyl of Leu-1328. The AF-2 helix interacts with the neighboring LBDs in much the same way we see the SMRT peptide in this complex interacting with residues 446-455 having an r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å between Cα atoms relative to the residues 1320-1329 of the SMRT peptide. The larger hydrophobic side chains found on the AF-2 helix appear to be responsible for the shift in position relative to the SMRT peptide; however, this does not prevent Lys-284 from binding to the carbonyl of Met-453 on the AF-2 helix. Agonist Complex—The structure of a ternary complex of ERRγ·RIP140 with the small molecule agonist GSK4716 reveals a homodimer of ERRγ, with the AF-2 helix in both molecules adopting the agonist conformation. The agonist ligand is visible in the pocket of one of the two molecules in the homodimer (Fig. 5). The global receptor conformation and coactivator binding are similar to the unliganded ERRγ structure. Notably, Phe-435 and Phe-450 do not rotate from their apo conformation to accommodate the binding of the agonist ligand. Instead, a small rearrangement of the receptor (overall Cα r.m.s.d. of 0.91 Å to the RIP140 structure) occurs primarily from the N terminus of helix 1 to the beginning of helix 3. There is marked movement of three residues, in particular Pro-246, Glu-247, and Lys-248, with Pro-246 showing the greatest movement (∼7.5 Å) relative to the unliganded conformation. As a result of this reorganization, there is an observable difference in the structure between helices 1 and 3 when comparing the unliganded and agonist-bound ERRγ structures (Fig. 6). The phenol-binding residues Glu-275 and Arg-316 are rotated to allow access to an additional pocket that was previously shielded from the classic estrogen binding site in a location remote from the AF-2 helix, which had a volume of 390 A3. The movement of phenolic binding residues and those centered around Pro-246 substantially change the shape of the original remote second pocket and result in the formation of a single combined pocket enclosing a volume of 610 Å3 (Fig. 6). The phenolic hydroxyl of GSK4716 interacts with Asp-328 near the surface of the receptor and does not make contact with Glu-275 and Arg-316. However, the carbonyl of the acyl hydrazone bridges to two water molecules, one of which interacts with Arg-316 (Fig. 7). Glu-275 is rotated into a conformation that allows it to make contact with Glu-247. The closest approach of the ligand to any residue on the AF-2 helix is between Phe-450 and th"

Dislocation requires a subclass of ubiquitin ligases that includes gp78 in addition to the AAA ATPase p97/VCP and its cofactor, the Ufd1-Npl4 dimer. We have previously reported that gp78 interacts directly with p97/VCP. Here, we identify a novel p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM) within gp78 that mediates this interaction. We demonstrate that the VIM of gp78 recruits p97/VCP to the ER, but has no effect on Ufd1 localization. We also show that gp78 VIM interacts with the ND1 domain of p97/VCP that was shown previously to be the binding site for Ufd1. To evaluate the role of Ufd1 in gp78-p97/VCP-mediated degradation of CD3δ, a known substrate of gp78, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of Ufd1 and p97/VCP. Inhibition of p97/VCP, but not Ufd1, stabilized CD3δ in cells that overexpress gp78. However, both p97/VCP and Ufd1 appear to be required for CD3δ degradation in cells expressing physiological levels of gp78. These results raise the possibility that Ufd1 and gp78 may bind p97/VCP in a mutually exclusive manner and suggest that gp78 might act in a Ufd1-independent degradation pathway for misfolded ER proteins, which operates in parallel with the previously established p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4-mediated mechanism.

Proteins destined for the secretory pathway are translocated into the lumen or inserted into the membrane of the ER where they are properly folded and modified before being delivered to their functional destinations (1Federovitch C.M.

These misfolded proteins are retained in the ER by a qualitycontrol mechanism and eliminated through a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin.

ERAD requires retrotranslocation, in which misfolded proteins are dislocated from the ER membrane into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasomes (7Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence from yeast indicates that the ATPase CDC48 in combination with its cofactors, the Ufd1-Npl4 dimer, are essential for retrotranslocation (8Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of CDC48, p97/VCP, in concert with Ufd1-Npl4 dimer, appears to play a similar role in mammalian cells (9Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A.

They must be recruited to the cytosolic surface of the ER to carry out the retrotranslocation process. In yeast, an ER membrane-anchored protein, Ubx2, plays a central role in coupling ubiquitination with retrotranslocation. Ubx2 recruits CDC48 along with the Ufd1-Npl4 dimer using its Ubx domain (11Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat.

In mammalian systems, p97/VCP interacts with a protein complex that contains at least four ER membrane-anchored proteins, the p97/VCP-interacting membrane protein (VIMP), Derlin-1, Derlin-2, and ERAD E3 Hrd1. The Ufd1-Npl4 dimer is also recruited along with p97/VCP by the four-protein complex (Fig. 1b) (16Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous reports that the p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is functionally required for ERAD in mammalian cells (9Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A.

However, the role of p97/VCP cofactors, Ufd1 and Npl4, in gp78-mediated ERAD is yet to be determined.In this study, we have identified a novel p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM) in the cytosolic tail of gp78 and in the N-terminal region of the small p97/VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) (21Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The VIM of gp78 interacts with the ND1 domain of p97/VCP, the reported binding site for SVIP, Ufd1, and p47, another p97/VCP cofactor required for Golgi and ER membrane fusion (22Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SVIP, Ufd1, and p47 are known to bind p97/VCP in a mutually exclusive manner. In the current study, our data suggest that gp78 and Ufd1 also bind p97/VCP in a mutually exclusive fashion. Functionally, gp78-mediated ERAD apparently requires p97/VCP but not Ufd1. We have also confirmed the presence of an Ufd1-dependent ERAD pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that gp78 may mediate an Ufd1-independent degradation pathway for misfolded ER proteins. This pathway appears to operate in parallel with the previously established p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4-mediated mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Antibodies—Mouse Ufd1 with an N-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pcDNA3-FLAG-Ufd1. To construct pFLAG-His-Npl4, His-Npl4 cDNA was excised from pQE9-Npl4 (generously provided by Dr. Chou-chi Li, NCI-Frederick) and then cloned into the pFLAG-CMV vector. The pFLAG-CMV-N (aa 1-198), ND1 (aa 1-470), D1 (aa 199-470), and D2 (aa 471-806) domains of mouse p97/VCP were generated based on a recent structural study (24DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-gp78 (mouse) was a gift from Dr. Jun Yotoka (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan). pcDNA3-gp78ΔVIM was created by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a stop codon that truncates the C-terminal 30 amino acids (VIM). To make recombinant GST-VIM, cDNA encoding the VIM of human gp78 was cloned into the pGEX4T3 vector (pGEX4T3-VIM). pCIneo-Hrd1-FLAG has been previously reported (18Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A pCIneo-Hrd1-VIM-FLAG chimera was generated by inserting cDNA encoding the VIM of mouse gp78 through a SacII site between the C terminus of Hrd1 and the FLAG tag of pCIneo-Hrd1-FLAG (18Zhong X.

Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Ufd1 antibody was generously provided by Dr. Hemmo Meyer (Swiss Federal School of Technology, Switzerland) and purchased from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-gp78 antibody (clone 2G5) was generated using recombinant GST-gp78C as antigen. 2G5 recognizes the epitope located between amino acids 497-578 of gp78.Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—For subcellular fractionation, 293 cells were transfected as indicated in the figure legends. Cell fractionation was carried out by homogenization in fractionation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm triethanolamine, and 0.32 m sucrose via passage through a 27-gauge syringe 20 times. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g to sediment unbroken cells, cell debris, and nuclei (pellet fraction (p)). The remaining supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet contained the microsomal fraction (m) and the supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction (c). All three fractions (m, c, and p) were further processed for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out following previously published protocols (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Interaction between GST-VIM and Purified p97/VCP—His-tagged p97/VCP, Ufd1, and Npl4 were expressed in E. coli after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged p97/VCP, Ufd1, and Npl4 in lysates were affinity-purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The in vitro binding assay was carried out essentially as previously reported (25Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μg of GST-VIM immobilized and purified on glutathione agarose beads was incubated with His-tagged p97/VCP, Ufd1, and Npl4 proteins (2 μg each) for 1 h at 4°C in binding buffer containing 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. After washing, GST-VIM-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.Fluorescence Microscopy—U2OS cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. For double immunofluorescent staining, gp78 and endogenous p97/VCP were labeled using rabbit anti-gp78 and mouse anti-p97/VCP antibodies in conjunction with Alexa Fluor-594 and Alexa Fluor-488. A similar procedure was used to label gp78 and Ufd1, as well as Hrd1/Hrd1 plus VIM and p97/VCP. Staining was performed as described previously (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Fluorescent microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescent microscope.Establishment of 293 Cell Lines That Stably Express HA-CD3δ or HA-CD3δ and gp78—293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-CD3δ or HA-CD3δ and gp78. pBABE vector conferring puromycin-resistance was co-transfected for stable clone selection. Twenty-four hours after transfection 2.5 μg/ml puromycin was added to eliminate nontransfected cells. Culture medium was refreshed every 3 days until cell colonies became evident. Positive clones expressing HA-CD3δ (CD3δ clones) or HA-CD3δ plus gp78 (CD3δ/gp78 clones) were characterized by immunoblotting and cycloheximide (CHX) chase analysis. CHX chase was performed as previously described (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).RNA Interference—pSUPER-gp78 siRNA1 was used to knockdown endogenous gp78 expression as previously reported (18Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Silencer ® pre-designed siRNAs target p97/VCP and Ufd1, as well as serves as a negative control, were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). CD3δ clone-5 and CD3δ/gp78 clone-20 cells were transfected with appropriate siRNA(s) using Lipofectamine 2000. 72 h after transfection cells were harvested and processed for further experiments.Pulse-chase Analysis—Pulse-chase analysis was performed essentially as we have previously described (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). CD3δ clone-5 and CD3δ/gp78 clone-20 cells with a knockdown of either p97/VCP or Ufd1 were pulse-labeled with a mixture of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (Redivue™ Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix, GE HealthCare) at a concentration of 200 μCi/ml for 30 min. After labeling, unincorporated l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine were removed and chased for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h. Labeled cells were processed for immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged CD3δ followed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive CD3δ was detected by a Typhoon scanner (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by Image-QuaNT (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTSIdentification of a Novel p97/VIM in gp78 and SVIP—Many p97/VCP-interacting proteins have been reported (26Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Wang Q.

In search of a common p97/VCP-interacting domain that might be present in different p97/VCP-interacting proteins, we identified a conserved amino acid sequence within the C-terminal portion of gp78 and the N-terminal region of SVIP, both of which have previously been found to bind p97/VCP (18Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We named this sequence the p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM). VIM comprises the C-terminal 30 amino acids of gp78 and is well conserved in vertebrates (examples are given in Fig. 2a). However, it is not present in the yeast Cue1p protein or Caenorhabditis elegans gp78. Consistently, Cue1p and C. elegans gp78 do not interact with p97/VCP (supplemental Fig. S1). Bioinformatic analysis predicts a helix formed by 17 amino acids (aa 625-641 in gp78 and aa 20-35 in SVIP, underscored in Fig. 2a) within the VIM of human gp78 and SVIP (29Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the VIM of gp78 is sufficient to bind p97/VCP, we assessed its ability to recruit p97/VCP to microsomal membranes. 293 cells were transfected with wt gp78 or its VIM deletion mutant (gp78ΔVIM) (Fig. 2b). Transfected cells were fractionated into cytosol (c) and ER-containing microsomal membrane (m) fraction where gp78 is generally localized, which we have previously reported (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Wild-type (wt) gp78 efficiently moves p97/VCP from the cytosol to the microsomes as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, b and c, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 1 and 2). Deletion of VIM from gp78 (gp78ΔVIM) largely diminishes this effect (Fig. 2b, lanes 10 and 11 versus lanes 4 and 5). To investigate the role of the E3 activity of gp78 in relocalization of p97/VCP, we examined the effects of gp78R2m on p97/VCP localization in cytosol and microsomal fractions. gp78R2m is an E3-inactive mutant form of gp78 with two defective zinc ligand residues in the RING finger (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The results showed that gp78R2m recruits p97/VCP from the cytosol to the microsomes (Fig. 2b, lanes 7 and 8 versus lanes 1 and 2) as efficiently as wt gp78 (Fig. 2b, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 7 and 8). These results strongly suggest that the VIM of gp78 interacts with and recruits p97/VCP from the cytosol to the ER and gp78 E3 activity is not required for p97/VCP relocalization.FIGURE 2Identification of a p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM) in gp78 and SVIP. a, alignments of the VIM of gp78 and SVIP. Hs, human; Rn, rat; Mm, mouse; aa, amino acid. Underscored is the predicted sequence that forms a helix. b, 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt gp78, or gp78ΔVIM, or gp78R2m. Empty vector was transfected as a negative control. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were fractionated into membrane (m) and cytosol (c). The initial pellet (p) obtained from clearing the homogenates was retained to monitor total levels of proteins. Endogenous p97/VCP was revealed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody. p97/VCP in the microsome (m) and cytosolic (c) fractions are framed for easy comparison. Transfected gp78 was detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-gp78 antibodies that do not recognize endogenous gp78 as previously reported (17Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). gp78 tends to form high molecular weight smears (arrow) due to oligomerization and autoubiquitination (17Fang S. Ferrone M.

Calnexin was blotted as an ER marker. c, 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt gp78 or empty vector as control. Transfected cells were analyzed as in b. Endogenous p97/VCP and Ufd1 were blotted using monoclonal antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A previous study has shown that VIMP, another ER-anchored p97/VCP-interacting membrane protein, co-localizes with p97/VCP in the ER (16Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Importantly, VIMP interacts with p97/VCP along with its cofactor, the Ufd1-Npl4 dimer (16Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). To determine whether gp78 could recruit p97/VCP along with Ufd1, a similar fractionation experiment to that shown in Fig. 2b was performed and the effects of gp78 on localization of endogenous Ufd1 were examined by immunoblotting. According to this data, gp78 has no apparent effect on Ufd1 localization despite the fact that p97/VCP is relocalized to the microsomes (Fig. 2c, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that gp78 interacts only with p97/VCP and that Ufd1 is not a part of the gp78-p97/VCP complex (Fig. 2c, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 4 and 5).Based on previous studies showing that SVIP, Ufd1, and p47 bind to the ND1 domain of p97/VCP in a mutually exclusive manner (21Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we reasoned that gp78 might also bind to the p97/VCP ND1 domain. A GST pull-down assay with GST fusion of the VIM of gp78 (GST-VIM) was designed to test this hypothesis. Various truncation mutants of p97/VCP (N (aa 1-198), ND1 (aa 1-470), D1 (aa 199-470), and D2 (aa 471-806) domain) tagged with FLAG were generated based on structural studies that pinpointed key structural domains of p97/VCP (Fig. 3a) (24DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In pull-down assays with 293 cell lysates, the VIM of gp78 interacted only with proteins containing the ND1 domain of p97/VCP (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, like Ufd1, p47, and SVIP, gp78 also binds to the ND1 domain of p97/VCP.FIGURE 3The VIM of gp78 interacts with the ND1 domain of p97/VCP. a, diagrammatic representation of p97/VCP and its mutants with N-terminal FLAG (FL) tag. b, GST-VIM interacts with the ND1 domain of p97/VCP. Lysates from 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged p97/VCP or FLAG-tagged N, ND1, D1, or D2 domain of p97/VCP were used for pull-down assays with GST-VIM from gp78. Only the full-length p97/VCP and its ND1 domain were pulled down by GST-VIM (lanes 1 and 2). Whole cell lysates (WCL) used for pull-down are shown in lanes 6-10. The lower panel shows Coomassie Blue staining of GST-VIM purified on glutathione agarose-beads used in the pull-down assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GST-VIM Interacts with p97/VCP but Not the p97/VCP-Ufd-Npl4 Complex—The interaction of gp78 with the ND1 domain of p97/VCP suggests that gp78 and Ufd1 might form mutually exclusive complexes with p97/VCP. To test this possibility, GST-VIM pull-down assays of lysates from 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Ufd1 and FLAG-His-tagged Npl4 were conducted. In these experiments, p97/VCP alone was associated with GST-VIM but not Ufd1-Npl4 or complexes between p97/VCP and Ufd1-Npl4 (Fig. 4a, lanes 4 and 12). Overexposing the blot did not reveal any additional bands (data not shown). These results further support the notion that the VIM of gp78 mediates the formation of the gp78 and p97/VCP complex from which Ufd1 is excluded. However, a second possibility also exists: p97/VCP might not be able to form a complex with Ufd1-Npl4 dimer under the conditions we used for the pull-down assay shown in Fig. 4a. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we carried out a pull-down of Npl4 with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-Ufd1, FLAG-His-Npl4, or both (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-4). Lysates prepared from the transfected cells were used for a pull-down assay with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting indicates that, indeed, p97/VCP, Ufd1, and Npl4, appear to be capable of forming a complex (Fig. 4b, lane 8) under conditions used for the GST-pull-down assay (Fig. 4a). Therefore, it is plausible that GST-VIM forms a complex with p97/VCP and excludes Ufd1-Npl4 from the complex.FIGURE 4GST-VIM interacts with p97/VCP, but not the p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex. a, GST-VIM pulls down p97/VCP, but not p97/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex. Lysates prepared from 293 cells transfected with FLAG-Ufd1 and FLAG-6His-Npl4 were used for GST-VIM pull-down. p97/VCP, but not Ufd1 and Npl4, were pulled down by GST-VIM (lanes 9-12). GST alone pulls down neither p97/VCP nor Ufd1 or Npl4 (lanes 5-8). Whole cell lysates (WCL) used for the pull-down assay are shown in lanes 1-4. b, p97/VCP, FLAG-Ufd1, and FLAG-6His-Npl4 form complex in cells. 293 cells transfected as in a were lysed and used for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarosebead pull-down of FLAG-6His-Npl4. p97/VCP and FLAG-Ufd1 are associated with FLAG-6His-Npl4 (lane 8). WCL used for pull-down is shown in lanes 1-4. c, GST-VIM of gp78 interacts with purified recombinant p97/VCP.

https://openalex.org/W2038994163,"Human lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that specifically removes methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3 (H3-K4). We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to characterize the substrate specificity and recognition by LSD1. Biochemical assays on histone peptides show that essentially all epigenetic modifications on the 21 N-terminal amino acids of histone H3 cause a significant reduction in enzymatic activity. Replacement of Lys4 with Arg greatly enhances binding affinity, and a histone peptide incorporating this mutation has a strong inhibitory power. Conversely, a peptide bearing a trimethylated Lys4 is only a weak inhibitor of the enzyme. Rapid kinetics measurements evidence that the enzyme is efficiently reoxidized by molecular oxygen with a second-order rate constant of 9.6 × 103 m-1 s-1, and that the presence of the reaction product does not greatly influence the rate of flavin reoxidation. In vivo experiments provide a correlation between the in vitro inhibitory properties of the tested peptides and their ability of affecting endogenous LSD1 activity. Our results show that epigenetic modifications on histone H3 need to be removed before Lys4 demethylation can efficiently occur. The complex formed by LSD1 with histone deacetylases 1/2 may function as a “double-blade razor” that first eliminates the acetyl groups from acetylated Lys residues and then removes the methyl group from Lys4. We suggest that after H3-K4 demethylation, LSD1 recruits the forthcoming chromatin remodelers leading to the introduction of gene repression marks.

Conversely, a peptide bearing a trimethylated Lys4 is only a weak inhibitor of the enzyme. Rapid kinetics measurements evidence that the enzyme is efficiently reoxidized by molecular oxygen with a second-order rate constant of 9.6 × 103 m-1 s-1, and that the presence of the reaction product does not greatly influence the rate of flavin reoxidation. In vivo experiments provide a correlation between the in vitro inhibitory properties of the tested peptides and their ability of affecting endogenous LSD1 activity. Our results show that epigenetic modifications on histone H3 need to be removed before Lys4 demethylation can efficiently occur. The complex formed by LSD1 with histone deacetylases 1/2 may function as a “double-blade razor” that first eliminates the acetyl groups from acetylated Lys residues and then removes the methyl group from Lys4. We suggest that after H3-K4 demethylation, LSD1 recruits the forthcoming chromatin remodelers leading to the introduction of gene repression marks. Post-translational modifications on histone proteins are fundamental epigenetic marks that control chromatin state and gene expression (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3186-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Histone lysine demethylases participate in the regulation of chromatin functional states by removing methyl groups from lysine residues on histone N-terminal tails. At present two different subclasses of histone lysine demethylases have been identified: the FAD-dependent histone demethylases (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A.

The LSD1 catalyzed reaction starts with the oxidation of the H3-K4 N-methyl group carried out by the FAD cofactor (Fig. 1). The resulting imine intermediate is then hydrolyzed generating the demethylated histone and formaldehyde.We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments in an effort to characterize LSD1 substrate specificity and mechanism of H3-K4 recognition. We provide evidence that oxygen can be the physiological electron acceptor, and that the enzyme is likely to function through a ternary complex mechanism. In addition, our data show that LSD1 can efficiently act only after removal of the other epigenetic modifications present on the same histone H3 N-terminal tail.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation and Steady-state Kinetics Measurements—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified. Human LSD1 lacking the N-terminal 157 amino acids was expressed and purified as described (6Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E.

Enzymatic activities were measured under aerobic conditions by using a peroxidase-coupled assay (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) on a Cary 100 UV/visible spectrophotometer. Peptides were purchased from Thermo Electron Corporation. Their purity was greater than 90% as checked by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. LSD1 inhibitors were tested by using the peroxidase-coupled assay in the presence of varied concentrations (2-100 μm) of monomethylated H3-K4 peptide and of the inhibitor under analysis (global range 1-300 μm, depending on the inhibitor strength). Initial velocity values were fitted to equations describing competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibition patterns using Grafit (Erithacus Software) to obtain the values of apparent kcat and Km along with their associated errors. Propagation of statistical error value was carried out as described (14Bevington P.H. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 56-62Google Scholar).Stopped Flow Kinetics of the Oxidative Half-reaction— Stopped flow kinetic experiments were performed using a SX17MV stopped-flow instrument equipped with a diode array detector (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). For these experiments, the enzyme was artificially reduced by preparing a solution of 10 μm enzyme in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, also containing benzyl viologen (1.0 μm), and xanthine (400 μm) in a total volume of 1.2 ml. After flushing this enzyme solution with nitrogen, enzyme reduction was initiated by adding 0.2-0.5 nm xanthine oxidase resulting in full reduction of LSD1 within 30 min. The reduced LSD1 was mixed with buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with varying oxygen concentrations. Upon mixing in the stopped-flow instrument, spectral scans were collected either in 4 or 8 ms intervals. The same experiment was repeated in the presence of 100 μm unmodified 21-amino acid histone H3 peptide. The spectral data were analyzed using the Pro-K software package (Applied Photophysics).Cell Line Maintenance and Peptide Transduction—HEK293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Celbio) and grown in humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transduced with selected peptides complexed with the Chariot reagent (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). In brief, 1 × 106 HEK293 cells/well were seeded in 35-mm culture plates and incubated until they were at 50% confluence. For each transduction reaction, 6 μl of a 1:10 diluted Chariot solution was added to 100 μl of sterile water, and 500 ng of peptide was diluted in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Peptide was added to Chariot dilution and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were overlaid with the Chariot-peptide complex, and 400 μl of serum-free medium was added to the overlay achieving the final transfection volume of 600 μl. One hour after transfection, 1 ml of complete growth medium was added to each well without removing the Chariot-peptide complex. Cells were incubated again at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 1.5 h. In control experiments, cells were treated with the Chariot reagent without peptide.Isolation of Total RNA and Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from treated or control cells using the RNA Wiz™ reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCRs were performed on the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using the iScrip™ one-step reverse transcription-PCR kit with SYBR® Green. The specificity of the amplifications was assessed by electrophoretic separation of the amplified products and melting curve analysis. The expression of the investigated genes was quantified after normalization with β2-microglobulin gene (B2M) expression. Primers used for amplification are the following: B2M forward TGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATGTATCT, B2M reverse TCTCTGCTCCCCACCTCTAAGT; β-actin forward GGAGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC, β-actin reverse GCTGGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAA; tubulin forward CTCTGTTCGCTCAGGTCCTTTTG, tubulin reverse GCCTCCTTCCGTACCACATCC; SCG10 forward GAAGAAAGACCTGTCCCTG, SCG10 reverse GTTTCAGCACCTGGGCCTCC; SCN1A forward CATCGCCTGTTGGACAGCTT, SCN1A reverse AGTGGTTGTTCCATTGTCATCAG.Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—Total proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and Western blot analysis was carried out using standard techniques. The antibodies used were anti-LSD1 ab17721 (Abcam) and anti-α/β-tubulin (Cell Signaling).RESULTSInfluence of Other Epigenetic Marks on Substrate Recognition and Enzymatic Activity—Substrate recognition by LSD1 is not confined to residues neighboring Lys4 but it is achieved through a network of specific interactions with the 21 N-terminal residues of histone H3 (4Shi Y.

The histone H3 N-terminal tail has many potential sites of epigenetic post-translational modifications, and it was shown that the locus Lys9-Ser10 is particularly important in affecting LSD1 activity (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To investigate how different epigenetic marks affect the LSD1 demethylation process, we tested several 21-amino acid peptides that in addition to being monomethylated on Lys4 contain other epigenetic covalent modifications (Fig. 2, a and b). For each peptide, we measured the enzymatic activity with a peroxidase-coupled assay (Ref. 13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and Table 1), and the resulting steady-state kinetic parameters were evaluated relatively to those obtained with the 21-amino acid monomethylated substrate (peptide 1).FIGURE 2a, sequence of the first 21-amino acids of histone H3 N-terminal tail.

Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab We first tested the effect of arginine methylation, an epigenetic mark that has been recently shown to be dynamically modulated (15Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Coonrod S. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y. Wysocka J. Sayegh J. Lee Y.H. Perlin J.R. Leonelli L. Sonbuchner L.S. McDonald C.H.

Monomethylation of Arg2 (peptide 2) decreased LSD1 activity by more than 80%, whereas a methyl group on Arg8 (peptide 3) made the peptide totally unable to function as a substrate. Arg17 monomethylation (peptide 4) had a lower effect mostly due to a decrease in binding affinity. We also found that peptide 3 hardly inhibits LSD1 (Ki > 100 μm) implying that methylation of Arg8 completely prevents binding to the enzyme.Next, we investigated the effect of lysine hyperacetylation, a post-translational modification of histone H3 that is associated with gene activation (3Biel M. Wascholowski V. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3186-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a monomethylated H3-K4 peptide acetylated at Lys9, Lys14, and Lys18 (peptide 5) was tested. This peptide did not exhibit any inhibitory or catalytic activity. This observation is in agreement with data reported by Shi et al. (11Shi Y. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) showing that hyperacetylated nucleosomes are less susceptible to CoREST/LSD1-mediated demethylation. Lysine acetylation seems to have an additive effect because acetylation at Lys9 causes a 6-fold reduction in activity (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas acetylation of all three Lys residues present in the 21-amino acid peptide leads to complete inactivation. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that Lys4 demethylation by LSD1 can be drastically reduced by other epigenetic marks present on the same histone H3 tail.The Essential Role of Gly12-Gly13 of Histone H3—To investigate whether LSD1 activity is influenced by specific stereochemical and conformational properties of the histone tail, we inserted point mutations in the H3-K4 monomethylated peptide sequence (Fig. 2, a and b). We designed two peptides, one with both Gly12 and Gly13 mutated to alanine (peptide 6) and another with Pro16 replaced by alanine (peptide 7). We chose glycine and proline as sites for mutagenesis because these amino acids can either restrain the peptide conformation (Pro16) or provide the peptide with the conformational flexibility and/or adaptability required for binding (Gly12-Gly13). Peptide 7 exhibited normal catalytic properties suggesting that the conformational constraint imposed by Pro16 ring was not critical for productive binding to LSD1. Conversely, peptide 6 did not function either as a substrate or as an effective inhibitor indicating that the double mutation at Gly12-Gly13 made the peptide unable to bind to the protein.Specificity at the H3-K4 Site—The three-dimensional structure determination of LSD1 in the substrate-free state reveals a deep negatively charged pocket in proximity of the FAD cofactor and a shallow groove that might form the substrate-binding site (17Stavropoulos P. Blobel G. Hoelz A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 7: 626-632Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Yang M. Gocke C.B. Luo X. Borek D. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Otwinowski Z. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We explored the specific properties of the Lys4 binding site by using a trimethylated H3-K4 peptide and a peptide bearing an arginine at position 4. In the former, the charge on Lys4 was embedded by the three methyl groups, whereas in the latter the positive charge was delocalized on the Arg guanidium group. As expected, we found that the trimethylated H3-K4 peptide (peptide 8) is not a substrate for LSD1, in agreement with the chemical nature of the flavin-dependent amine oxidation reaction that requires a free lone pair of electrons on the substrate nitrogen atom (19Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. The Enzymes-Protein Methyltransferases. Academic Press, San Francisco2006: 229-240Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptide 8 was found to competitively inhibit LSD1 (Ki, 20 μm, Fig. 2b) but to a lower extent compared with the unmodified product (Ki, 2 μm; Table 1) (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These data show that the enzyme senses the presence of the third methyl group so that LSD1 is both catalytically inactive against trimethylated Lys4 and unable to bind it with high affinity. In this respect, it is worthwhile to note that LSD1 is much more efficient in discriminating among H3-K4 methylation states compared with other chromatin remodeling enzymes (20Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Peña P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T. Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The peptide with Lys4 mutated to arginine (peptide 9) was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor of LSD1 with a measured Ki of 0.4 μm. Among the many peptides evaluated in this and previous studies (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Culhane J.C. Szewczuck L.M. Liu X. Da G. Marmorstein R. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4536-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), peptide 9 exhibits the highest binding affinity and inhibitory power. To exclude that this tight binding simply reflects a particularly favorable interaction between the delocalized charge on the guanidinium group and LSD1 active site, we also probed guanidine, phenyl guanidine, and arginine for potential LSD1 inhibition. None of these compounds exerted any inhibitory effect on LSD1 activity indicating that, although an Arg side chain at position 4 significantly improved peptide binding, guanidinium or the isolated arginine amino acid was unable to bind to LSD1. In a perspective of exploiting chromatin as a therapeutic target, knowledge on mechanisms of LSD1 inhibition may help future drug design studies.Oxygen Reactivity of LSD1—The LSD1-catalyzed demethylation reaction is an oxidative process that requires an electron acceptor to reoxidize FAD (Fig. 1). Although it has been shown that molecular oxygen can function as the electron acceptor substrate, other molecules were also shown to efficiently reoxidize the LSD1-bound flavin (6Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This raises several questions. Can dioxygen function as physiological electron acceptor? Does the reduced enzyme react with oxygen when it is still bound to the demethylated histone? What is the order of the events during the catalytic cycle? To clarify these issues, we investigated the kinetics of reduced LSD1 with oxygen at pH 7.5 and 25 °C by mixing a solution of artificially reduced enzyme with buffer solutions containing various concentrations of oxygen in the stopped-flow instrument (Fig. 3). A plot of the pseudo first-order rate constant versus oxygen concentration was linear (data not shown) giving a bimolecular rate constant of 9.6 × 103 m-1s-1. This value is comparable with the rate constants typically found in other flavin-dependent oxidases (23Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and indicates that LSD1 can be efficiently reoxidized by molecular oxygen. These observations suggest that in vivo, the enzyme likely acts as an oxidase using oxygen as the electron acceptor required for completion of the catalytic cycle. In addition, the measured rate constant value indicates that reoxidation by molecular oxygen is a relatively fast process compared with the turnover number measured in the steady-state kinetics experiments (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), implying that FAD reoxidation is not rate-limiting in the demethylation reaction. To dissect the order of events during the catalytic cycle, we analyzed the kinetics of the oxygen reaction in the presence of an unmodified histone H3 peptide known to be a LSD1 inhibitor (13Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41360-41365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (peptide 10, Table 1). Addition of such peptide in stopped-flow measurements did not markedly influence the reoxidation rate (Fig. 3), suggesting that, after Lys4 demethylation, FAD can be reoxidized by oxygen before release of the demethylated product, i.e. LSD1 is likely to function through a ternary complex mechanism (23Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This observation has two important implications. First, in the case of a dimethylated H3-K4 substrate, the two methyl groups can be sequentially removed, whereas the protein stays bound to the histone substrate. Second, after completion of the oxidative demethylation reaction, LSD1 can remain firmly attached to the histone, functioning as a docking element for the LSD1-containing corepressor complexes.FIGURE 3Spectral changes observed upon mixing 10 μm fully reduced LSD1 with buffer containing 1.14 mm O2. Spectra were collected every 4 ms; only spectra obtained with 20-ms intervals are shown. After deconvolution, the spectral data could be fitted with a single exponential decay function yielding a rate of 5.5 s-1. The inset shows the absorbency at 458 nm as a function of time (black line). The gray line in the inset refers to an analogous experiment performed in the presence of 100 μm inhibitor (peptide 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vivo Assays of LSD1 Inhibition—To further investigate the ability of LSD1 to bind to a demethylated histone peptide, we performed an in vivo transduction experiment by delivering peptides into cells (Fig. 4, a and b).

Here we demonstrate, using sedimentation and size exclusion chromatography, that small amounts of detergent-insoluble PrP aggregates are present in uninfected human brains. Moreover, PK-resistant PrP core fragments are detectable following PK treatment. This is the first study that provides experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that there might be silent prions lying dormant in normal human brains. Human prion diseases may be sporadic, familial, or acquired by infection, and include four major phenotypes: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 3The abbreviations used are: CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PK, proteinase K; PrPC, cellular prion protein; PrPSc, pathological, scrapie isoform of prion protein; PrP*, PrPSc precursor; iPrP, insoluble PrP; g5p, Fd gene 5 protein; NaPTA, sodium phosphotungstate; PrP*20, PK-resistant PrP fragment migrating at ∼20 kDa; PrP*18, PK-resistant PrP fragment migrating at ∼18 kDa; PrP-(27–30), PK-resistant PrP fragment migrating at ∼27–30 kDa; PrP-CTF12/13, PK-resistant PrP C-terminal fragment migrating at ∼12 and 13 kDa; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonic acid; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; non-PrD, non-prion disease; sCJD, sporadic CJD; rPrP, recombinant PrP.

The central event in the pathogenesis of all forms of prion disease involves a conversion of the host-encoded cellular prion protein PrPC to its pathogenic conformer PrPSc (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

Whereas PrPC is detergent-soluble and sensitive to proteinase K (PK) digestion, PrPSc forms detergent-insoluble aggregates and is partially resistant to PK (3Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M.

The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is known to involve a conformational transition of an α-helical to a β-sheet structure of the protein (8Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but the in vivo pathway is still poorly understood. Two non-exclusive conversion models have been put forward: refolding (11Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 12Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) and seeding (13Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). In the refolding model, the exogenous PrPSc binds to a PrPC species that has been partially unfolded and the PrPSc-bound PrPC molecule undergoes a refolding process, during which nascent PrPSc is derived from this PrPC species via a conformational transition. The seeding or nucleation-polymerization model proposes that a small amount of abnormal PrPSc or PrPSc precursor (PrP*) is present in the normal brain and is in reversible equilibrium with PrPC. When several precursor monomeric PrP* molecules form a highly ordered nucleus, PrPC can be converted to PrPSc polymers. Clearly, two key elements are required by the seeding model. One is the presence of a small amount of endogenous PrPSc or PrP* in the uninfected brain and the second is the formation of PrPSc-derived oligomers. The seeding model, with the two elements, has been recapitulated in vitro using PrP from various fungal and mammalian sources (14Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol.

However, this hypothetical endogenous PrPSc, PrP* or “silent prion” has yet to be identified in the uninfected brains (13Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 19Weissmann C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20Hall D.

We isolated and characterized insoluble PrP aggregates (designated iPrP) from uninfected human brains using sedimentation and size exclusion chromatography. Our data demonstrate that this isoform accounts for about 5–25% of total PrP including full-length and N-terminal truncated forms present in uninfected brains and that it can be captured by Fd gene 5 protein (g5p) and sodium phosphotungstate (NaPTA), two reagents that specifically bind to PrPSc but not to PrPC (21Zou W.Q.

The state of the various PrP species range from a monomer to small oligomers (less than 200 kDa), to large aggregates (equal to or greater than 2,000 kDa). Moreover, we observed in these brains protease-resistant PrP core fragments migrating at ∼20, 18–19, and ∼7 kDa on immunoblots, after PK digestion and deglycosylation using anti-PrP antibodies. These PK-resistant PrP fragments are derived from the detergent-insoluble fraction (P2) and are present in the fraction captured with g5p. Reagents and Antibodies—NaPTA, PK, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used following the manufacturer's protocol. Urea, CHAPS, dl-dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, tributylphosphine, Ampholine pH 3–10, and immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (pH 3–10, 11 cm long), and antibody stripping solution were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, tosyl-activated) were from Dynal Co. (Oslo, Norway). Anti-PrP antibodies, including rabbit antiserum (anti-C) immunoreactive to human PrP residues 220–231 (23Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody was from Clontech. Preparation of Gene 5 Protein (g5p)—The g5p was isolated from Escherichia coli TG1(f+) cells following infection with fd bacteriophage. Purification was performed using DNA cellulose affinity and CM-ion exchange chromatography as described (25Oliver A.W. Bogdarina I. Schroeder E. Taylor I.A. Kneale G.G J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The purity was >99% as determined by quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained bands on SDS-PAGE. Brain Tissues—Consent to use autopsy material for research purposes was obtained for all human brain samples. Autopsy was performed within 20 h from death. Biopsy brain tissues were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and then transferred to –80 °C for future use. Clinical data and relevant hospital records were examined. The normal human brains were obtained from subjects free of neurological disorders and PrP mutations as indicated by neurohistology, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and genetic analysis at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (Cleveland, OH). Six cases including 4 autopsies and 2 biopsies were used and the average age at death was 61 ± 10 years (49–79 years). In addition, 14 sCJD cases were used as controls. The uninfected brain tissues from transgenic mice expressing 2-fold human PrP (26Kong Q. Huang S. Zou W.Q. Vanegas D. Wang M. Wu D. Yuan J. Zheng M. Bai H. Deng H. Chen K. Jenny A.L. O'Rourke K.

Preparation of Brain Homogenate and Detergent-soluble (S2) and -Insoluble (P2) Fractions—The 10% (w/v) brain homogenates were prepared in 9 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) on ice using pestles with microtubes driven by a cordless motor. When required, brain homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect supernatant (S1). To prepare S2 and P2 fractions, S1 were further centrifuged at 35,000 rpm (100,000 × g) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 1 h at 4°C. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatants that contain the detergent-soluble fraction were transferred into a clean tube. After being washed gently with 1× lysis buffer twice to remove residual supernatant proteins, the pellets that contain detergent-insoluble fraction (P2) were further resuspended in the lysis buffer as described (27Zou W.Q.

Velocity Sedimentation in Sucrose Step Gradients—Supernatant prepared by centrifugation of 20% brain homogenate at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C was incubated with an equal volume of 2% Sarcosyl for 30 min on ice. The sample was loaded atop 10–60% step sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 200,000 × g in the SW55 rotor for 1 h at 4°C as described with minor modifications (28Tzaban S. Friedlander G.

Kang S.C. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the contents of the centrifuge tubes were sequentially removed from the top to the bottom to collect 12 fractions. Aliquots of 12 fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Superdex 200 HR beads (GE Healthcare) in a 1 × 30-cm column were used to determine the oligomeric state of PrP molecules. Chromatography was performed in an fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and fractions of 0.25 ml each were collected as described (28Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In brief, 200-μl samples, prepared as described above (sucrose step gradients), were injected into the column for each size exclusion run. The molecular weight (Mr) of the various PrP species recovered in different fast protein liquid chromatography fractions was evaluated according to a calibration curve generated with the gel filtration of molecular mass markers (Sigma) including dextran blue (2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferittin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). These standards were loaded independently at the concentrations recommended by Sigma in 200-μl sample volumes. The elution volume of blue dextran was used to determine the void volume (V0 = 8.45 ml) and the total volume (Vt = 24 ml) was provided by the product instruction. The peak elution volumes (Ve) were calculated from the chromatogram and fractional retentions. Kav were calculated using the equations: Kav = (Ve–V0)/(Vt–V0) (30Eggington J.M. Haruta N. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The calibration curve was determined by plotting the Kav of the protein standards against the log Mr of the standards (30Eggington J.M. Haruta N. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Capture of PrP by g5p—The g5p molecule (100 μg) was conjugated to 7 × 108 tosyl-activated magnetic beads in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 20 h (21Zou W.Q. Zheng J. Gray D.M. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The g5p-conjugated beads were incubated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to block nonspecific binding. The prepared g5p beads were stable for at least 3 months at 4 °C. The capture of PrP by g5p was performed as described (21Zou W.Q. Zheng J. Gray D.M. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) incubating S1 fractions or P2 with g5p-conjugated beads (10 μg of protein/6 × 107 beads) in 1 ml of binding buffer (3% Tween 20, 3% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, pH 7.5). After incubation with constant rotation for 3 h at room temperature, the PrP-containing g5p beads were attracted to the sidewall of Eppendorf tubes by external magnetic force, allowing easy removal of all unbound molecules in the solution. Following three washes in wash buffer (2% Tween 20 and 2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, pH 7.5), the g5p beads were collected and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (3% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Precipitation of PrP by NaPTA—Precipitation of PrP by NaPTA was conducted as described (31Wadsworth J.D. Joiner S. Hill A.F. Campbell T.A. Desbruslais M. Luthert P.J. Collinge J. Lancet. 2001; 358: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 10% (w/v) homogenates from brain tissues were prepared in PBS lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+. The samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A 500-μl aliquot of supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 4% (w/v) Sarcosyl prepared in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. Samples were adjusted to final concentrations of 50 units/ml Benzonase (Benzon nuclease, Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ) and 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. Subsequently, the samples were adjusted to a final concentration in the sample of 0.3% (w/v) NaPTA with 81.3 μl of a stock solution containing 4% (w/v) NaPTA and 170 mm MgCl2. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with constant agitation before centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 1× lysis buffer for Western blotting as described below. One- and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved either on 15% Tris-HCl Criterion pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) for one-dimensional gel electrophoresis or IPG strips for the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by the supplier using the PROTEIN IEF cell (Bio-Rad) (27Zou W.Q. Capellari S. Parchi P. Sy M.S. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol.

Samples denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer were incubated with reducing buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 5 mm tributylphosphine, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 200 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h. Proteins were precipitated with a 5-fold volume of pre-chilled methanol at –20 °C for 2 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Ampholine pH 3–10, and trace amounts of bromphenol blue). The pellets were dissolved in rehydration buffer and subsequently incubated with the IPG strips for 14 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The dehydrated gel strips were transferred onto a focusing tray and focused for about 40 kV·h. The focused IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in equilibration buffer 1 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 130 mm dithiothreitol, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8), and then another 15 min in equilibration buffer 2 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 135 mm iodoacetamide, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). The equilibrated strips were loaded onto the 8–16% Tris-HCl Criterion pre-cast gel (Bio-Rad). The proteins on the gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore) for 2 h at 70 V. For probing of the PrP or caveolin-1, the membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-PrP antibodies including 3F4 (1:40,000), 1E4 (1:500), anti-C (1:4,000), 6H4 (1:10,000), or anti-caveolin-1 (1:5,000) as the primary antibody. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 1:3,000, the PrP or caveolin-1 bands or spots were visualized on Kodak film by ECL Plus as described by the manufacturer. Detergent-insoluble PrP Species Are Present in Uninfected Human Brains—It has been shown that PrPC is recovered in a soluble fraction (S2), following ultracentrifugation in nondenaturing detergents at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, whereas PrPSc is recovered in an insoluble fraction (P2) (6Hope J. Morton L.J. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 7Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). When we applied this separation procedure to human brain tissues, free of prion diseases (non-PrD), as expected, most of the PrPC was recovered in the S2 fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, a small amount of PrP was consistently detectable in the P2 fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitative densitometric analysis of immunoblots probed with 3F4 antibody showed that 96% of the PrP detected was recovered in S2 as a soluble form, whereas 4% of the PrP was recovered in P2 as a detergent-insoluble form (mean ± S.D.: 96 ± 2 versus 4 ± 2%, n = 6) (Fig. 1A). An increased intensity of PrP staining was observed in P2 on the blot re-probed with anti-C (mean ± S.D.: 75 ± 9 (S2) versus 25 ± 9% (P2), n = 6) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that predominant PrP distributed in P2 is N-terminal truncated. Taken together, PrP recovered in P2 accounted for ∼5–25% of total PrP including full-length and N-terminal-truncated species. This novel isoform, termed insoluble PrP (iPrP), had a banding profile different from that of soluble PrPC in the immunoblot probed with 3F4 (Fig. 1, A and C). In normal human brains, PrPC from S2 always possesses a dominant upper band. The intensity of the middle PrP band is often similar or less than that of the upper band. However, the intensity of its low band normally is the lowest among the three PrP bands (Fig. 1C, middle panel). By contrast, the ratio of the low to upper PrP band of the iPrP species significantly increased, which is similar to that found with PrPSc (1Gambetti P. Kong Q. Zou W.Q. Parchi P. Chen S.G. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 213-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, left and right panels). Following PK treatment, the PK-resistant core fragment (termed PrP-(27–30)) was only detected with 3F4 in PrPSc, but not in either iPrP or PrPC (Fig. 1C). Uninfected Human Brains Contain PrP Aggregates That Are Typically Detected in Prion-infected Brains—It is conceivable that the iPrP molecules also form aggregates in uninfected human brains. To investigate this possibility, velocity sedimentation of PrP in sucrose step gradients from 10 to 60% was conducted. Various PrP species including PK-sensitive aggregates of heterogeneous sizes can be separated by this procedure into several fractions based upon distinct molecular densities, sizes, and shapes (28Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Pan T. Wong P. Chang B. Li C. Li R. Kang S.C. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The abundant PrP from the brains of non-PrD was distributed through the upper fractions from 1 to 4 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, PrP from brains infected with prion disease was predominantly recovered in the bottom fractions from 9 to 12 (Fig. 2B). The distribution profile of PrP from non-PrD and sCJD was significantly different. The majority of PrP species recovered in the top fractions from non-PrD represent PrPC that consisted mainly of detergent-soluble monomers. The increased PrP in fractions 9–12 from sCJD indicate that PrPSc formed large aggregates that fractionated toward the bottom of the sucrose gradients (28Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Pan T. Wong P. Chang B. Li C. Li R. Kang S.C. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, small amounts of PrP were also consistently detectable in the bottom fractions derived from the brains of non-PrD. The amount of PrP aggregates precipitating in bottom fractions 9–12 (Fig. 2, A and C) accounted for ∼5% of the total PrP in non-PrD (n = 6), similar to the amount of iPrP detected with 3F4 in fraction P2 (Fig. 1). By contrast, the PrPSc aggregates in fractions 9–12 from sCJD brain homogenates (n = 4) accounted for ∼50.4% of the total PrP (Fig. 2, B and C). The high reproducibility of finding of PrP aggregates in 6 non-PrD brains including 2 biopsy brain samples makes it unlikely that they are a product of postmortem autolysis. We then conducted a comparison of PrP levels in the top and bottom fractions between non-PrD and sCJD on a single blot, which should determine more precisely the changes in the exact amounts of the PrP species in these fractions. Equal volumes of samples from either the top (fraction 1), or the bottom (fraction 9), of a non-PrD and two sCJD cases, were each loaded into the same gel. Compared with non-PrD, the level and/or banding pattern of PrP in fraction 1 (top) for sCJD was profoundly different, in addition to a significant increase in the amount of PrP in fraction 9 (bottom) (Fig. 2D). Therefore, in the brains with non-PrD, whereas most PrP species consisting of monomeric PrPC were recovered in the top fractions of sucrose gradients, there were also small amounts of PrP recovered in the bottom fractions. Because these PrP species were present in all bottom fractions, the density and size must have increased continuously, which is an indication of aggregation of the PrP (28Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Pan T. Wong P. Chang B. Li C. Li R. Kang S.C. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the sCJD-affected brains, the PrP species in the bottom fractions significantly increased, whereas PrP in the top fractions decreased, indicating that most of the PrP species was in aggregate form, along with a decrease in the level of PrPC, a result consistent with our recent study on characterization of PrP in the most common subtype of sCJD (33Cali I. Capellari S. Yuan J. Al-Shekhlee A. Cohen M.L. Xiao X. Moleres F.J. Parchi P. Zou W.Q. Gambetti P. Brain. 2006; 129: 2266-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, we also investigated hamsters and cows to see if the finding of the presence of iPrP in uninfected human brains is seen in other animals. A small amount of PrP was also detectable in the sucrose gradient bottom fractions of uninfected cow and hamster brains (Fig. 2, E and F). We next examined another membrane protein caveolin-1, as a control, to confirm that this assay is able to faithfully determine the oligomeric state of a membrane protein. Caveolin-1 is mainly localized in plasma-membrane caveolae and may also have soluble cytoplasmic and secreted forms (34Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Ann. Med. 2004; 36: 584-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that both recombinant and endogenous caveolin-1 form high molecular mass oligomers of 200–400 kDa in vitro and in vivo (35Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). After stripping 3F4 from used Western blots, we re-probed the blots with rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody. Caveolin-1 from both uninfected and prioninfected human brains was mostly distributed in fractions 2–6, although it was also observed in other fractions (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared with non-PrD, sCJD had higher levels of caveolin-1 in fractions 2–6. Therefore, in the uninfected human brains the membrane protein caveolin-1 is mainly present as small oligomers and small amounts of large aggregates are also detectable, which is different from the membrane protein PrPC. Prion-infected human brain showed an increase in the amounts of only oligomeric caveolin-1 but not large caveolin-1 aggregates. This is inconsistent with the distribution of PrP. The Size of iPrP Aggregates in Uninfected Human Brains Is Similar to That of PrPSc Aggregates Present in Prion-infected Brains—The size of the various PrP conformers of non-PrD samples was further characterized using size exclusion chromatography (also called gel filtration). We first generated a calibration curve with seven molecular mass markers from Sigma (Fig. 4A). We then examined the Mr of PrP from non-PrD and sCJD. PrP f"

Here, we investigated the influence of polysialic acid on NMDA receptor activity. We found that glutamate-elicited NMDA receptor currents in cultured hippocampal neurons were reduced by ≈30% with the application of polysialic acid or polysialylated NCAM but not by the sialic acid monomer, chondroitin sulfate, or non-polysialylated NCAM. Polysialic acid inhibited NMDA receptor currents elicited by 3 μm glutamate but not by 30 μm glutamate, suggesting that polysialic acid acts as a competitive antagonist, possibly at the glutamate binding site. The polysialic acid induced effects were mimicked and fully occluded by the NR2B subunit specific antagonist, ifenprodil. Recordings from single synaptosomal NMDA receptors reconstituted in lipid bilayers revealed that polysialic acid reduced open probability but not the conductance of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in a polysialic acid and glutamate concentration-dependent manner. The activity of single NR2B-lacking synaptosomal NMDA receptors was not affected by polysialic acid. Application of polysialic acid to hippocampal cultures reduced excitotoxic cell death induced by low micromolar concentration of glutamate via activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, whereas enzymatic removal of polysialic acid resulted in increased cell death that occluded glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These observations indicate that the cell adhesion molecule-associated glycan polysialic acid is able to prevent excitotoxicity via inhibition of NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors.

Cell interactions play important roles during development and in maintenance and modification of synaptic functions in the adult. The question is whether recognition molecules that specify and modulate contacts between neural cells may influence other parameters essential for nervous system function, such as neurotransmitter release and receptor activity. Among the recognition molecules with widespread functions is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) 4The abbreviations used are: NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; CA, colominic acid; endo-N, endoneuraminidase-N; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors; PSA, polysialic acid; PSA-NCAM, polysialylated NCAM; SA, sialic acid; MOPS, 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; CV, coefficient of variation; APV, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate subtype of glutamate. 4The abbreviations used are: NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; CA, colominic acid; endo-N, endoneuraminidase-N; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors; PSA, polysialic acid; PSA-NCAM, polysialylated NCAM; SA, sialic acid; MOPS, 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; CV, coefficient of variation; APV, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate subtype of glutamate. that starts to be expressed at the time of neural tube closure and remains detectable at lower levels in the adult. Its importance in shaping synaptic functions in the adult has long been recognized (1Persohn E. Pollerberg G.E. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Lüthi A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). NCAM is unique among recognition molecules in that its adhesive and concomitant signal transduction functions are modified by an unusual glycan, polysialic acid, a highly negatively charged and voluminous carbohydrate, which is regulated by its attachment to the protein backbone (3Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). PSA is a polymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues with chain lengths of up to 200 residues. It has not been detected on other recognition molecules. PSA is synthesized by two sialyltransferases, ST8Sia-II and ST8Sia-IV, and attached to the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of NCAM (4Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Even more so than the protein backbone of NCAM, expression of PSA is developmentally regulated, with high expression during embryonic stages and gradual reduction as development proceeds. However, it remains expressed in some areas of the brain during adulthood, including the hippocampus, which undergoes functional changes underlying synaptic plasticity. In particular, PSA-NCAM is required for NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation and spatial learning (5Becker C.G. Artola A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Becker T. Welzl H. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 6Muller D. Wang C. Skibo G. Toni N. Cremer H. Calaora V. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The NMDARs are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are found widely throughout the brain. NMDARs are heteromers assembled from the NMDAR subunit NR1 and at least one type of NR2 subunit (10Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). CA1 pyramidal cells, for instance, express mostly two different NR2 subunits, NR2A and NR2B, and perinatally, NR2D (11Kirson E.D. Schirra C. Konnerth A. Yaari Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 99-111Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is believed that the different NR2 subunits confer distinct gating and pharmacological properties to NMDARs (12Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar) and couple them to distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms (13Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which may shape their characteristic roles in synaptic plasticity (14Kohr G. Jensen V. Koester H.J. Mihaljevic A.L. Utvik J.K.

Bashir Z.I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7821-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). NMDARs are expressed both synaptically and extra-synaptically. The subunit composition at these locations is not uniform; synaptic NMDARs predominantly contain NR2A, whereas extra-synaptic NMDARs contain mostly the NR2B subunit (17Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although recent data in mature cultured hippocampal neurons support a view that both subtypes can be located in either synaptic or extrasynaptic compartments (18Thomas C.G. Miller A.J. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Importantly, synaptic and extra-synaptic NMDARs may activate opposing pathways to prevent or induce glutamate-induced excitotoxic cell death, respectively (19Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that there are intriguing links between PSA-NCAM and glutamate receptors. NMDARs are co-redistributed with NCAM after induction of long-term potentiation (20Fux C.M. Krug M. Dityatev A. Schuster T. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 931-942Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and NCAM associates with the postsynaptic spectrin-based scaffold cross-linking NCAM with the NMDAR and calmodulin kinase IIα (21Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Nikonenko A.G. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Activity of NMDARs is required for PSA-NCAM-stimulated synaptogenesis (22Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Sytnyk V. Delling M. Toni N. Nikonenko I. Muller D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9372-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and PSA directly increases the probability of the open state of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate subtype of glutamate (AMPA) receptors (23Vaithianathan T. Matthias K. Bahr B. Schachner M. Suppiramaniam V. Dityatev A. Steinhauser C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47975-47984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether PSA may also modulate NMDARs, we examined the effects of PSA on glutamate-evoked NMDAR currents in cultured hippocampal neurons and synaptosomal NMDARs incorporated in artificial lipid bilayers. Chemicals—Polymers containing 25–50 sialic acid residues were purified from colominic acid (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) using anion exchange chromatography on a Hamilton PRPX column dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 0–500 mm NaCl and detected at 214 nm (24Hallenbeck P.C. Yu F. Troy F.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The concentration was determined using a colorimetric resorcinol method adapted to microtiter plate format (25Bhavanandan V.P. Sheykhnazari M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mouse PSA-NCAM-Fc, containing the extracellular domain of NCAM and the Fc portion of human IgG, was produced according to Vutskits et al. (26Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a stably transfected TE671 cell line kindly provided by Genevieve Rougon. Mouse NCAM-Fc was produced using stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described (27Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Polysialylation of PSA-NCAM-Fc and PSA negativity of NCAM-Fc were checked by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (clone 735) to PSA (23Vaithianathan T. Matthias K. Bahr B. Schachner M.

Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recombinant endoneuraminidase-N (Endo-N) (0.2 μg/ml), which specifically cleaves the long-chain PSA residues from the NCAM protein backbone (29Gerardy-Schahn R. Bethe A. Brennecke T. Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Ziesing S. Lottspeich F. Frosch M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was used to remove PSA from cultured neurons. The efficacy of this enzymatic treatment was confirmed by the loss of PSA immunoreactivity using the monoclonal antibody to PSA. Electrophysiological Recordings in Cultured Neurons—All recordings were performed in the whole-cell patch clamp mode at room temperature in extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm d-glucose, 12 mm d-sucrose, adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. In some experiments, as indicated under “Results,” modified solutions with 0 mm Ca2+ or 1.5 mm Mg2+ were used. Patch pipettes were filled with 135 mm CsCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.2 mm Na-GTP, 10 mm d-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH with an osmolarity of 290–320 mosmol/liter. Fire-polished patch pipettes with a resistance of 2–4 megaohms were pulled on a DMZ-Universal puller (Zeitz, Munich, Germany) using GB150F-8P borosilicate glass (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany). Dissociated hippocampal cultures used for recordings were prepared from 1–3-day-old mice (30Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Schachner M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and maintained in vitro for 12–20 days. In these relatively mature neurons, the composition of NMDARs appeared to be stable (18Thomas C.G. Miller A.J. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To isolate NMDAR currents in neurons, tetrodotoxin (1 μm, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), tetraethylammonium chloride (10 mm, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (5 μm, Tocris, Bristol, UK), (RS)-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (100 μm, Tocris), and picrotoxin (100 μm, Tocris) were added to the extracellular solution. These compounds were applied to block Na+ and K+ voltage-dependent channels and γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, glycine, and non-NMDA glutamate receptors. Cells were voltage-clamped using an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) at –60 mV with a series of voltage steps from –100 to +60 mV every 3 s, with each step lasting 100 ms. NMDAR currents were evoked by glutamate (3, 5, or 30 μm), which was applied using a multiple input, single-barrel application system that allowed direct application onto the patched cell. Glutamate rather than NMDA was used in our experiments since it is a natural ligand of NMDARs, and thus, the data obtained are easier to relate to physiological processes in the brain. Control experiments were performed to verify that solutions coming from different inputs did not interfere with each other. Compounds were applied for 10 s with a 60-s washout period between applications. The current/voltage relationships were plotted in Sigma Plot 5.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) after subtraction of the leak current and averaging currents elicited by four voltage steps during the application of glutamate. The leak current was the average of the five voltage steps before agonist application. Currents were normalized using the value recorded in the presence of glutamate at +60 mV. Statistical comparisons of the current/voltage curves were done in Statistica 5.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK) using analysis of variance with “voltage” and “treatment” as repeated measures. To evaluate whether PSA induces changes in the conductance or gating of NMDAR channels in cultures, the fluctuation analysis of glutamate-activated NMDAR currents was performed (31Heinemann S.H. Conti F. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Tsvetkov E. Carlezon W.A. Benes F.M. Kandel E.R. Bolshakov V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The coefficient of variation was calculated for glutamate-evoked NMDAR currents at –60 mV as the following ratio: CV = [(variance (glutamate response)–variance (base line)]1/2/[mean (glutamate response)–mean (base line)]. This measure is useful in light of the following considerations. The mean and variance of current generated by n independent channels, which are open with a probability p and have a conductance q, are described by a binomial law and equal to q·n·p and q2·n·p·(1–p), respectively. Then CV–2 = n·p/(1–p) is a measure of variability that does not depend on q and changes only when the number of channels or their open probability is changed. Any changes in q alone would not affect this measure. Using these equations one can derive that the ratio between mean currents before and after inhibition of channel activity (x) would be proportional to the ratio between corresponding CV–2 (y). The x,y values would lie along the line of identity (y = x) if inhibition is exclusively due to reduction in number of channels (Fig. 2B). If inhibition of channel activity is due to reduction in open probability, the x,y values would be below y = x. The x,y values would lie along the line y = 1 if reduction in q mediates inhibition. Synaptosomal Preparation—The synaptosomes were prepared as described elsewhere (33Johnson M.W. Chotiner J.K. Watson J.B. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The hippocampi were isolated from 7–10 days old Sprague-Dawley rats and homogenized in an Eppendorf tube with 400 μl of ice-cold 95% O2, 5% CO2-aerated Krebs-Henseleit buffer consisting of 118.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 24.9 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dextrose, with the pH adjusted to 7.4. Leupeptin (0.01 mg/ml), pepstatin A (0.005 mg/ml), aprotinin (0.10 mg/ml), adenosine deaminase (10 mg/ml), and benzamide (5 mm) were added to the buffer to minimize proteolysis. The homogenate was diluted with 1.60 ml of additional Krebs buffer after being homogenized with 5 turns of a handheld pestle. The mixture loaded into the 1-cc tuberculin syringe was forced through three layers of nylon (Tetko, 100-μm pore size) pre-wet with 150 μl of Krebs buffer and collected in an Eppendorf tube. After another filtering with a pre-wet Millex filter (5-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride Millipore filter), the filtrate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. After removing the supernatant, the pellet, which contained the synaptosomes, was resuspended in 100 μl of Krebs buffer for electrophysiological recordings. Reconstitution of Synaptosomal NMDA Receptors in Lipid Bilayers— Incorporation of synaptosomal NMDARs in artificial lipid bilayers was carried out using the “tip-dip” method (34Vaithianathan T. Manivannan K. Kleene R. Bahr B.A. Dey M.P. Dityatev A. Suppiramaniam V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 42: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipid bilayer was formed at the tip of a polished glass pipette (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL). The P-2000 laser micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) was used to pull pipettes with 100-megaohm resistance. The synthetic phospholipids were prepared by dissolving 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar-Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain a concentration of 1 mg/ml. About 3–5 μl of this phospholipid preparation was delivered into 300 μl of bath solution. The bilayer formation was initiated by successive transfer of two monolayers onto the tip of the patch pipette in an asymmetric saline condition with “outside-out” configuration. The bath solution contained pseudoextracellular fluid composed of 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, and 5 mm Tris HCl. The pseudointracellular fluid consisting of 110 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MOPS was used as the pipette solution. After forming a stable membrane, a 3–5-μl suspension of synaptosomes was transferred to the pseudoextracellular fluid. Gentle stirring facilitated fusion of synaptosomal fragments into the bilayer. Single Channel Recording and Analysis—Single synaptosomal NMDA receptor channel currents were elicited by application of glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μm glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence 1 μm 4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-1-methyl-2-propylcarbamoyl-6,7 methylenedioxyphthalazine (SYM 2206, Tocris), 1 μm (2S, 4R)-4-methylglutamic acid (SYM 2081, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μm picrotoxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 μm tetrodotoxin (Tocris), which block AMPA, kainate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine receptors, and potassium and sodium channels, respectively. PSA (colominic acid) was delivered to the pseudoextracellular fluid in increasing concentrations ranging from 1 to 3 μg/ml. Chondroitin sulfate A (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The single channel currents were amplified (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), digitized using a PCM interface (VR-10B Digital Data Recorder, Instrutech. Corp., Elmont, NY), and stored on VHS tape. For off-line analysis, the data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized between 5 and 25 kHz with PClamp6 software. The channel currents, which were sensitive to NR2B specific antagonist 1 μm Ro (Ro 25-6981 maleate, Tocris), were included in the analysis. The data processing of single channel recordings from synaptosomal receptors was described elsewhere (34Vaithianathan T. Manivannan K. Kleene R. Bahr B.A. Dey M.P. Dityatev A. Suppiramaniam V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 42: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the data exhibiting long stretches of single channel current transition without base-line drifts were chosen for quantitative analysis. All point current amplitude histograms were constructed and fitted with Gaussian curves to identify the individual conductances. The single channel conductance of NMDA receptors were obtained by plotting current as a function of membrane voltage, and the conductance was determined according to the equation g = I/(V–V0), where I is the single channel current, V is the voltage, and V0 is the reversal potential. The single channel open probability was estimated as Po = Ro/(Rc + Ro), where Rc and Ro stand for the areas under the current-amplitude histogram corresponding to close and open states, respectively. Excitotoxicity Assay—Cell survival assays were performed using dissociated hippocampal cultures maintained in vitro for 7 days (in glass-bottomed 96-well plates, which are well suited for pharmacological experiments) or for 12 days (in cloning cylinders on glass coverslips, which are superior in comparison to plates in terms of cell survival after 9 days in vitro). The conditioned culture medium (70 μl/well) was removed from wells and saved for the later use (see below). Compounds used during the induction of excitotoxicity were applied in Lockes buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm HEPES, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Lockes buffer (70 μl) alone or Lockes buffer containing the compounds of interest was then added to and immediately removed from the cells twice. A further 70 μl of the respective solutions was then added, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 10 min. For washing, solutions were exchanged 3 times by replacing 70% of the total volume at each step to avoid drying out the cells during the washing procedures and to obtain a >95% solution exchange after the last step. After this, the conditioned medium (saved as culture supernatant) was returned to the cells. Cell survival was measured 20–24 h after treatment using the live cell marker, calcein (0.5 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the dead cell marker, propidium iodide (3 μm, Sigma-Aldrich). Three visual fields were counted per well, and there were three wells per treatment group per culture preparation. Excitotoxicity was calculated as the ratio of dead cells to total cells. The t test was used to determine the statistical differences between the experimental groups. Reduction of NMDAR Currents by PSA in Cultures of Dissociated Hippocampal Neurons—Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were used to measure the NMDAR currents in pyramidal-like neurons from 12–20-day-old cultures (Fig. 1A). The currents were evoked by the application of glutamate (3 μm) and recorded at different membrane potentials from –100 to +60 mV. Because previous experiments showed an effect of 40 μg/ml bacterially produced PSA, colominic acid, on AMPA receptor currents in hippocampal neurons (23Vaithianathan T. Matthias K. Bahr B. Schachner M. Suppiramaniam V. Dityatev A. Steinhauser C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47975-47984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we tested whether this concentration of colominic acid would affect NMDAR activity. Co-application of colominic acid with glutamate reduced the NMDAR currents by ∼30% (n = 40, F8,312 = 60.34, p < 0.000001) at all tested membrane potentials (Fig. 1B). After wash-out of colominic acid, the NMDAR currents in seconds returned to control levels (Fig. 1A). To verify that the reduction of NMDAR currents was specific for colominic acid, a series of control experiments was performed. First, to show that the effect was due to PSA and not impurities in the sample, polymers of sialic acid with 25–50 residues were purified. Co-application of the purified PSA (10 μg/ml) with glutamate produced a reduction of NMDAR currents of ∼20% (n = 4, F8,24 = 4.28, p < 0.005) in comparison to glutamate alone. This effect was not different from the effect of unpurified colominic acid (Fig. 1D). Because PSA is a polymer of sialic acid, there was the possibility that the effect was not specific for the polymeric and highly negatively charged PSA but could also be induced by equally overall negatively charged monomers. To investigate this possibility, sialic acid monomers (40 μg/ml) were co-applied with glutamate. This, however, did not produce any significant change in the glutamate-induced NMDAR currents compared with glutamate alone (n = 4, F8,24 = 2.12, p > 0.05, Fig. 1D). As another control, colominic acid was treated with the enzyme endo-N, which is known to specifically cleave α2,8-linked PSA. Endo-N-treated colominic acid did not change NMDAR currents when co-applied with glutamate (n = 6, F8,56 = 0.98, p > 0.05, Fig. 1, C and D). Next, we examined the effect of another negatively charged carbohydrate polymer, chondroitin sulfate. Co-application of chondroitin sulfate (40 μg/ml) with glutamate resulted in NMDAR currents that were not different from those induced by glutamate alone (n = 7, F8,48 = 0.35, p > 0.05, Fig. 1D). Thus, the influence of colominic acid on NMDARs is specific to the unique PSA polymer of sialic acid. Because these experiments were performed using a bacterially produced PSA, we next addressed the question of whether mammalian PSA associated with NCAM would affect NMDARs. Co-application of glutamate with mouse PSA-NCAM-Fc (10 μg/ml), containing the extracellular domain of NCAM in fusion with the Fc portion of human IgG, reduced NMDAR currents in the same manner as colominic acid (n = 7, F8,48 = 19.38, p < 0.000001). Application of non-polysialylated NCAM-Fc (10 μg/ml) did not affect NMDAR currents (n = 3, F8,16 = 2.41, p > 0.05). Thus, PSA carried by NCAM, but not the NCAM protein backbone that carries glycan chains not related to PSA, inhibits NMDAR currents (Fig. 1D). Pharmacological and Fluctuation Analyses of the Effects of PSA on NMDARs—Because divalent cations forming a complex with PSA may modify properties of the PSA chains (35Hayrinen J. Haseley S.

Therefore, the effects of colominic acid on NMDAR currents were compared in the same cells for two Ca2+ concentrations, 0 or 2 mm, or for two Mg2+ concentrations, 0.5 or 1.5 mm (Fig. 2A). There was no difference in modulation of NMDAR currents by colominic acid under these conditions. These experiments suggest that association of the negatively charged PSA with positively charged divalent cations is not critical for the effects of PSA on NMDARs. Also, the addition of the NMDAR agonist spermidine (100 μm) or omitting 2 μm glycine normally included in the perfusion solution did not alter the inhibition of NMDAR cur"
https://openalex.org/W2118058448,"MthK is a prokaryotic Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channel that, like other ligand-gated channels, converts the chemical energy of ligand binding to the mechanical force of channel opening. The channel's eight ligand-binding domains, the RCK domains, form an octameric gating ring in which Ca(2+) binding induces conformational changes that open the channel. Here we present the crystal structures of the MthK gating ring in closed and partially open states at 2.8 A, both obtained from the same crystal grown in the absence of Ca(2+). Furthermore, our biochemical and electrophysiological analyses demonstrate that MthK is regulated by both Ca(2+) and pH. Ca(2+) regulates the channel by changing the equilibrium of the gating ring between closed and open states, while pH regulates channel gating by affecting gating-ring stability. Our findings, along with the previously determined open MthK structure, allow us to elucidate the ligand gating mechanism of RCK-regulated K(+) channels."

The prevalence of RCK domains in prokaryotic potassium channels, together with their role in the regulation of potassium transporters, shows that these domains are a focal point in the physiological regulation of K+ homeostasis in prokaryotes. In all these protein systems, it is thought that binding of a specific ligand induces a conformational change in the RCK domain that is propagated to the membrane-bound protein, leading to ion transport (Jiang et al., 2002aJiang Y.

The basic assembly in all these structures is a homodimer. Each dimer subunit has an N-terminal subdomain (∼124 residues long) that adopts a Rossmann fold where a ligand binds, followed by a crossover helix (∼13–17 residues) that intercalates into the partner subunit (see Figure 1) and a roughly 80 residue long C-terminal subdomain. The N-terminal subdomain exhibits some sequence conservation within RCK subfamilies. By contrast, the C-terminal region appears to be much more variable. At present, there are two conflicting models for the functional oligomeric arrangement of RCK domains. The structure of the MthK potassium channel (Jiang et al., 2002aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J.

Crystal structure and mechanism of a calcium-gated potassium channel.Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 2002bJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The open pore conformation of potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) reveals an intriguing arrangement of eight RCK domains (a tetramer of dimers); in this structure, two tetrameric channels are stacked foot to foot through their tethered RCK domains. In the MthK channel, a Ca2+ binds within a cleft of each RCK domain not far from the dimer interface; functional studies have shown that Ca2+ binding increases the open probability of the channel. This structural information, together with biochemical data, led to a functional model where, in the cell, the MthK-channel RCK domains form an octameric ring on the cytoplasmic face of the channel with four domains tethered to the channel subunits and four other RCK domains existing as independent polypeptides. Gating (opening and closing) of the channel is proposed to result from RCK-ring expansion or contraction in response to a change, induced by calcium binding, in the relative positions of the subunits within the homodimer assembly (Jiang et al., 2002aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Crystal structure and mechanism of a calcium-gated potassium channel.Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical data on isolated MthK RCK domains have provided additional support for this octameric arrangement (Dong et al., 2005Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. Structures of the MthK RCK domain and the effect of Ca2+ on gating ring stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The other oligomeric functional model is based on structural studies (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S.

The structure of a truncated form of the KtrA protein (with the variable C-terminal subdomain removed) was solved bound to NADH (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. A mechanism of regulating transmembrane potassium flux through a ligand-mediated conformational switch.Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A comparison of the RCK domain structures of this transporter and of the MthK channel revealed the same homodimer assembly; the ligands, calcium ion in MthK and NADH in KtrAB, bind within the same groove of the N-terminal subdomain (Dong et al., 2005Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. Structures of the MthK RCK domain and the effect of Ca2+ on gating ring stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the truncated KtrA bound to NADH and of the related Trk RCK domain bound to NAD+, together with solution studies (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R.

It was proposed that, in response to ligand, there are changes in the RCK dimer organization that lead to the destabilization of the tetramer and inactivation of the transporter. The two contrasting quaternary arrangements proposed for the RCK domains of KtrAB (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. A mechanism of regulating transmembrane potassium flux through a ligand-mediated conformational switch.Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and MthK (Jiang et al., 2002aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The open pore conformation of potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) (tetramer versus octamer) are intriguing since both have at their basis a very similar homodimer assembly and both models propose ligand-induced changes in the relative orientation of the subunits across the dimer interface. It is also clear that both proposals have shortcomings: The tetrameric model is based on an artificially imposed remodeling of crystal lattice contacts of the structures from two different RCK domains, while the octameric ring proposal is based on a nonphysiological crystal structure where two channels are stacked foot to foot through their cytoplasmic domains. The contradictions of the two models together with the importance of RCK domains for the regulation of potassium-transport systems in prokaryotes and of channels in eukaryotes led us to revisit the structure of the RCK domain of KtrAB. Here we show that this protein adopts an oligomeric state that contrasts with the previous report: We reveal different conformations of the oligomer and provide experimental data supporting an unanticipated stoichiometry of the KtrAB complex. Together, these results unify our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying ligand activation by the RCK domain family. The truncated RCK domain from the B. subtilis KtrAB ion transporter was cloned and expressed using published protocols (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. A mechanism of regulating transmembrane potassium flux through a ligand-mediated conformational switch.Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A search for new crystal forms produced crystals in the presence of NADH that diffract to 2.2 Å. We solved the structure (Rwork 23.2.0%, Rfree 25.8%) by molecular replacement using a single domain of the previously deposited KtrAB RCK coordinates (PDB ID code 1LSU) (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P.

A mechanism of regulating transmembrane potassium flux through a ligand-mediated conformational switch.Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and found a homodimer in the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, analysis of the crystal lattice contacts showed the RCK domains organized as an octameric ring (Figure 1A). This quaternary arrangement with an up-and-down disposition of the subunits around the ring is similar to the one observed in the MthK structure (Figure 1B) (Jiang et al., 2002aJiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The open pore conformation of potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The up-domains in the ring (colored red in the figure) do not directly contact each other, with interactions being mediated by intervening down-domains (blue). The KtrAB RCK ring takes the shape of a diamond with 222 point-group symmetry, with each homodimer defining a side of the diamond and the dimer interface at the center of the side (Figures 1A and 1B). Dimer-to-dimer interfaces are located at the corners of the diamond and come in two types that we refer to as rotating and fixed for reasons that will become clear. As previously shown for MthK and KtrAB (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S.

The NADH ligands are bound at positions flanking the dimer interface and line the hole of the ring (Figure 1A), while the N and C termini are located on the outside of the ring. This general arrangement is similar to that observed in MthK, where the Ca2+ ligands also flank the dimer interface (Figure 1D) facing the hole of the ring (Figure 1B) while the C-terminal “peripheral” subdomains lie outside the ring. We determined the solution molecular weight of the RCK domain by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to light scattering (Folta-Stogniew and Williams, 1999Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.M.

At all concentrations, the protein forms a single species with a solution molecular weight that varies between 133.4 and 135.9 kDa (Figure 1E). Since the expected monomer molecular weight is 16.3 kDa, the ratio between measured and expected masses gives an oligomer number of 8.2–8.3 molecules. These results, together with the crystal structure, clearly show that the KtrAB RCK domain adopts an octameric organization. Simulated annealing omit maps were used to confirm the conformation of the bound NADH molecule (Figure 2A). The electron density shows that the adenine ring is flipped relative to the previously reported conformation (Roosild et al., 2002Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. A mechanism of regulating transmembrane potassium flux through a ligand-mediated conformational switch.Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The temperature factors of the adenine ring (average = 45.2 Å2) are similar to those of the nearby main-chain atoms of the binding pocket (average = 41.6 Å2), indicating that ligand is present at essentially 100% occupancy and that it is tightly held on the adenine end. Conversely, the ligand density in the omit map terminates before the second phosphate, revealing the nicotinamide end to be highly mobile. The electron density of the partially resolved NADH ligand closely matches an ADP molecule, raising the question of whether ADP or ATP could also bind to this protein. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether the ATP fluorescent analog ATP-γS-BODIPY binds to the RCK domain. As shown in Figure 2B, when protein is added to a solution containing the analog, a decrease of BODIPY fluorescence intensity is observed along with a 3 nm spectral shift. The spectral changes reflect specifically the binding of the fluorescent analog to RCK since the addition of an excess of NADH reverses these effects due to competition for the same binding site (data not shown). Importantly, the fluorescence signal is also recovered upon competition with NAD+, ATP (Figure 2B), ADP, and ATP-γS, but not with GTP-γS. An apparent dissociation constant (KD) of ∼600 nM was determined for ATP-γS-BODIPY (inset of Figure 2B), and competition experiments (Figure 2C) revealed that ATP-γS, ATP, and ADP bind more tightly (KD ∼ 20–70 nM) to the domain than NADH or NAD+ (KD ∼ 200–400 nM). These results raise the possibility that, in the context of the KtrAB complex, this RCK domain may bind ATP or ADP. We cannot evaluate whether any of these small molecules are functionally active in KtrAB since no suitable ligand-dependent transport assay has been reported in the literature. Cocrystallization trials under the same conditions were carried out using a variety of adenine-containing molecules (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). All cocrystals show the same octameric ring structure, and only small adjustments in the ligand binding sites are observed. Just as for NADH, the NAD+ maps also display a lack of electron density for the nicotinamide group. In all cases, the ligands are near full occupancy in all subunits as deduced by comparing the temperature factors of the adenine ring with the main-chain atoms of the binding pocket. This binding site uniformity demonstrates that the symmetry in our ring is not a result of the ligand's occupying only some of the sites in KtrAB but must be an intrinsic property of the octamer. Interestingly, we also observe for all cases that temperature factors of the ligand atoms increase when traveling away from the adenine group, indicating increased mobility (Figure 2A; see also Figure S1A). By contrast, the main-chain atoms of the binding pocket in that region do not show a similar pattern. Further crystallization trials of the KtrAB RCK domain were carried out, and determination of the structures (Table S1) revealed an octameric ring that adopts three different conformations, designated as square, diamond (discussed above), and rectangle (Figure 3A). The square conformation was determined at 3.0 Å in the presence of ATP (Rwork 26.4%, Rfree 30.3%; PDB ID code 2HMW) or NADH (the two structures are basically identical); the diamond conformation was determined in the presence of NADH (2.2 Å, Rwork 23.2%, Rfree 25.8%; PDB ID code 2HMT), ATP-γS (2.25 Å, Rwork 22.8% Rfree 24.5%; PDB ID code 2HMU), ADP (2.2 Å, Rwork 22.8%, Rfree 24.5%; PDB ID code 2HMV), and NAD+; and the rectangle conformation was determined in the presence of NADH (2.7 Å, Rwork 21.4%, Rfree 24.9%; PDB ID code 2HMS). Some of the diffraction data sets were collected after cryocooling the crystals using the high-pressure helium gas method (Kim et al., 2005Kim C.U. Kapfer R. Gruner S.M. High-pressure cooling of protein crystals without cryoprotectants.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This method overcame difficulties encountered during the search for adequate cryoprotection conditions and ensured that the ligand was not disturbed by addition of cryoprotectants and remained at full occupancy. High-pressure cryocooling data sets were as good as or better than those obtained via traditional cryoprotection; no significant change was observed between ring structures determined with data obtained via these two methods. The three ring structures differ in a few aspects. The overall shape and dimensions of the rings are different (Figure 3A). The outer ring diameter is 87 Å for the square, 89 Å and 81 Å for the diamond, and 92 Å and 72 Å for the rectangle (measured along the directions defined by the fixed and rotating interfaces, respectively); for MthK, this distance is 81 Å (see Figure S4). Therefore, the transition from square to rectangle results in a reduction of 15 Å in one direction (∼7.5 Å for each half of the ring) and a smaller, concurrent 5 Å expansion in the other direction (∼2.5 Å for each half of the ring). Strikingly, the square octamer ring is approximately 4-fold symmetrical, while the diamond and rectangle conformations exhibit 2-fold symmetry. The changes at the level of the inner hole of the ring can be illustrated by the separation of Asn38 Cα (marked as a yellow spot in Figure 3A) between pairs of domains positioned across the hole (opposing domains). This distance is 39 Å in the square conformation; in the diamond, it is 34 Å in one pair and 42 Å in the other; and in the rectangular ring, spacing is 22 Å in one pair versus 48 Å in the other. For comparison, the MthK ring is 4-fold symmetrical, with an inner diameter of 25 Å as measured from Asn145 Cα (the residue equivalent to Asn38). Superimposition of individual subunits from the various rings shows almost no change (Figure 3B) except for a shift in the tip of the crossover helix. Between rings, the relative orientation of the two domains in a dimer changes by rotation about a hinge point close to Pro124 at the beginning of the crossover helix, with all motions occurring roughly in the same plane. This change can be measured in terms of the “dimer hinge angle” that corresponds to the relative angle between the crossover helices. Importantly, all four dimers within a given octameric ring have the same dimer hinge angle. The angles for each ring shape are ∼80° in the square (blue), ∼83.5° in the diamond (green), and ∼90° in the rectangle (red). The 10° transition from square to rectangular ring causes a maximum displacement of 11 Å in the partner subunit. This results in a contraction on the face of the dimer that lines the hole of the ring. By contrast, the dimer hinge angle of MthK RCK is much larger, ∼124°. In KtrAB, the total buried surface values for this interface change relatively little between conformations: 3277 Å2 for the square, 3189 Å2 for the diamond, and 3228 Å2 for the rectangle. The other regions that underlie the different ring shapes are the hydrophobic dimer-to-dimer interfaces. In the square conformation, all of the dimer-to-dimer interfaces are equivalent; in the rectangle and diamond rings, there are two different sets, rotating and fixed. Both sets utilize the same hydrophobic patch along helices αD and αE (Figure 1C and Figures 3C and 3D). The orientation of domains across the fixed interfaces (positioned along the long dimension in the diamond and rectangle conformations) remains almost unchanged in all three ring shapes (Figure 3C): The pair of helices (gray) in one domain pack against the equivalent pair from the other domain (blue, green, or red) with a relative angle of ∼35°, ∼38°, and ∼37° and a total buried surface area of 1317 Å2, 1628 Å2, and 1544 Å2 for the square, diamond, and rectangle, respectively. By contrast, in the rotating interfaces (along the short dimension of the diamond and rectangle rings), large relative domain movements occur (Figure 3D) (see Movie S1). In the diamond and rectangular conformations, the pairs of helices have rotated on each other"

Whereas multidomain anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL share up to four BH domains (BH1-4), multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK contain three BH domains (BH1-3). The “BH3-only” proteins constitute a subset of pro-apoptotic proteins that display sequence conservation exclusively in the BH3 domain. BH3-only proteins antagonize anti-apoptotic proteins through direct interactions (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

A discrete subset of BH3-only members, including BIM and BID, are also believed to activate multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins BAX or BAK directly (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L.

Recent studies using an in vitro liposomal assay demonstrated that BAX protein, when combined with BID and BIM BH3 peptides, triggered release of liposomal contents, supporting a direct interaction between select BH3 peptides and BAX (12Kuwana T.

In these studies, an excess of synthetic peptides (up to 50 μm) was required to activate submicromolar concentrations of BAX, raising the question of whether this in vitro observation reflects the in vivo mechanism of BAX activation (23Annis M.G.

We investigated whether endowing the BID BH3 peptide with membrane targeting capability could restore its biological potency, and thereby confirm its physiologic activity. Using a novel Ni2+-NTA-containing liposomal assay system, we find that tethering a BID BH3 peptide to the membrane by chemical means increases its potency in BAX activation by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with the untargeted peptide. These data reveal the functional importance of the membrane targeting module of tBID, in combination with the BH3 domain, in triggering BAX activation. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)], beef liver phosphatidylinositol, beef heart cardiolipin, cholesterol, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{[N-5-amino-1-carboxylpentyl)iminodiacetic acid]succinyl} (nickel salt) (DOGS-NTA-Ni) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Mixtures of lipids were prepared in chloroform, divided into 50-mg aliquots, and dried as thin films in glass test tubes under nitrogen gas and then under vacuum for an additional 16 h. The lipids were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0) (buffer A). The lipid suspensions were freeze-thawed 3 times and extruded 15 times through two sheets of polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 100 nm (Avestin) using an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids), resulting in the generation of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (24Szoka F.

LUVs replicating the lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) contact sites, designated as MOM vesicles, were made with a mixture of POPC, POPE, phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol, and cardiolipin in the weight ratio of 41:22:9:8:20 (17Lutter M.

LUVs containing 1, 5, 10, and 20% (w/w) of DOGS-NTA-Ni were also prepared using the same ratio of lipids as in the MOM vesicles except for POPC. To encapsulate FITC-labeled dextran 10 (10 kDa; Sigma or Molecular Probes), 50-100 mg of FITC-dextran 10 was weighed into a test tube containing 50 mg of dried lipid film. The lipid mixture and the FITC-dextran were resuspended in buffer A and freeze-thawed 20 times. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were converted to LUVs by extrusion as described above. Untrapped FITC-labeled dextran 10 was removed by gel filtration in Sephacryl S-300 HR columns (GE Healthcare). The phosphate contents of the vesicles were determined as described (26Böttcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of lipid vesicles was estimated as described in supplemental Fig. S1.

Two BAX mutants, one lacking helices 5 and 6 (amino acid sequence 109-144), designated as BAXΔH56, and the other with a glycine to valine substitution at residue 108, designated as BAXG108V, were engineered using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

To ensure that equal concentrations of BAX and BAX mutants were employed in the biochemical experiments, BAX proteins were calibrated by Western blot analysis using the N-20 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rabbit secondary IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of BCL-XL (residues 1-212) lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain, designated as GST-BCL-XLΔC, was prepared as described (27Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 was purified as described (28Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

To express N-terminally His-tagged, full-length mouse BID proteins, the cysteine-less clone p22BID30S126S was prepared in pJO vector (see supplemental Fig. S2) as described previously (29Oh K.J.

Proteins were stored at -80 °C in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 16% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm DTT, and ∼200 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal.

DTT was then removed by eluting the reaction mixture through a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) after pre-equilibration with buffer A. The purified p7/p15 BID was then loaded onto a column containing 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) and washed with 10 ml of buffer A. p15 BID was eluted with 40 ml of buffer A containing 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem). The eluted p15 BID solution was then concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator (5 kDa; Millipore) to a final volume of ∼2.5 ml. To remove the excessive detergent, the resultant p15 BID concentrate was passed through a PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to generate stock solutions for biochemical experiments. Hydrocarbon-stapled BID BH3 peptides were synthesized as described previously (32Walensky L.D. Kung A.L. Escher I. Malia T.J. Barbuto S. Wright R.D. Wagner G. Verdine G.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 40 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatants were quickly removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The amount of cytochrome c in the supernatants and pellet fractions was determined by ELISA (Quantikine M kit; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

The release of the FITC-labeled Dextran 10 from the LUVs was monitored by fluorometry (FluoroMAX-2, ISA Inc.) using a thermostatted 1-cm path length quartz cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 525 nm, respectively (slits, 2 nm). The extent of marker release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the following equation: ((Ft - F0)/(F100 - F0) × 100), where Ft is the measured fluorescence of reagent-treated LUVs at time t; F0 is the average fluorescence of the LUV suspension for the initial 1-2 min before reagent addition, and F100 is the average fluorescence value of the final 1-2 min after complete disruption of LUVs by addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.66 mm). Lipid concentration was 10 μg/ml unless otherwise stated. BCL-XL Binding Assays—BID BH3 peptides were incubated with lipid vesicles for 10-20 min at room temperature in 50 μl of buffer A with or without EDTA. An equal volume of GSTBCL-XLΔC, preincubated with or without a competing peptide (BAD BH3), was added to the reaction mixture at 10-fold excess and co-incubated for 60 min. Final concentrations of BID BH3 peptides, GST-BCL-XLΔC, EDTA, and lipids were 20 μm, 10 μm, 10 mm, and 4.23 μg/μl, respectively. After incubation, the vesicles were pelleted by 1 h of centrifugation in a Beckman A-110 Airfuge rotor at 104,000 rpm and then successively washed (buffer A) and pelleted again. The pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A and an equal volume of reaction supernatant (first centrifugation), and resuspended vesicles were analyzed by gel electrophoresis using pre-cast NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gels. Proteins were transferred to the Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and GST-BCL-XLΔC was detected using a primary mouse anti-glutathione S-transferase antibody (Pharmingen) and an anti-mouse secondary IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Circular Dichroism—Mixtures of His-BID BH3 peptides (13.4 μm) and MOM vesicles (13 nm LUVs, 1 mg/ml) containing 0 or 5% DOGS-NTA-Ni were prepared in buffer A. BID BH3 peptides and their hydrocarbon-stapled derivatives were dissolved in water to a concentration of 25-50 μm. CD spectra were obtained in a quartz cell with a 1-mm path length using an Aviv (Lakewood, NJ) CD spectrometer at 20 °C. A bandwidth of 1.5 nm was used for all measurements. Signals were averaged for 5 s for every half nanometer measurement between 215 and 260 nm. Signals below 215 nm were not recorded because of light scattering induced by the vesicles. Each spectrum represents the average of three distinct spectral recordings. To correct for the spectral contribution of MOM vesicles, the CD spectra of the vesicles alone were subtracted from those of the peptide/vesicle mixtures. Similarly, the CD spectra of the peptides alone were corrected by subtraction of the solvent blank (buffer A). Peptide concentrations were calibrated by amino acid analysis. The helical content was estimated from the mean residue molar ellipticity value at 222 nm ([θ]222), according to the following empirical Equation 1 (34Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H.

Spin Labeling of His-BID BH3 Peptides—Cysteine mutant peptides of hexahistidine-tagged BID BH3, His-BID BH3 92C, His-BID BH3 96C, and His-BID BH3 92C96C (5-6 mg) were reacted with 10-20-fold molar excess of (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL, Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) in 0.5 ml of buffer A. The final pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH ∼7 with 12 μl of potassium hydroxide solution (1 m). The spin-labeled peptides with the resulting R1 side chains (Fig. 5A) were designated as His-BID BH3 92R1, His-BID BH3 96R1, and His-BID BH3 92R1/96R1. Unreacted spin label was removed by gel filtration chromatography using Superdex Peptide 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) with buffer A containing 30% acetonitrile. Fractions containing the spin-labeled peptides were lyophilized and then dissolved in 20% Me2SO in buffer A (20% Me2SO/buffer A). Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectroscopy was used to investigate potential conformational changes of the spin-labeled peptides upon membrane binding. Peptides bound to MOM vesicles containing 5% DOGS-NTA-Ni were prepared as follows. Peptides (184 μm) were incubated with 0.20 μm vesicles (15.6 mg/ml) in a final volume of 90 μl in 20% Me2SO/buffer A for 30 min at room temperature. Membrane-bound peptides were further washed with 100 μl of 20% Me2SO/buffer A by two successive centrifugations (30 min, 100,000 rpm) using an Airfuge (Beckman). Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 5 μl of 20% Me2SO/buffer A. For low temperature measurements (at 232 K), the pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A containing 16% (v/v) glycerol and pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of buffer A, 16% glycerol. The mixtures of peptides (184 μm) and 0.20 μm MOM vesicles (15.6 mg/ml) without DOGS-NTA-Ni were also prepared in 20% Me2SO/buffer A and used without further treatment. The peptides bound to Ni-NTA-agarose resins (Qiagen) were prepared by mixing 50 μl of 50% (v/v) Ni-NTA-agarose slurry pre-equilibrated in buffer A with peptides (final concentration 110 μM) to a final volume of 90 μl 20% Me2SO/buffer A. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, the gels were spun down by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 rpm on a tabletop Beckman microcentrifuge. The resulting gel pellet was washed five times by resuspension and pelleting in 100 μl of 20% Me2SO/buffer A. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20% Me2SO/buffer A in a volume of 50 μl. For low temperature experiments, the peptide/gel resuspension was prepared similarly and washed three times with 20% Me2SO/buffer A, followed by two washes with 3× volumes of 16% glycerol in buffer A. The samples were pipetted into capillary tubes (Vitro Com Inc, NJ; inner diameter = 0.5 mm) and further compacted after sealing with wax. EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer using a Bruker high sensitivity resonator. Spectra were recorded at a 1-2-milliwatt incident microwave power using a field modulation of 1.0-2.0 G at 100 kHz at room temperature. To determine the number of spin labels attached to peptides, EPR spectra were taken after liberating the spin labels from the protein molecules by incubating the labeled proteins with 50 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The amount of spin label was calculated by double integration of the EPR spectra using 3-carboxyproxyl (Sigma) as a standard. The concentrations of the spin-labeled peptides were determined by amino acid analysis. The distance between two R1 residues were estimated by the deconvolution method as described (36Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 37Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Briefly, the spectra of singly labeled samples and the spectrum of the doubly labeled samples were obtained for a pair of R1 residues at 232 K (-41 °C). EPR spectra were normalized to the same area by double integration after baseline corrections. Depending on the magnitude of the line broadening, various scan widths such as 100, 150, or 250 G were used to avoid the base-line distortions of the spectra. Using the normalized spectrum of the doubly labeled sample and the sum of the two normalized spectra of the singly labeled samples, the distance distributions between the paired nitroxide residues were calculated by the method developed by Altenbach et al. (36Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and Rabenstein et al. (37Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc.

Mitochondrial and Liposomal Release Assays Similarly Reflect the Specificity of tBID-induced BAX Activation—To validate the liposomal release assay as a high fidelity experimental correlate to the mitochondrion, we probed the specificity of tBID-induced BAX activation in both assay systems using a comprehensive panel of tBID, BCL-XL, and BAX mutants (supplemental Figs. S3-S6). In mitochondrial and liposomal assays, wild type tBID and tBID 97A98A, tBID 94A, tBID(93-96)A and tBID 90A95A similarly demonstrated the differential activities of tBID constructs in triggering BAX pore formation (supplemental Fig. S4). Wild type tBID displayed the highest BAX activation activity in both systems, whereas mutant tBID 90A95A was completely ineffective at submicromolar concentrations (supplemental Fig. S4, A and C). The specificity of tBID-induced BAX activation was similarly confirmed in both assay systems using BCL-XL blockade (supplemental Fig. S5). BCL-XL inhibition experiments using mitochondria demonstrated that wild type tBID and tBID94A maintained high affinity BCL-XL binding, whereas 97A98A and (93-96)A mutagenesis abrogated BCL-XL binding (supplemental Fig. S5A). Strikingly similar findings were observed when BCL-XL blockade experiments were performed usi"

Lectins recognize and bind carbohydrates covalently linked to proteins and lipids on the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix, and they mediate many cellular functions ranging from cell adhesion to pathogen recognition. The galectins are a family of animal lectins that share a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) 2The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; NCRD, N-terminal CRD; CCRD, C-terminal CRD; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; T-antigen, Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen; LN2, N-acetyllactosamine dimer; Tris, tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane; CHES, N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GA1, GAlβ1–3Gal-NAcβ1–4Galβ1–4Glc; GM1, Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2-3]Galβ1–4Glc; GD1a, NeuAcα2-3Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2–3]Galβ1–4Glc; GD1b, Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2-6NeuAcα2-3]Galβ1–4Glc; Gb4, GalNAcβ 1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc. of about 130 amino acids. The galectin CRDs all bind small β-galactosides, but the overall binding affinity for more complex glycoconjugates varies substantially. To date, 14 members of the mammalian galectin family have been identified (1Cooper D.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hirabayshi and Kasai (2Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) proposed designating galectin subfamilies as proto-, chimera-, and tandem-repeat types based on their domain organization. The prototype galectins (galectin-1, -2, -5, -7, -10, -11, -13, and -14) consist of a single CRD with a short N-terminal sequence, but the tandem-repeat type galectins (galectin-4, -6, -8, -9, and -12) are composed of two non-identical CRDs joined by a short linker peptide sequence. The single chimera-type galectin (galectin-3) has one CRD and an extended N-terminal tail containing several repeats of proline-tyrosine-glycine-rich motif. The structures of several galectin CRDs have been reported, and all exhibit a β-sandwich fold containing two antiparallel β-sheets (3Liao D.-I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13930-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, their quaternary structures differ. Galectin-1 and -2 form non-covalently associated homodimers through extended β-sheet interactions (7Loris R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The association state of galectin-3 is regulated by its N-terminal domain, and it can exist in monomeric or oligomeric forms (8Birdsall B. Feeney J. Burdett I.D.J. Bawumia S. Bardoni E.A.M. Hughes R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4859-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, because the tandem-repeat type galectins possess two different CRDs, they may adopt more complex assembly states. Galectins are found in both the cytoplasm and extracellular regions where they regulate inflammation, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and cell death (9Rabinovich G.A. Rubinstein N. Toscano M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Galectins lack a traditional signal sequence, and several are secreted by an unorthodox mechanism to exert their extracellular functions (10Mehul B. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a variety of potential glycoconjugate targets for galectins in mammalian cells, but the molecular mechanisms of carbohydrate recognition remain unclear. Galectin-9, a tandem-repeat type galectin, is a 40-kDa protein consisting of 353 amino acids. The sequence identity between the N- and C-terminal CRDs is 35%. The C-terminal CRD (CCRD) is highly homologous to rat galectin-5 CRD with an amino acid sequence identity of 70%, but the N-terminal CRD (NCRD) is only moderately homologous with the known galectins. Among these, the galectin-9 NCRD shows the highest sequence identity (40%) with the galectin-3 CRD. Galectin-9 was first cloned from tumor cells from Hodgkin disease, a condition characterized by blood and tissue eosinophilia (11Türeci Ö. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recombinant galectin-9 causes thymocyte apoptosis in mouse cells, suggesting a possible role for galectin-9 in negative selection during T-cell development (12Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6078-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 13Wada J. Oka K. Kumar A. Wallner E.I. Kanwar Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, galectin-9 was shown to be related to a novel eosinophil chemoattractant produced by T lymphocytes, previously designated “ecalectin” (14Matsumoto R. Matsumoto H. Seki M. Hata M. Asano Y. Kanegasaki S. Stevens R.L. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mutation studies showed that both the NCRD and CCRD of galectin-9 were required for the eosinophil chemoattraction activity (15Matsushita N. Nishi N. Seki M. Matsumoto R. Kuwabara I. Liu F.T. Hata Y. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8355-8360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, galectin-9 interacts with Tim-3, which is specifically expressed on the surface of T helper type 1 (TH1) cell, through recognition of Tim-3 carbohydrates, and the Tim3-galectin9 pathway induces cell death in TH1 cells. This suggests that galectin-9 plays a role in down-regulating the effector TH1 responses (16Zhu C. Anderson A.C. Schubart A. Xiong H. Imitola J. Khoury S.J. Zheng X.X. Strom T.B. Kuchroo V.K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Galectin-9 interacts with carbohydrate(s) covalently attached to the surface of Tim-3, but the molecular and structural basis for this recognition is unknown. In vitro analyses showed that galectin-9 has a high affinity for a variety of oligosaccharides containing β-galactosides (17Hirabayshi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E.G. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), and the NCRD and CCRD of galectin-9 have different oligosaccharide-binding affinities. The biological activities of galectin-9 may be related to the ligand binding specificity of each CRD and the multivalent binding conferred by two CRDs. To date, the structures of many CRDs from fungi to human have been solved, but there is no structural information about the structure of tandem-repeat type galectin CRDs. Such information should greatly clarify the mechanism of carbohydrate recognition by the CRDs and the multivalent properties that lead to multiple functions for a single protein. Compared with the galectin-9 CCRD, the NCRD shows striking affinities for complex glycoconjugates such as Forssman pentasaccharide and polymerized N-acetyllactosamine (17Hirabayshi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E.G. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys.

Structure. 2004; 12: 689-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The specific interactions of the galectin-9 NCRD with the carbohydrates is thought to be the clue for understanding the physiological mechanism of galectin-9. We report here the crystal structures of the mouse galectin-9 N-terminal CRD in the absence and the presence of carbohydrate ligands. These structures show both the basic mechanism of carbohydrate binding and suggest a potential mechanism for the specificity of carbohydrate recognition and binding. Additionally, the galectin-9 NCRD dimerizes in both crystal and solution. From these observations, we discuss the relationship between the structure and function of galectin-9. Materials—Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, benzamidine-Sepharose, and Superdex75 columns for protein purification were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Carbohydrate chemicals of lactose (Galβ1–4Glc) and Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen, Galβ1–3GalNAc) were from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck Ltd., respectively. N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc, Galβ1–4GlcNAc) was synthesized by a previously described method (18Sakai K. Katsumi R. Ohi H. Usui T. Ishido Y. J. Carbohydr.

All crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA) and deCODE genetics. Other chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich. Synthesis of LN2 Carbohydrate—UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal were kind gifts from Yamasa Corp. (Japan). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Japan). LacNAc (460 mg) UDP-GlcNAc·2Na (264 mg) and UDP-Gal·2Na (244 mg) were dissolved in 20 ml of 150 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8) containing MnCl2 (64 mg), ATP·2Na (20 mg), and 0.02% NaN3 (w/v) followed by addition of 3.2 g of crude enzyme preparation obtained by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation from fetal bovine serum. The mixture was incubated for 8 days at 310 K, and the reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant was loaded onto a charcoal-Celite column (ϕ2.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with H2O at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 150 ml of H2O and eluted with a linear 0–50% ethanol gradient (total 2,000 ml). Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm, and peak fractions were collected, concentrated, and applied onto a Toyopearl HW-40S column (ϕ2.5 × 65 cm) equilibrated with H2O at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

The supernatant was applied to a glutathione S-transferase affinity column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fusion protein bound to the resin was eluted with 10 mm glutathione-containing buffer, and glutathione S-transferase was removed from the fusion protein by cleaving with human α-thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) at 10 units/ml for 12 h at 293 K. The cleaved proteins were collected for further purification by benzamidine-Sepharose and Superdex 75. The purified protein was a single band on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing equal volumes of protein (6 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and precipitant composed of 0.1 m CHES (pH 9.5), 15% ethanol at 289 K. The crystals (apo form1) attained dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.02 mm3 within 1–2 weeks and diffracted to ∼2.5-Å resolution. They grew in space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 58.1, and c = 221.7 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Under almost identical conditions (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15% ethanol), another crystal (apo form2) was obtained in another space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 56.4, b = 58.6, c = 48.4 Å, and only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The complex crystals with carbohydrate were prepared by two methods. Lactose complex crystals were obtained by co-crystallization in 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.0), 5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 10 mm lactose, and T-antigen complex crystals were obtained by soaking the apo form1 crystal in 10 mm T-antigen solution for 10 min at 293 K. In the case of LacNAc and LN2, the complexes were obtained by soaking the galactose complex crystals grown in 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.0), 5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 10 mm galactose in 10 mm of each solution. In the galactose complex, the electron density of sugar moiety was poor, but the addition of longer carbohydrates greatly improved the quality of the crystal. Primitive and C-centered orthorhombic galactose complex crystals appeared under the same conditions. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Synchrotron data were collected at beamlines BL-5A, BL-6A, and AR-NW12A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) and BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). Data reduction was carried out with the HKL2000 suite of programs (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The phases of the apo form1 were determined by the molecular replacement method using the galectin-3 CRD (PDB code: 1A3K) as a search model. The program MOLREP in the CCP4 program suite (20Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the rotation and translation functions. The crystallographic refinement was performed by CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr.

The apo form2 and the other carbohydrate complexes were solved by molecular replacement using the apo form1 structure as a search model. All carbohydrate chains are clearly identified in the initial Fo – Fc map. The qualities of the models were shown to be reasonable using PROCHECK program (22Laskowski R.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Final statistics of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurement—SPR binding assay was performed at 298 K using BIACORE 2000 (Biacore). HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20) was used as a running buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The galectin-9 NCRD was directly immobilized on CM4 sensor chips (Biacore) by amine coupling. The binding response was measured at 1–50 μm concentrations of galectin-9 NCRD as analyte. The net response was calculated by subtracting the background response from the binding response. Steady-state responses (Req) were determined from the net response of sensorgrams using BIAevaluation 3.2 program (Biacore). The Req values were plotted against galectin-9 NCRD concentrations and were fitted to a simple 1:1 steadystate binding model using the BIAevaluation 3.2 software, Req = CRmax/(Kd + C), where C is the analyte galectin-9 NCRD concentration, Rmax is the maximum binding response, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Overall Structure—We determined the x-ray crystal structures of mouse galectin-9 NCRD in the absence of ligand in two crystal forms and in the presence of four different carbohydrates (lactose, LacNAc, T-antigen, and LN2). The crystal structure of galectin-9 NCRD apo form1 was determined by the molecular replacement method using the galectin-3 structure (PDB code: 1A3K) as a search model. Full-length mouse galectin-9 shares 85% amino acid identity with the rat urate transporter, UAT1 (27Leal-Pinto E. Tao W. Rappaport J. Richardson J. Knorr B.A. Abramson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which was originally proposed to contain four membrane-spanning domains based on the amino acid sequence (28Lipkowitz M.S. Leal-Pinto E. Rappoport J.Z. Najfield V. Abramson R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, x-ray structure shows that the galectin-9 NCRD is composed of six-stranded (S1–S6) and five-stranded (F1–F5) β-sheets, which together form a β-sandwich arrangement (Fig. 1A). Thus, based on this structure, the galectin-9 NCRD is not buried in membranes. The overall structure of the galectin-9 NCRD is very similar to that of galectin-3 with an r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms of 0.9 Å. The carbohydrate binding site is formed by the S4, S5, and S6 β strands, and the carbohydrate recognition mechanism is similar to those of other galectins (see below). Dimer Formation—In the asymmetric unit of apo form1, two molecules, referred as chains A and B for clarity, are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic axis perpendicular to the β-sheets. They form a continuous 12-stranded antiparallel β-sheet through interactions between the β strands of chain-A S6 and chain-B S6 (Fig. 1B). On the dimer interface, the main-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms of Arg-86 form hydrogen bonds with the corresponding main-chain atoms of Arg-86 of the other monomer (Fig. 1C). Previously, a modified galectin-9 construct lacking the linker region was generated (29Nishi N. Itoh A. Fujiyama A. Yoshida N. Araya S. Hirashima M. Shoji H. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2058-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and substitution of Arg-86 with alanine increased the solubility of this protein (data not shown). Thus, a local conformational change caused by this mutation may affect the intermolecular interaction of two galectin-9 monomers, suggesting that dimer formation occurs at the S6 strands in solution. The main-chain oxygen atoms of Glu-84 of both molecules also form hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen atoms of Met-88 of the other molecules. The N and C termini of each monomer are positioned at the opposite side of the dimer interface (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the CCRD does not prevent dimer formation of the NCRD. The contact area of the dimer is 615 Å2, and this value is slightly smaller than that of galectin-1 (670 Å2, PDB code: 1GZW). Although galectin-1 and -2 form homodimers, the interfaces are formed by extended β-sheet interactions across the two monomers at both sides (F1 and S1) (3Liao D.-I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The architecture is quite different from that of the galectin-9 NCRD. In our structures, this contact is conserved in all six crystals, which contain different space groups with only slight differences in the monomer orientations. Apo Form Structure—The apo and lactose binding structures are very similar to each other with an r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms of 0.4 Å. The carbohydrate binding site of apo form1 is occupied by four well ordered water molecules, which correspond to O4 (Wat-1), cyclic O5 (Wat-2), and O6 (Wat-3) of the β-galactoside and O6 of the reducing sugar (Wat-4) in the complexes with lactose and other carbohydrates (Fig. 2A). In the other apo form structure (apo form2), the positions of the water molecules are slightly shifted, and the hydrogen bond network is also slightly altered (Fig. 2B). The position of wat4 is common in both structures, but wat1 and wat2 move by 1.0 Å without losing the hydrogen bond network. Wat-3 moves by 0.4 Å and makes a new hydrogen bond with Asn-74. Because Wat-2 does not directly interact with the protein in both structures, this positional flexibility may affect the hydrogen network. These waters, which are held in the carbohydrate binding cleft, help to stabilize the spatial arrangement of the amino acid side chains involved in carbohydrate recognition in the absence of the ligand. Because the water molecules in the ligand binding cleft are reported to mimic the carbohydrate binding mode in galectin-1, chick galectin CG16 and fungal galectin CGL2, galectins may generally use such a water stabilization mechanism (30Lopez-Lucendo M.F.

Carbohydrate Recognition Mechanism—Galectin-9 recognizes many β-galactoside-containing carbohydrates (17Hirabayshi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W.E.G. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 33Sato M. Nishi N. Shoji H. Seki M. Hashidate T. Hirabayashi J.

To elucidate the recognition mechanism at an atomic level, we determined four complex structures with different saccharides. The positions of the β-galactoside moiety at the non-reducing end are virtually the same in all the carbohydrate complexes examined (Fig. 3A). The β-galactoside moiety is most deeply buried in the binding site formed by β strands S4–S6. O4 of the galactose plays a central role in forming hydrogen bonds, accepting protons from two highly conserved residues His-60 and Asn-62. O6 of the galactose also interacts with Asn-74 via another hydrogen bond. Two residues with planar side chains, His-60 and Trp-81, provide contacts that help align the carbohydrate. Trp-81 participates in a stacking interaction with the galactose ring similar to that seen in a number of other galactose and lactose binding lectins (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the lactose complex, O6 of the glucose moiety is recognized by Arg-64, Glu-84, and Arg-86 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3B). Arg-64 also makes a hydrogen bond with O4 in the galactose moiety. Replacement of Arg-64 with Ala in mouse galectin-9 impairs its capacity to bind to Tim-3 (16Zhu C. Anderson A.C. Schubart A. Xiong H. Imitola J. Khoury S.J. Zheng X.X. Strom T.B. Kuchroo V.K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Moreover, ecalectin, which was previously isolated as an eosinophil chemoattractant from a human T-cell-derived expression library, is a variant of human galectin-9 with amino acid sequence identity of 66%, and substitution of Arg-65 by Asp, which corresponds to Arg-64 in mouse galectin-9, disrupts its ability to bind lactose (15Matsushita N.

The importance of Arg-64 for galectin-9 activity shown by these experiments is explained well by our crystal structures. Next, we determined the complex structures of galectin-9 NCRD with LacNAc and T-antigen. In the LacNAc complex, the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety is exposed to solvent and is recognized by Arg-64 and Glu-84, which make hydrogen bonds with O3 o"

An inactive mutant of BiSP (E232Q) was co-crystallized with sucrose. The structure revealed a substrate-binding mode comparable with that seen in other related sucrose-acting enzymes. Wild-type BiSP was also crystallized in the presence of sucrose. In the dimeric structure, a covalent glucosyl intermediate was formed in one molecule of the BiSP dimer, and after hydrolysis of the glucosyl intermediate, a β-d-glucose product complex was formed in the other molecule. Although the overall structure of the BiSP-glucosyl intermediate complex is similar to that of the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex, the glucose complex discloses major differences in loop conformations. Two loops (residues 336-344 and 132-137) in the proximity of the active site move up to 16 and 4Å, respectively. On the basis of these findings, we have suggested a reaction cycle that takes into account the large movements in the active-site entrance loops.

Sucrose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.7) is an enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the following reaction; sucrose + orthophosphate = d-fructose + α-d-glucose 1-phosphate (see Scheme 1). This reaction enables the production of the essential glucose moiety from sucrose. Sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BiSP) 3The abbreviations used are: BiSP, B. adolescentis sucrose phosphorylase; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; r.m.s, root mean square.3The abbreviations used are: BiSP, B. adolescentis sucrose phosphorylase; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; r.m.s, root mean square. has been recently sequenced, cloned, and characterized (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P. Verhoef R. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure has also been determined by crystallographic methods (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BiSP consists of 504 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 56,189 g/mol. Based on amino acid sequence similarities, BiSP has been placed in the retaining glycoside hydrolase family 13 (3Henrissat B. Biochem.J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar), also called the α-amylase family, in which, however, functions more complex than hydrolysis are not unprecedented. In this family, other members show transglycosidase activity, e.g. cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase and amylosucrase. Structurally, the glycoside hydrolase family 13 is characterized by having a (β/α)8-barrel comprising the catalytic domain that is referred to as domain A. Apart from the catalytic domain, the enzymes of the family typically contain several other domains. These include the N-terminal domain, a domain formed by the usually long loop 2 in the (β/α)8-barrel (loop B), and the C-terminal domain. The structure of BiSP is composed of the four domains A, B, B′, and C (Fig. 1) (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Domain B contains two short anti-parallel β-sheets and two short α-helices, whereas domain B′ is mainly a coil region, but contains one long and one short α-helix. The first 56 residues of the C-terminal domain form a single five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with a topology described as 1,1,1,1 in algebraic notation, and this is unique among the glycoside hydrolase family 13 domains. Gel filtration (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P. Verhoef R. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and dynamic light scattering and crystal packing analysis (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have suggested that BiSP is a dimer. The majority of the interactions are confined to the two B domains, but interactions between the loop 8 regions of the two A domain barrels are also observed. This results in a large cavity in the dimer, which includes the entrance to the two active sites. In the glycoside hydrolase family 13, dimers are also seen for the enzymes cyclomaltodextrinase (4Park K.H. Kim T.J. Cheong T.K. Kim J.W. Oh B.H. Svensson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), neopullulanase (5Hondoh H. Kuriki T. Matsuura Y. J. Mol.

Choi K.Y. Park K.H. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26279-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast to the BiSP dimer, the other dimers are formed primarily by the hydrolase N-terminal domains. To our knowledge, the BiSP structure represents the first assignment of a functional role of a B domain for dimerization in the entire glycoside hydrolase family 13. The proposed reaction mechanism of the glycoside hydrolase family 13 is a double displacement reaction (7Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar) involving a covalent enzyme-glucosyl intermediate (Scheme 1). For sucrose phosphorylase from Pseudomonas saccharophila, the existence of the intermediate was indicated already in 1947 by Doudoroff et al. (8Doudoroff M. Barker H.A. Hassid W.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 168: 725-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this was experimentally confirmed by Voet and Abeles (9Voet J.G. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1020-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is initiated by simultaneous protonation of the ether linkage oxygen atom by the proton donor (identified as Glu232 for BiSP) and nucleophilic attack by Asp192 on the anomeric carbon of the glucosyl moiety. This leads to the covalently linked enzyme-substrate intermediate and the release of fructose. The intermediate can then react with phosphate (HPO42− orH2PO4−), and glucose 1-phosphate is finally released. Reactions with other nucleophiles such as water and saccharides are also possible. A detailed kinetic study of BiSP has not been performed yet, but sucrose phosphorylase from P. saccharophila has been thoroughly examined previously (10Silverstein R. Voet J. Reed D. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1338-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present the structures of wild-type BiSP reacted with sucrose and the BiSP(E232Q) mutant co-crystallized with sucrose. The structures represent the first intact complexes of a sucrose phosphorylase and provide significant new information on the catalytic mechanism. This study will lead to a number of biochemical investigations that will further enhance our understanding of the basis for substrate specificity of enzymes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism. Chemicals and Enzymes—Chemicals and primers were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Recombinant BiSP was isolated and purified as described (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P. Verhoef R. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Construction of BiSP Mutant—A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations in the gene (AF543301) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The following primers were used for the E232Q modification (with the introduced mutations in italics and underlined): E232Qreverse, 5′-GTAGTAGGAGTGCACTTGGATGAGGATTTCCAGACC-3′; and E232Qforward, 5′-GGTCTGGAAATCCTCATCCAAGTGCACTCCTACTAC-3′. The wild-type BiSP gene (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P. Verhoef R. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used as a template. After mutagenesis, plasmid DNA from two blue colonies was isolated using a Qiagen plasmid purification kit. To verify that the desired mutation was introduced, the DNA nucleotide sequences of the plasmids were determined using a DYEnamic™ ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an automated ABI PRISM 3100 analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Isolation of Mutant Sucrose Phosphorylase—Cells from an Escherichia coli culture (1 liter, LB medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin, 37 °C) containing the mutant BiSP gene were grown overnight. The mutant sucrose phosphorylase present in the cells was isolated as described for the recombinant sucrose phosphorylase (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P. Verhoef R. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 65: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fractions containing high amounts of mutant BiSP were pooled. The presence of mutant BiSP was determined by SDS-PAGE using the Pharmacia PhastSystem according to the instructions of the supplier. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was used for detection of proteins on PhastGel 10-15% gradient gels (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Sucrose Phosphorylase Activity—Sucrose phosphorylase activity was measured in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6) containing 1 g/liter sucrose and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The concentrations of wild-type and mutant BiSP were 2.8 and 34.0 μg/ml, respectively. The reaction was stopped by raising the temperature to 100 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography as described (1van den Broek L.A.M. van Boxtel E.L. Kievit R.P.

Crystallization and Data Collection of the BiSP(E232Q) Mutant in Complex with Sucrose—Crystals of the E232Q mutant were produced as described for native BiSP crystals (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M.

Hanging drops were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl of protein solution (0.9 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1)) with 2.5 μl of precipitant solution (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Bicine (pH 8.6), and 50 mm sodium acetate) and equilibrated with 500 μl of precipitant solution at 20 °C. These crystals were soaked with a solution mimicking the crystallization conditions but supplemented with 20 mm sucrose for 1 h. Small crystals could also be obtained by co-crystallization with sucrose, but these were too small for data collection. The soaked crystals were mounted in a thin fiber loop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at beamline BW7B (λ = 0.843 Å) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Hamburg, Germany) at 120 K using a crystal- to-detector distance of 325 mm (300-mm scan mode of a MAR 345 image plate) and an oscillation range of 0.5°. The collected reflection data were processed with MOSFLM (12Leslie, A. G.

Hanging drops were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl of protein solution (0.9 mg/ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1)) with 2.5 μl of precipitant solution (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Bicine (pH 8.6), 50 mm sodium acetate, and 5% (w/v) sucrose) and equilibrated with 500 μl of precipitant solution at 20 °C. After 3-4 days, the drops were streak-seeded using wild-type microcrystals. Crystals grew to a maximum size of 50 × 50 × 50 μm within 14 days and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Data collection was performed at beamline BW7B (λ = 0.841 Å) at the EMBL Hamburg Synchrotron Radiation Facility at 120 K using a crystal- to-detector distance of 250 mm (240-mm scan mode of a MAR 345 image plate) and an oscillation range of 0.5°. The collected reflection data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. A summary of the data collection statistics is provided in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinements—In both structures, the resulting electron density maps were easily traced using the program ARP/wARP (15Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct.

Refinement steps were accepted if they produced a lowering of Rfree. Water molecules were picked among spherical peaks of 1.2σ in the 2Fo - Fc maps and were analyzed for hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein or other water molecules.

Open table in a new tab The BiSP(E232Q)-Sucrose Structure—Two BiSP molecules (A and B) resulting in a total of 1008 amino acid residues, two sucrose molecules, and 999 water molecules were included in the final model. In both chains, Cys356 has been oxidized (probably by the synchrotron radiation) to a sulfone, and residue 232 has been modeled as Gln according to the introduced mutation. The Ramachandran plot as calculated by the program PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Preparation of Figures—All figures presented here were created with PyMOL (www.pymol.org) (22DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Sucrose phosphorylases are retaining enzymes, and the crystal structure of wild-type BiSP indicates that Glu232 and Asp192 are the catalytic residues acting as acid/base catalyst and nucleophile, respectively (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain detailed information on the binding site of the substrate, mutants that capture sucrose in the active site can be created. In this study, the BiSP gene was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to replace Glu232 with Gln to inactivate the enzyme. The products formed by sucrose phosphorylase were measured by high performance anion exchange chromatography. In comparison with wildtype BiSP, the BiSP mutant showed no activity toward sucrose, not even at a >10-fold higher protein concentration (data not shown). The BiSP-Substrate Complex—To obtain the sucrose complex, crystals of the inactive BiSP(E232Q) mutant were soaked in sucrose. Both monomers (A and B) have identical overall conformations (root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.3 Å on 504 C-α atoms and an estimated coordinate error of the structure of 0.3 Å) that are highly similar to those in the wild-type BiSP-Tris complex (r.m.s. deviation of 0.3 Å on 504 C-α atoms of molecule A) (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The sucrose molecule is bound within the active-site pocket (Fig. 2A) at approximately the same position as the Tris molecule in the previously determined structure (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The interactions of BiSP(E232Q) and sucrose are shown in Fig. 2B and Table 3. The binding of sucrose is very similar to that observed in the mutant E328Q amylosucrasesucrose complex (Fig. 2C) (18Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. De Montalk G.P. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9032-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl groups of the glucosyl moieties (4C1 conformation) have conserved hydrogen-bonding partners. Also, the water molecule that mediates the contact between Asp50 (Asp144 in amylosucrase) and the glucosyl O-4 is conserved. However, there are differences in the binding of the fructosyl moieties. O-3′ is within hydrogen-bonding distance of His234, whereas O-3′ interacts with a water molecule in amylosucrase. Furthermore, BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose has one hydrogen bond with a water molecule and one with Asp342; instead, a water-mediated hydrogen bond with O-4′ is formed in the E328Q amylosucrase-sucrose complex. The E328Q amylosucrase-sucrose O-6′ interactions with Asp394 and Arg446 are replaced in the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex by hydrogen bonds with Gln345 only. Unlike in E328Q amylosucrase and other related enzymes, the sucrose molecule in BiSP(E232Q) is packed tightly within the active-site pocket.TABLE 3Potential hydrogen-bonding distances (up to 3.5 Å) of the two BiSP complexesInteratomic distanceLigandBiSP(E232Q)-sucrose, molecule AWild-type BiSP-glucoseGlucosyl intermediateβ-d-GlucoseÅGlucosylO-2Arg190 N-η23.03.02.9Gln/Glu232 N-ϵ2/O-δ23.32.9His289 N-ϵ23.13.12.9Asp290 O-δ22.62.72.7O-3His289 N-ϵ22.93.12.9Asp290 O-δ22.72.82.7O-4Asp50 O-δ22.83.02.8Arg399 N-η12.62.72.7O-6His88 N-ϵ22.93.02.9Asp192 O-δ22.92.72.8FructosylO-1′, Gln232 O-ϵ12.6O-3′, His234 N-ϵ23.5O-4′, Asp342 O-δ22.8O-5′, Gln345 O-ϵ12.8 Open table in a new tab The BiSP-Glucosyl Intermediate Complex—Crystals of the wild-type BiSP complex were obtained by co-crystallization with sucrose. The asymmetric unit of the crystals comprises two molecules forming the same dimer interface as observed in the Tris complex. Here, however, the two molecules adopt different conformations. The conformation of molecule A is very similar to that in the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex (r.m.s. deviation of 0.3 Å on 504 C-α atoms), whereas the conformation of molecule B shows larger deviations (1.6 Å to molecules A of the Tris and E232Q complexes on all 504 C-α atoms). Both enzyme molecules contain glucose within the active site, but only one glucose is covalently bound to the nucleophile, i.e. forming the catalytic covalent intermediate (molecule A) (Fig. 3A) The other glucose is noncovalently bound (molecule B) (Fig. 3B). The interactions of the glucosyl intermediate are shown in Fig. 3C and Table 3. Because the anomeric carbon of sucrose changes configuration from α to β upon formation of the covalent intermediate, we observed the β-anomer bound as expected. To date, two covalent intermediate structures have been solved for enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family 13, viz. cyclodextrin glucosyltransferase (19Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and amylosucrase (20Jensen M.H. Mirza O. Albenne C. Remaud-Simeon M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The most relevant structure for comparison with the covalent BiSP intermediate is that of amylosucrase, because amylosucrase and BiSP share sucrose as the primary substrate; furthermore, hydrolysis is only a minor side reaction for both enzymes. The glucosyl moiety in BiSP is in a slightly twisted 1,4B conformation compared with 4C1 observed in amylosucrase. However, O-δ2, O-2, O-3, and O-4 occupy nearly the same positions in the two structures. O-6 is shifted by ∼1 Å, but forms a hydrogen bond with a conserved His residue in both structures. The active-site architecture of the covalent intermediate appears to be very similar to that of the sucrose-bound form. The glucosyl moiety occupies the same position in the covalent intermediate as in the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex, and all residues in close vicinity of the glucosyl moieties are located at very similar positions, i.e. no structural rearrangements accompany the formation of a covalent intermediate in BiSP. The flipping of the glucosyl ring from 4C1 in sucrose to 1,4B in the intermediate does, however, have consequences in terms of binding. C-1 moves by 1.2 Å toward Phe53, and this movement adds to the van der Waals interactions. A similar situation was observed upon formation of the covalent intermediate in amylosucrase, where the glucosyl moiety was translated toward Tyr147 with a shift of 1.5 Å (20Jensen M.H. Mirza O. Albenne C. Remaud-Simeon M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that favorable van der Waals interactions contribute to stabilize the covalent intermediates in BiSP as well as in amylosucrase. The BiSP-Product Complex after Hydrolysis—As the enzyme goes from the covalent intermediate-bound state to the product-bound state, a number of changes to the active-site topology occur. The glucosyl-binding site remains unaltered. Hence, the active-site interactions with the glucose are very similar to those seen with the glucosyl part of sucrose in the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex (Fig. 3D). The noncovalently bound glucose (in molecule B) adopts the β-configuration with a 4C1 conformation. The most striking differences between the glucose product-bound form (after hydrolysis of the covalently bound intermediate) and the substrate- and intermediate-bound forms are the conformations of the loops between residues 336 and 344 (loop A) and residues 130 and 140 (loop B), which differ by up to 16 and 4 Å, respectively (Fig. 4A). Excluding these regions, the r.m.s. deviation is 0.3 Å (on 484 C-α atoms) compared with all other BiSP monomers. The rigid-body movement of loop B can be ascribed to major changes in backbone torsion angles of residues 133 and 137. Both loops A and B are in close proximity in the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose and BiSP-glucosyl intermediate structures. Therefore, it is conceivable that the conformational changes observed in the wild-type BiSP-glucose structure are not independent. As a consequence of these differences in loop conformations, the architecture of the active site changes. Asp342 of loop A moves out of the binding site and becomes solvent-exposed. Tyr344 replaces Asp342, whereas Arg135 of loop B moves into the active site, with the guanidino group replacing the side chain of Leu341. Because of the movement of Asp342 out of and the movement of Arg135 and Tyr344 into the active site, a net change in charge of +2 is seen. Toward Understanding the Reaction Mechanism—The study has provided structural information on a substrate (sucrose)-bound form of the enzyme, the enzyme-glucosyl intermediate, and a product (glucose)-bound form. So far, the structures of the apoenzyme and α-d-glucose 1-phosphate product-bound form remain to be determined. The first step in the proposed reaction cycle (Scheme 2) is binding of sucrose to the active site of the enzyme. Upon formation of the covalent intermediate, the fructose group is cleaved off and is required to move away from the covalent intermediate C-1 atom by ∼3 Å. This is compensated, to some extent, by the 1.2-Å movement caused by the 4C1-to-1,4B conformational change, but it still requires loop A to be pushed ∼2 Å away from the active-site residues. In the covalent intermediate structure, loops A and B adopt conformations similar to those observed in the sucrose complex: conformations that do not allow the exit of fructose because the entry to the active site is too narrow. In the BiSP-substrate and BiSP-intermediate complexes, loop A is hydrogen-bonded to loop B through the backbone atoms of Pro134 and Leu343. Upon hydrolysis of the enzyme-glucosyl intermediate and formation of the glucose productbound form, this interaction is lost because of large movements of loop A. Loop A now adopts an entirely different conformation that brings Tyr344 into the fructose-binding site. The large conformational change in loop A possibly causes loop B to move farther in toward the active site. Phosphorolysis of the glucosyl intermediate is not observed in the wild-type BiSP structure, as phosphate ions were not present during crystallization. To locate possible phosphate-binding site(s) in BiSP, soaking and co-crystallization experiments with phosphate, sulfate, vanadate, and cacodylate were performed. Only co-crystallization of wild-type BiSP with cacodylate resulted in a complex structure to a resolution of 3 Å (data not shown). However, no cacodylate ions were observed within the active site. To investigate the phosphorylase activity of BiSP, the position of the glucose molecule hydrolysis product can be used to dock the glucose 1-phosphate reaction product into the active site (Fig. 4B). Arg135 and Tyr344 are positioned nearly optimally for the binding of a phosphate group. By extruding Arg135 into the active site, the BiSP enzyme ensures that phosphate is able to compete out water, i.e. prevent hydrolysis via strong electrostatic interaction. Hydrolysis is a significant reaction in other transferases utilizing a covalent intermediate. Notably, Asp342 and Tyr344 of loop A are completely conserved, and Arg135 of loop B is substituted only with lysine among the known sucrose phosphorylases, emphasizing the importance of these residues for sucrose phosphorylase activity. A question that remains to be answered is why a mixed dimer consisting of the intermediate- and hydrolysis product-bound forms is found upon treatment of wild-type BiSP with sucrose. One possible explanation is that it is a consequence of crystal packing. However, it has been previously indirectly observed using complementary methods that such mixed dimers also exist in solution (9Voet J.G. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1020-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although structurally different from BiSP, the crystal structure of maltose phosphorylase (an enzyme that undertakes phosphorolysis of maltose into glucose and glucose 1-phosphate by inversion) (21Egloff M.P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 689-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) also shows a mixed dimer when phosphate is present. In maltose phosphorylase, the phosphate-binding loops rearrange in only one molecule to create a phosphate-binding site near the proposed maltose-binding site. As in BiSP, these phosphate-binding loops are also involved in forming the dimer interface in maltose phosphorylase, and it is possible that both enzymes work in a similar fashion, even though they do not belong to the same family of enzymes. Overall, essentially the same dimer as identified in the BiSP-Tris structure (2Sprogoe D. van den Broek L.A.M. Mirza O. Kastrup J.S. Voragen A.G.J. Gajhede M. Skov L.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is found in the our two structures. When analyzing the protein-protein contacts using the PISA server at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, we found that, for the BiSP(E232Q)-sucrose complex, the size of the accessible surface area is 957 Å2. For the glucosyl intermediate, the dimer interface is generally maintained, but because of the movements of the loops in the glucose product-bound form of the enzyme, the interactions are slightly different. The size increases to 1052 Å2, and the number of hydrogen bonds also increases. This asymmetry of the dimers may reflect the way that phosphate ions are brought to the active site. Analyses of the dimer interface in the BiSP-sucrose and BiSP-glucosyl intermediate complexes revealed that the guanidino groups of Arg135 are pointing toward the interface and that the distance between them is ∼10 Å. Slight movements of these side chains would make the guanidino groups from both monomers create a phosphate-binding site (Fig. 4C). This is in agreement with the observation that cacodylate ions are capable of binding to this site (data not shown). It implies that BiSP has only one surface phosphate-binding site from which phosphate ions are transported to the active site by Arg135. Thus, BiSP might work in such a way that the two monomers are out of phase and require phosphate at different times; whereas one monomer phosphorylates the covalent intermediate and releases glucose 1-phosphate, the other monomer binds sucrose and creates the covalent intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W1967913576,"Iso-fatty acids (FAs) are the dominant FA family in all myxobacteria analyzed. Furthermore, it was postulated that iso-FAs or compounds derived thereof are involved in fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus, since mutants with a reduced level of iso-FA due to a reduced level of the precursor isovaleryl-CoA, are delayed in aggregation and produce only few myxospores. To elucidate the function of iso-FAs and their corresponding lipids we have analyzed the developmental phenotype of mutants having different levels of iso-FAs resulting in a clear correlation between the amount of iso-FAs and the delay of aggregation and reduction in spore yield. Addition of either isovalerate or 13-methyltetradecanoic acid resulted in restoration of the wild-type FA profile and normal development. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid (FA) profile during fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus wild-type revealed the specific accumulation of 13-methyltetradecanal and 1-O-13-methyltetradecylglycerol which were produced specifically in the myxospores and which are derived from 1-O-(13-methyl-1-Z-tetradecenyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (VEPE) and 1,2-di-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol (TG-1), respectively. The structures of these unusual ether lipids have been determined by spectrometric methods and synthesis (for TG-1). Analysis of several mutants blocked at different stages of development indicated that the biosynthesis of TG-1 is developmentally regulated and that VEPE might be an intermediate in the TG-1 biosynthesis. Finally, addition of TG-1 to mutants blocked in the biosynthesis of isovaleryl-CoA could restore aggregation and sporulation emphasizing the important role of iso-branched lipids for myxobacterial development. Iso-fatty acids (FAs) are the dominant FA family in all myxobacteria analyzed. Furthermore, it was postulated that iso-FAs or compounds derived thereof are involved in fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus, since mutants with a reduced level of iso-FA due to a reduced level of the precursor isovaleryl-CoA, are delayed in aggregation and produce only few myxospores. To elucidate the function of iso-FAs and their corresponding lipids we have analyzed the developmental phenotype of mutants having different levels of iso-FAs resulting in a clear correlation between the amount of iso-FAs and the delay of aggregation and reduction in spore yield. Addition of either isovalerate or 13-methyltetradecanoic acid resulted in restoration of the wild-type FA profile and normal development. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid (FA) profile during fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus wild-type revealed the specific accumulation of 13-methyltetradecanal and 1-O-13-methyltetradecylglycerol which were produced specifically in the myxospores and which are derived from 1-O-(13-methyl-1-Z-tetradecenyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (VEPE) and 1,2-di-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol (TG-1), respectively. The structures of these unusual ether lipids have been determined by spectrometric methods and synthesis (for TG-1). Analysis of several mutants blocked at different stages of development indicated that the biosynthesis of TG-1 is developmentally regulated and that VEPE might be an intermediate in the TG-1 biosynthesis. Finally, addition of TG-1 to mutants blocked in the biosynthesis of isovaleryl-CoA could restore aggregation and sporulation emphasizing the important role of iso-branched lipids for myxobacterial development. Myxobacteria are Gram-negative soil bacteria that can form fruiting bodies under starvation conditions (1Reichenbach H. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These fruiting bodies are visible to the naked eye and can reach a tree-like complexity in some species. During the developmental process, a certain amount of vegetative cells differentiates into heat- and desiccation-resistant myxospores enabling the survival of the colony. The model organism to study this highly complex process is Myxococcus xanthus from which different extracellular signals and regulators have already been described that can be combined in a model likely reflecting the essential parts of the underlying regulatory network (2Kaiser D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Søgaard-Andersen L. Overgaard M. Lobedanz S. Ellehauge E. Jelsbak L. Rasmussen A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical changes that are involved in this process or appear as a result of it have been barely identified. That biochemical changes occur is evident from change in cell shape from vegetative rods to round myxospores with thick spore coats (4Johnson R.Y. White D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kottel R.H. Bacon K. Clutter D. White D. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 550-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and high amounts of trehalose (6McBride M.J. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6383-6386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is proposed to act as a compatible solute. Furthermore, the pioneering work of White and co-workers (7Orlowski M. White D. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 96-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Filer D. White D. Kindler S.H. Rosenberg E. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 751-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that several enzymes involved in increase of carbohydrate biosynthesis are induced during sporulation. Ten years ago, Downard and coworkers identified a mutant that was disrupted in the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (Bkd) 2The abbreviations used are: Bkd, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase; FA, fatty acid; SCFA, straight-chain fatty acid; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; IVA, isovalerate; iso15:0, 13-methyltetradecanoate; MvaS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; kan, kanamycin; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; di-iso15:0-PE, 1,2-di-(-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; VEPE, 1-O-(13-methyl-1-Z-tetradecenyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; AEPE, 1-O-(13-methyltetradecyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; TG-1, 1,2-di-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol; TG-2, 1,2-di-(hexadecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol; TPG, glycerol tripalmitate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; PR, peripheral rod. 2The abbreviations used are: Bkd, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase; FA, fatty acid; SCFA, straight-chain fatty acid; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; IVA, isovalerate; iso15:0, 13-methyltetradecanoate; MvaS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; kan, kanamycin; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; di-iso15:0-PE, 1,2-di-(-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; VEPE, 1-O-(13-methyl-1-Z-tetradecenyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; AEPE, 1-O-(13-methyltetradecyl)-2-O-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; TG-1, 1,2-di-(13-methyltetradecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol; TG-2, 1,2-di-(hexadecanoyl)-3-(13-methyltetradecyl)glycerol; TPG, glycerol tripalmitate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; PR, peripheral rod. complex, which resulted in a developmental phenotype forming almost no aggregates or spores under starvation conditions (10Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Bkd complex is involved in the degradation of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine, with all three being essential amino acids for M. xanthus (11Bretscher A.P. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 763-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation products of these amino acids are isovaleryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively (12Michal G. Biochemical Pathways. 1, Spektrum Akad. Verlag, Heidelberg1999Google Scholar), which are used as starting units for iso- and anteiso-fatty acids and also for several secondary metabolites from different bacteria (e.g. avermectin from Streptomyces avermitilis (13Dutton C.J.

Antibiot. 2005; 58: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) from Stigmatella aurantiaca). In all myxobacteria analyzed so far, iso-FAs are the dominant fatty acid family (17Bode H.B. Dickschat J.S. Kroppenstedt R.M. Schulz S. Müller R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 532-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Dickschat J.S. Bode H.B. Kroppenstedt R.M. Müller R. Schulz S. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2005; 3: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consequently, disruptions of the bkd genes (also termed esg from E-signal (22Downard J. Ramaswamy S.V. Kil K.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7762-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) result in a dramatic decrease in the amount of iso-FAs due to a severe reduction of isovaleryl-CoA levels. Because the wild-type fatty acid profile and the normal life cycle can be restored in the bkd mutant by adding isovalerate (IVA), it was speculated that an iso-FA or a corresponding lipid is involved in the developmental process (10Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Downard J. Toal D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) containing the straight-chain fatty acid (SCFA) hexadecenoic acid 16:1ω5c has been identified by Shimkets and coworkers (24Kearns D.B. Venot A. Bonner P.J. Stevens B. Boons G.J. Shimkets L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13990-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to act as a chemotaxis signal with a very narrow activity profile. The bkd mutant showed a high excess of this and other SCFAs, which would result in an excess of the required signal and therefore in a loss of the chemotaxis. However, recent analysis of a mutant that produces only trace amounts of SCFAs revealed that this FA or the corresponding PE is not required for fruiting body formation or sporulation as both occurred indistinguishable to the wild type (25Bode H.B. Ring M.W. Kaiser D. David A.C. Kroppenstedt R.M. Schwär G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5632-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inactivation of the bkd locus does not lead to a complete loss of iso-FA production, which is due to the presence of a novel alternative pathway to isovaleryl-CoA (Fig. 1), branching from the well known mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid biosynthesis (18Mahmud T. Bode H.B. Silakowski B. Kroppenstedt R.M. Xu M. Nordhoff S. Höfle G. Müller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23768-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Mahmud T. Wenzel S.C. Wan E. Wen K.W. Bode H.B. Gaitatzis N. Müller R. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This pathway is so far unique to myxobacteria and is highly induced in bkd mutants. Recently, we were able to show that this pathway is also induced during fruiting body formation and might function as an alternative source for isovaleryl-CoA under these leucine limiting conditions (27Bode H.B. Ring M.W. Schwär G. Kroppenstedt R.M. Kaiser D. Müller R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6524-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we could show that the decrease in iso-FA formation is even more severe in mutants where both pathways to isovaleryl-CoA are disrupted (27Bode H.B. Ring M.W. Schwär G. Kroppenstedt R.M. Kaiser D. Müller R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6524-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the developmental phenotype of this double mutant and present evidence that the developmental defect might be due to the loss of unusual iso-branched ether lipids, which were identified as novel biochemical biomarkers of myxobacterial development, because they are produced mainly in fruiting body-derived myxospores.

The triglycerides (which did not dissolve well in methanol) were mixed vigorously and added as suspension. Developmental aggregation was followed visually using an Olympus SZH or a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axiocam MRc camera.

Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar), modified by Lewis et al. (38Lewis T. Nichols P.D. McMeekin T.A. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2000; 43: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen and dissolved in chloroform to give a concentration of 10 mg of total lipids per milliliter. One milliliter of this solution was fractionated by solid-phase extraction on a column of 300 mg of unmodified Silica Gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in chloroform. Neutral lipids were eluted from the column with 15 ml of chloroform, medium polar lipids were eluted with 15 ml of an acetone-methanol mixture (9:1, v/v), and phospholipids were eluted with 10 ml of methanol. For higher lipid quantities, amounts of silica gel and solvents were scaled up appropriately. Separation of Lipids by HPLC—Phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species were separated similar to a published procedure (39Brouwers J.F. Vernooij E.A. Tielens A.G. van Golde L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 164-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with UV detection at 206 nm and a Nucleosil C18 column (250 × 10 mm, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The mobile phase was acetonitrile-methanol-water (30:68:2, v/v) containing 5 μm ethanolamine at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. For further purification, the mobile phase composition was changed to acetonitrile-methanol-water (30:65:5, v/v). Neutral lipid classes were fractionated by normal phase HPLC on a LiChrospher silica gel column (250 × 4 mm, Merck) with hexane/methyl-tert-butylether (98:2, v/v) as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 215 nm. Structural Elucidation of Lipids—Samples were directly injected into a Bruker HCTplus ESI ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). PE and plasmenylethanolamine molecular species were analyzed in negative ionization mode, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns were interpreted according to the literature (40Pulfer M. Murphy R.C. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 332-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 41Han X.L. Gross R.W. J. Am. Soc Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In positive mode, triacylglycerols and their ether analogues could be analyzed in the presence of 10 mm of LiCl, favoring the formation of [M+Li]+ ions, whose structural elucidation was carried out according to the literature as well (42Cheng C. Gross M.L. Pittenauer E. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 43Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For high resolution mass spectrometry, samples were injected into a Bruker mic-rOTOF ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, and the sum formula was calculated from the obtained exact ion mass. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX 500 or Bruker Avance 500 spectrometers with CDCl3 as solvent and internal reference. Analysis of Phospholipids via HPLC-MS—For relative quantitation of phospholipid molecular species, 10 μl of the phospholipid fraction dissolved in acetonitrile-methanol (1:3, v/v) were separated by analytical HPLC (Agilent 1100 HPLC system, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) on a Nucleodur Gravity RP18 column (125 × 2 mm, Macherey-Nagel) coupled to a Bruker HCTplus ion trap mass spectrometer. The mobile phase consisted of methanol-water (9:1 v/v, solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with both solvents containing 5 μm ethanolamine. The gradient started at 50% B for 2 min, then decreased to 30% B over a time of 48 min, increased to 95% B over 5 min, and held at this percentage for 4 min, followed by a decrease to 50% over 5 min and a re-equilibration period of 4 min. The flow rate was maintained at 0.4 ml/min. Quantitation was carried out using Bruker QuantAnalysis software, calculating the areas under the [M-H]– ions from appropriate extracted ion chromatograms. Analysis of Whole Lipids by GC-MS—The lipid sample was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in a mixture of hexane and methyl-tert-butylether (1:1, v/v). To 80 μl of this solution, 20 μl of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Macherey-Nagel) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The gas chromatograph was an Agilent model 6890 with a 7683N mass selective detector and a high temperature 50%-phenyldimethylpolysiloxane capillary column (OPTIMA-17TG 25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.1 μm, Macherey-Nagel). 2 μl of sample solution was injected using a pulsed splitless injection technique. The helium flow rate was set to 1.5 ml/min, and inlet and GC-MS transfer line temperatures were held at 300 °C. Column oven temperature was initially set to 200 °C and held for 5 min, then increased to 340 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min followed by 15 min at 340 °C. Synthetic Procedures—13-methyltetradecanal and 13-methyltetradecanoic acid were synthesized by stepwise oxidation of 13-methyltetradecanol (44Dickschat J.S. Bode H.B. Wenzel S.C. Müller R. Schulz S. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) similar to published procedures (45Corey E.J. Schmidt G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1979; 20: 399-402Crossref Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 46Bailey S.J. Thomas E.J. Vather S.M. Wallis J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1983; 1: 851-859Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, 13-methyltetradecanol was transformed to 1-iodo-13-methyltetradecane, which then was reacted with dl-1,2-O-isopropylideneglycerol resulting in the formation of dl-1-O-13-methyltetradecylglycerol after hydrolysis of the protecting group following standard synthesis methods. Acylation of the free hydroxy groups of dl-1-O-13-methyltetradecylglycerol by either 13-methyltetradecanoic acid or palmitic acid similar to published procedures (47Starck J.P. Nakatani Y. Ourisson G. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 2629-2638Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) resulted in the final diacyl ether lipids TG-1 and TG-2, respectively. Detailed descriptions and spectroscopic data of all synthesis products and intermediates can be found as supplemental information on the JBC website. Fruiting Body Formation and Developmental Sporulation in M. xanthus Is Dependent on the Amount of Iso-branched Fatty Acids—Analysis of fruiting body formation of the wild-type (DK1622), a mutant impaired in leucine degradation (DK5643/Δbkd) and a strain with an additional disruption of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase encoding gene (DK5624/Δbkd, mvaS::kan) showed that aggregation was delayed most severely in DK5624, which produces only trace amounts of iso-FAs (27Bode H.B. Ring M.W. Schwär G. Kroppenstedt R.M. Kaiser D. Müller R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6524-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, the number of spores decreased 100-fold from 4% for DK5643 to 0.04% for DK5624 compared with the wild-type (100%). As expected, the aggregation and sporulation (to 40% of wild-type level) of both mutants could be restored by the addition of IVA (1 mm). In contrast to previous observations based on IVA addition to the growth medium and into the starvation medium (10Toal D.R. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. Downard J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), IVA supplementation of the starvation medium alone was sufficient for complementation (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, complementation to 30% of the wild-type level was achieved by supplementation of the starvation medium with the most abundant iso-FA 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso15:0, final concentration 1 mm). Microscopy employing a higher magnification of the colonies after 72 h of development showed that the fruiting bodies of DK5624 (Fig. 3b) were less compact and hardly produced any spores surrounding the aggregates as it could be frequently observed for DK1622 fruiting bodies (Fig. 3a). Reduced Fatty Acid Derivatives Accumulate during Fruiting Body Formation—The complementation of the developmental defect of DK5624 by addition of either IVA or iso15:0 indicated the involvement of iso-FAs in fruiting body formation, which was postulated previously. However, gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the wild-type FA profile during fruiting body formation revealed no significant change in the level of major iso-FAs. Nevertheless, two compounds increased during development (Fig. 4). The first compound increased during the first 24 h of development and was predicted to be iso14:0 3-OH by the microbial identification system used but GC-coupled MS of this compound led to its identification as dimethyl acetal of 13-methyltetradecanal, the aldehyde derived by reduction of iso15:0. The second compound increased constantly during the whole experiment (72 h) and eluted very late from the GC column. Furthermore, it could only be detected reproducibly after trimethylsilylation of the extract generated by the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) method (27Bode H.B. Ring M.W. Schwär G. Kroppenstedt R.M. Kaiser D. Müller R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6524-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), thus indicating the presence of acidic protons. Subsequent GC-MS analysis of this compound led to the identification of 1-O-13-methyltetradecylglycerol bearing an ether bond between 13-methyltetradecanol, the alcohol of iso15:0, and glycerol at the 1-position. The structure of both compounds was confirmed by synthesis and subsequent comparison of natural and synthetic compounds with respect to their fragmentation pattern and retention time. During fruiting body formation only ∼1% of all cells involved transform into myxospores, a process which is known to be dependent on the culture conditions (48O'Connor K.A. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4103-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wireman J.W. Dworkin M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 796-802Crossref Google Scholar). The remaining cells are thought to be used as a nutrient resource to support fruiting body formation and sporulation or retain their morphology as vegetative-like cells called peripheral rods (PRs). Moreover, despite their rod-shaped appearance, PRs are clearly distinguishable from vegetative cells by several characteristics (50O'Connor K.A. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3318-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52O'Connor K.A. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3342-3355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether the two unusual compounds were present in all cells during fruiting body formation, PRs and myxospores were separated by sucrose density centrifugation (32Tzeng L. Singer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the FA profile of both cell types was analyzed. Surprisingly, both new compounds are highly enriched in the myxospores with up to 20 and 40% of the total FAME extract consisting of the derivatized aldehyde and the glycerol ether, respectively. Contrary to this, PRs showed no such increase and looked much more like vegetative cells with respect to their fatty acid profile (Fig. 5). Furthermore, a third compound was detected in the spores by GC-MS that was identified as the vinyl ether analogue of the already described alkyl ether. Additional analyses showed that the ratio of vinyl ether to dimethyl acetal is strongly dependent on the workup procedure. Prolonged acidic conditions and the absence of water led to the exclusive formation of the dimethyl acetal, whereas only vinyl ether could be detected after alkaline hydrolysis, careful neutralization, and silylation of the resulting mixture (data not shown). This readily indicated that the dimethyl acetal might be derived from acidic vinyl ether cleavage and that the alkyl and the vinyl ethers are derived from larger lipids. No accumulation of the aldehyde or the glycerol ether was observed in spores obtained by glycerol induction, which are already known to be different from fruiting body spores by several other features (51O'Connor K.A. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3334-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, starvation buffer-induced sporulation spores show an increase of the aldehyde. This indicates that the morphological differences of the three spore types (30Rosenbluh A. Rosenberg E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4521-4524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51O'Connor K.A. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3334-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with specific biochemical differences. 13-Methyltetradecanal and 1-O-13-Methyltetradecylglycerol Originate from Two Lipids Accumulating during Fruiting Body Formation—During derivatization cellular lipids decompose, and their acyl residues are transformed into the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters. Similarly, vinyl ethers (e.g. plasmenyl lipids, also known as plasmalogens) are not stable under these acidic conditions and give rise to aldehydes, which are converted into the corresponding dimethyl acetals, whereas alkyl ethers (e.g. plasmanyl lipids) are stable but lose the acyl groups at"

Despite being essential the functions of this protein and its modification remain unclear. To gain more insight into these functions temperature-sensitive mutants of the human EIF5A1 were characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of the point mutated form V81G in a ΔeIF5A strain of yeast led to a strongly temperature-sensitive phenotype and to a significantly reduced protein level at restrictive temperature. The mutant showed accumulation of a subset of mRNAs that was also observed in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-deficient yeast strains. After short incubation at restrictive temperature the mutant exhibited increased half-lives of the intron containing CYH2 pre-mRNA and mature transcripts of NMD-dependent genes. Reduced telomere silencing and shortening was detected in the V81G mutant further supporting similarities to NMD-deficient strains. Our data suggest that eIF5A mediates important cellular processes like cell viability and senescence through its effects on the stability of certain mRNAs. The highly conserved protein eIF5A found in Archaea and all eukaryotes uniquely contains the posttranslationally formed amino acid hypusine.

Our data suggest that eIF5A mediates important cellular processes like cell viability and senescence through its effects on the stability of certain mRNAs. The cellular physiology of mRNA processing, transport, localization, and turnover is central to the process of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Increasing evidence has been found for a close connection between mRNA degradation processes and the steps of translation. The highly conserved hypusine-containing protein eIF5A has been implicated in both of these aspects of RNA metabolism; however, its precise cellular function is not yet fully understood.Hypusine formation is a two-step enzymatic reaction catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase and then deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (1Park M.H. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The disruption of genes encoding either eIF5A or deoxyhypusine synthase in yeast leads to a lethal phenotype (2Sasaki K. Abid M.R. Miyazaki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the deoxyhypusine residue is essential for the function of eIF5A and thus for proliferation and cell survival. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two HYP genes (HYP1, alias TIF51B or ANB1, and HYP2, alias TIF51A) coding for eIF5A. These genes are differentially expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (3Wöhl T. Klier H. Ammer H. Lottspeich F. Magdolen V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and share an identity of 90%. HYP genes of other higher eukaryotes, e.g. one of the two human HYP genes (encoding EIF5A1), can functionally replace these yeast-specific genes (4Magdolen V. Klier H. Wöhl T. Klink F. Hirt H. Hauber J. Lottspeich F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Schwelberger H.G. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14018-14025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The eIF5A protein was first isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate ribosomes and classified as a translation initiation factor because in vitro the protein enhanced the building reaction of the first peptide bond measured as the yield of methioninepuromycin (6Kemper W. Berry K. Merrick W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5551-5557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cell fractionation revealed that only a small fraction of the protein associated with ribosomes (7Thomas A. Goumans H. Amesz H. Benne R. Voorma H.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover depletion or inactivation of the protein in S. cerevisiae reduced the global protein synthesis rate by only 30% (8Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zuk D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of eIF5A as a translation initiation factor remains to be confirmed.eIF5A is an RNA-binding protein (10Liu Y.P. Nemeroff M. Yan Y.P. Chen K.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it was hypothesized to regulate the translation of a subset of mRNAs that are needed for G1/S cell cycle progression because agents blocking deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (11Hanauske-Abel H.M. Slowinska B. Zagulska S. Wilson R.C. Staiano-Coico L. Hanauske A.R. McCaffrey T. Szabo P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or deoxyhypusine synthase (12Jin B.F. He K. Hu M.R. Yu M. Shen B.F. Zhang X.M. Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003; 11: 325-328PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Ahern J. Davis L.J. Stern A.M. Waxman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) induced a cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary in several mammalian cell types. These results were supported by the G1 arrest at 37 °C of yeast cells expressing a temperature-sensitive point mutated form of Tif51A (14Chatterjee I. Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Chen K.Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2006; 275: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The finding that eIF5A is a cellular cofactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 Rex transactivator proteins in mRNA export and the interaction of eIF5A with the general exportin Crm1p for nuclear export signal-containing proteins in higher eukaryotes suggested it played a role in nucleoplasmatic shuttling of mRNA (15Bevec D. Jaksche H. Oft M. Wöhl T. Himmelspach M. Pacher A. Schebesta M. Koettnitz K. Dobrovnik M. Csonga R. Lottspeich F. Hauber J. Science. 1996; 271: 1858-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Rosorius O. Reichart B. Kratzer F. Heger P. Dabauvalle M. Hauber J. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, although the protein was found to be located in the nucleus and the cytosol of COS-7 cells (18Jao D.L.-E. Chen K.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), active shuttling between both compartments could not be confirmed. Also a direct interaction between Rev and eIF5A has not been shown (19Lipowski G. Bischoff F.R. Schwarzmaier P. Kraft R. Kostka. S. Hartmann E. Kutay U. Göhrlich D. EMBO J. 2000; 16: 4362-4371Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition yeast strains expressing temperature-sensitive mutants of Crm1p did not show a mislocalization of eIF5A to the nucleus (20Valentini S.R. Casolari J.M. Oliveira C.C. Silver P.A. McBride A.E. Genetics. 2002; 160: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the nuclear export hypothesis has been questioned.The implication of eIF5A in mRNA degradation initially came from studies of a temperature-sensitive HYP2 mutant (ts1159) that showed an accumulation and a strongly prolonged half-life of unspliced CYH2 mRNA (9Zuk D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The genetic background of this strain, however, reveals a functional HYP1 introducing the possibility that it might affect the observed phenotypic effects.Two studies revealed a connection between eIF5A and senescence processes showing a transcriptional up-regulation of deoxyhypusine synthase and eIF5A in aging tomato plants (21Wang T.-W. Lu L. Wang D. Thompson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17541-17549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Wang T.W. Lu L.G. Zhang C. Taylor C. Thompson J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 52: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian IMR-90 cells senescence led to a distinct attenuation of the hypusine formation (23Chen Z.P. Chen K.Y. J. Cell Physiol. 1997; 170: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). So far the cellular mechanism by which eIF5A is involved in cell aging is not known.Using yeast as a model system in which both native HYP genes were disrupted we describe the effects of expressing the point mutation V81G in the human hypusine-containing protein eIF5A1. We observed strong temperature sensitivities in these yeast strains. Expression of the mutant protein resulted in the accumulation of nonsense-containing RNAs, which are known to be specifically degraded by the polyadenylation-independent 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway (nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) 2The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HDOA, high density oligonucleotide array; LTR, long terminal repeat; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthizole-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ORF, open reading frame; ts, temperature-sensitive; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Ty, transposon yeast; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PD, population doubling.2The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HDOA, high density oligonucleotide array; LTR, long terminal repeat; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthizole-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ORF, open reading frame; ts, temperature-sensitive; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Ty, transposon yeast; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PD, population doubling.). Additionally elongated half-lives of selected NMD transcripts and shortened telomeres were observed. These results suggest a functional connection of eIF5A with the NMD machinery that is coupled to translation initiation and reinforce the notion that the protein might influence essential cellular functions via its role in RNA processing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown either on semisynthetic medium with 2% galactose or 2% glucose or on yeast-peptone-dextrose medium and yeast-peptone-galactose medium (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The plasmid shuffle with and without 5-fluoroorotic acid as selective agent was performed as described previously (25Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The disruption of the HYP1 gene was performed with the haploid strain WDH#6-9[YEpHYP2] (3Wöhl T. Klier H. Ammer H. Lottspeich F. Magdolen V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) bearing a disruption of HYP2 by a 2.22-kb LEU2 fragment. The HYP1 gene (cloned as a 1.94-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment in a plasmid derived from pBluescript; Stratagene) was disrupted by insertion of a 1.6-kb SmaI-AatII fragment carrying the TRP1 marker gene into the single SalI site of the HYP1 coding region. From the resulting vector a linear 3.6-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment was used for homologous recombination according to Rothstein (26Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Correct integration was verified by Southern analysis. Isolation of high molecular weight genomic yeast DNA, cloning, and in vitro mutagenesis of DNA were performed as described previously (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR amplification was used to clone the coding regions of different wild-type and point mutated HYP genes according to the properties of multiple cloning sides in the target vectors. The plasmids used and produced for this study are listed in Table 2. The constructs for HYP expression either harbored the coding sequence of the HYP2 gene (S. cerevisiae) or the cDNA of the human HYP1 gene EIF5A1. Transformation of yeast strains was performed using the lithium ion method (32Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (33Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) using a 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal antiserum against human EIF5A1 and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare).MTT Cell Viability Test—An MTT viability assay of mutant and wild-type yeast cells was performed as described previously (34Hodgson V. Walker G.M. Button D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 120: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—The TUNEL assay and appropriate cell preparations were performed as described previously (35Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Froehlich K.-U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Coverslips were mounted with a drop of 5% n-propyl gallate (Sigma) in glycerol (100%). Slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.Measurement of Caspase Activation—In vivo staining of caspase activity by flow cytometric analysis was performed as described previously (36Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Laechelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Froehlich K.-U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) using FITC-VAD-fmk (CaspACE, Promega) and a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). Wild-type cells treated with 3 mm H2O2 served as a positive control.Generation of Gene Expression Datasets by Microarray Analysis—For high density oligonucleotide array (HDOA) analysis total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol method (37Sprague G.F. Jensen Jr., R. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1983; 32: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) from cultures grown at 25 °C reaching early logarithmic phase. For each experiment RNA was independently isolated from four isogenic yeast strains of the wild type and the mutant (strains WDH(hum)Gal and WDHG81Gal), and in vitro transcriptions and hybridizations were performed. Thus, a total of eight chips were included in the analysis (4 replicates × 2 datasets for the wild type and the mutant V81G). RNA was further purified with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). In brief 30 μg of total RNA were subjected to a cDNA synthesis reaction to make the first strand using an oligo(dT) primer with a T7 promoter sequence added to the 5′-end. After synthesis of the second strand, double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Biotin-labeled cRNA was made by in vitro transcription using the High Yield Transcription kit (ENZO Diagnostics). The resulting cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in buffer A (40 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm KOAc, and 30 mm Mg(OAc)2). Affymetrix yeast S98 GeneChip ® arrays were hybridized, washed, stained, and scanned according to the manufacturer's specifications. Scanned raw data images were processed with Affymetrix GeneChip Version 3.2 software.Normalization and Statistical Analysis of Hybridization Data—Data from the arrays was normalized, and expression values based on an additive model were calculated according to the method of Irizarry et al. (38Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were identified by the permutation-based method of Tusher et al. (39Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Gilbert C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5115-5121Crossref Scopus (9704) Google Scholar). Briefly to control for multiple testing, a false discovery rate (40Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) was calculated as the percentage of genes falsely detected as differentially expressed among all genes detected as differentially expressed. The q value is the lowest false discovery rate at which the gene is called significant. Significant genes were identified if they exhibited the lowest q value computed by SAM (“Significance Analysis of Microarrays”) software. Detailed information regarding the analysis performed on the microarray data can be found in the supplemental data section. Primary array datasets were published in the gene expression and hybridization array data repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, accession number GSE5290). The transcriptomic profiles of V81G with NMD-deficient yeast were compared with the original .cel files published by He et al. (41He F. Spatrick P. Li X. Casillo R. Dong S. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1439-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and are available at www.ebi.ac.uk/miamexpress/under accession numbers E-MEXP-26 and E-MEXP-27. These datasets were analyzed in exactly the same way as the microarray data produced for this study.Northern Blotting and Determination of mRNA Half-lives—Yeast strains were cultured until they entered early log phase at either 25 or 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated as before (37Sprague G.F. Jensen Jr., R. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1983; 32: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was carried out as described previously (42Hatfield L. Beelman C.A. Stevens A. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5830-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RNA was detected by hybridization to digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes of about 350 bp in length that were prepared by PCR using yeast genomic template DNA. After hybridization and stringent washing signal detection was performed using anti-digoxigenin antiserum (Roche Applied Science). Quantification of RNA bands was performed using densitometry. The stability of selected mRNAs was determined according to Parker et al. (43Parker R. Herrick D. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 415-423Google Scholar). Briefly 200 ml of mutant and wild-type yeast strains were grown to A600 = 0.7 and incubated for 1 h at either 25 or 37 °C. Next transcription was inhibited by the addition of thiolutin (20 μg/ml), and subsequent samples were taken at 0-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-min intervals and frozen quickly in a dry ice-ethanol bath. Subsequently total RNA was isolated, and 10 μg of RNA/lane was analyzed by Northern blotting as described above.Quantitative Real Time (Reverse Transcriptional) PCR—Genespecific primers were designed with the PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems). The antisense primers were used for reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 2 μg of total RNA. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR ® Green PCR Master Mix and a Gene-Amp5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Relative expression levels were calculated, and PCR efficiencies were determined as described previously by Pfaffl (44Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24904) Google Scholar) and Ramakers et al. (45Ramakers C. Ruijter J.M. Deprez R.H. Moorman A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 339: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar), respectively, using ACT1 expression for normalization. For each RNA preparation tested a minimum of three independent real time (reverse transcriptional) PCR experiments were conducted.Determination of Telomere Length by Southern Analysis—Telomere lengths were determined as described previously (46Lew J.E. Enomoto S. Berman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6121-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly a probe containing a telomere repeat sequence was prepared by 5′-end labeling of the oligonucleotide Tel-Rep4 (CACCACACCCACACCCACACCACACCCACACACCCACAC) with digoxigenin. The sequence was identical to 2.5 repeats of the telomere template sequence from the chromosome 8 analogue to TLC1. Total genomic DNA was digested with PstI, and Southern blotting was performed as before. Signal development was achieved by using the DIG (digoxigenin) Luminescent Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSIsolation of the Temperature-sensitive Point Mutant V81G—To study the relationship between structure and function in the human EIF5A1 hypusine-containing protein point mutations were made throughout the entire length by exchanging phylogenetically conserved residues with related amino acids. A yeast strain was constructed (W303Δh1h2) in which both the genes HYP2 and HYP1 (ANB1) encoding for the hypusine-containing protein were disrupted (3Wöhl T. Klier H. Ammer H. Lottspeich F. Magdolen V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The strain harbored a 2μ-URA3-plasmid-borne wild-type copy of the genomic HYP2, thus complementing the otherwise lethal phenotype. The constructs containing the point mutations to be tested were cloned into pRS313 containing the GAL promotor and transformed into the W303Δh1h2 cells. The exchange of the wild type for a mutated allele was performed by selective plasmid shuffling using fluoroorotic acid. Because hypusine is essential, cell death occurred if the mutant allele cloned in pRS313 was incapable of complementing the gene function of the wild type. This counterselection was used to screen all mutations in the human HYP homologue EIF5A1.The expression of certain mutated alleles resulted in temperature-sensitive yeast strains. The strongest temperature sensitivity was observed by the substitution of the valine residue at position 81 (Fig. 1). Proliferation of cells at the restrictive temperature was stopped after only one round of doubling when valine at position 81 was mutated to a glycine (V81G). In comparison with wild type the growth of the mutated strain at the permissive temperature was decelerated. Retransformation of the mutant strains with a single copy plasmid carrying wild-type human EIF5A1 completely restored the temperature sensitivity (Fig. 1C) indicating that it was not a recessive mutation. Several independent transformations and subsequent 5-fluoroorotic acid selections reproducibly showed the pronounced phenotype of the mutant V81G. These mutated strains were chosen for the subsequent phenotypic characterization experiments.eIF5A Protein Levels and Viability at 37 °C—Complete cell lysates were prepared from wild-type or mutant cells after incubation at permissive or restrictive temperatures (Fig. 2). The eIF5A protein levels in each case were determined by Western blotting. At 25 °C the mutated protein was expressed to nearly the same amount as the wild type. Within 60 min after heat shock induction the level of the eIF5A (V81G) protein declined more than 5-fold. A further 5-h incubation at 37 °C did not result in further changes in the protein level.FIGURE 2Protein expression of wild-type and V81G mutated human eIF5A in yeast. Cells were incubated at 25 or at 37 °C for the indicated times and were subsequently harvested to prepare complete cell lysates. Equal amounts of total protein from mutant and wild-type strains were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the human EIF5A1 protein. Equal loading of all lanes was confirmed by densitometric scanning of the Coomassie-stained gel prior to blotting as well as quantification of the actin 1 protein on the Western blots that was equally expressed in wild-type and mutant strains. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The viability of V81G-expressing cells at both temperatures was checked with an MTT assay (Fig. 3). Independently isolated strains of the mutant V81G and the corresponding wild-type strains that were in early logarithmic growth phase were tested at both the restrictive and the permissive temperatures. Fig. 3 shows that the formation of blue formazan from the activity of dehydrogenases was similar for the wild-type cultures grown at either the restrictive or the permissive temperature. Slight differences were observed between wild-type HYP2 expression in yeast and heterologous (human) EIF5A1 expression. However, even at the permissive temperature, V81G, although capable of growth, displayed a 50% reduction in viability when compared with the wild type. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C the viability was further decreased.FIGURE 3MTT viability assay of mutant and wild-type cultures incubated with MTT for 2 h at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. Two independently isolated clones of each strain (WDH(hum) TO, WDHyp2TO, and WDHG81TO) were tested. Cell density of all cultures was normalized to 5×108 cells/ml, and isopropanolic cell extracts were measured at 570 nm. This OD value was proportional to the amount of blue formazan that was formed during reduction time. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate measurements of each of the two isogenic strains. Student's t tests for independent samples performed on every pair of strains in all cases generated p values below 0.05, indicating significance of the results. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the mutant's loss of cell viability was due to apoptotic death a TUNEL assay was performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 4B. No fluorescence was detected in the control cells expressing wild-type eIF5A regardless of the growth conditions. However, addition of 3 mm H2O2 and incubation for 6 h at 37°C rendered the cells positive for DNA breaks, which served as a positive control. At the permissive temperature (25 °C) the V81G mutant did not show any fluorescent nuclei. In contrast, after 4 h at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) clear fluorescence in the nuclei was visible and increased with longer incubation times.FIGURE 4Test for apoptotic death in growth-arrested cells of V81G.

Pneumonia is an acute respiratory disease that is caused by viral or bacterial pathogens. The major causative agent of pneumonia is the encapsulated, facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive, α-streptococcus bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. Having no known environmental pool, the S. pneumoniae niche appears to be strictly limited to a relationship with animals. In roughly ∼40% of humans it is a transient commensal of the throat and upper respiratory tract. However, S. pneumoniae frequently slips out of this passive role and into one of an accomplished pathogen. Indeed, invasive S. pneumoniae infections are a leading cause of death worldwide (1Kadioglu A. Andrew P.W. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The hardest hit are children less than 5 years old, where ∼3 million worldwide succumb annually to S. pneumoniae infections (2Tettelin H. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A. Read T.D. Peterson S. Heidelberg J. DeBoy R.T. Haft D.H. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Gwinn M. Kolonay J.F. Nelson W.C. Peterson J.D. Umayam L.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Lewis M.R. Radune D. Holtzapple E. Khouri H. Wolf A.M.

Fraser C.M. Science. 2001; 293: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In addition to pneumonia, this bacterium can cause meningitis, septicemia, and otitis media (1Kadioglu A. Andrew P.W. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae is clearly a serious pathogen that places a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Alarmingly, the frequency of antibiotic resistance in community-acquired strains of S. pneumoniae is increasing (3Doern G.V. Brueggemann A.B. Huynh H. Wingert E. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), requiring increased vigilance and redoubled research efforts aimed at fighting this bacterium. Recent signature-tagged mutagenesis experiments have suggested that numerous genes encoding putative glycoside hydrolases are necessary for the full virulence of S. pneumonia in a murine lung model of pneumonia (4Hava D.L. Camilli A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1389-1406PubMed Google Scholar). One such gene (SP2159 of S. pneumoniae TIGR 4) is the co-called “fucolectin-related protein” but is here called SpGH98. This gene is part of a fucose utilization operon that is conserved among the three sequenced strains of S. pneumoniae. Curiously, although it has been shown that the fucose utilization operon in S. pneumoniae is expressed (5Chan P.F. O'Dwyer K.M. Palmer L.M. Ambrad J.D. Ingraham K.A. So C. Lonetto M.A. Biswas S. Rosenberg M. Holmes D.J. Zalacain M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this bacterium is not capable of using fucose as a sole carbon source, indicating a non-nutritional role of SpGH98 in virulence. This protein is a 1038-amino acid protein of which the ∼600 amino acid N-terminal region shows amino acid sequence identity with family 98 glycoside hydrolases. After this is a triplet of modules (Fig. 1) having roughly 50-60% identity with one another and ∼25% amino acid sequence identity to the Anguilla anguilla fucose-specific lectin (AAA) 2The abbreviations used are: AAA, A. anguilla fucose-specific lectin; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (6Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the possible carbohydrate binding function of these C-terminal modules, which appear to fall into the family of so-called F-type lectins (6Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar), we have dissected the modular structure of SpGH98 by heterologous production of two single modules (SpX-1 and SpX-3), a tandem construct (SpX-1.2) and the triplet (SpX-1.2.3). This work reports the oligosaccharide binding specificity of these bacterial lectin-like carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which are classified on the basis of this study as family 47 CBMs, and explores the molecular basis of their specificity by x-ray crystallography. The apparent specificity of these modules for blood group antigens, particularly the Lewisy antigen, is relatively rare among carbohydrate-binding proteins and quite unusual, although not entirely unique (7Kostlanova N. Mitchell E.P. Lortat-Jacob H. Oscarson S. Lahmann M. Gilboa-Garber N. Chambat G. Wimmerova M. Imberty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), among bacterial carbohydrate-binding proteins. The observation that these fucose binding modules fall within the context of a putative enzyme involved in the virulence of S. pneumoniae is quite extraordinary and hints at an unexplored role of carbohydrate recognition in bacterial pathogenesis. Materials—All monosaccharides used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Oligosaccharides were obtained from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). Cloning—The DNA fragments encoding the desired modules (see Fig. 1) of the putative S. pneumoniae (TIGR4) family 98 glycoside hydrolase (see GenBank™ AE007504; open reading frame SP2159) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (ATCC BAA-334D) using previously described methods (8van Bueren A.L. Morland C. Gilbert H.J. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 530-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CATATGGCTAGCACACCAGATAAATTTAATGATG-3′ (X1F), 5′-CTCGAGAAGCTTTTATGATCTAAAAACCTCTAC-3′ (X1R), 5′-CTCGAGAAGCTTTTACTTTGAACCATAGACTTCAAG-3′ (X2R), 5′-CATATGGCTAGCAGAACTCCGAAGAAACTTTC-3′ (X3F), and 5′-CTCGAGAAGCTTTTACTTATAAGTATAAACCTCTAC-3′ (X3R). The SpX-1 module was amplified with the oligonucleotide pair X1F and X1R, SpX-3 module was amplified with X3F and X3R, the SpX-1.2 tandem module was amplified with X1F and X2R, and the SpX-1.2.3 triplet module was amplified with X1F and X3R. The amplified DNA products were cloned via their 5′- and 3′-engineered NheI and HindIII restriction sites into identically digested pET28a to give the plasmids pSPX1, pSPX3, pSPX12, and pSPX123, respectively. The encoded polypeptides contained an N-terminal His6 tag fused to the desired module by a thrombin protease cleavage site. Protein Production and Purification—Polypeptides were produced in 4-liter cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing pSPX1, pSPX3, pSPX12, or pSPX123 using methods described previously (9Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SpX-1, SpX-3, SpX-1.2, and SpX-1.2.3 were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography from cell free extracts following previously described procedures (9Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SpX-3 was solubilized from inclusion bodies and simultaneously renatured and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described previously (10Henshaw J. Horne-Bitschy A. van Bueren A.L. Money V.A. Bolam D.N. Czjzek M. Ekborg N.A. Weiner R.M. Hutcheson S.W. Davies G.J. Boraston A.B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17099-17107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purified polypeptides were concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, in a stirred ultra-filtration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA) on a 5000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Filtron, Northborough, MA). Purity, assessed by SDS-PAGE, was greater than 95%. Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentration of purified protein was determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) using a calculated molar extinction coefficients (11Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) of 17,780 m-1 cm-1, 20,340 m-1 cm-1, 54,620 m-1 cm-1, and 34,280 m-1 cm-1 for SpX-1, SpX-3, SpX-1.2.3, and SpX-1.2, respectively. Binding Studies—Fucose affinity chromatography experiments were run on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph using immobilized fucose resin (EY Laboratories, Inc.) packed in a 1-cm diameter column with a packed bed volume of 5 ml. The column was pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a sample containing 2 mg each of SpX-1.2.3, SpX-1.2, and SpX-1 was loaded on to the column. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of PBS followed by 1 ml of 300 mm l-fucose in PBS. Protein elution was monitored by both UV absorbance at 280 nm and SDS-PAGE. Binding to soluble oligosaccharides was assessed by their ability elute SpX-1.2.3 from immobilized fucose resin. Briefly, excess SpX-1.2.3 was incubated with 500 μl (packed volume) of fucose resin with agitation at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed and washed with 1 ml of PBS. Centrifugation and washing was repeated 5 additional times to remove any unbound SpX-1.2.3. On the final wash samples of 60 μl were separated into aliquots and centrifuged, and 40 μl of supernatant was discarded to give a 20-μl volume of packed resin. 15 μl of sugar solution was added to this, incubated for 1 h, and centrifuged to pellet the resin. 10 μl of supernatant samples were incubated with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Band intensities were quantified by densitometry. Data were corrected by subtraction of the amount of protein removed by incubation with only buffer (i.e. no sugar) and presented as values normalized to the amount of protein removed by excess l-fucose (20.8 mm), which was considered as 100% of the protein removed from the resin. Error was estimated to be ∼5% based on triplicate measurements for the 2.1 mm fucose samples. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed as described previously (12Boraston A.B. Notenboom V. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Davies G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Micro-Cal, Northampton, MA). Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5) then concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell as above. Sugar solutions were prepared by mass in buffer saved from the ultrafiltration step. Both protein and sugar solutions were filtered and degassed immediately before use. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance as described above. Aliquots of 5 mm Lewisy antigen were titrated into SpX-1 (87 μm). In this case, the C-value (13Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar) was less than 1 due to the low binding affinity. Based on the 1:1 binding observed in the crystal structure, the stoichiometry was fixed at 1 in the analysis of this data. Data were fit with a single binding site model. Indirect Immunofluorescence—SpX-1.2.3 was labeled with FITC as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Free label was separated from the labeled protein by gel filtration using Sephadex G-75. Freshly dissected, normal mouse lungs were infiltrated at room temperature with OCT compound and frozen at -800 °C. Cryostat sections (10-15 μm) were collected on gelatin-coated glass slides. Some sections were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (5 min) followed by 100% methanol (1 min). The sections were rinsed and blocked in 5% lamb serum in PBS Tween 20 for 45 min at room temperature. Fluorescently labeled carbohydrate affinity proteins were diluted to 200-250 pg/μl in 5% lamb serum in PBS and applied directly to sections for overnight incubation (4 °C). For double labeling experiments, primary antibody (anti-proSurfactant protein C, Chemicon) was diluted in 5% lamb serum in PBS (1:1000) and applied to sections overnight. Sections were rinsed 3 times in PBS, and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted as 1:800 or 1:1500 in 5% lamb serum PBS was applied to each section. After incubation (2 h) sections were rinsed with PBS. In some preparations sections were counter-stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Sections were mounted with coverslips and examined with a Leica DM-6000, and images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca wide-field camera controlled with Openlab software (4.04). Contrast and brightness were adjusted and images cropped and assembled using Photoshop. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—SpX-1 and SpX-3, previously exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, were treated overnight at room temperature with thrombin to remove the His6 tag. The polypeptides were separated from the cleaved His6 tag by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S200 column (GE Biosciences). Pure fractions were concentrated in a 10-ml stirred ultrafiltration device using a 5000 molecular weight cut-off membrane. All crystallizations were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. SpX-1 (at 20 mg/ml) was crystallized uncomplexed and in complex with sugars in 20-22% polyethylene glycol 1500, 0.15 m KSCN, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Crystals of SpX-1 in the presence of the Lewisy antigen were only obtained after streak-seeding drops with crushed crystals of uncomplexed SpX-1. SpX-3 (at 25 mg/ml) was crystallized in 30% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in mother liquor supplemented with 20-25% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data for all crystals except the SpX-1 type II blood group H-trisaccharide complex were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS 4++ area detector coupled to a MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700 cryocooler. Diffraction data for the SpX-1 type II blood group H-trisaccharide complex was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven, Long Island, NY) on beam line X8-C. All data were processed using Crystal Clear/d*trek (14Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar).

Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar)) as a search model, the program molrep (15Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) was able to find two molecular replacement solutions corresponding to the two SpX-1 molecules in the asymmetric unit. One molecule was corrected by successive rounds of building using COOT (16Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23864) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13945) Google Scholar). This corrected model was used to replace the second molecule in the asymmetric unit followed by additional rounds of building and refinement. This model was used directly as a starting point in the building and refinement of SpX-1 in complex with carbohydrate ligands. The coordinates of SpX-1 were used to solve the structure of SpX-3 by molecular replacement. The single molecule of SpX-3 in the asymmetric unit was corrected and refined as above. Water molecules were added using the REF-MAC implementation of ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar) and inspected visually before deposition. In all data sets the same five percent of the observations were flagged as “free” (19Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar) and used to monitor refinement procedures. All final model statistics are given in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB codes of 2j1r (SpX-1 uncomplexed), 2j1s (SpX-1 in complex with fucose), 2j1v (SpX-1 in complex with the H-trisaccharide), 2j1u (SpX-1 in complex with the blood group A-tetrasaccharide), 2j1t (SpX-1 in complex with the Lewisy antigen), and 2j22 (SpX-3). Structure images were prepared with PyMOL). Carbohydrate Binding Specificity—SpX-1.2.3 bound tightly to resin immobilized l-fucose in a column chromatography format and did not appear to desorb except when a high concentration of soluble l-fucose was used to wash the column (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the single module construct, SpX-1, did not appear to interact with the column at all while the double module construct, SpX-1.2, was somewhat retained but did elute with the buffer wash (Fig. 2A). Thus, the SpX modules do appear to have an affinity for fucose, but the affinity of an individual module is low. Indeed, binding to fucose could be detected by UV difference titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry, but the affinity was too low to quantify (not shown). The natural linking of the three modules appears to confer a high apparent affinity for immobilized fucose. This is consistent with the avidity affects observed with many glycoside hydrolase derived tandem CBMs (20Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) and multimeric lectins (21Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The soluble sugar binding specificity of SpX-1.2.3 was investigated by competitive elution of SpX-1.2.3 from immobilized fucose (Fig. 2B). This revealed binding to l-fucose, the blood group H-disaccharide, blood group A and B trisaccharides, better binding to the type II blood group H-trisaccharide and 2′-fucosyllactose (α-l-fucosyl-(1,2)-β-d-galactosyl-(1,4)-β-d-glucose), and optimal binding to the Lewisy antigen. No competition was observed with other monosaccharides (not shown), LacNAc (β-d-galactosyl-(1,4)-β-d-N-acetylglucosamine), or the Lewisx and Lewisa trisaccharides (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the specificity determined for the entire SpGH98 protein determined by glycan microarray screening, the results of which are publicly available through the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. The binding affinity for the Lewisy antigen was further explored by ITC. To obtain sufficient quantities of protein for ITC and minimize the complexities of using a protein with multiple binding sites, we did not use SpX-1.2.3 but instead chose to use SpX-1. This analysis revealed a relatively small association constant (Ka)of ∼1 × 103 m-1. Because of the low affinity, the stoichiometry of binding could not be accurately deconvoluted by the fitting process. On the basis of the SpX-1 structure, which revealed a single binding site (see below), fixing the stoichiometry at one for the data-fitting was deemed valid (22Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). This analysis yielded a Ka of 1.46 (±0.02) × 103 m-1, a ΔG of -4.32 (±0.02) kcal/mol, a ΔH of -8.56 (±0.40) kcal/mol, and a ΔS of -14.25 (±1.41) cal/mole/K (see supplemental Fig. 1). This signature of an enthalpically driven binding process with partially offsetting unfavorable entropy is common to many protein-carbohydrate interactions, particularly lectins (23Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and carbohydrate binding modules (20Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The S. pneumoniae Fucose Binding Modules Recognize Lung Tissue—The ability of the SpX-1.2.3 triplet to specifically recognize lung tissue was investigated by fluorescence microscopy of mouse lung sections probed with FITC labeled SpX-1.2.3 (SpX-FITC). In these preparations SpX-FITC localized to a subpopulation of cells in the lung. Pneumocytes bound the probe most intensely, and there was binding to the epithelial lining of the bronchi (Fig. 3). The binding of SpX-FITC to pneumocytes localized to vesicles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, inset). Some of the cells binding SpX-FITC in alveoli are type II pneumocytes, identified by co-localization of anti-pro surfactant C protein (Fig. 3, B-D). Preabsorption of SpX-FITC with 1 m fucose substantially reduced binding to tissues consistent with fucose-dependent binding to the lung tissue (Fig. 3, E and F). Fluorescently labeled Ulex europaeus lectin (UEA1), which has a preference for the type II blood group H-trisaccharide and the Lewisy antigen (24Baldus S.E. Thiele J. Park Y.O. Hanisch F.G. Bara J. Fischer R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), had a qualitatively similar pattern of binding to tissue as that of SpX-FITC consistent with their shared carbohydrate binding specificity (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these results clearly reveal a specific interaction of the SpX modules with mouse lung tissue and a fairly widely distributed target ligand. Fold of the SpX Modules—SpX-1 adopts an eight-stranded β-sandwich-fold comprising a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet opposing another three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 4). Two short stretches of α-helix separate β-strands 1 and 2, while another short α-helix separates β-strands 3 and 4. A single metal ion, likely calcium, is heptahedrally coordinated by the backbone carbonyls of Arg-37, Asn-42, and Ser-51 and by the side chains of Asp-40, Ser-51, and Glu-144. The position of this atom is conserved with AAA (so-called F-type lectins) as well as a number of CBM families (20Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Perhaps not surprisingly, the closest structural neighbor of SpX-1 is AAA, which when overlapped with SpX-1, gives a root mean square deviation of ∼1.4 Å2 (as measured with PyMol more than ∼110 matched Cα residues). Slightly more distant structural neighbors are the family 6, 32, 35, and 36 CBMs, which belong to a large β-sandwich superfamily of carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. The Molecular Determinants of SpX-1 Sugar Specificity—The electron density maps of the fucose complex unambiguously revealed the position of single β-l-fucose residues bound to each of the SpX-1 monomers in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 5A). Tyr-31 and Phe-47 create a relatively hydrophobic pocket that cradles the C6-methyl group. Tyr-31 “stacks” against the flat, apolar surface created by carbons 3-6 on the A-face of the l-fucose (Fig. 5A). Specificity for the non-reducing end of l-fucose is conferred by three potential hydrogen bonds to the axial O4 of the sugar from the terminal guanido nitrogens of Arg-81 and Arg-88 and the ϵN from the imidazole ring of His-54 (Fig. 6A). The complement of protein-carbohydrate hydrogen bonds is completed by interactions between O3 and the endocyclic oxygen of the fucose and the terminal guanido nitrogens of Arg-88 and Arg-81.FIGURE 6Hydrogen bonding schematics of fucose (A), the type II H-trisaccharide (B), the blood group A-tetrasaccharide analogue (C), and the Lewisy antigen (D) bound to SpX-1. Potential hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines. Waters are shown as gray spheres. Potential hydrogen bond distances were between 2.5 and 3.3 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional potential interactions in the SpX-1 binding site were mapped by cocrystallizing the protein with the type II H-trisaccharide, a blood group A-tetrasaccharide analogue (based on 2′-fucosyllactose), and the Lewisy antigen. In each case the electron density for the sugar was well defined, allowing its unambiguous modeling (Fig. 5, B-D). However, unlike with the fucose complex, only one molecule of SpX-1 in the asymmetric unit had bound oligosaccharide. Crystal packing around the binding site of the second molecule appeared to obscure the binding site and prevent ligand binding. For each of these ligands the interactions between the galactose linked fucose residue and the protein were identical to those observed in the fucose complex (Fig. 6, B-D). Likewise, for the three oligosaccharides the galactose moiety makes minimal interactions with the protein through water-mediated hydrogen bonding networks (Fig. 6, B-D). The O3 of the GlcNAc in the H-trisaccharide antigen makes a potential direct hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-48, whereas additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds are made with the GlcNAc 2′-acetamido group. The Lewisy antigen does not make this direct hydrogen bond due to a slight shift of the GlcNAc in the binding site relative to the GlcNAc in the H-trisaccharide. However, numerous water-mediated hydrogen bonds are made. In both the H-trisaccharide and Lewisy complexes, the surface defined by the C6, C5, O5, and C1 atoms of GlcNAc appears to interact with the edge of the Tyr-31 phenol ring. This GlcNAc is replaced by a glucose residue in the A-tetrasaccharide analogue. The lack of the 2′-acetamido group appears to allow the glucose to shift slightly in the binding site causing the glucose to make no hydrogen bonds with the protein. However, the glucose in the A-tetrasaccharide maintained similar interactions with the edge of the Tyr-31 phenol ring as did the GlcNAc in the H-trisaccharide and the Lewisy antigen. The terminal α-1,3-linked GalNAc residue, which determines the blood group type A, made scarce interactions with the protein (Fig. 6C). Only a single water-mediated hydrogen bond is made between O3 of this sugar and the backbone nitrogen of Glu-85. The apolar B-face of GalNAc, particularly the C2-C4 plane, sits above a platform formed by the side chains of Glu-85 and Ala-84 (not shown). Thus, this assemblage of interactions should not legislate against binding of the blood group B antigen. Consistent with this was the roughly equal abilities of the A- and B-trisaccharides to compete with the binding of SpX-1.2.3 to immobilized fucose (Fig. 2B). The fucose linked to the core GlcNAc of the Lewisy antigen appears to force the GlcNAc residue of this sugar into a slightly different position relative to the same sugar in the H-trisaccharide. As mentioned, this results in the sacrifice of a direct hydrogen bond to this sugar for an extensive network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the Lewisy antigen. However, the additional fucose of the Lewisy antigen adds a direct hydrogen bond and a water-mediated hydrogen bond, the former with Asn-48 and the latter with Asp-83. The primary determinant of binding is clearly a number of specific interactions between the protein and the key H-antigen fucose. Additional binding energy and specificity seems to require principally shape complementarity between the binding site and the saccharide to which the fucose is attached. On the basis of this, there is little to suggest that the SpX-1 module would not also accommodate ligands based on the type I H-trisaccharide core. Modeling of this ligand into the SpX-1 binding site using the type II H-trisaccharide as a guide suggests that the 2′-acetamido group of the type II H-trisaccharide would be positionally replaced by the C6-hydroxylmethly group of the same GlcNAc in the type I H-trisaccharide (not shown). Though it appears that this ligand could be accommodated, it is unclear how the spatial replacement of the 2′-acetamido group with the C6-hydroxymethyl group would impact the binding affinity. Lack of binding to the Lewisx and Lewisa trisaccharides, which adopt a roughly similar conformation to the H-trisaccharide, may be due to steric intramolecular restraints resulting from the differing positions of the chemical substituents of these sugars. This may cause them to adopt subtly different conformations from the H-trisaccharide and, thus, violate the shape complementarity between the sugar and the binding site. Structural Relationships between the SpX Modules—SpX-1 and SpX-3 overlapped each other with a very small root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å2 (as measured with PyMol over ∼121 matched Cα residues) highlighting their structural identity. The binding sites of these modules are extremely similar except the replacement of Asn-48 in SpX-1 with glycine in SpX-3 (Fig. 7A). Examination of the amino acid sequence alignment of the SpX modules shows that the binding site residues of SpX-2 are identical to those of SpX-3 (Fig. 7C). Given the ability of the H-trisaccharide and Lewisy antigen to elute SpX-1.2.3 from immobilized fucose, all of the SpX modules must share the ability to bind these sugars, suggesting the impact of this asparagine to glycine substitution on specificity is low. However, the relative affinities of the SpX modules for these sugars is currently unknown. SpX Modules and the A. anguilla Fucolectin—The constellation of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the polypeptide and fucose is virtually identical for AAA and SpX-1 (Fig. 7, B and C). The differences in the binding sites of these two proteins arise mainly in the loop comprising residues 28-34 of SpX-1. In AAA, the analogous loop comprising residues 21-32 is lengthened by 5 amino acids, resulting in AAA having no structural equivalent of Tyr-31 in SpX-1. The closest replacement is His-27 in AAA, which appears to have some interactions with the C6-methyl group of the fucose (Fig. 7B). However, in AAA His-27 works in combination with Phe-45 and Tyr-46, the latter of which nonconservatively replaces Asn-48 of SpX-1, to completely enclose the C6-methyl group of the fucose. Consequently, although the protein-ligand hydrogen-bonding interactions are identical for the two proteins, the binding site architectures surrounding the C6-methyl group of the bound fucoses are substantially different. This elaborated loop structure in AAA may also contribute to the differing specificities of the proteins; AAA binds comparatively poorly to the Lewisy antigen, whereas this is the apparently preferred ligand for SpX-1. Indeed, the overlap of the SpX-1-Lewisy complex with AAA reveals potential clashes between the GlcNAc-linked fucose and His-27 and Tyr-46 of AAA (Fig. 7B), supporting the importance of this loop structure in defining oligosaccharide specificity in this family of carbohydrate-binding proteins. AAA appears to exploit the avidity effect of multivalent binding to clustered glycotopes by the formation of a non-covalent trimer with all three binding sites oriented in the same direction (6Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar). Triplication of the SpX modules appears to achieve the same effect with respect to binding immobilized fucose. However, the relative orientations of the three SpX modules are unknown, and the residues involved in the AAA trimer packing are not well conserved in the SpX modules (not shown), making it difficult to draw meaningful parallels. Implications—Fucose recognition by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin, PA-IIL, is known to play a role in the virulence of this organism (25Imberty A. Wimmerova M. Mitchell E.P. Gilboa-Garber N. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of virulence are postulated to be through roles in host-recognition, cytotoxicity, and/or biofilm formation; however, all of these rely on the multimeric organization of this protein and its sole ability to bind carbohydrate (25Imberty A. Wimmerova M. Mitchell E.P. Gilboa-Garber N. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This study of S. pneumoniae fucose binding modules suggests a different role for fucose recognition in the virulence of this bacterium. The role of the SpX modules is likely to target SpGH98, a known virulence factor, to host tissues bearing the ABH blood group antigens and, most effectively, the Lewisy antigen. The suggestion then is that the role of SpGH98 in virulence is through its catalytic activity. Anderson et al. (26Anderson K.M. Ashida H. Maskos K. Dell A. Li S.C. Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7720-7728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the Clostridium perfringens GH98 to have endogalactosidase activity on the blood group A and B antigens. This group also tested the activity of SpGH98 on the same substrates but failed to detect any activity; thus, the specificity of SpGH98 is currently unknown. However, given the placement of SpGH98 in a fucose utilization operon but the inability of S. pneumoniae to grow on fucose, the predicted extracellular location of SpGH98, and the ability of the SpGH98 modules to recognize host glycans, it is possible that SpGH98 and the operon are involved in the release of fucosylated host glycans and their recycling by the bacterium into anabolic precursors.

https://openalex.org/W2087315189,"CKIP-1 is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein that induces alterations of the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology when expressed in human osteosarcoma cells. CKIP-1 interacts with the heterodimeric actin-capping protein in cells, so we postulated that this interaction was responsible for the observed cytoskeletal and morphological effects of CKIP-1. To test this postulate, we used peptide “walking arrays” and alignments of CKIP-1 with CARMIL, another CP-binding protein, to identify Arg-155 and Arg-157 of CKIP-1 as residues potentially required for its interactions with CP. CKIP-1 mutants harboring Arg-155 and Arg-157 substitutions exhibited greatly decreased CP binding, while retaining wild-type localization, the ability to interact with protein kinase CK2, and self-association. To examine the phenotype associated with expression of these mutants, we generated tetracycline-inducible human osteosarcoma cells lines expressing R155E,R157E mutants of CKIP-1. Examination of these cell lines reveals that CKIP-1 R155E,R157E did not induce the distinct changes in cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton that are characteristic of wild-type CKIP-1 demonstrating that the interaction between CKIP-1 and CP is required for these cellular effects.

The cDNA for CKIP-1 codes for a protein of ∼46 kDa with an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich region as well as five putative PXXP motifs. The PH domain of CKIP-1 is required for phospholipid binding in vitro and for plasma membrane localization in cells (1Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42114-42127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this domain is necessary for interactions with protein kinase CK2, because mutants lacking the PH domain fail to interact with the kinase. Additionally, we have demonstrated that a subpopulation of protein kinase CK2 is targeted to the plasma membrane by CKIP-1 in cells (2Olsten M.E. Canton D.A. Zhang C. Walton P.A. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42114-42127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This targeting of CK2 is lost when the PH domain of CKIP-1 is replaced by a myristoylation recognition sequence, even though the CKIP-1 mutant still localizes to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that CKIP-1 may function in an analogous manner to protein kinase A anchoring proteins, which target cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (3Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K.

In addition to this potential role as a CK2-targeting protein, CKIP-1 appears to have roles independent of CK2. Recent reports have shown that CKIP-1 functions in muscle cell differentiation (7Safi A. Vandromme M. Caussanel S. Valdacci L. Baas D. Vidal M. Brun G. Schaeffer L. Goillot E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and AP-1 regulation and apoptosis (8Zhang L. Xing G. Tie Y. Tang Y. Tian C. Li L. Sun L. Wei H. Zhu Y. He F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 766-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular functions of CKIP-1, we generated cell lines with tetracycline-regulated expression of FLAG-CKIP-1. Induction of FLAG-CKIP-1 in these cells caused changes in cellular morphology, as well as increases in F-actin and total cellular levels of actin (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanistic basis for these observations, we performed a proteomic screen using Tandem affinity purification (10Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and large-scale immunoprecipitations to identify CKIP-1 interaction partners. We identified the heterodimeric actincapping protein as a novel CKIP-1-interacting protein (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that CKIP-1 can partially inhibit the activity of CP at the barbed ends of actin filaments. Collectively, these observations suggested two hypothetical models. First, it is possible that the interaction of CP with CKIP-1 at the plasma membrane inhibits binding of CP to the barbed ends of the actin filament leading to increased actin polymerization and changes in cellular morphology. Alternatively, the effects of CKIP-1 on cell morphology may require interactions with CP to target CKIP-1 to the barbed ends of actin filaments. To distinguish between these models, we used peptide “walking arrays” and alignments with the CP-binding protein, CARMIL (11Yang C. Pring M. Wear M. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to identify Arg-155 and Arg-157 as residues of CKIP-1 potentially required for its binding with CP. To investigate the importance of these residues for interactions between CKIP-1 and CP, we employed mutants of CKIP-1 harboring substitutions at Arg-155 and Arg-157 as well as a synthetic peptide encompassing the putative CP-binding region of CKIP-1. Finally, to directly test whether changes in cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton induced by CKIP-1 require its interactions with CP, we generated human osteosarcoma cell lines expressing CP-binding deficient mutants of CKIP-1 under the control of tetracycline. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope and polyclonal antibodies directed against actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyclonal antibodies directed against green fluorescent protein (GFP) were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against CPα (mAb 5B12.3) and CPβ (mAb 3F2.3 and mAb 1E5.25.4) subunits of actin-capping protein (12Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences (Iowa City, IA). Polyclonal antibodies against CKIP-1 and GST were described in a previous study (1Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against β-tubulin were a generous gift from Dr. Lina Dagnino (Department of Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario). Plasmid Constructs—FLAG-CKIP-1 was generated by PCR amplification and subcloned into pRc/CMV and pTRE as previously described (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CKIP-1 mutations to disrupt interactions with CP were generated for FLAG-CKIP-1, GFP-CKIP-1, GST-CKIP-1, and/or FLAG-CKIP-1/pTRE using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer. FLAG-CKIP-1 R133,K135E was generated using the forward primer: 5′-CTC AAC TCT GCC ATC ACC GAG GCC GAG AAC CGT ATC TTG GAT GAG-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-CTC ATC CAA GAT ACG GTT CTC GGC CTC GGT GAT GGC AGA GTT GAG-3′. FLAG-CKIP-1 R133A,K135A,R137A was similarly generated using the forward primer: 5′-CTC AAC TCT GCC ATC ACC GCT GCC GCT AAC GCT ATC TTG GAT GAG GTC ACC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-GGT GAC CTC ATC CAA GAT AGC GTT AGC GGC AGC GGT GAT GGC AGA GTT GAG-3′.

Similarly, CKIP-1 R155A,R157A,K159A constructs were generated using the forward primer: 5′-CCC ACT GCA GAC GCA GCA GCA ATC CAG CAC TCC CGC CGC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-GCG GCG GGA GTG CTG GAT TGC TGC TGC GTC TGC AGT GGG-3′ using CKIP-1 R155A,R157A as a template. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitations—For endogenous CKIP-1 immunoprecipitations, U2-OS cells (9 × 15-cm plates) or C2C12 cells (3 × 10-cm plate) were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.l% SDS, 1% aprotinin and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were sonicated on ice with four 4-s bursts and then centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman TL120.2 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were divided into three aliquots, and precleared with pansorbin and protein G beads. Immunoprecipitations were then performed with anti-CKIP-1 or as a control with anti-GST antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. An additional control employed protein A-Sepharose in the absence of antibody. For FLAG and GFP immunoprecipitations, U2-OS cells were lysed on ice in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. The lysates were sonicated and cleared as described above. The cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose or anti-GFP antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. In all cases, the lysates were centrifuged briefly, and the protein A/G-Sepharose beads were washed four times with the appropriate lysis buffer. Following the last wash, bound proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of sample buffer. Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1 h at 15 V, 0.3 A using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Anti-FLAG blots were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-FLAG M2 at 1:2,500 and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Anti-actin blots were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-actin at 1:2,000 and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:20,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Anti-GFP immunoblots were performed by blocking for 1 h in 3% gelatin in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20), followed by incubation with primary antibody at 1:3,000. Immune complexes were detected with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:20,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoblotting with anti-β-tubulin antibodies was performed by blocking for 1 h in 5% skim milk powder in TBST, followed by incubation with primary antibody (1:100). Immune complexes were detected using goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Anti-CPα and -CPβ blots were performed by blocking membranes for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST followed by incubation with primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:1,000, respectively. In both cases, secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5,000. Where indicated, membranes were stripped with 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min. Peptide Array Generation—The SPOT method (14Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 15Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar) was employed in the synthesis of peptide arrays for use in determining the residues of CKIP-1 required for interaction with CP. Peptides were synthesized on Amino-PEG500-UC540 membranes derivatized with a polyethylene glycol spacer (Intavis AG). Stock solutions of amino acid derivatives (Peptides International) were prepared at a concentration of 0.33 m in a solution of 0.5 m 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Immediately prior to each cycle of synthesis, amino acid solutions were activated with the addition of one part diisopropyl-carbodiimide (DIC) solution (1.1 m DIC in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) to three parts of the amino acid stock solution. Each cycle of peptide synthesis consisted of (i) coupled spotting of amino acids on the membrane, (ii) capping of the membrane with a solution of 2% acetic anhydride in DMF (1 × 30 s, 1 × 5 min), (iii) wash with DMF (3 × 2 min), (iv) deprotection with 20% piperidine in DMF (10 min), (v) wash with DMF (4 × 2 min), (vi) wash with ethanol (2 × 2 min), and (vii) drying of membranes in a stream of cold air and preparation for the next cycle of synthesis. After the final cycle in the peptide synthesis, the membrane was thoroughly dried overnight in a fume hood to prepare the peptides for side-chain deprotection. Side-chain deprotection was carried out on the membrane in the following steps: (i) deprotection in 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% triisopropylsilane, 2% water for 2 h, (ii) wash with dichloromethane (4 × 2 min), (iii) wash with DMF (4 × 2 min), (iv) wash with ethanol (2 × 2 min), and (v) dry with a stream of cold air. Purification of Recombinant CP—Recombinant CP was purified using a tandem bacterial expression vector (pET-3d/CP), allowing for co-translation of chicken α1- and β1-subunits or mouse α1- and β2-subunits from a single plasmid (16Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CP was expressed and purified to homogeneity from BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, as described (17Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chicken CP was used for GST pulldown assays and peptide array assays. Mouse CP was used for in vitro actin polymerization assays. Peptide Overlay Assay—Prior to the overlay assay, the membrane was wetted with 95% ethanol and water. The peptide filter was then blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline followed by incubation with CP (1 μm) overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Following washing, the filter was incubated with antibodies against native CP (anti-CPβ 1E5.25.4) at a dilution of 1:200. Bound CP was detected with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (18Pierce M.M. Raman C.S. Nall B.T. Methods. 1999; 19: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric actin-CP was purified as described (17Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Purified CP and CKIP-1 peptide (SYLAHPTRDRAKIQHSRRPPTR) were dialyzed into 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and 5% glycerol. For titration, purified CP and CKIP-1 peptide were diluted to 18 and 180 μm, respectively, using the equilibrating solution obtained after dialysis was complete, and each was degassed prior to titration. CP protein was loaded into the cell (∼1.4 ml), and CKIP-1 peptide was loaded into the syringe. Titration of the CKIP-1 peptide was performed at 25 °C starting with an initial 1-μl injection, followed by 65 5-μl injections, with a spacing of 300 s. The sample cell was stirred at 300 rpm throughout the experiment. The buffer blank performed under the same conditions showed negligible heats of binding (<0.015 μcal/s). The dissociation constant (KD) and stoichiometry of binding (n) were obtained by non-linear least-squares fitting of the CP versus CKIP-1 pep-tide data to a one-site model provided with the data analysis software (Origin). Baseline was subtracted automatically using Origin software. The results of two independent experiments are shown. Spectrin-F-actin-seeded Actin Polymerization Assay—Phalloidin-stabilized F-actin seeds were prepared as described in Harris et al. (19Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Polymerization of 1 μm actin (5% Pyrenelabeled) in F-buffer was measured in the presence of F-actin seeds, 4 nm CP, and different amounts of CKIP-1 protein and CKIP-1 and human CARMIL peptides. Pyrene fluorescence (Ex = 368 nm; Em = 386 nm) was monitored for 500 s at 25 °C. The sequences of the CKIP-1 and CARMIL peptides were SYLAHPTRDRAKIQHSRRPPTR and RRLEHFTKLRPKRNKKQQPTQA, respectively. In Vitro Translation Assays and GST Pull-down Assays—Radiolabeled (35S-lableled) FLAG-CKIP-1 and FLAG-CKIP-1 R155E,R157E were produced by in vitro transcription and translation using a TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with T7 polymerase according to the manufacturer's recommendations. GST fusion proteins encoding CK2α or GST alone were expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathioneagarose as described previously (20Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following in vitro transcription and translation, GST pull-down assays were performed by diluting 5 μl of the TnT reactions with 50 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and adding 11 μl of GST or GST-CK2α beads. Incubation was at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. The beads were collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of sample buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. After drying, the radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated for two independent experiments using ImageQuaNT software. Generation of Cell Lines—UTA6 cells were derived from the human osteosarcoma cell line U2-OS and express the tetracycline-regulated transcriptional activator protein (generous gift from Dr. Christoph Englert, Forschungszentrum, Germany (21Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar)). Generation of a cell line with tetracycline-regulated expression of FLAG-CKIP-1 has been previously described (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing FLAG-CKIP R155E,R157E were generated by transiently transfecting UTA6 cells with mutant FLAG-CKIP-1/pTRE and pTK-Hyg in the presence of tetracycline (1.5 μg/ml). Drug selection with hygromycin (500 μg/ml) and G418 (460 μg/ml) began 4 days after transfection. Once stably transfected colonies were formed, they were picked and transferred to 96-well plates. Individual colonies of FLAG-CKIP-1 R155E,R157E-expressing cells were grown up and screened for highly regulated inducible expression by immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells (∼200,000) grown on sterile coverslips were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then treated with for 5 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 at 1:250 for 1 h at 37 °C. Following washing with PBS, secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC (1:1,000) were added for 1 h in the dark. Coverslips were washed, mounted with Gelvatol (Celvol 205, Celanese Chemicals, Dallas, TX), and examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Phalloidin Staining, Extraction, and Quantitation—For TRITC-phalloidin staining of cells, coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C. Following permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, coverslips were stained with TRITC-phalloidin (1 μg/ml) for 40 min in the dark, washed with PBS, and mounted with Gelvatol. Slides were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted fluorescence microscope and Northern Elite software. F-actin quantitation experiments were performed by the method of Machesky et al. (22Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate plates of cells were washed 2× with PBS and scraped into 400 μl of F-actin stabilizing extraction buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 2 μm TRITC-phalloidin and rocked for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed 2× with 200 μl of 0.1% saponin, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2. The bound phalloidin was extracted in 1 ml of methanol by rocking1hat room temperature, and TRITC levels were determined by reading the emission at 563 nm following excitation at 542 nm. Values were normalized to the overall protein concentration and represent the average of three 10-cm plates ± S.D. from two independent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of Endogenous CP with Endogenous CKIP-1—We have previously shown that elevated expression of CKIP-1 induces alterations in cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton. The discovery of the heterodimeric actin-CP in complexes with Tandem affinity purification-CKIP-1 and FLAG-CKIP-1 suggested that CKIP-1-CP interactions could have a role in the observed morphological and cytoskeletal alterations (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Examination of Fig. 1A illustrates co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous CKIP-1 and endogenous CP in mouse myoblast (C2C12) cells where CKIP-1 has been shown to be induced during differentiation and in human osteosarcoma (U2-OS) cells where CKIP-1 has also been observed. In this respect, although CPβ is detected in anti-CKIP-1 immunoprecipitates from extracts of U2-OS and C2C12 cells, CPβ is not detected following immunoprecipitation with control anti-GST (IgG) antibodies or with protein A beads alone. These observations reinforce the physiological relevance of CP-CKIP-1 interactions. Identification of CP-binding Sites on CKIP-1—We have previously demonstrated using deletion analysis that interaction between CKIP-1 and CP is dependent on amino acids 133-193 of CKIP-1 (9Canton D.A. Olsten M.E. Kim K. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Cooper J.A. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (highlighted in Fig. 1B). To identify residues required for this interaction more precisely, we generated a CKIP-1 peptide filter composed of 16-mers “walking” from the amino to carboxyl termini of this region, with frame shifts of three amino acids between each peptide (Fig. 1C). The resulting filter was incubated with recombinant CP (see inset) followed by detection with antibodies against native CPβ. As shown in Fig. 1C, two peptides exhibited interactions with CP. A multiple sequence alignment of the CP-binding domain of CKIP-1 reveals that both peptides, designated site 1 and site 2, appear to be very well conserved between species (Fig. 1D). Recently, a study by Yang et al. (11Yang C. Pring M. Wear M. Huang M. Cooper J.A. Svitkina T.M. Zigmond S.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the interaction of CARMIL with CP requires two conserved basic residues, Lys-991 and Arg-993. It was therefore intriguing that both site 1 and site 2 (Fig. 1D) contain basic-X-basic motifs. Consequently, we performed an alignment of CARMIL (residues 969-1008) with the region of CKIP-1 encompassing sites 1 and 2. As illustrated in Fig. 1E, the sequence encompassing site 2 could be aligned with the CARMIL sequence suggesting that the residues necessary for interactions between CARMIL and CP might be present in CKIP-1. Moreover, the equivalent residues in CKIP-1 (Arg-155 and Arg-157) are highly conserved between species (Fig. 1D). Disruption of Interactions between CKIP-1 and CP—Based on the data in Fig. 1, we performed mutagenesis to determine if disruption of one or both of the CP-binding sites on CKIP-1 could result in loss of CKIP-1-CP interactions. To disrupt site 2, which could be aligned with the CP-binding region of CARMIL, we generated constructs in which residues Arg-155 and Arg-157 were mutated to alanine or glutamic acid. Similarly, we mutated Lys-159, because this residue was also conserved between CKIP-1 and CARMIL. The resulting constructs were designated CKIP-1 R155A,R157A, R155E,R157E, and R155A,R157A, K159A. Because site 1 contained similar positively charged residues, we also generated CKIP-1 R133,K135E and R133A,K135A,R137A mutants. These constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 2A. To distinguish between these two binding sites, we tested if mutations within these regions affected interactions with CP by immunoprecipitation assays. U2-OS cells were transfected with FLAG-CKIP-1 constructs as indicated, and the derived lysates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies to demonstrate equal loading (Fig. 2B, left panel). Immunoprecipitations were performed on these lysates using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-CPβ antibodies (Fig. 2B, right panel). As shown, mutation of R155E,R157E in putative site 2 resulted in greatly diminished binding to CP as did R155A,R157A or R155A,R157A,K156A (data not shown). By comparison, CKIP-1 harboring R133A,K135A,R137A substitutions (Fig. 2B) or R133,K135E substitutions (data not shown) in site 1 had no effect on binding to CP. These results indicate that disruption of Arg-155 and Arg-157 within site 2 on CKIP-1 is sufficient to prevent interaction with CP, whereas similar substitutions within site 1 do not affect CKIP-1-CP interactions. To further characterize CKIP-1 with substitutions within site 2, we next examined the effects of various mutations on binding to CP using immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Fig. 3). For immunoprecipitations, U2-OS cells were transfected with FLAG-CKIP-1 constructs, and the lysates derived from these cells were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies to demonstrate equal loading (Fig. 3A, left panel). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-CPβ antibodies (Fig. 3A, right panel). Compared with wild-type CKIP-1, all three mutants exhibit greatly reduced binding to CP. Similar experiments were performed with GFP-tagged con"
https://openalex.org/W2008761606,"The chemotaxis of differentiated HL60 cells stably expressing CXCR2 was examined in a microfluidic gradient device where the steepness of the CXCL8 chemokine gradient was varied from 2 pg/ml/μm (0-1 ng/ml over a width of 500 μm) to 50 pg/ml/μm (0-25 ng/ml over 500 μm). The differentiated HL60 cells stably expressing CXCR2 exhibited little chemotaxis in response to a 0-1 ng/ml gradient, but displayed an increasing chemotactic response as the gradient steepness increased from 0 to 5, 0 to 10, and 0 to 25 ng/ml, demonstrating that steepness of gradient is a major determinant of the relative ability of cells to persistently migrate up a chemotactic gradient. When HL60 cells expressed CXCR2 mutated in the C terminus LLKIL motif (IL to AA), ligand-induced internalization of receptors was reduced 50%, whereas cell migration along the gradient of CXCL8 was completely lost. Although both mutant and wild-type receptors could mediate Akt and Erk activation in response to CXCL8, the level of activation of these two kinases was much lower in the cell line expressing the mutant receptors. These data imply that the IL amino acid residues in the LLKIL motif are very important for activation of the signal transduction cascade, which is necessary for cells to sense the chemokine gradient and respond with chemotaxis. Moreover, because mutation of the IL residues in the LLKIL motif resulted in only 50% reduction in receptor internalization, and a 50% reduction in Akt and Erk phosphorylation, but a complete loss of chemotactic response, the data imply that IL amino acid residues in the LLKIL motif are key either for amplification or oscillation of crucial signaling events or for establishment of a threshold for signals required for chemotaxis. The chemotaxis of differentiated HL60 cells stably expressing CXCR2 was examined in a microfluidic gradient device where the steepness of the CXCL8 chemokine gradient was varied from 2 pg/ml/μm (0-1 ng/ml over a width of 500 μm) to 50 pg/ml/μm (0-25 ng/ml over 500 μm).

Chemotaxis is a process by which cells move directionally up a gradient of chemokine or chemoattractant. Chemotaxis plays an important role in the immune response through recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammatory sites (1Harris H. Physiol.

We previously reported that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor mutated in the LLKIL motif, which binds adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) 3The abbreviations used are: AP-2, adaptor protein 2; CXCR2, CXC chemokine receptor 2; CXCL8, CXC ligand 8 or interleukin 8; HL60, human leukemia; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; LLKIL, binding domain on CXCR2 for AP-2 and HIP; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; HIP, heat shock 70 interacting protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PE, phycoerythrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mHBSS, modified Hanks' balanced salt solution; WT, wild type; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. and heat shock 70 interacting protein (HIP), displayed compromised ligand-triggered receptor internalization and mediated impaired chemotaxis in HEK293 cells (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Sai J. Fan G.H. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5489-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, Richardson et al. (12Richardson R.M. Marjoram R.J. Barak L.S. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, a C-terminal-truncated CXCR2 did not undergo ligand-triggered internalization but still mediated robust chemotaxis in response to one of its ligands, CXCL8. However, this same C-terminal-truncated receptor underwent internalization equivalent to the wild-type CXCR2 in HEK293 cells (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of the same receptor displaying different behavior in different cell lines could be due to different cellular levels of the components used for receptor internalization. For example, it has been reported that the levels of the β-arrestin adaptor proteins are high in leukocytes but very low in HEK293 cells (20Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). AP-2 and β-arrestin are two adaptor proteins that play very important roles in G-protein-coupled receptor internalization. AP-2 is a complex that can bind to the leucine-rich motif of the receptor through its μ-subunit, and its β-subunit binds to clathrin to form clathrin-coated vesicles. Additionally, AP-2 can be recruited to the receptor as a result of recruitment of AP-2 to β-arrestin, which binds the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of CXCR2. Because of the cell type differences in expression of receptor regulatory proteins, it is helpful to study CXCR2 internalization in relation to chemotaxis in cells such as neutrophils that naturally express the receptor. However, due to the difficulties of maintaining native neutrophils and the technical challenge of transfecting or transducing expression vectors for mutant receptors into neutrophils, we chose to study HL60 cells. HL60 cells are human promyelocytic leukemia cells (21Collins S.J. Gallo R.C. Gallagher R.E. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) that have been extensively studied because they can be manipulated to differentiate into monocytes or neutrophils (22Collins S.J.

In this report two HL60 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type CXCR2 or the LLKIL motif mutant form of CXCR2 (IL/AA) were constructed from the parental HL60 cell line that naturally expresses very low levels of CXCR2, even after Me2SO-induced differentiation along the granulocytic linage. Chemotaxis assays were performed using a microfabricated device, the microfluidic gradient device. The microfluidic gradient device has several advantages over traditional methods of generating a chemokine gradient (26Li Jeon N. Baskaran H. Dertinger S.K. Whitesides G.M. Van de Water L. Toner M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). With this device, stable chemokine gradients can be delivered and manipulated in a variety of ways, thereby providing a very powerful tool to study different aspects of chemotaxis, such as the effects of the chemokine concentration on chemotaxis (27Lin F. Nguyen C.M. Wang S.J. Saadi W. Gross S.P. Jeon N.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells can be visualized microscopically during the migration process. In this report, the response of these stable HL60 cell lines to a CXCL8 gradient delivered in the microfluidic gradient device was tested to determine the role of the IL residues of the LLKIL motif and ligand-triggered receptor internalization in mediating intracellular signaling and chemotaxis. Cell Lines and Reagents—The HL60 cell line was kindly provided by Henry Bourne, University of California at San Francisco. The retroviral vector, pMSCV, was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). RPMI1640 was purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies used in FACS and Western blot were purchased from following companies: phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CXCR2 antibody (PE-CXCR2, CDw128b), BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); rabbit polyclonal antibody to CXCR2 previously developed and characterized in our laboratory (28Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Erk (Lys-23), Akt1/2 (His-136), and mouse monoclonal antibody to CXCR2 (E2) and phosphorylated Erk (E4), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal rabbit antibody to phosphorylated Akt (Thr-308), Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies to mouse or rabbit, Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); IR-conjugated secondary antibodies, IRdye 800, Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA); and Alexa 680, Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and x-ray films were from Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY). CXCL8 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Radiolabeled CXCL8 (125I, 2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science. Human fibronectin was purchased from BD Biosciences, and proteinase inhibitor cocktails were from Sigma-Aldrich. HL60 Cell Culture and Differentiation—HL60 cells were induced to differentiate along the neutrophilic lineage as previously described (29Servant G. Weiner O.D. Neptune E.R. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), l-glutamine, 100 units/ml PennStrep (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells were subcultured every 3-4 days to a cell density of 106 cells/ml. To differentiate HL60 cells along the granulocytic lineage, cells were inoculated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in antibiotic-free medium containing 1.3% Me2SO (endotoxin-free, Sigma) and cultured for 6-7 days. Transduction of HL60 Cells with a Retroviral Construct—The human CXCR2 DNA sequence was amplified by PCR with the following pair of primers: 5′ primer, 5′-GCGAATTCATGGAAGATTTTAACATGG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TACTCGAGTTAGAGAGTAGTGGAAGTG-3′. IL/AA mutant CXCR2 was amplified from a mutated CXCR2 template that was previously generated by point mutation of IL to AA in the LLKIL motif (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the retroviral vector pMSCV. The retroviral construct containing CXCR2 was cotransfected with the DNA construct expressing the viral envelop protein into a packaging cell line, GP2-293 (BD Biosciences-Clontech). The retroviral particles were collected from the cultured medium of packaging cells and used to infect HL60 cells. The cell lines stably expressing CXCR2 were selected for resistance to neomycin by inclusion of 1 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc.) in the culture medium. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Differentiated HL60 cells (5 × 105 cells) were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of BSA/PBS. PE-conjugated anti-CXCR2 antibody (1:50 dilution, 0.2 mg/ml) was added, and cells were allowed to sit on ice for 1 h. Cells were subsequently washed three times with ice-cold 0.1% BSA/PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1% BSA/PBS for flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). For the receptor internalization assay, cells were pre-treated with ligand, CXCL8 (100 ng/ml), for different time periods before staining with PE-conjugated anti-CXCR2 antibody. For cell sorting, cells were treated the same as for FACS, except that 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS was used instead of 0.1% BSA/PBS to enhance cell survival. Radioligand Binding Assay—Differentiated HL60 cells (5 × 105 cells) were washed with binding buffer (1% BSA in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium) and resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 0.1 nm 125I-CXCL8 and different concentrations of unlabeled CXCL8 (from 0 to 100 nm). After sitting on ice for 4 h, cells were washed with binding buffer three times and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 N NaOH). Radioactivity in the cell lysate was determined by a γ-counter (Cobra II, Global Medical Instrumentation, Inc., Ramsey, MN). For the receptor internalization assay, 5 × 105 cells were washed with binding buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing total 25 ng/ml CXCL8 (1.2 ng/ml 125ICXCL8 and 23.8 ng/ml unlabeled CXCL8). After a 3-h incubation on ice with ligand, 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer was added to the incubation tubes to terminate ligand binding, and the cells were washed twice with fresh binding buffer. The receptor internalization was initiated by incubating the cells at 37 °C for different periods of time. The non-internalized ligand bound to cells was removed from cell membrane by 1 ml of acid wash (0.2 m acidic acid and 0.5 m NaCl) and followed by a wash with binding buffer. The cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer, and the radioactivity was determined on a γ-counter. The data were analyzed by the computer software Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Immunostaining—Differentiated HL60 cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin (100 μg/ml) pre-coated coverslips for 10 min at 37° C. After being stimulated with CXCL8 (25 ng/ml) for different periods of time at 37° C, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against human CXCR2 was applied to the cells for 30 min, washed with PBS, and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG was applied. Confocal microscopy was carried out with an LSM510 Zeiss inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimage, Germany). Chemotaxis Assay in Microfluidic Gradient Device—Microfluidic gradient devices were made at the Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education as described previously (30Walker G.M. Sai J. Richmond A. Stremler M. Chung C.Y. Wikswo J.P. Lab. Chip. 2005; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Devices were pre-coated with fibronectin (100 μg/ml) in modified Hanks' buffer (mHBSS) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mg/ml glucose) (29Servant G. Weiner O.D. Neptune E.R. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature and washed briefly with mHBSS before use. Differentiated HL60 cells were washed and resuspended in mHBSS at 3 × 106 cells/ml, and injected into the pre-coated device. Cells were seeded in the device for 5 min at 37° C and 5% CO2 and placed in a prewarmed temperature-controlled chamber of the inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss Microimage). The two input tubes of the device were connected to syringes filled with CXCL8 in mHBSS containing 1% human serum albumin and buffer alone without CXCL8, respectively. The injection of the solutions from syringes into the device was driven by a syringe pump (Harvard PHD2000, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), first at 50 μl/min to quickly fill the tubing and at 1 μl/min to maintain a CXCL8 gradient in the main channel of the device. The live cell microscopic images were taken every 20 s for a period of 30 min by a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) controlled by the computer software Openlab (Improvision, Lexington, MA). The data were analyzed by using the Openlab and Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) to trace the cell movements. Chemotaxis Assay in a Modified Boyden Chamber—A Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was assembled as the manufacturer suggested, and a 5-μm pore filter was used for differentiated HL60 cells. 100,000 cells were loaded into each well in the top chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate through the filter into the bottom chamber containing varying concentrations of CXCL8 for 3 h at 37°C and5%CO2. Cells that migrated into the bottom chamber were collected by centrifugation and counted with hemocytometer. Cell Adhesion Assay—A 96-well plate was precoated with mHBSS buffer, 1% BSA in mHBSS buffer or 100 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h at room temperature, and washed with mHBSS buffer before loading the cells. Differentiated HL60 cells were washed and resuspended in mHBSS buffer at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. A 100-μl aliquot of these cells was loaded for each well pre-coated as above. Cells were allowed to adhere for 20 min at 37° C and 5% CO2, and 200 μl of paraformaldehyde (3.8%) was added directly to the cells in each well to fix adhered cells followed by mHBSS wash to remove non-adhered cells. The numbers of cells in each well were counted under the microscope (10× objective, Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss Microimage) for ten randomly selected fields. Western Blot—Differentiated HL60 cells were washed, resuspended in mHBSS, and treated with 100 ng/ml CXCL8 or buffer alone. After CXCL8 stimulation for different periods of time, cells were lysed with an equal volume of 2× RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture). The lysate was sonicated for 10 s at output 20 (Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. 20-μg aliquots of protein were loaded to each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE, and samples were electrophoresed at 100 V for 2 h. Resolved proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat Carnation skim milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then immunoblotted with primary and secondary antibodies. For horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, substrates from ECL or ECL advance were applied on the membrane for 1 or 5 min, respectively, and exposed to x-ray film. In some cases, infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the membrane was scanned in Odyssey scanner (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Quantitation of signal intensities was performed in an Odyssey scanner. For each set of samples in a time course, the signal intensity from the untreated control (time 0) were set to be 1, and all the other samples in the time course were normalized to the value of each control. GTPase Activity Assay—Crude cell membrane preparations were obtained from differentiated HL60 cells by swelling in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice, followed by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min, and the plasma membranes were precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm (SW50.1 rotor, 150,000 × g) for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer at a protein concentration of 1 μg/μl. GTPase activity assays were carried out according to the protocol described previously by Richardson et al. (31Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of membrane proteins (20 μl) was mixed with 25 μl of GTPase activity assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1% BSA, 0.4 mg/ml creatine kinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 nm [γ-32P]GTP) and 5 μl of CXCL8 (20 ng/μl). Reaction tubes were incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time, and the reaction was terminated by adding 750 μl of ice-cold 5% charcoal solution in PBS. After 15 min on ice, the charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 min. 400 μl of supernatant was removed, mixed with 2 ml of scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity incorporation was determined by scintillation counting (LS6500, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Characterization of CXCR2-expressing HL60 Cells—Differentiated HL60 cells induced to differentiate with Me2SO normally gain neutrophil-like characteristics after 6-7 days of treatment. The cells change their morphology from round to somewhat stellate, become easily adherent to the fibronectin or collagen matrix, and develop the capability to chemotax toward the chemoattractant fMLP, indicating the expression of the receptor for this chemoattractant. The endogenous expression of CXCR2 in differentiated HL60 cells studied here was tested by flow cytometry and by ligand binding assay with radiolabeled CXCL8 (125I-CXCL8), and the results revealed little, if any, expression of CXCR1 or CXCR2 on these cells (Fig. 1A). There was no chemotactic response to CXCL8 as tested in a microfluidic chamber, although the cells did exhibit chemotaxis in response to fMLP (supplemental videos S1 and S2). Because the expression of CXCR2 after Me2SO-induced differentiation of HL60 cells revealed virtually no CXCR1 or CXCR2 expression, we transduced these cells with a retroviral expression vector for the wild-type (WT) or the IL/AA mutant CXCR2 to study the function of this receptor in neutrophil-like cells. Stable HL60 cell lines expressing either WT or the IL/AA mutant CXCR2 were constructed by retroviral delivery and selection under G418 (1 mg/ml). The expression of CXCR2 was confirmed by FACS with PE-conjugated anti-CXCR2 antibody, and CXCR2-expressing cells were sorted to obtain a population of cells with a similar expression level of CXCR2 in the two cell lines (Fig. 1A). The ligand binding affinities (Kd) for WT and IL/AA mutant receptor in stable HL60 cell lines were calculated to be 1.61 ± 0.29 nm and 1.51 ± 0.63 nm, respectively, indicating that the mutation of the receptor did not change the ligand affinity (Fig. 1B). The Kd value for CXCR2 in differentiated HL60 cells was very close to that in human neutrophils (∼1 nm). Differentiated HL60 Cells Expressing IL/AA Mutant CXCR2 Exhibit Compromised Receptor Internalization but Normal Adhesivity to Fibronectin—We previously reported that the LLKIL motif of CXCR2 is required for optimal ligand-triggered receptor internalization in HEK293 cells (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This motif binds to AP-2 as well as heat shock-70 interacting protein (HIP). The confocal images of immunostaining on the differentiated HL60 cells expressing either WT CXCR2 or IL/AA mutant CXCR2 revealed that, in WT CXCR2-expressing cells, the internalization of receptor could be detected as early as 1-2 min upon 25 ng/ml CXCL8 stimulation and reached a maximum at 30 min after ligand stimulation when tested over a 90-min incubation period. However, in cells expressing the IL/AA mutant of CXCR2, the internalization of receptor was much delayed and never reached the same level of internalization as in cells expressing WT CXCR2 (Fig. 2A). Receptor internalization was also tested by a ligand binding assay containing radiolabeled ligand (125I-CXCL8) to allow more accurate quantitation. In cells expressing WT CXCR2, the ligand-triggered receptor internalization occurred quickly, reaching 70% in 10 min and almost 90% in 30 min at 37° C. In contrast, for the HL60 cells expressing the IL/AA mutant receptor, receptor internalization was greatly inhibited. Only ∼35% of the receptor was internalized after 10-min incubation, and 45% internalized after 30-min incubation at 37° C (Fig. 2B). The analysis of variance indicated that the time course for receptor internalization was significantly different (p = 0.005) between the two cell lines. Chemotaxis of Differentiated HL60 Cells Stably Expressing CXCR2 under Different Gradient Steepness—As little as 1% difference in the chemokine concentration across a cell is believed to be sufficient to induce neutrophil chemotaxis (32Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We used a microfluidic gradient device to test the hypothesis that chemotactic response is directly proportional to the steepness of the chemokine gradient. With this device, well controlled chemokine gradients with varying steepness can be delivered into the chamber where cells are located with a constant flow driven by a syringe pump. Here, chemotaxis assays were performed in the microfluidic gradient devices using differentiated HL60 cells stably expressing WT CXCR2. The movements of the cells in the microfluidic gradient device are driven by two forces, shear force from flow and chemotactic force from the chemokine gradient. The trajectories of cell movements are dependent on the balance of these two forces on the cells. We have previously tested the affect of shear force on cell movement with different flow rates and discussed the possibility of estimating the chemotactic force generated by external chemokine gradients by observing the trajectory of cell movements when detou"
https://openalex.org/W2078608120,"Recently we reported that transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) independently of I-κB kinase (IKK) activation, by inducing cross-linking and protein polymer formation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-κBα (I-κBα). TGase 2 catalyzes covalent isopeptide bond formation between the peptide bound-glutamine and the lysine residues. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra analysis of I-κBα polymers cross-linked by TGase 2, as well as synthetic peptides in an in vitro competition assay, we identified a glutamine cluster at the C terminus of I-κBα (amino acids 266–268) that appeared to play a key role in the formation of I-κBα polymers. Although there appeared to be no requirement for specific lysine residues, we found a considerably higher preference for the use of lysine residues at positions 21, 22, and 177 in TGase 2-mediated cross-linking of I-κBα. We demonstrated that synthetic peptides encompassing the glutamine cluster at amino acid positions 266–268 reversed I-κBα polymerization in vitro. Furthermore, the depletion of free I-κBα in EcR/TG cells was completely rescued in vivo by transfection of mutant I-κBαs in glutamine sites (Q266G, Q267G, and Q313G) as well as in a lysine site (K177G). These findings provide additional clues into the mechanism by which TGase 2 contributes to the inflammatory process via activation of NF-κB.

Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). Under normal cellular conditions, NF-κB is retained in an inactive state in the cytosol through its association with I-κBα (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Exposure to certain stresses, such as lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), activates signaling pathways that ultimately result in ubiquitination of I-κBα, through a mechanism that involves IKK-dependent phosphorylation of I-κBα (3Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar). Proteosome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated I-κBα releases NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus and becomes active (4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The development of therapeutics that block the degradation of I-κBα represents a promising approach to treating many of the diseases in which NF-κB plays a role (5Umezawa K. Chaicharoenpong C. Mol. Cells. 2002; 14: 163-167PubMed Google Scholar). For example, IKK-dependent stress signaling has been shown to deplete I-κBα through phosphorylation of serine 32 and serine 36 (6Brockman J.A.

Recently, we identified an IKK-independent mechanism of NF-κB activation through TGase 2-mediated cross-linking of I-κBα (10Kim S.Y. Front.

TGase 2 (EC 2.3.2.13) is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a strong covalent bond between peptide-bound glutamine and lysine residues, resulting in protein cross-linking and the formation of protein polymers (12Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). TGase 2-mediated polymerization of I-κBα depletes free I-κBα from the cytosol, resulting in the activation of NF-κB (11Lee J. Kim Y.S. Choi D.H. Bang M.S. Han T.R. Joh T.H. Kim S.Y. J. Biol.

These results suggest a model in which peptide inhibitors of TGase 2 mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of free I-κBα depletion. In the current study, we examined whether TGase 2 targeted specific glutamine and lysine residues of I-κBα.I-κBα contains many glutamine residues throughout its secondary structure, whereas lysine residues cluster in the N-terminal domain of the protein. To identify residues of I-κBα that were involved in the formation of glutamyllysine cross-links, I-κBα polymers cross-linked in vitro by TGase 2 were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Candidate residues were identified using proteolytic digestion of full-length I-κBα polymers, and their identity was confirmed using synthetic peptides containing candidate glutamine and lysine residues. The results of an in vitro competition assay using full-length I-κBα and synthetic peptides carrying putative cross-linking sites and in vivo rescues of I-κBα using mutant I-κBα carrying each mutated putative cross-linking site confirmed that the residues we identified by MALDI-TOF contributed to TGase 2-mediated I-κBα polymerization. I-κBα Polymerization by TGase 2—To obtain purified I-κBα, DNA sequences encoding full-length human I-κBα were subcloned into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen) using PCR and the full-length I-κBα cDNA as a template (pCMV-IκBα, BD Biosciences). Protein was expressed and purified using a HiTrap IMAC FF column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the in vitro polymerization reactions, 10μg of purified I-κBα was incubated with 1 milliunit of TGase 2 (guinea pig liver, Sigma) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm CaCl2. Polymerization was analyzed by 4–12% NuPAGE gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen). High molecular weight I-κBα polymers were separated for further analysis using a centrifugal filter device (Centricon, molecular size cut-off 100 kDa, Millipore). Proteolysis of I-κBα Polymers—Filter-purified I-κBα polymer (10 μg) was denatured in 4m urea containing 10 mm dithiothreitol at 55 °C, and then the concentration of urea was diluted to 1m using 100 mm NH4 HCO3. The polymer was digested to completion with trypsin (Promega) or endoproteinase Glu-C (V8, Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) overnight at 37 °C. MALDI-TOF MS Analyses—Peptide masses were determined using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) with a matrix of 5 mg/mlα-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). Samples were desalted using Zip-Tips C18 (Millipore), eluted in matrix solution directly onto the target, and air-dried. Analyses was performed in positive ion reflectron mode, and spectra were calibrated at 50 ppm tolerance using the [M+H] ion from 4700 Cal Mix (Applied Biosystems): des-Arg1-bradykinin (Mr 904.4681), angiotensin 1 (Mr 1296.6853), Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (Mr 1570.6774), ACTH 1–17 clip (Mr 2093.0867), ACTH 18–39 clip (Mr 2465.1989), and ACTH 7–38 clip (Mr 3657.9294). For data processing, Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) was used. After removing peptide masses corresponding to keratins and proteases (trypsin or V8), measured masses were matched with the peptide masses from an ideal digest at 100 ppm tolerance using Paws (Genomic Solutions). Identification of Cross-linking Sites Using Synthetic Peptides—Synthetic peptides were obtained by solid-phase synthesis and purified to >95% purity by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Peptron Co., Daejeon, Korea). Peptides (Table 1) were dissolved in double distilled water. For the in vitro cross-linking reaction, each peptide containing candidate glutamine residues (PQ-1, PQ-2, PQ-3, or PQ-4, 5 pmol) and a mixture of PK-1, PK-2 and PK-3, which contained candidate lysine residues, were incubated with TGase 2 (guinea pig liver, Sigma). To determine which glutamine residues served as acyl donors, the derivatives of PQ-4 (PQ-5–PQ-9) were tested for cross-linking with PK-3. The cross-linked dipeptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The reaction mixture was desalted using Zip-Tips C18 and eluted in matrix solution containing internal standards (4700 Cal Mix). The quantities of the dipeptides were calculated relative to the peak area of ACTH (1–17 clip).TABLE 1Synthesized peptides used in this studyPeptide nameAmino acid sequenceMr (Mo)aMo, monoisotopic mass.PK-117RDGLKKERLL261226.7459PK-283IHEEKALTM911070.5430PK-3173HSILKATNY1811045.5556PK-4175ILKAT179544.3584PQ-1161GVLTQSCTT169908.4273PQ-2275ENLQMLP281843.4160PQ-3299VFGGQRLTL317989.5658PQ-4263TRIQQQLGQLTL2741397.7990PQ-5264RIQQQLG270841.4770PQ-6RIQEELG843.4450PQ-7RIEQELG843.4450PQ-8RIEEQLG843.4450PQ-9269LGQLT273530.3064a Mo, monoisotopic mass. Open table in a new tab Competition Assay for I-κBα Polymerization Using Synthetic Peptides in Vitro—I-κBα (2 μg) was incubated with 0.5 milliunit of TGase 2 in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm CaCl2 with or without each of the indicated peptides (2 nmol). After 10 min at 37 °C, the reactants were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. The relative intensities of the bands corresponding to intact I-κBα were calculated by densitometry. Competition Assay for I-κBα Polymerization by Transfection of I-κBα Mutants in Vivo—To identify critical residues of I-κBα in cross-linking, point mutated full-length cDNAs of I-κBα (K177G, Q255G, Q266G, Q267G, Q313G) were constructed by the recombinant PCR method using cDNA of full-length I-κBα (pCMV-I-κBα; BD Biosciences). The PCR products of the mutants were designed to be inserted into pcDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen) at HindIII and XbaI sites. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing after cloning. The wild type or mutated I-κBα DNAs (1 μg) were transfected to EcR293/TG cell lines (11Lee J. Kim Y.S. Choi D.H. Bang M.S. Han T.R. Joh T.H. Kim S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53725-53735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) as per the manufacturer's instruction using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in a 6-well tissue culture dish. After a 24-h incubation, TGase 2 was induced by treatment with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. The cytosolic fraction of cells was prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Sigma). The level of I-κBα in the cytosolic fraction was examined by Western blot. It was previously reported that overexpression of TGase 2 in cells causes a reduction in free I-κBα and the concomitant appearance of a discrete pattern of high molecular weight species of I-κBα (11Lee J. Kim Y.S. Choi D.H. Bang M.S. Han T.R. Joh T.H. Kim S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53725-53735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When I-κBα and TGase 2 were incubated in vitro, we observed the formation of high molecular weight polymers of I-κBα (Fig. 1A). The size of the polymer complex was such that it was unable to migrate into the 4% polyacrylamide gel and remained trapped in the loading well at the top of the gel. However, we were able to purify the polymer complex by centrifugation on a filtering device.FIGURE 1MS analyses of peptides released from proteolytic digestion of I-κBα polymers.

Peaks corresponding to contaminants (keratins and autodigestion) were identified by comparison with a negative control that did not contain I-κBα polymers. I-κBα-specific peaks were then matched to theoretical peptides derived from digestion of intact I-κBα (Fig. 1, B and C). Approximately 88.3% of the full-length I-κBα sequence was represented by the matching peptides, indicating that the sequences in the remaining 11.7% of I-κBα were involved in TGase 2 mediated cross-linking. The regions of I-κBα that were not retrieved by proteolytic digestion included amino acid (aa) residues 141–143, 265–287, and 307–317 (Fig. 2). The absence of the first region, aa 141–143, appeared to be an experimental artifact, given that it contained no glutamine or lysine residues. The second and third regions contained 6 glutamine residues, aa 266, 267, 268, 271, 278, and 313, but did not contain any corresponding lysine residues. Interestingly, these regions of I-κBα overlapped the glutamine- and leucine-rich region (QL-rich region; amino acids 264–276) located between aa 263 and 277. This region has been shown to be required for both inducible degradation and inhibition of RelA function (15Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 1058-1065Crossref Google Scholar). Our data suggested that there was no specificity for lysine residues in the cross-linking reaction, resulting in the saturation of identifiable peptides. A series of peptides containing candidate glutamines and lysines were synthesized (Table 1) and tested for their ability to undergo cross-linking. A peptide containing a glutamine residue from one of the recovered regions (aa 165) was selected as a negative control for cross-linking (PQ-1). Because there appeared to be a lack of specificity for lysine residues, lysine-containing peptides were designed ad hoc. We ruled out lysine residues in the ankyrin repeat region (aa 73–275), with the exception of one that we used as a negative control (PK-2, aa 83–91), because the ankyrin domains are known to bind to NF-κB and lysines in this region were considered inaccessible by TGase 2. The two regions of I-κBα that were selected were the bridge sequence between ankyrin domains 3 and 4 (PK-3, aa 173–181) and the N terminus of I-κBα containing target lysines for ubiquitination (PK-1, aa 17–26). Interestingly, there were no lysine residues in the C-terminal region of I-κBα (aa 245-C terminus). Peptides containing candidate glutamine residues (PQ-1, -2, -3, or -4) were added to a peptide mixture containing candidate lysine residues (PK-1, -2, and -3), incubated with TGase 2, and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3). The mass spectra obtained following the cross-linking reaction showed that cross-linked dipeptides of PQ-3 (Fig. 3B) or PQ-4 (Fig. 3C) were generated, whereas PQ-1 and PQ-2 did not appear to undergo a cross-linking reaction (data not shown). The result suggested that glutamine 313 in PQ-3 and one or more of the glutamine residues in PQ-4 were involved in TGase 2-mediated cross-linking. PQ-4 contained two potential glutamine regions, a glutamine cluster at aa 266–268 and glutamine 271. PQ-4 was further divided into two peptides, PQ-5 and PQ-9, and these two peptides were incubated with the mixture of peptides containing candidate lysine residues (PK-1,-2, and -3). Cross-linked dipeptides of PQ-5 were evident following incubation with TGase 2, whereas PQ-9 did not appear to undergo a cross-linking reaction (data not shown). In contrast to the apparent specificity of TGase 2 for glutamine residues, peptides containing candidate lysine residues (PK-1, -2, and -3) generally participated in the cross-linking reaction regardless of their sequence (Fig. 3). However, there was a distinct difference in the intensity of the dipeptides containing each of the PK peptides, implying a preference for certain lysine residues. Each PK peptide, present at equal concentrations, exhibited a different ionization efficiency, represented by the ratio of the areas of the ionization peaks for each peptide, 5.2:1:1.1 for PK-1:PK-2:PK-3 (Fig. 3A). If a glutamine-containing peptide was cross-linked with equal efficiently to each PK peptide, the ionization efficiency of cross-linked dipeptides would follow the pattern of each PK peptide alone. However, the ratio of ionization peak areas of the dipeptides shifted dramatically. In the case of PQ-3 and PQ-4, the ratios of peak areas were 2.3:1:4.8 (Fig. 3B) and 3.1:1:18.8 (Fig. 3C) for PK-1:PK-2:PK-3. This suggested that PK-3 was the most abundant partner for the glutamine donors, although PK-1 and PK-2 were also involved in the cross-linking reaction. By repeating this series of peptide cross-linking experiments several times, we were able to confirm that TGase 2 specifically targeted glutamine residues 266–268 and appeared to have some preference for lysine 177. We observed that glutamine residues in PQ-3 and PQ-4 were simultaneously deaminated following incubation with TGase 2, as well as cross-linked to PK peptides. Peptide deamination was not detected in PQ-1, PQ-2, or PQ-9 (data not shown). TGase 2 catalyzes a two-step reaction process in which a peptide-bound glutamine residue in a target protein first forms a thiol ester with the active site cysteine of TGase 2, releasing ammonia and resulting in the formation of an acylgroup. In the second step, the acyl group is transferred to an acyl acceptor (amine donor) lysine residue, and an isopeptide bond is formed. However, when there is no amine donor available, the thiol ester bond can be also hydrolyzed, resulting in deamination of glutamine and a corresponding mass increase of Δ1 as glutamine is converted to glutamate. In the absence of a lysine donor, the glutamine residue of PQ-3 was deaminated by TGase 2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). To identify the glutamine residues preferred by TGase 2, we compared the peak areas of the monoisotopic masses of the synthetic peptides with TGase 2 treatment. We found that the molecular ratio of intact PQ-3 to deaminated PQ-3 was 1:3. After incubation of PQ-4 with 0.001 unit TGase 2 for 1 h in the absence of a lysine donor, we observed that glutamine residues 266 and 267 were completely deaminated and that glutamine 268 was partially deaminated (Fig. 4B). We found no evidence for deamination of glutamine 271 (data not shown). Therefore, glutamine residues at positions 266 and 267 may play an important role for initiation of TGase cross-linking. To identify the glutamine residue(s) within the glutamine cluster (aa 266–268) involved in TGase 2-mediated cross-linking of I-κBα, three additional peptides were synthesized (PQ-6, PQ-7, and PQ-8) and tested in the in vitro cross-linking reaction using PK-4 as the donor lysine (Fig. 5). Each of the peptides contained glutamine to glutamate substitutions at two of the three positions in the glutamine cluster based on the data in Fig. 4. After incubation with PK-4, cross-linked dipeptides of PQ-6 (Q267E,Q268E) and PQ-7 (Q266E,Q268E) were evident, whereas PQ-8 (Q266E,Q267E) showed no evidence of cross-linking (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the intensity of PQ-7 was higher than that of PQ-6. The calculated peak areas of each of the mutant peptides in relation to PQ-5 were 0.44 (PQ-7) and 0.21 (PQ-6). These results suggested that TGase 2 was most selective for the second glutamine of the cluster, residue 267, whereas the third glutamine residue did not appear to participate in cross-linking. To determine the cross-linking efficiency of the putative TGase 2 targets identified thus far (glutamines 266, 267, and 313 and lysine 177), an I-κBα polymerization competition assay was performed using synthetic peptides carrying each of the target glutamine and lysine residues (Fig. 6). PQ-4 and PQ-5, which contained the entire glutamine cluster (aa 266–268), completely blocked I-κBα polymerization. PQ-3 also had an inhibitory effect on I-κBα polymerization (Fig. 6). Of note, PK-1, which contained the ubiquitination sites lysine 21 and lysine 22, had an inhibitory effect on I-κBα polymerization similar to that of PK-3 (Fig. 6). Based on the relative intensity of the I-κBα bands generated in the in vitro cross-linking reaction, the peptides containing glutamines at positions 266 and 267 (PQ-4 and PQ-5) showed a higher inhibitory effect on I-κBα polymerization than any of the mutant peptides (PQ-6, PQ-7, and PQ-8) of PQ-5 (Fig. 6). In addition to in vitro test, we determined whether I-κBα polymerization by TGase 2 could be rescued in vivo by human I-κBα mutant constructs containing mutations at TGase 2 targeting sites. To test this hypothesis, a series of mutants (lysine to glycine at 177 (K177G), glutamine to glycine at 266 (Q255G), glutamine to glycine at 266 (Q266G), glutamine to glycine at 267 (Q267G), glutamine to glycine at 313 (Q313G)) were constructed and transfected into the EcR/TG cell line (11Lee J. Kim Y.S. Choi D.H. Bang M.S. Han T.R. Joh T.H. Kim S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53725-53735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After a 24-h transfection, TGase 2 was induced for 24 h by tetracycline treatment. Interestingly, the depletion of free I-κBα was almost rescued by transfection of mutant I-κBαs in glutamine sites (Q266G,Q267G) as well as in the lysine site (K177G) (Fig. 7). Densitometry analysis showed that the differential depletion of each mutation occurs in I-κBα cross-linking in vivo. The data suggest that Lys-177 and Gln-267 of I-κBα are preferentially selected sites for TGase 2 cross-linking in vivo. Mutation of a non-substrate residue (Q255G) in this region of the molecule was employed for a specificity control, which showed no comparable effect on TGase 2. In the current study, we demonstrated that TGase 2 catalyzes the cross-linking of I-κBα monomers by preferentially targeting specific glutamine residues in the C terminus of I-κBα. In contrast, we found that here was no apparent specificity for lysine donor residues. However, based on analysis of peptides containing Lys-177, which is located between the third and the fourth ankyrin repeats of I-κBα, and lysines 21 and 22 in the N terminus, it appeared that certain lysines functioned as good acyl acceptors in the TGase 2-catalyzed acyl transfer reaction (Fig. 3). Interestingly, peptide PK-1 blocked I-κBα polymerization in an in vitro competition assay as efficiently as the PK-3 peptide (Fig. 6). Based on our current results, we cannot rule out the possibility of heteropolymerization between I-κBα and other TGase 2 substrates containing better lysine donors than I-κBα. However, TGase 2-catalyzed I-κBα homopolymerization in vitro was very efficient, suggesting that I-κBα homopolymerization may also occur in vivo. Upon activation of IKK by various stimuli, I-κBα binds to IKK and is phosphorylated on serine residues 32 and 36 (16Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is followed by ubiquitination and rapid proteosome-dependent degradation of I-κBα (17DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of I-κBα does not lead to dissociation of I-κBα from NF-κB but, rather, targets free I-κBα for rapid degradation (6Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). This mechanism of regulation of NF-κB activity is not universal, however, as it has been shown that proteasome-mediated degradation of I-κBα does not play a role in the constitutive activation of NF-κB in early B cells in response to oxidative stress (18Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Under conditions of oxidative stress, I-κBα is phosphorylated on tyrosine 42. Rather than mediating degradation however, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to play a role in inhibiting the association between NF-κB and free I-κBα (19Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation-mediated regulation of I-κBα, there is evidence that other pathways of activation of NF-κB exist in tumors and contribute to the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy. Depletion of free I-κBα induced by doxorubicin does not require classical phosphorylation, or the PEST domain of I-κBα (20Tergaonkar V. Bottero V. Ikawa M. Li Q. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8070-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In fact, the mechanism of activation of NF-κB upon prolonged anticancer chemotreatment has yet to be fully characterized. TGase 2 is highly up-regulated in chemoresistant breast cancers (21Mehta K. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and depletion of free I-κBα by TGase 2-mediated polymerization does not require kinase activation, making this pathway an attractive candidate for the regulation of NF-κB during tumorigenesis. As we showed previously (11Lee J. Kim Y.S. Choi D.H. Bang M.S. Han T.R. Joh T.H. Kim S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53725-53735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and in the current study (Fig. 1), TGase 2 efficiently polymerizes I-κBα in vivo and in vitro. TGases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes, so in the absence of activated kinase-dependent signaling pathways, the process of TGase-mediated NF-κB activation could be triggered by any type of stimuli that results in an increase in calcium uptake. However, TGase 2 can be induced by NF-κB (22Mirza A. Liu S.L. Frizell E. Zhu J. Maddukuri S. Martinez J. Davies P. Schwarting R. Norton P. Zern M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G281-G288PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that kinase-dependent NF-κB activation and TGase 2-mediated NF-κB activation may be related. Our data show that TGase 2 specifically targets glutamine residues in the C-terminal region of I-κBα (Fig. 2). This region also contains the QL-rich region (15Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 1058-1065Crossref Google Scholar) as well as a PEST sequence that is associated with rapid protein turnover (23Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was the QL-rich region, rather than the PEST sequence, that appeared to be involved in the inducible degradation of I-κBα observed by Sun et al. (15Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 1058-1065Crossref Google Scholar). Deletion of the 13 amino acids that constituted the QL-rich region (and that constitute the TGase 2 targeting region) in the C terminus of I-κBα completely abolished TNF-α-induced degradation of I-κBα (15Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 1058-1065Crossref Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the depletion of I-κBα by TNF-α may be due to TGase 2-mediated polymerization of I-κBα. Inhibition of NF-κB represents an attractive therapeutic approach to the treatment of many diseases, including inflammatory disease and cancer. Several strategies for reversing NF-κB activation have been employed, including inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation, NF-κB translocation to nucleus, degradation, IKK·I-κBα complex formation, IKK activation, and cyclooxygenase-2 activity. NF-κB translocation into the nucleus can be blocked by a synthetic compound, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, which is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyaniline (24Matsumoto N. Ariga A. To-e S. Nakamura H. Agata N. Hirano S. Inoue J. Umezawa K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibition has broad application, because inhibition of the proteosome affects the accumulation of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcriptional factors, and tumor suppressors as well as I-κBα (25Zavrski I. Jakob C. Schmid P. Krebbel H. Kaiser M. Fleissner C. Rosche M. Possinger K. Sezer O. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this regard, a reversible boronic acid dipeptide proteasome inhibitor (Bortezomib) has been shown to have a dramatic anti-tumor effect, along with its ability to block NF-κB activation (26Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Mitsiades C. Mitsiades N. Hayashi T. Munshi N. Dang L. Castro A. Palombella V. Adams J. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16639-16647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and is well tolerated in phase I/II clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma (27Orlowski R.Z. Stinchcombe T.E. Mitchell B.S. Shea T.C. Baldwin A.S. Stahl S. Adams J. Esseltine D.L. Elliott P.J. Pien C.S. Guerciolini R. Anderson J.K. Depcik-Smith N.D. Bhagat R. Lehman M.J. Novick S.C. O'Connor O.A. Soignet S.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 4420-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The tripeptide aldehydes proteasomal system inhibitor (PSI: N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-(O-t-Bu)-Ala-leucinal) and MG-132 reversibly inhibit the proteasome complex and are able to sensitize cancer cells to antitumor agents through the inhibition of NF-κB (28Arlt A. Gehrz A. Muerkoster S. Vorndamm J. Kruse M.L. Folsch U.R. Schafer H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3243-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, are well known for their ability to prevent the development of various cancers. Interestingly, NSAIDs also inhibit the activity of IKKβ and prevent NF-κB activation (29Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Therefore NSAIDs also appear to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents through inhibition of NF-κB activation. A synthetic peptide, IKKβ 644–756, which inhibits the interaction of I-κBα and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), has been shown to inhibit cytokine-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (30May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that prevent phosphorylation of I-κBα by IKK have been shown to completely abolish lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB (9Swaroop N. Chen F. Wang L. Dokka S. Toledo D. Rojanasakul Y. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2001; 18: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identified specific glutamine targets of TGase 2, glutamines 266 and 267 in I-κBα, and demonstrated that a synthetic peptide in which the sequence encompasses aa 264 to 270 of I-κBα (PQ-5) dramatically blocked I-κBα polymerization by TGase (Fig. 8). These peptides also demonstrated the potential to block free I-κBα depletion in vitro (Fig. 6). Furthermore, transfection of mutant I-κBα constructs containing TGase 2 targeting sites effectively reversed the TGase 2-mediated loss of I-κBα in vivo. Interestingly, the mutation at lysine 177 reversed I-κBα depletion as efficiently as the mutation at glutamine targets (Q266G, Q267G, and Q313G) did in vivo. Therefore, lysine 177 may have an important role for TGase cross-link in vivo, although in vitro competition assay shows about 50% rescue effect of I-κBα depletion. The physiological impact of TGase 2 inhibitors mimicking TGase 2 targeting domains of I-κBα is the subject of ongoing and future studies."

Nevertheless, extracellular residues are important for various functions in both peptide-GPCRs and amine-GPCRs. In this study, the V1a vasopressin receptor was used to systematically investigate the role of extracellular charged residues that are highly conserved throughout a subfamily of peptide-GPCRs, using a combination of mutagenesis and molecular modeling. Of the 13 conserved charged residues identified in the extracellular loops (ECLs), Arg116 (ECL1), Arg125 (top of TMIII), and Asp204 (ECL2) are important for agonist binding and/or receptor activation. Molecular modeling revealed that Arg125 (and Lys125) stabilizes TMIII by interacting with lipid head groups. Charge reversal (Asp125) caused re-ordering of the lipids, altered helical packing, and increased solvent penetration of the TM bundle. Interestingly, a negative charge is excluded at this locus in peptide-GPCRs, whereas a positive charge is excluded in amine-GPCRs. This contrasting conserved charge may reflect differences in GPCR binding modes between peptides and amines, with amines needing to access a binding site crevice within the receptor TM bundle, whereas the binding site of peptide-GPCRs includes more extracellular domains. A conserved negative charge at residue 204 (ECL2), juxtaposed to the highly conserved disulfide bond, was essential for agonist binding and signaling. Asp204 (and Glu204) establishes TMIII contacts required for maintaining the β-hairpin fold of ECL2, which if broken (Ala204 or Arg204) resulted in ECL2 unfolding and receptor dysfunction.

The atomic detail of this general GPCR fold has been elucidated for bovine rhodopsin (bRho) using x-ray crystallography (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H.

This confirmed that the chromophore 11-cis-retinal is covalently linked to Lys296(7.43) in transmembrane helix VII (TMVII) via a protonated Schiff-base and projects into a binding pocket formed within the TM bundle where it interacts with amino acid side chains and water molecules (1Palczewski K.

Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding pocket for small biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine is buried deep within the TM bundle (3Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is known from the bRho x-ray structure that the extracellular domains possess defined structure and are orientated to interact with each other and with the TM helices. Indeed ECL2 of bRho forms a β-hairpin that plunges down into the helical bundle to form a plug over the chromophore. Furthermore, the orientation of ECL2 in the majority of GPCRs is restrained by a conserved disulfide bond between ECL2 and the top of TMIII (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A.

Coles P. Thibonnier A. Shoham M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). The effects of AVP/OT are mediated by a family of receptors (V1aR, V1bR, V2R, and OTR), which together with the vasotocin receptor (VTR), mesotocin receptor, and isotocin receptor from lower vertebrates constitute a subfamily of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor class of GPCRs (family A). The V1aR, V1bR, and OTR couple to phospholipase C thereby generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol as second messengers, whereas the V2R stimulates adenylyl cyclase. The V1aR is widely distributed and mediates nearly all of the actions of AVP with the exceptions of antidiuresis (V2R) and ACTH secretion (V1bR). Activation of the OTR stimulates contraction of the uterine myometrium during labor and causes lactation. In addition to the characteristic architecture of GPCRs, members of the neurohypophysial peptide hormone receptor family share certain sequence motifs and exhibit related pharmacologies (5Gimpl G.

In particular, two charged residues (Arg46 and Glu54) in the V1aR N terminus are required for high affinity agonist binding but not antagonist binding (14Hawtin S.R. Wesley V.J. Parslow R.A. Simms J.

The aim of this study was to use the V1aR to systematically investigate the function of extracellular charged residues that are highly conserved throughout a subfamily of peptide GPCRs. By using a combination of mutagenesis and molecular modeling, our results indicate that specific conserved charged residues in ECL1, ECL2, and ECL3 fulfill important roles in ligand binding, receptor activation, domain conformation, and cell-surface expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—AVP was purchased from Sigma. The cyclic peptide antagonist (CA) 1-(β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine AVP (d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2AVP), and linear peptide antagonist (LA) phenylacetyl (PhAc)-d-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9AVP were from Bachem (St. Helens, UK). SR 49059 was a gift from Sanofi Recherche (Toulouse, France). Cell culture media, buffers, and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas (Sunderland, UK).Mutant Receptor Constructs—Mutation of the V1aR was made using a PCR approach as described previously (15Hawtin S.R. Wesley V.J. Simms J. Argent C.C.H. Latif K. Wheatley M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutant receptor constructs [D112A]V1aR, [R116A]V1aR, [R118A]V1aR, [D121A]V1aR, and [R125A]V1aR were engineered using the antisense oligonucleotides as follows: 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GCG-GTA-GGT-GAT-GGC-CCA-GC-3′;5′-GGC-AAA-CAC CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GGC-GTA-GG-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GGC-GAA-GCG-G-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GGC-GGG-CCC-3′; and 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GGC-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-3′, respectively. Each primer contained a unique SdaI restriction site (underlined) and base changes (shown in boldface) to generate each individual Ala substitution plus base changes to create a silent ApaI restriction site for diagnostic purposes (shown in italics). The same cloning strategy was employed to generate the mutant constructs [D112E]V1aR, [D112K]V1aR, [D112R]V1aR, [R116D]V1aR, [R116E]V1aR, [R116K]V1aR, [R125D]V1aR, and [R125K]V1aR using the antisense oligonucleotides as follows: 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GCG-GTA-GGT-GAT-CTC-CCA-GC-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GCG-GTA-GGT-GAT-TTT-CCA-GC-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GCG-GTA-GGT-GAT-GCG-CCA-GC-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-GTC-GTA-GGT-G-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-CTC-GTA-GGT-G-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GCG-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-GCG-GAA-TTT-GTA-GGT-G-3′; 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-GTC-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-3′; and 5′-GGC-AAA-CAC-CTG-CAG-GTG-CTT-CAC-CAC-TTT-GCA-CAG-CCA-GTC-GGG-CCC-3′, respectively. PCR products were subcloned into the HA epitope-tagged rat V1aR coding sequence in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) utilizing unique HindIII and SdaI restriction sites.The mutations [E193A]V1aR, [E195A]V1aR, [K201A]V1aR, and [D204A]V1aR were made using antisense oligonucleotides as follows: 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-GGT-AGC-CCA-GCA-GTC-TTG-GGT-TTT-AGT-GCC-ATT-GTT-CAC-CTC-GAT-TGC-GAT-CAC-AGA-G-3′; 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-GGT-AGC-CCA-GCA-GTC-TTG-GGT-TTT-AGT-GCC-ATT-GTT-CAC-CGC-GAT-TTC-G-3′; 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-CGT-TGC-CCA-GCA-GTC-TTG-GGT-TGC-AGT-GCC-ATT-G-3′; and 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-GGT-AGC-CCA-GCA-GGC-TTG-GGT-TTT-AGT-GC-3′, respectively. These primers contained the base changes (shown in boldface) to incorporate the Ala mutations and unique KpnI restriction site (underlined) used for subcloning. The [D204E]V1aR and [D204R]V1aR mutations were also engineered using this strategy using antisense oligonucleotides as follows: 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-GGT-AGC-CCA-GCA-CTC-TTG-GGT-TTT-AGT-GC-3′ and 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-ACC-CCA-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-GGT-AGC-CCA-GCA-GCG-TTG-GGT-TTT-AGT-GC-3′. The construct [R216A]V1aR was made using sense oligonucleotide 5′-G-CCC-TGG-GGT-ACC-GCC-GCG-TAC-GTG-ACC-TGG-ATG-ACC-TCA-GGT-GTC-TTC-GTG-G-3′. This primer contained five base changes in the V1aR sequence (shown in boldface) that created the Ala mutation (shown in italics) unique silent Pfl23II and Eco81I restriction sites (for diagnostic purposes) and a KpnI restriction site (underlined) for subcloning into the V1aR.The [E332A]V1aR mutation was made by PCR using both sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The sense primer was 5′-C-GAT-TCA-GCA-AAC-CCA-TCGATA-ACA-ATC-ACG-GCG-3′. This primer contained four base changes in the V1aR sequence (indicated in boldface) that created a unique functional ClaI restriction site (underlined) without altering the amino acid sequence and incorporated the Glu332 → Ala mutation (shown in italics). A KpnI/EcoRI digest of this PCR fragment was subcloned into the V1aR. The constructs [D323A]V1aR and [D330A]V1aR were made by PCR with pcDNA3-[E332A]V1aR as template. Mutant antisense oligonucleotides were 5′-CGT-GAT-TGT-TAT-CGA-TGG-GTT-TTC-TGA-ATC-GGT-CCA-GAT-GAA-ATT-CTC-AGC-CCA-GAC-TGA-CC-3′ and 5′-CGT-GAT-TGT-TAT-CGA-TGG-GTT-TTC-TGA-AGC-GGT-CCA-GAT-GAA-ATT-CTC-ATC-C-3′ for [D323A]V1aR and [D330A]V1aR mutations, respectively. These primers contained base changes (shown in boldface) for the required Ala substitution and unique ClaI restriction site (underlined). The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3-[E332A]V1aR utilizing unique SdaI and ClaI restriction sites. All receptor constructs were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C.

Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression to fit theoretical Langmuir binding isotherms to the experimental data using PRISM Graphpad (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego). Individual IC50 values obtained for competing ligands were corrected for radioligand occupancy as described (26Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

After 36 h, each well received 0.5 ml of binding buffer (described above) containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 1-2 nm V1aR-selective peptide antagonist PhAc-d-Tyr(Me)2Arg6(3,4[3H]Pro)(3,5[3H]Tyr)9NH2-AVP (22 Ci/mmol; custom synthesis Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, INC. Belmont, CA) as tracer ligand in the presence (nonspecific) or absence (total) of 1 μm LA. Plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, before removal of the medium by aspiration. After three rinses with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was added to each well to extract radioactivity. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the fluid from the plates was transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of HiSafe3 scintillant mixture for counting. Cell-surface expression values were corrected for radioligand occupancy as described (26Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

Briefly, HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates and transfected after 24 h using Transfast™ (Promega Corp., Southampton, UK). After 36 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at 37 °C and then washed three times with TBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 45 min. Anti-HA primary antibody (HA-7; Sigma) was diluted to 1:1000 in TBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA for 60 min at room temperature with occasional shaking, followed by three gentle washes with TBS. Cells were briefly re-blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 15 min, prior to incubation with secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse; Bio-Rad), and diluted to 1:3000 in 1% (w/v) BSA/TBS for 60 min with occasional shaking. Cells were washed three times with TBS before a colorimetric alkaline phosphate substrate (Bio-Rad) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A 100-μl aliquot from each well was mixed with an equal volume of 0.4 m NaOH prior to measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Results were normalized against a wild-type control processed in parallel. Nontransfected cells were used to determine background.

Briefly, following pre-labeling of transfected cells with 2 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (22.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, a mixed fraction containing mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (InsP-InsP3) was collected following stimulation by AVP, at the concentrations indicated, in the presence of 10 mm LiCl.Molecular Modeling of the V1aR—The V1aR sequence was aligned against the sequence corresponding to the crystal structure coordinates of bRho using ClustalW (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). The alignment was then used to generate homology models using MODELLER version 6.2 (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar). A collection of 200 model structures was generated and ranked based on an objective function score provided by MODELLER version 6.2. From this ensemble, a single structure was selected for further analysis. Further refinement of the homology model was achieved through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the receptor embedded in a hydrated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer. MD simulations were carried out using the GROMOS96 force-field parameters, with minor modifications, as implemented in GROMACS (30Lindahl E. van der Hess B. Spoel D. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). Partial charges for the heavy atoms of Lys and Arg side chains were determined using the 6-31G basis set as implemented in GAMESS US.RESULTSRole of Charged Residues in the First Extracellular Loop (ECL1) of the V1aR—The sequences of the extracellular loops, plus the extracellular boundaries, of the neurohypophysial peptide hormone subfamily of GPCRs are aligned in Fig. 1A. Within ECL1 (including the extracellular regions of TMII and TMIII), there are five conserved charged residues as follows: Asp112, Arg116, Arg118, Asp121, and Arg125 (Fig. 1B, residue number is based on rV1aR). Residues Arg116, Asp121, and Arg125 are absolutely conserved across all VPR/OTRs cloned to date (Fig. 1A). Asp112 is also conserved with the exception of the human V2R (Lys) and the VTR (Glu). Arg118 is only conserved in V1aRs, although positively charged residues are present at this locus in all V2Rs (Fig. 1A).To assess the importance of these conserved residues in V1aR function, each residue was substituted individually by Ala and then pharmacologically characterized using the natural agonist AVP and three different structural classes of antagonist as follows: (i) CA, [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2]AVP (25Kruszynski M. Lammek B. Manning M. Seto J. Haldar J. Sawyer W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar); (ii) LA ([PhAc-d-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9]AVP (31Schmidt A. Audigier S. Barberis C. Jard S. Manning M. Kolodziejczyk A.S. Sawyer W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)); and (iii) nonpeptide antagonist (SR 49059; (32Serradeil-Le Gal C. Wagnon J. Garcia C. Lacour C. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Villanova G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar)). The Kd values are presented in Table 1, corrected for radioligand occupancy. Mutating Arg116, Arg118, Asp121, or Arg125 to Ala had only a slight effect on the binding of the agonist AVP or the three different classes of antagonist (Table 1 and Fig. 2). [D112A]V1aR was also essentially wild type, although the Kd value for LA was slightly (5-fold) increased. Furthermore, the mutations [D112A]V1aR, [R118A]V1aR, and [D121A]V1aR had little effect on signaling, with EC50 values for AVP-stimulated inositol phosphate (InsP-InsP3) accumulations comparable with wild-type V1aR (Table 1). In contrast, [R116A]V1aR and [R125A]V1aR had a marked effect on signaling, increasing the EC50 value 70- and 16-fold, respectively, compared with the wild type (Fig. 3, A and B).TABLE 1Pharmacological profile of mutant V1aRs Mutant V1aRs were expressed in HEK 293T cells and characterized pharmacologically.

None of the mutant receptors displayed constitutive activity. Cell-surface expression was determined, mean ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1964017923,"We report the cloning and characterization of DANGER, a novel protein which physiologically binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R). DANGER is a membrane-associated protein predicted to contain a partial MAB-21 domain. It is expressed in a wide variety of neuronal cell lineages where it localizes to membranes in the cell periphery together with IP3R. DANGER interacts with IP3R in vitro and co-immunoprecipitates with IP3R from cellular preparations. DANGER robustly enhances Ca2+-mediated inhibition of IP3 RCa2+ release without affecting IP3 binding in microsomal assays and inhibits gating in single-channel recordings of IP3R. DANGER appears to allosterically modulate the sensitivity of IP3 RtoCa2+ inhibition, which likely alters IP3R-mediated Ca2+ dynamics in cells where DANGER and IP3R are co-expressed.

Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar, 2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is formed in response to the activation of G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinase receptors located in the plasma membrane (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar), which elicit IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from ER stores. The IP3 recognition site of IP3R includes amino acids (aa) 225-578 in the N-terminal portion of the protein, while the Ca2+ channel domain comprises ∼300 aa in the extreme C terminus (2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The IP3 binding site and the Ca2+ channel are separated by ∼2,000 aa, providing a large area for interactions with multiple regulatory proteins including calmodulin, chromogranins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, RACK1, and caldendrin (3Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). While these proteins regulate IP3R function in diverse ways, only two regulators have been shown to influence Ca2+ sensitivity. Cytochrome c, which binds to the extreme C terminus of the IP3R, relieves the inhibitory actions of Ca2+ upon the channel (4Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and Bcl-XL binding to the C terminus also influences the Ca2+ dependence (5White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We have identified a novel vertebrate protein, designated DANGER, which was isolated by yeast two-hybrid analysis with the regulatory region of the IP3R as bait. DANGER physiologically binds to IP3R and allosterically enhances the potency of Ca2+-inhibition of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release without affecting ligand binding. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The Matchmaker3 yeast-2-hybrid system from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) was employed. AH109 β-galactosidase yeast was used. IP3R fragments were cloned into pGADT7 (β-galactosidase acceptor domain) vector and were screened against a rat brain and human fetal kidney library (Clontech) as per the manufacturer's specifications. Expression of these fragments was determined by Western blotting using antibodies from Clontech, corresponding to the expression vector. Positive clones grew on minimal SD agar (Clontech) lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and had β-galactosidase activity. Calcium Release Measurements and Electrophysiology—Calcium release through recombinant type I (SII+)IP3R was measured exactly as described previously (13Boehning D. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16084-16090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Calcium concentrations in all solutions were calibrated with a calcium-selective minielectrode, and confirmed with fluorescent dyes. When the effects of DANGER were examined, it was added simultaneously with IP3. In the absence of IP3, SERCA activity was not affected by the addition of DANGER. At the concentrations used in this study, DANGER did not change the calcium concentration of the assay solution as determined by a calcium minielectrode. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Invitrogen) were grown and maintained in SF-900II serum-free media (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Ionescu L. Cheung K.H. Vais H. Mak D.O. White C. Foskett J.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 645-662Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An ice-cold nuclear isolation solution, containing (in mm): 140 KCl, 250 sucrose, 1.5 β-mercaptoethanol, 10 Tris-HCl (pH to 7.4), with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was added to the flask, and the cells were detached by gentle scraping. Homogenization of 1-2 ml of the mixture was performed using 2-4 strokes of the pestle in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. 20-30 μl of the homogenized mixture was added to 1 ml standard bath solution (in mm: 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 BAPTA, pH 7.3, and free [Ca2+] adjusted to ∼300 nm) in an experimental chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. Isolated nuclei are 5-10 μm in diameter and were distinguished from intact cells based on their unique morphology (9Ionescu L. Cheung K.H. Vais H. Mak D.O. White C. Foskett J.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 645-662Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The standard pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 0.5 Na2ATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.07 mm Ca2+, and 100 nm InsP3. All solutions were carefully buffered to desired free [Ca2+] (8Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) confirmed by fluorometry. Data were acquired as described (8Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Segments of current traces exhibiting one or two InsP3R channels were used for open probability (Po) determinations (15Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Single channel traces were used for dwell time analyses by QuB software (16Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1915-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The number of active channels in nuclear membrane patches (NA) and the mean channel activity duration Ta were determined as described (9Ionescu L. Cheung K.H. Vais H. Mak D.O. White C. Foskett J.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 645-662Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All data are averages of at least six experiments performed at the same [InsP3] and [Ca2+]i. Error bars indicate S.E. Cell Lines and Expression Protocols—Human HEK cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Transfection of PC12 and HEK with either 100 nm small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex and 1 μg YFP, or 1 μg of DANGER and 1 μg of YFP, was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Expression Constructs—The type 1 IP3R SII+ splice variant and SERCA-2b in pcDNA3.1 have been described elsewhere (17Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Suresh K. Joseph (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). DANGER was cloned from human, rat, and mouse cDNA libraries generated from brain using the Roche reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using 5′ and 3′ 21-mer primers corresponding to the following sequences human (GI: 29789287), Mouse (GI: 39645725), and Rat (GI:30466774), which have 9-mer overhangs on each end to engineer the appropriate restriction sites. Two siRNA sequences were used for DANGER deletion, each with similar efficacy: 5′-aagaatgccccagcgctcatt-3′ (human) and 5′-aatacgagtttgaccttgctt-3′ (rat). Antibody Generation—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against DANGER was generated by injecting New Zealand White male rabbits with peptide RAEPLNLFRPFVLQR SLYR coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Initial injection was with Complete Freund's adjuvant, and boost injections at days 14, 21, and 49 were with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. Rabbit injections, bleeds, and housing were performed by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Monoclonal type 1 IP3R antibody m18A10 was a kind gift form K. Mikoshiba. Anti-Myc antibody was from Sigma. Subcellular Fractionation—After inducing differentiation by NGF, cells were harvested by gently scraping plates with a cell scraper, and were washed once with cold PBS. The washed pellet was subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, one protease inhibitor pill). Cells were then homogenized on ice using a 1-ml glass Dounce homogenizer with a tight fitting pestle until ∼95% of cells were disrupted as judged by trypan blue staining. Crude lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was collected and the pellet (P1) discarded. The low speed supernatant was then subjected to 10,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, which yielded the 10,000 × g pellet (P2). The supernatant from the P2 pellet was centrifuged at 15,000 × g to completely rid the supernatant of any remaining mitochondria. Finally the 15,000 × g supernatant was separated into cytosol (S3) and light membrane (P3) fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The 100,000 × g supernatant was collected as the S3 fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 40-70 μl of Buffer A. P2 was washed twice by resuspending cells in 100 μl of Buffer A and pelleting (10,000 × g for 15 min). After the final wash, P2 was resuspended in 50-100 μl of Buffer A. All fractionations were repeated a minimum of four times with essentially identical results. Subcellular fractions were characterized using nucleoporin (P1, nuclear), cytochrome c oxidase (P2, mitochondria, heavy ER), heme oxygenase 2 (P3, light ER), and lactate dehydrogenase (S3, cytosol). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA) was added to 100 μg of cell lysate to bring samples to a total volume of 500 μl. Samples were cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Anti-IP3R-1, pre-immune sera, mouse IgG, or anti-DANGER antibodies, and protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated on a rotator for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and quenched with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. Co-immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—PC12 cells were grown on coverslips for 56 h then fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde in 2× PBS for 30 min and washed three times in 2× PBS for 15 min. Coverslips were quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min and washed three times in 2× PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized in saponin solution (2× PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum, and 0.075% w/v saponin) for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times in 2× PBS for 15 min and subsequently inverted on 250 μl of anti-DANGER and IP3R in a wet chamber overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times in 2× PBS for 15 min and inverted on 250 μl of secondary antibody solution 1:300 for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were washed three times in 2× PBS for 15 min and mounted onto slides with Slo-fade. Fluorescence signals were detected with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal laser scanning microscope, using a 63×/NA 1.4 objective. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5 μm sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval by incubation in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, at 98 °C for 20 min. Sections were then immunostained using the Vectastain™ ABC system according to the manufacturer instructions using affinity purified anti-DANGER antibody described above at a dilution of 1/50. Antibodies and Reagents—Plasmids were from the following sources: EYFP, Matchmaker©, and Myc-CMV vector cDNA from CLONETECH and human M5 muscarinic receptor cDNA from L. Birnbaumer (National Institutes of Health). Human Northern blot from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Carbachol, protein A-agarose, GST-agarose, Sigma. Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). UTP was from Invitrogen. siRNA duplex was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Ca45 was from Amersham Biosciences. We conducted a yeast two-hybrid analysis using multiple fragments of IP3R as described previously (6Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Barrow R.K. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). A novel interacting sequence, corresponding to a previously uncharacterized expressed sequence tag designated KIAA1754 (7Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), bound to aa 923-1581 fragment of IP3R. This expressed sequence tag, which we now denote as DANGER, maps to a human genomic sequence on chromosome 10q25.1 comprising a single coding exon (4.3 kb). The open reading frame codes for a protein of 547 aa and is predicted to contain several coiled-coil regions, an N-terminal signal peptide for ER/plasma-membrane retention, and a partial MAB-21 domain (Fig. 1A, schematic). Direct binding of DANGER to full-length IP3R was detected in vitro by co-immunoprecipitation with both overexpressed and endogenous DANGER proteins. We observe robust interactions between a GST-DANGER fusion protein and IP3R (type 1 and type 3) from cell lysates as well as purified type 1 IP3R from rat cerebellum (Fig. 1B). Binding to type 2 IP3R could not be confirmed as the type2 IP3R antibodies we employed failed to demonstrate immunoreactivity to the samples assayed. To study endogenous DANGER, we developed a polyclonal antibody against C-terminal aa 496-514 of DANGER (Fig. 1C). Using a Myc-tagged DANGER expression construct in PC12 cells, the polyclonal antibody recognizes both endogenous and over-expressed DANGER at the same molecular weight (Fig. 1C) as shown by anti-Myc staining of overexpressed DANGER. Western analysis of PC12 cell lysates blotted with polyclonal anti-DANGER reveals a single major band (59 kDa) corresponding to the full-length protein as well as two other bands of lower intensity (49 and 41 kDa). To ensure the specificity of the antibody, we employed DANGER-specific siRNA to deplete endogenous DANGER from PC12 cells (Fig. 1C). The siRNA abolishes DANGER immunoreactivity indicating that the three bands observed by our antibody arise from the same mRNA. Next, we tested the interaction of endogenous DANGER and IP3R in intact cells. We observed co-immunoprecipitation of DANGER with IP3R using either our polyclonal antibody to DANGER or a monoclonal antibody to type 1 IP3R (Fig. 1D). Subcellular fractionation of PC12 cells (Fig. 1E) reveals the greatest enrichment of DANGER in fractions P2 and P3, which contain ER membranes, with lower levels in the crude nuclear P1 fraction. The DANGER clone isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen comprises aa 259-547, which contain a partial MAB-21 region. We attempted to map the site in DANGER that binds IP3R more extensively, using yeast two-hybrid and GST fusion proteins of DANGER (data not shown). Thus far we are unable to identify binding to IP3R with any fragment of DANGER smaller than the one isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen suggesting that the tertiary structure of the MAB21-containing region is critical for binding. To more carefully characterize the intracellular localization of DANGER, we performed immunofluorescence using Alexa-488-conjugated DANGER antibody and Alexa-568-conjugated type 1 IP3R antibodies in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 2 days. We observe a membrane staining pattern for endogenous DANGER, which has a high degree of co-localization with type 1 IP3R (54% ± 8% concurrence in 50 cells measured) (Fig. 2, A-C). We also observe a small amount of DANGER staining in the nucleus, consistent with the results from the subcellular fractionation. Higher magnification reveals substantial co-localization of DANGER with type 1 IP3R near the plasma membrane (Fig 2C1). DANGER and type 1IP3R also co-localize in NGF-induced neurites to a similar extent as in the cell body (46% ± 11%) (Fig. 2C2). DANGER is concentrated in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which contain the highest densities of IP3Rin the brain (Fig. 2D). Whereas cerebellar immunoreactivity for IP3Ris confined to Purkinje cells, DANGER is also concentrated in basket cells. DANGER is also expressed throughout the body in numerous terminally differentiated cell types including neurons, neuroendocrine cells, crypt cells, muscle cells, B-cells, and T-cells (data not shown). To ascertain a possible modulatory role of DANGER on IP3R function, we monitored IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from microsomal preparations of COS7 cells transfected with type 1 IP3R and SERCA2b (Fig. 3, A-C) as described previously (4Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Compared with GST alone (black), incubation with purified GST-tagged DANGER (500 nm) has little effect on IP3-induced Ca2+ release in the presence of 300 nm Ca2+ over a wide range of IP3 concentrations (Fig. 3A). In addition, overexpression or depletion (siRNA) of DANGER does not alter IP3 production in response to muscarinic and purinergic receptor stimulator (data not shown). At low Ca2+ (<150-200 nm) concentrations, Ca2+ enhances IP3R channel activity, while supraphysiologic concentrations of Ca2+ inhibit IP3R activity, reflecting feedback regulation (8Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DANGER (500 nm) has no effect on the stimulatory actions of Ca2+ but markedly enhances the inhibitory effects of elevated Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3C). Thus, in the absence of DANGER, moderately high Ca2+ levels (0.8 and 3.8 μm) do not influence IP3R responses to 100 nm IP3; however, in the presence of DANGER (500 nm), IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ is virtually abolished at these Ca2+ levels. Similar but lesser effects are observed with 100 nm DANGER (data not shown). DANGER-elicited alterations on IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release do not appear to result from changes in binding affinity of IP3 for IP3R as DANGER does not affect IP3 binding affinity (Fig. 3B). We further examined the effects of DANGER on activity of IP3R by performing single IP3R channel recordings with patch clamp electrophysiology. We utilized endogenous Sf9 IP3Rin the outer membrane of freshly isolated nuclei (5White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 9Ionescu L. Cheung K.H. Vais H. Mak D.O. White C. Foskett J.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 645-662Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic face of the channel is exposed to the pipette solution containing 7 μm Ca2+ and 100 nm InsP3. In this preparation, the channel open probability (Po)is ∼0.7 (Fig. 4), as observed previously (9Ionescu L. Cheung K.H. Vais H. Mak D.O. White C. Foskett J.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 645-662Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 1 μm DANGER in the pipette solution reduces channel Po by ∼50%. Channel Po is diminished primarily as a consequence of an increase of the mean closed time (tc), indicating that DANGER decreases the channel opening rate. In contrast, the rate of channel inactivation, monitored by the channel activity duration Ta and the mean number of channels activated in each patch, NA, is unaffected by DANGER (Fig. 4). In summary, DANGER is a novel membrane-associated IP3R binding protein that enhances the sensitivity of IP3R to inhibition by Ca2+. By contrast, cytochrome c and Bcl-XL, which also modulate Ca2+ sensitivity of IP3R, decreases the inhibitory actions of high Ca2+ (4Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 5White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). What might be the major physiologic role of DANGER? Its enhancement of Ca2+ inhibition of IP3R channel function is striking. In microsomal membranes treated with DANGER, IP3R channel function decreases by 90% as [Ca2+] increases from 300 to 800 nm, reflecting a highly cooperative process. This suggests that in DANGER-enriched cells, Ca2+ is a major regulator of channel opening. DANGER occurs in numerous terminally differentiated tissues (data not shown), but its marked enrichment in cerebellar Purkinje cells is unique among neuronal lineages. IP3R in Purkinje cells are highly insensitive to IP3 (10Khodakhah K. Ogden D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Hernjak N.

This decreased sensitivity fits well with the influences we have observed of DANGER on IP3R channel function, which may reflect allosteric modulation of the Ca2+ inhibition site. Last, many of the proteins which have been demonstrated to bind to the IP3R have not been tested for their ability to alter IP3R activity over a large range of external Ca2+ concentrations. Thus it may be that regulation of IP3R Ca2+ dependence via IP3R binding partners may be a more common function than has been described previously. We thank Drs. R. E. Rothe, J. White, and M. Elliot for useful discussions."

The classical site of renin expression and secretion is the renal juxtaglomerular cell, where its expression is tightly regulated by physiological cues. An evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer located 11 kb upstream of the human RENIN gene has been reported to markedly enhance transcription in renin expressing cells in vitro. However, its importance in vivo remains unclear. We tested whether this enhancer is required for appropriate tissue- and cell-specific expression, or for physiological regulation of the human RENIN gene. To accomplish this, we used a retrofitting technique employing homologous recombination in bacteria to delete the enhancer from a 160-kb P1-artificial chromosome containing human RENIN, two upstream genes and one downstream gene, and then generated two lines of transgenic mice. We previously showed that human renin expression in transgenic mice containing the wild type construct is tightly regulated as is expression of the linked genes. Deletion of the enhancer had no effect on tissue-specific expression of human RENIN, but using the downstream gene as an internal control, found that human RENIN mRNA levels were 3-10-fold decreased compared with constructs containing the enhancer. Despite this decrease in expression, renin protein remained localized to renal juxtaglomerular cells and was appropriately regulated by cues that either increase or decrease expression of renin. Our results suggest that sequences other than the enhancer may be necessary for tissue-specific, cell-specific, and regulated expression of human RENIN.

Ang-II is an important regulator of cardiovascular function, stimulating vasoconstriction, cardiac output, aldosterone synthesis, and sympathetic activity, thereby directly and indirectly enhancing peripheral vascular resistance and renal tubular water and salt reabsorption. The critical importance of the RAS is evidenced by gene targeted ablation of the RAS genes in mice. The elimination of any RAS gene in mice causes cardiovascular consequences that include hypotension and renal insufficiency, and developmental consequences including postnatal lethality (1Kim H.S.

The cardiovascular and developmental defects can be complemented in mice by substitution of the mouse RAS with their human orthologs (5Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O.

In humans, genetic defects in the RAS were reported to cause renal tubular dysgenesis, hypotension, and early stillbirth (7Gribouval O. Gonzales M. Neuhaus T. Aziza J. Bieth E. Laurent N. Bouton J.M. Feuillet F. Makni S. Ben Amar H. Laube G. Delezoide A.L. Bouvier R. Dijoud F. Ollagnon-Roman E. Roume J. Joubert M. Antignac C. Gubler M.C. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consequently, both the mouse and human genetic data illustrate the importance of the system both developmentally and in adults. Renin is primarily expressed in renal juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole proximal to the glomerulus. Its expression is tightly regulated by renal baroreceptor, macula densa, β-adrenergic receptor, and Ang-II receptor-mediated mechanisms. For example, Ang-II elicits negative feedback on renin synthesis and secretion, whereas inhibition of Ang-II synthesis caused by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition increases renin synthesis. Despite our descriptive understanding of physiological cues that regulate renin expression, the molecular mechanisms operant in vivo remain unclear. Recent advances in the development of sophisticated mouse models is beginning to provide clues to understand the mechanisms regulating the RENIN gene. For example, using cell-specific cre-LoxP-mediated gene ablation, Chen et al. (8Chen L. Kim S.M. Oppermann M. Faulhaber-Walter R. Huang Y.G. Mizel D. Chen M. Sequeira Lopez M.L. Weinstein L.S. Gomez R.A. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Kim S.M. Oppermann M. Faulhaber-Walter R. Huang Y.G. Mizel D. Chen M. Sequeira Lopez M.L. Weinstein L.S. Gomez R.A. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). However, exactly what DNA sequences control the tissue-specific, cell-specific, and regulated expression of the RENIN gene in vivo remain unclear. Previous studies by us and others have identified a potent transcriptional enhancer 2.6 kb upstream of the mouse Renin (mRen) gene (9Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C.M. Jones C.A.

A sequence with 75-85% homology was also identified ∼6 kb upstream of the rat and 11-kb upstream of the human RENIN (hREN) gene (10Yan Y. Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ.

Detailed analysis of the enhancer using an immortalized renin-expressing JG cell line in vitro has led many to conclude that a minimum of 10 different transcription factors exhibiting either stimulatory and inhibitory effects on renin expression may bind to the enhancer (12Shi Q.

Consequently, this sequence becomes an important candidate as a major regulator of Renin expression. Recently, the Morris laboratory (22Adams D.J. Head G.A. Markus M.A. Lovicu F.J. van der Weyden L. Kontgen F. Arends M.J. Thiru S. Mayorov D.N. Morris B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31753-31761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using a gene targeted deletion of the mouse Renin enhancer, reported diminished levels of juxtaglomerular renin protein. Their conclusion that the enhancer is a critical regulator of Renin gene expression was made without defining the tissue-specific expression of renin or measuring the level of renal Renin mRNA. Moreover, their deletion, whereas encompassing the enhancer, extended 349 bp upstream and 137 bp downstream of the enhancer. The function of these additional 5′-flanking sequences remains unclear. We previously reported that transgenic mice carrying a 160-kb P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) encoding the hREN gene including 75 kb of upstream and 70 kb of downstream sequences exhibited appropriate tissue-specific, cell-specific, copy number proportional, and exquisitely regulated expression in response to cues that either stimulate or inhibit renin expression (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Sinn P.L. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of neighboring upstream (GOLT1A and KISS1) and downstream (ETNK2) genes also encoded on PAC160 were appropriately expressed (25Nistala R. Zhang X. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore to develop a robust experimental platform to accurately and completely assess the importance of the hREN enhancer in vivo, we used a PAC/BAC retrofitting technique to delete the kidney enhancer (termed KE) (26Nistala R. Sigmund C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We then characterized the expression and regulation of hREN in PAC160ΔKE transgenic mice using the neighboring genes as internal controls. This has major advantages over traditional promoter-reporter gene approaches that often suffer from ectopic expression due to position artifacts, exhibit variegated expression, highly variable expression not in proportion to copy number, and generally lack internal controls to normalize the level of transgene expression. We report herein a retention of appropriate tissue- and cell-specific expression and appropriate regulation of hREN even after deletion of the kidney enhancer. However, loss of the enhancer causes a 3-10-fold decrease in base-line hREN expression. We conclude that the enhancer is not required for appropriate spatial hREN expression but is required to maintain the normal level of base-line expression. Generation of the Kidney Enhancer-deficient PAC160 Construct—The PAC160 (Genome Systems control number 4917) was used as the template for deletion of the human kidney enhancer (KE) as previously reported (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Nistala R. Sigmund C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼500 bp upstream and downstream of the KE (KE-L and KE-R) were PCR amplified and cloned between two clusters of three adjacent χ-site sequences in the vector pRM4-N (27Jessen J.R. Meng A. McFarlane R.J. Paw B.H. Zon L.I. Smith G.R. Lin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5121-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Chi sequences are known to facilitate homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. The flanking sequences were designed to specifically delete the 241-bp KE (GenBank™ accession number AF140238) segment without altering adjacent sequences. Another PCR fragment was cloned containing a LoxP511-flanked chloramphenicol resistance (CAM) marker used for selection in bacteria. LoxP511 is a cre-recombinase recognizable heterotopic form of LoxP that does not recombine with the wild type LoxP site in the PAC160 parent vector. The LoxP511-CAM-LoxP511 was then inserted between KE-L and KE-R. The targeting construct was linearized and transformed to E. coli strain MC1061 containing the PAC160 with selection for kanamycin (on the PAC vector) and CAM resistance. Colonies were screened to ensure they were ampicillin sensitive. The PAC160ΔKE+CAM vector was isolated and subjected to battery of PCR and Southern blots to ensure faithful recombination. This vector was then transformed into E. coli strain BS591 (a gift of Brian Sauer), which constitutively expresses cre-recombinase, to excise the CAM gene. Kanamycin-resistant, CAM-sensitive colonies were selected for further analysis. The PAC160ΔKE vector was isolated and purified using the large construct DNA isolation kit from Qiagen. Again, this PAC was subjected to a number of PCR and Southern blot analysis to ensure fidelity of the KE deletion. Sequence analysis confirmed the precise replacement of the KE with a single LoxP511 site. PCR and Southern Blot Analysis of PAC160ΔKE Mice—Microinjection of PAC160ΔKE was performed by the University of Iowa Transgenic Animal Facility as described previously (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two lines of founder mice, 17853/2 (PAC160ΔKE2) and 26913/1 (PAC160ΔKE4), were initially identified by hREN-specific PCR. Spleen DNA from PAC160ΔKE and PAC160 control mice was isolated as described previously. 200 ng of genomic DNA was used for PCR. 10 or 20 μg of genomic DNA digested with HindIII or MscI was used for standard Southern blot hybridization. The hREN cDNA, KE, and KE-L probes were labeled with Rediprime II Random Primer Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—Mouse RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described by the manufacturer. The RPAIII Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to analyze the expression of hREN, mRen, ETNK2, and GOLT1A genes. The size of the protected fragments are 300, 326, 225, and 412 bases, respectively. Three different loading controls (Ambion) were used, 28S (115 nucleotides), β-actin (245 nucleotides), or cyclophilin (105 nucleotides). Total RNA (50 μg) was hybridized with 2 × 105 dpm of hREN, ETNK2, and GOLT1A probes, and 5 × 104 dpm of loading controls (28S, β-actin, and cyclophilin). RNase digestion was performed with RNase A and RNase T1 at a dilution of 1:75 for 45 min. Quantifications of RPA results were performed with PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Treatment of Transgenic Mice—Captopril was dissolved in the drinking water (0.5 mg/ml) and administered to mice for 10 days, whereas control mice were given only drinking water as the vehicle. For Ang-II treatment, all mice were first trained for 7 days for tail-cuff measurement of blood pressure using the BP-2000 apparatus (Visitech System Apex, NC). Systolic blood pressure was then measured for 4 consecutive days. Microosmotic mini-pumps (Alzet; model 1007D) were implanted subcutaneously in mice under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. The pumps contained either saline (vehicle) or a pressor dose (1000 ng/kg/min) of Ang-II (Sigma). Blood pressure was then measured for the next 5 days before sacrificing the mice. For each day of measurement, 10 practice cuff inflations were followed by 20-30 test inflations. Systolic blood pressure data were transferred to Excel, and any blood pressure datum outside the range of mean ± 2 S.D. was discarded before further statistics analysis. Kidneys were collected on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. All mice were fed with standard mouse chow (LM-485; Teklad Premier Laboratory Dies) and water ad libitum. Care and use of mice met the standard set forth by the National Institutes of Health and all procedures were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Antibodies against hREN or mREN were previously demonstrated for their specificity (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol.

Gross (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY), respectively. Two to seven mice for each line were perfused transcardially and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The kidneys were frozen in OCT compound and sectioned 5-8-μm thick using a Cryocut 1800 cryostat (Leica). Frozen kidney sections were incubated with hREN antibody (×1:250 dilution), then detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (×1:100 dilution, Pierce). To study the co-localization of hREN and endogenous mREN, antibodies to both renins were used with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (×1:40 dilution, Santa Cruz) and rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (×1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz). The images were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600) equipped with Spot advanced digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) or Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser confocal microscope. All photos in each experiment were taken with the same exposure. Image J (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe Photoshop were used to minimally process all figures. In most cases, brightness and contrast were increased until the biological tissue and background fluorescence could be clearly observed. The same setting was used on control and experimental sections. Statistical Analysis—All results were compared by Student's t test using the SigmaStat software (SPSS Scientific). Values are shown as mean ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To assess the contribution of the KE in the regulation of hREN gene expression we utilized homologous recombination in bacteria to accurately delete the KE sequence. This retrofitting strategy involved: 1) cloning short homologous segments (500 bp) upstream (KE-L) and downstream (KE-R) of the target deletion; 2) the use of an easily selectable marker (CAM) for recombination in bacteria; 3) heterotopic LoxP511 sites that can facilitate cre-mediated recombination with each other but not with the wild type LoxP present in the PAC parent vector; and 4) χ-sites to facilitate homologous recombination in E. coli. Bacterial cells containing the PAC160 vector were transformed with the targeting vector, recombinants were selected, and the CAM gene was then removed by propagation in bacteria expressing cre-recombinase (Fig. 1). This strategy deleted the KE, leaving a single LoxP511 site as a footprint of the deletion (Fig. 1C). PAC160ΔKE recombinant clones shown to faithfully delete the KE were identified and characterized by a series of PCR, Southern blot, sequencing, and fingerprint experiments (26Nistala R. Sigmund C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Four transgenic lines containing PAC160ΔKE were initially identified by PCR using primers within hREN. Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested genomic DNA using an hREN cDNA as probe indicated that all four lines contained the entire hREN gene (Fig. 2), but only two (ΔKE2 and ΔKE4) were shown to be fully intact when the Southern blot was probed either with the entire PAC160, or a probe derived from GOLT1A (data not shown). PAC160ΔKE2 and PAC160ΔKE4 were also found to contain an intact copy of the chorionic enhancer, a sequence located ∼5 kb upstream of the transcription start site that was reported to be active in choriodecidual cells (30Germain S. Bonnet F. Philippe J. Fuchs S. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25292-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but has little homology with sequences upstream of the mouse or rat renin genes. To verify the absence of the KE in transgenic mice carrying PAC160ΔKE2 and PAC160ΔKE4, we first performed PCR using primers inside the KE-L and KE-R homology and analyzed the sequence. Sequence analysis clearly showed a faithful deletion of the KE and replacement with a single LoxP511 site. We next performed Southern blot analysis using DNA flanking the KE (KE-L) as a probe. As expected, a higher molecular weight band was identified in both PAC160ΔKE transgenic lines consistent with loss of a MscI site in the enhancer (Fig. 2C, top). When the blot was stripped and reprobed with a KE probe, bands were detected in the wild type PAC160 mice, but not the PAC160ΔKE mice, nor the non-transgenic controls (Fig. 2C, bottom). We next examined the tissue-specific expression of hREN in PAC160 transgenic mice retaining an intact KE and in both lines of mice lacking the KE. To accomplish this, we performed multiplex RNase protection assays using probes to hREN, 28S, and two neighboring genes ethanolamine kinase 2 (ETNK2) and Golgi transport 1 homolog A (GOLT1A) that exhibit overlapping but distinct tissue-specific expression profiles (Fig. 3). This provided a mechanism to not only assess the effect of the KE on hREN, but also on its neighboring genes, as well as to provide an internal control in the occurrence that loss of the KE dramatically affected the level of hREN expression. In wild type PAC160 mice, hREN expression was evident in kidney and to a much lower content in lung. Consistent with our previous report, ETNK2 was abundantly expressed in the kidney, liver, and testes (25Nistala R. Zhang X. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas GOLT1A was primarily expressed in the liver and at lower levels in kidney, brain, and lung. Deletion of the KE did not dramatically alter the tissue specificity of any of the three genes examined. Expression of renal hREN was lowest in PAC160ΔKE2 that exists in 1-2 copies per genome, and higher in PAC160ΔKE4, which exists in several copies per genome. Although the KE appears dispensable for appropriate tissue-specific expression of hREN (and its closely linked genes), a comparison of the ratio of renal hREN to ETNK2 expression in the PAC160ΔKE2 and PAC160ΔKE4 lines suggested diminished expression of hREN compared with wild type PAC160 mice. To formally test the possibility that loss of the enhancer diminishes the level of base-line hREN mRNA, we evaluated hREN expression in kidney samples from a line of PAC160 (line 2, n = 10) and PAC160ΔKE (line 4, n = 9) that exhibit similar levels of ETNK2 (one of two internal controls). RPA analysis clearly shows equivalent levels of ETNK2 and cyclophillin, but lower levels of hREN in kidney RNA from PAC160ΔKE4 mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Quantification of the results shows a 2.8-fold decrease in hREN mRNA when compared with either cyclophillin or ETNK2 (Fig. 4, C and D). A comparison of the hREN/ETNK2 ratio of PAC160ΔKE4 with another line of wild type PAC160 mice similarly revealed a 2.7-fold decrease in hREN expression (Fig. 4E). Because the copy number PAC160ΔKE2 is significantly lower than that in either line of PAC160 wild type mice, we compared the ratio of hREN/ETNK2 with a line of PAC140 wild type mice that has a similar copy number. The PAC140 construct is similar to PAC160, exhibits copy number dependent expression, but differs in the extent of flanking sequences (75 kb upstream and 70 kb downstream in PAC160 versus 35 kb upstream and 90 kb downstream in PAC140) (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this comparison, loss of the KE caused an 11-fold decrease in base-line hREN expression suggesting that the loss of the KE may be greater in mice with fewer copies of the transgene (Fig. 4F). To address whether the KE is required for JG cell-specific expression of hREN we performed immunohistochemistry for mouse and human renin using antisera specific to each (23Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Lavoie J.L. Lake-Bruse K.D. Sigmund C.D. Am. J.

Investig. 2002; 109: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). JG cell-specific co-expression of both mouse and human renin was clearly demonstrated in kidney from wild type PAC160 (Fig. 5, A-C) and in the higher copy number PAC160ΔKE4 (Fig. 5, D-F). Because the expression of renal hREN mRNA was lower in PAC160ΔKE2 we performed immunohistochemistry for human renin alone to avoid misinterpreting a carry over signal from the higher mouse renin. A low level of human renin, likely in a single JG cell per positive JG apparatus was detected in PAC160ΔKE2 mice (Fig. 6, B, and C, arrows), but not in kidney sections from non-transgenic littermate controls (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the level of human renin, the number of positive JG cells per apparatus, and the number of positively labeled JG apparatuses was increased in PAC160ΔKE2 mice treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril (Fig. 6, E and F), but not in Captopril-treated controls (Fig. 6D). Similarly, there was an increase in the level and number of JG cells labeled by mouse and human renin in PAC160 wild type (Fig. 7, D-F) and PAC160ΔKE4 mice treated with Captopril (Fig. 7, G-I), whereas no human renin signal was detected in Captopril-treated non-transgenic mice (Fig. 7B). We quantified the induction of renal mRen and hREN mRNA of vehicle and Captopril-treated mice (Fig. 8). Captopril caused a significant induction of both mRen (3.75-, 6.2-, and 3.5-fold) and hREN (5.0-, 7.4-, and 9.9-fold) mRNA in PAC160, PAC160ΔKE4, and PAC160ΔKE2, respectively.FIGURE 6Immunostaining of human renin in kidney.

Spred-1 is expressed predominantly in adult brain (9Engelhardt C.M. Bundschu K. Messerschmitt M. Renne T. Walter U. Reinhard M. Schuh K. Histochem.

Spred-2 expression was rare in fetal tissues but mostly ubiquitous in adults, whereas an especially strong expression was seen in neural tissues and different glandular epithelia (9Engelhardt C.M.

Mammalian VASP was first characterized in platelets as a proline-rich substrate of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (11Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additional members of the Ena/VASP family are the Drosophila Enabled (Ena), its mammalian homologue Mena (mammalian Enabled), the C. elegans homologue unc34, and the murine Evl (Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like) (12Haffner C.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In general, the EVH1 domain is followed by a central proline-rich region responsible for interaction with Src homology 3 domains and profilins (compiled in Ref. 15Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U.

Because of their important role in actin cytoskeleton organization, members of the Ena/VASP family are expressed most likely in almost all mammalian cell types (11Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J.

VASP is associated to actin filaments and localized in focal adhesion complexes, dynamic membrane regions, leading membrane areas of non-epithelial cells, and cell/cell contacts of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (12Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).

The N-terminal regions of Sprouty proteins are astonishingly variable, but they contain a conserved SH2 domain binding motif (NXYXXXP) including a central tyrosine residue (Tyr-55 in Sprouty2) (26Guy G.R.

Recently, structural information on the Spred EVH1 domain revealed that this domain adopts, like the other EVH1 domains, a pleckstrin homology fold (48Zimmermann J. Jarchau T. Walter U. Oschkinat H.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, for the Spred EVH1 domain a different induced fit peptide binding mechanism has been proposed even in the absence of a characterized ligand for this domain (48Zimmermann J. Jarchau T. Walter U. Oschkinat H. Ball L.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 435-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 49Harmer N.J. Sivak J.M. Amaya E. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which makes the identification of binding partners a point of major interest (Fig. 1).KBD—KBD in the middle part of the Spred proteins consists of about 50 amino acids (amino acids 234–286) and is not related to any previously identified tyrosine kinase interaction domains (5Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Spred-3 with a non-functional KBD and deletion mutants of Spred-1 in this region revealed that this internal region is involved but not essential for ERK suppression (2Kato R. Nonami A. Taketomi T.

This raises the question of what the physiological function of this domain might be.SPR—Spred and Sprouty proteins harbor a well conserved cysteine-rich SPR domain at the C terminus. In the case of Spred-2, it is required for efficient suppression of stem cell factor-induced ERK phosphorylation and suppression of hematopoietic cell development (51Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. Taga T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A C-terminal deletion mutant of Spred-1 was shown to act as a dominant negative form and augments growth factor-induced ERK activation (5Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K.

Therefore, future work has to be done, elucidating the physiological function of the SPR domain.The SPR domain of Spred and Sprouty proteins is thought to be palmitoylated and necessary for membrane localization after growth factor stimulation (2Kato R.

Additionally, the minimal membrane-targeting region of the SPR domain in both protein families is necessary and sufficient for plasma membrane localization and binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (37Lim J.

Moreover, mutations disrupting this region interfere with their functions in modulating cell migration, cell proliferation, and ERK/MAPK activation (52Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat.

All four mammalian Sprouty proteins are able to form hetero- and homo-oligomers via their C-terminal SPR domain (54Ozaki K. Miyazaki S. Tanimura S. Kohno M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and although each of the Sprouty isoforms by itself inhibits growth factor-induced activation of the ERK pathway, hetero-oligomers show a more pronounced inhibitory activity (54Ozaki K. Miyazaki S. Tanimura S. Kohno M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, Spred-1 and Spred-2 were also presented to form heterodimers via their SPR domains, which increases the variety of regulatory possibilities (47King J.A. Straffon A.F. D'Abaco G.M. Poon C.L.

They were constitutively associated with Ras, but the inhibitory effect was exerted by suppressing the phosphorylation and activation of Raf (5Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). King et al. (47King J.A. Straffon A.F. D'Abaco G.M. Poon C.L. I S.T.

Spreds are potent inhibitors of a wide range of mitogenic stimuli like different growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, but the suppressing effect seems to be restricted to the Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway (2Kato R.

Spred-1–/– and Spred-2–/– mice revealed that these proteins are not existentially necessary for fertility and development, and young adult mice are viable and show no apparent abnormalities (56Bundschu K. Knobeloch K.P. Ullrich M. Schinke T. Amling M. Engelhardt C.M. Renne T. Walter U. Schuh K. J. Biol.

However, loss of functional Spred-2 protein causes a dwarf phenotype, similar to hypochondroplasia, a common form of human dwarfism (56Bundschu K. Knobeloch K.P. Ullrich M. Schinke T. Amling M.

In this context, Spred-2 seems to be an important modulator of bone morphogenesis by inhibiting the fibroblast growth factor-induced MAPK pathway (56Bundschu K. Knobeloch K.P. Ullrich M. Schinke T.

A similar phenotype was also mentioned for Spred-1–/– mice (57Inoue H. Kato R. Fukuyama S. Nonami A. Taniguchi K. Matsumoto K. Nakano T. Tsuda M. Matsumura M. Kubo M. Ishikawa F. Moon B.G. Takatsu K.

Med. 2005; 201: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), underlining the role of Spred proteins in growth regulation and supporting the idea of overlapping physiological functions. Furthermore, Spreds seem to be important for hematopoiesis. In Spred-2–/– midgestation mouse embryos, Spred-2 suppresses hematopoietic processes by inhibiting MAPK activation (51Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. Taga T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and stem cell factor or interleukin 3 stimulation of mature Spred-1–/– bone marrow-derived mast cells resulted in increased cell proliferation and MAPK activation (50Nonami A.

Therefore, Spred-2 could serve as a negative regulator of embryonic (51Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. Taga T. J. Exp.

Much of what is known relates to the tyrosine, threonine, and serine phosphatases, whereas the histidine phosphatases have not been studied as much. The structure of phosphohistidine phosphatase (PHPT1), the first identified eukaryotic-protein histidine phosphatase, has been determined to a resolution of 1.9Å using multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. This enzyme can dephosphorylate a variety of proteins (e.g. ATP-citrate lyase and the β-subunit of G proteins). A putative active site has been identified by its electrostatic character, ion binding, and conserved protein residues. Histidine 53 is proposed to play a major role in histidine dephosphorylation based on these observations and previous mutational studies.

Histidine 53 is proposed to play a major role in histidine dephosphorylation based on these observations and previous mutational studies. Models of peptide binding are discussed to suggest possible mechanisms for substrate recognition. Reversible phosphorylation of residues is crucial in a variety of signaling pathways. Most of our understanding regarding these signaling events in eukaryotes comes from tyrosine, serine/threonine kinases, and phosphatases (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Less well characterized is histidine phosphorylation-dependent signaling in eukaryotes. A little more than thirty years ago, Histone H4, the first vertebrate protein with a phosphorylated histidine residue, was identified (2Chen C.C. Smith D.L. Bruegger B.B. Halpern R.M. Smith R.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since then there has been a measured increase in knowledge of mammalian histidine kinases (3Besant P.G. Attwood P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, very little information regarding eukaryotic histidine phosphatases has been available during this same period. This nescience is interesting because histidine phosphorylation is quite prevalent in the cell and likely accounts for ∼6% of all phosphorylation in eukaryotes (4Matthews H.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus far, only one protein (the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins) in vertebrates has been identified as undergoing reversible histidine phosphorylation where both the kinase (NDPK B) and phosphatase (PHPT1) 2The abbreviations used are: PHPT, phosphohistidine phosphatase; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase. 2The abbreviations used are: PHPT, phosphohistidine phosphatase; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase. are known (for a recent review, see Ref. 5Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, more information regarding histidine phosphatases is slowly beginning to emerge. To date, the only other structure of a histidine phosphatase is Escherichia coli SixA (6Hamada K. Kato M. Shimizu T. Ihara K. Mizuno T. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Under certain anaerobic respiratory conditions, SixA is involved in down-regulation of the E. coli ArcB-to-ArcA phosphorelay system. SixA shows structural homology to the well studied family of arginine-histidine-glycine (RHG) phosphatases (6Hamada K. Kato M. Shimizu T. Ihara K. Mizuno T. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but no sequence homology to PHPT1.Mammalian phosphohistidine phosphatase (PHPT1) was first identified and characterized as a 14-kDa protein in 2002 (7Klumpp S.

Zetterqvist O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enzyme can dephosphorylate the phosphohistidine-containing peptide succinyl-Ala-His(P)-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, E. coli cheA, rabbit ATP-citrase lyase, and the rat β-subunit of G proteins (7Klumpp S.

Commun. 2005; 334: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PHPT1 has been suggested to be highly involved in neuronal function. Unlike most phosphatases it does not require divalent cations for activity. Individual point mutations of conserved histidine and arginine residues determined that Arg45, His53, and His102 may play a role in the reaction mechanism as a result of eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity when mutated to alanines (11Ma R. Kanders E. Sundh U.B. Geng M. Ek P. Zetterqvist O. Li J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PHPT1 is expressed in a variety of vertebrates but not in fungi or bacteria. The PHPT1 DNA sequence shows similarity to testes-specific proteins in Drosophila, ocnus, janus-a, and janus-b, according to the Conserved Domain Data Base (12Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B.

These proteins may be phosphatases, but little information is available on their function. In this work, we report the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic phosphohistidine phosphatase: PHPT1. The structure enables us to define a substrate-binding pocket and to model possible phosphatase-substrate docking modes. We thereby provide the structural basis for further biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies in the rapidly developing field of eukaryotic phosphohistidine signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—Residues 5–125 of the human PHPT1 gene (gi: 19353099) were cloned by ligation-independent cloning into a pET-28 based expression vector incorporating a TEV-cleavable N-terminal His-tag fusion (pNIC-Bsa4). After transformation and liquid culture growth using standard methods, recombinant expression of PHPT1 was induced at 291 K by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to either Terrific broth for expression of native protein or minimal medium for selenomethionine incorporation according to the methionine pathway inhibition method (13Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). After harvest PHTP1 was purified using IMAC on a 1 ml HiTrap chelating HP column followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (columns from GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Initial crystal screening with selenomethionine-derivatized protein using commercial screens gave hits in several salt conditions. After optimization, large rhombohedral crystals could be obtained by mixing protein solution (15 mg/ml) with an equal volume of reservoir (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Bistris, pH 5.5). Crystals were swept into a reservoir with 15% butanediol and then dunked in liquid nitrogen. The data were indexed in space group R3 with unit cell parameters a = b = 228 Å, c = 29.4 Å. Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data (Table 1) were collected around the selenium K-edge at Beamline 14.1 (BESSY II, Berlin, Germany). XDS/XSCALE (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar) was used to process the data and put the three data sets on an approximately similar scale. XPREP (Bruker AXS) were used to prepare FA-values for substructure solution in SHELXD (15Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) that found 10 of the possible 12 sites. Identified sites were used for phase calculation in SHARP (16de La Fortelle E.

The resulting map could be partially autotraced using ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Unfortunately, only one of the four protomers in the asymmetric unit was well ordered and numerous attempts with different refinement protocols failed to give acceptable residuals. Since twinning is common in space group R3, twinned refinement was attempted with different operators but did not improve residuals or the quality of difference maps.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsNative R3, small cellPeakSe-Met R3 remoteInflectionData collectionWavelength (Å)1.0330.97980.953730.97997Resolution (Å)30-1.9 (2.0-1.9)30-2.0 (2.1-2.0)30-2.0 (2.1-2.0)30-2.0 (2.1-2.0)Completeness (%)97.5 (88.8)96.9 (88.2)98.1 (99.0)96.4 (85.7)〈I/σ(I) 〉20.62 (6.47)11.61 (3.85)11.71 (3.72)9.7 (3.28)Rsym (%)5.6 (22.6)6.3 (29.4)5.6 (23.1)6.1 (26.8)RefinementResolution (Å)21.3-1.9 (2.0-1.9)Reflections (unique/observed)10,665/60,03075,450/208,92076,343/214,27674,707/165,905Rcryst (%)ar = Σ|Fobs - Fcalc|/ΣFobs.17.1 (19.4)Rfree (%)ar = Σ|Fobs - Fcalc|/ΣFobs.22.5 (24.4)r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.020Bond angles (°)1.8Average B-factors (Å2)24.4Ramachandran statistics (%)bFraction of residues favored and allowed according to the definition used in MolProbity (3).98.5, 1.5Number of atomsProtein985Water59Formate51a r = Σ|Fobs - Fcalc|/ΣFobs.b Fraction of residues favored and allowed according to the definition used in MolProbity (3Besant P.G.

Open table in a new tab A search for alternative crystal forms was initialized with native protein (23 mg/ml). Both protein with and without intact His-tag was used in this screening process. A new crystal form was obtained in 2.0 m sodium formate, 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 7.0. After optimization, the best diffracting crystals were grown in 1.9 m sodium formate, 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 6.5, at room temperature in 2 days by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Diffraction data were collected to 1.9 Å (λ = 1.033 Å) on a PHPT1 crystal at Beamline ID29 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). The data were indexed in space group R3 with unit cell parameters a = b = 112.5 Å, c = 29.4 Å. In the new crystal form, there is only one PHPT1 molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were processed using XDS/XSCALE (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). The large cell model was used as the starting model to obtain a molecular replacement solution using MOLREP (18Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar). The resulting model was improved through several rounds of model building and refinement in Coot (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. 2004; D60: 2126-2132Crossref Scopus (22781) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (18Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar). Progress of the refinement was monitored by the free R factor for 5% of the data (20Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). The final model consisted of 100 amino acid residues, 17 formate ions, and 59 waters. The N-terminal His-tag and linker (17 residues), residues 31–38, and the last three C-terminal amino acids are not visible in the structure. The final residuals for this model were r = 17.1% and Rfree = 22.5%.Structural Similarity Searches—DALI (21Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar) was used to determine the closest structural neighbors of PHPT1. The top five structures based on statistical significance (Z-score cutoff of 3.3) were aligned and compared with PHPT1.Modeling of Ligands—The peptides succinyl-Ala-His(P)-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, Met-Gly-His(P)-Ala-Gly-Ala-Ile, and Tyr-Ser-His(P)-Asp-Asn-Ile-Ile-Cys-Gly were modeled into the putative active site using the Molegro virtual docker (22Thomsen R. Christensen M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The sequences with phosphorylated histidines MGHAGAI and YSHDNIICG were chosen based on the conserved sequence among succinyl-CoA synthetases and its structure (23Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and a loop between two β-strands in the β-subunit of the G protein transducin structure (24Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), respectively. In the case of the β-subunit of the G protein transducin peptide, the histidine was modeled as phosphorylated on the Nϵ2 position. Typical docking runs consisted of docking a single ligand with the PHPT1 protein with no solvent molecules. The search algorithm typically used default values for 5–10 runs. In some cases the population size was increased from 50 to 100. Multiple poses were returned for each run and those with phosphohistidines near His53 were considered potential ligands.Protein Structure Accession Numbers—The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics under Protein Data Bank code 2HW4.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructural Model—PHPT1 is a 125-amino acid human cytostolic protein that folds into a compact elbow-shaped molecule of a mixed α/β fold with novel topology (Fig. 1, A and B). The molecule is defined by six β-strands flanked by two α-helices. A single helix and three strands lie approximately perpendicular to each other near the base of the molecule. There are two central anti-parallel β-strands (β2 and β4) that extend the full length of the protein. On either side of these strands are two sets of parallel β-strands (β1, β3 and β5, β6). The core of the protein is defined by this β-sheet and the N-terminal histidine tag extends from it. Electron density for the tag was partly not interpretable so it was not modeled, but it is likely required for crystallization because of the numerous crystal contacts that is formed with this extended strand. On the surface there is a positively charged pocket that consists of conserved residues (Fig. 2, A and B). This area is a potential site for phosphatase activity because of its positive surface charge. The cavity volume is ∼30 Å3 and found at the base of the molecule (Fig. 1C). Two individual amino acid substitutions to alanine resulted in the loss of phosphatase activity (11Ma R. Kanders E. Sundh U.B. Geng M. Ek P. Zetterqvist O. Li J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These mutations, His53 → Ala and His102 → Ala, map to this region of the enzyme. Additionally, many identical and conserved residues of orthologous proteins define this basic patch and surrounding atoms (Fig. 1D). Formate and sulfate ions are found in this pocket in both the small and large cell structures, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Both ions bind in similar locations near His53 in the positive patch but form a binding network distinct from one another. This arrangement suggests there may be multiple ways to bind substrates within the active site based on their size and charge. In total, 17 formate ions solvate PHPT1. Some of these ions are bound to surfaces distinct from the active site.FIGURE 2The putative active site. A, solid surface representation of the proposed active site with five formate ions. B, solid surface representation of the proposed active site with five sulfate ions. The colors indicate positive (blue) and negative (red) electrostatic potential at the solvent accessible surface. The electrostatic calculations were done with APBS (32Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ligand (magenta) is hydrogen-bonded to His53, Arg78, and Tyr93. Residues labeled in purple and black are for the ligand and PHPT1, respectively. In both cases, the histidine in the ligand is phosphorylated at the Nϵ2 position. The nitrogen (Nδ1 or Nϵ2) of His53 that interacted with substrate varied within each set of docking solutions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A DALI (21Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar) search revealed that the closest structural neighbors of PHPT1 in the Protein Data Bank are of no apparent relation. Polyphosphate kinase (Z score = 4.3, r.m.s.d. 3.1 Å over 74 Cα atoms), PurS (Z score = 3.4, r.m.s.d. 2.4 Å over 50 atoms), and plasma gelsolin (Z score = 3.4, r.m.s.d. 2.8 Å over 63 atoms) were the most similar. Weak structural homology to SixA (6Hamada K. Kato M. Shimizu T. Ihara K. Mizuno T. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is found in the central β-sheet with 23 Cα atoms superimposable within a distance of 3.8 Å.Active Site—The residues that define the active site are Lys21, Glu51, Tyr52, His53, Arg78, Tyr93, and Met95 (Fig. 2C). Almost all of these residues are identical in orthologous proteins among the animal kingdom. Therefore, these residues likely contribute important structural features to maintain the phosphatase activity of the enzyme. The active site residue His53 is located at the beginning of helix α1; near this residue, two formate ions and two water molecules form an intricate hydrogen bonding network. A total of five formate molecules are found in a pocket near His53. The pocket is defined by two loops; Glu51 and Tyr52 on a loop joining helix α1 and β-strand β4 define one side of the pocket while Tyr93 and Met95 on a loop between β5 and α2 define the other side. Furthermore, Arg78 is found in the middle of the β4 strand and may be involved in coordinating the phosphate group. The Arg78 → Ala mutant resulted in a 30% decrease in activity (11Ma R. Kanders E. Sundh U.B. Geng M. Ek P. Zetterqvist O. Li J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting it does play a role in phosphatase substrate recognition or catalysis. There are three conserved glycines immediately upstream of Arg78; these glycines offer Arg78 a great deal of conformational flexibility, presumably needed in substrate recognition and catalysis. Furthermore, in a scenario where substrate interacts with Arg78, the nearby glycine-rich region may flex so that a tightening of the pocket around the peptide substrate occurs. Close to Arg78, Lys21 is located in the middle of the β2 strand and is involved in hydrogen bonding to a formate ion. In the pocket, only Arg78 and Lys21 are found on β-strands. These residues may act as anchors and assist in coordination of the phosphohistidine to the active site. It is not known whether the Nδ1 or Nϵ2 of the imidazole ring of His53 is involved in dephosphorylation and it is unfortunately not clear from the structure in what orientation the imidazole ring should be positioned. From a conformational standpoint, as the side chain of His53 projects radially from its turning backbone with the imidazole pointing downward the bottom of the active site pocket, a substrate Nδ1 interaction is most likely. Interestingly, His53 is calculated to have a pKa of 3.13 using PROPKA (25Li H. Robertson A.D. Jensen J.H. Proteins. 2005; 61: 704-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that His53 is not protonated at the Nϵ2 position in the crystallization solution and in the physiological context.Substrate Binding—ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) is a substrate for PHPT1 and it has been suggested that PHPT1 dephosphorylates phospho-His760 (9Klumpp S.

Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69041) Google Scholar) search revealed that a conserved domain (SucD, succinyl-CoA α-subunit) is found from residues 649–777 of human ACL. The histidine maps to this domain and sequence analysis show that this residue and adjacent residues (GHAGA) are highly conserved among higher eukaryotes (data not shown). The structure of this subunit contains a phosphorylated histidine at residue His259 (23Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This amino acid corresponds to His760 in CLUSTALW (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55173) Google Scholar) sequence alignments of the succinyl-CoA α-subunit with ACL. This residue is found on an extended loop of 22 residues between two α-helices near the surface of the protein. Considering the length and makeup of the loop, it is entirely possible that it is flexible and could bind in the pocket of PHPT1 (Fig. 2D).The β-subunit of G proteins is phosphorylated on histidine residue 266 (28Kowluru A.

Krieglstein J. Klumpp S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structure of the β-subunit (24Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) shows this residue in a surface loop of eight amino acids connecting two β-strands. This small loop is modeled in the pocket of PHPT1 (Fig. 2E). In these two cases it appears that some rearrangement of these loops would be required for the substrate to bind in the pocket. It is unclear if there are additional sites of binding separate from the active site. The binding pocket of PHPT1 can accommodate a variety of ligands and studies are in place to assess possible inhibitors and binding partners that should allow for the mechanism of action to be discerned.The structure of PHPT1 is the first glimpse at a eukaryotic histidine phosphatase. The protein is of a novel topology, and the structure reveals a positively charged active site defined by conserved residues that provide a suitable environment for binding phosphohistidine-containing substrates. His53 is proposed to be involved with the phosphatase activity of this enzyme. Furthermore, Arg78 and Lys21 may act as anchors to provide a stable scaffold for substrate and phosphohistidine interactions as well as provide a possibility for charge stabilization of transition states in the catalytic reaction. Future challenges include investigation of co-crystal structures with target peptides to understand in detail the structural basis for substrate recognition and catalysis. Reversible phosphorylation of residues is crucial in a variety of signaling pathways. Most of our understanding regarding these signaling events in eukaryotes comes from tyrosine, serine/threonine kinases, and phosphatases (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Less well characterized is histidine phosphorylation-dependent signaling in eukaryotes. A little more than thirty years ago, Histone H4, the first vertebrate protein with a phosphorylated histidine residue, was identified (2Chen C.C. Smith D.L. Bruegger B.B. Halpern R.M. Smith R.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since then there has been a measured increase in knowledge of mammalian histidine kinases (3Besant P.G. Attwood P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, very little information regarding eukaryotic histidine phosphatases has been available during this same period. This nescience is interesting because histidine phosphorylation is quite prevalent in the cell and likely accounts for ∼6% of all phosphorylation in eukaryotes (4Matthews H.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus far, only one protein (the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins) in vertebrates has been identified as undergoing reversible histidine phosphorylation where both the kinase (NDPK B) and phosphatase (PHPT1) 2The abbreviations used are: PHPT, phosphohistidine phosphatase; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase. 2The abbreviations used are: PHPT, phosphohistidine phosphatase; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase. are known (for a recent review, see Ref. 5Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, more information regarding histidine phosphatases is slowly beginning to emerge. To date, the only other structure of a histidine phosphatase is Escherichia coli SixA (6Hamada K. Kato M. Shimizu T. Ihara K. Mizuno T. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Under certain anaerobic respiratory conditions, SixA is involved in down-regulation of the E. coli ArcB-to-ArcA phosphorelay system. SixA shows structural homology to the well studied family of arginine-histidine-glycine (RHG) phosphatases (6Hamada K. Kato M. Shimizu T. Ihara K. Mizuno T. Hakoshima T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but no sequence homology to PHPT1. Mammalian phosphohistidine phosphatase (PHPT1) was first identified and characterized as a 14-kDa protein in 2002 (7Klumpp S. Hermesmeier J. Selke D. Baumeister R. Kellner R. Krieglstein J. J. Cereb.

The enzyme can dephosphorylate the phosphohistidine-containing peptide succinyl-Ala-His(P)-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, E. coli cheA, rabbit ATP-citrase lyase, and the rat β-subunit of G proteins (7Klumpp S.

We report a JLNS causing mutation of the KCNQ1 gene and show that at the border from exon 1 to intron 1 the position of the first intronic nucleotide, nearly always a guanine followed by a thymidine (14Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar), is replaced by adenine (G477 + 1A). This altered splice donor site is associated with a splice error. Skipping of exon 1 caused a frameshift that introduces a premature translational termination codon leading to the expression of truncated KCNQ1 potassium channel subunits. Functional analysis in Xenopus oocytes revealed that mutant subunits exert strong dominant-negative effects on IKs currents supposed to induce JLNS symptoms in heterozygous individuals. These results are really exciting, because a variety of clinical manifestations has been linked to the heterozygous state of mutations at the splice donor site of exon 1 (G477 + 1A; G477 + 5A; G477 + 5C; this work, Refs. 15Ackerman M.J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that abolish suppression of IKs currents by mutant KCNQ1 subunits. Subjects—Our study is based on a three-generation family of German origin comprising two symptomatic individuals affected by profound sensorineural deafness and a prolonged QTc interval (Fig. 1). The subjects of this family underwent detailed clinical and cardiovascular examination, including a 12-lead ECG. The QT intervals were measured on the ECG in lead II or V5 and corrected for heart rate by the use of the Bazett formula. The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Mutation Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of the available family members using the genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) in accordance with manufacturer's protocol. The PCR primers (22Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Lehmann M.H. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) W33 (ATGGGAGAGGCCGTGATGCTGAC) and W34 (ATCCAGCCATGCCCTCAGATGC) were used to amplify exon 1 of the human KCNQ1 gene. The PCR reaction mix contained 50 ng DNA as template, 25 pm concentration of each primer, 200 μm 4-dNTP, 1 units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at room temperature, 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 50 μl. The DNA was denatured by exposing to 95 °C for 5 min and then amplified for 35 cycles in a Hybaid Omnigene Temperature Cycler. Each cycle consisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 s, an annealing step at 61 °C for 15 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 45 s. For single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, PCR products were separated on a 5-15% polyacrylamide gradient gel using a Multiphor II electrophoresis system and visualized by silver staining (23Zehelein J. Thomas D. Khalil M. Wimmer A.B. Koenen M. Licka M. Wu K. Kiehn J. Brockmeier K. Kreye V.A. Karle C.A. Katus H.A. Ulmer H.E. Schoels W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 4RT-PCR of RNA Isolated from Whole Blood Cells—Total RNA (∼10 μg) was isolated out of 2.5 ml whole blood (PAXgene kit, Qiagen) and 1 μg was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primer. The PCR primers KCNQ1-433 (GCCGCGTCTACAACTTCCTC) and LQT201 (24Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (ATGGAAATGGGCTTCCGGGCAAAGCGC) were applied to amplify a KCNQ1-isoform 1 wild type cDNA fragment of 277bp respectively the mutant isoform 1 derived cDNA fragment of 186bp lacking exon 1. Following denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 35 PCR cycles were performed on a Temperature Cycler (MWG Biotech) with a 1-min denaturation step at 95 °C, a 1-min annealing step at 58 °C, and a 1-min extension step at 72 °C. Normal and aberrant PCR products were subcloned and characterized by DNA sequence analysis of both strands (23Zehelein J. Thomas D. Khalil M. Wimmer A.B. Koenen M. Licka M. Wu K. Kiehn J.

Heterologous Gene Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—All protocols for animal use were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institute of Health (NIH Publication number 85-23, revised 1996) and the European Community guidelines for the use of experimental animals. cRNA of KCNE1, KCNQ1-iso1, KCNQ1-iso2, and their mutants, KCNQ1-iso1M and KCNQ1-iso2M, were synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V-VI defolliculated Xenopus oocytes were injected with the same total amounts of cRNA coding for the mutant or wild type potassium channel subunits. Electrophysiology and Statistics—Potassium channel expression was determined 2-3 days after cRNA injection by two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings from X. laevis oocytes. Whole-cell recordings were performed using a Warner OC-725A amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for data acquisition and analysis. Data were low pass filtered at 0.2 kHz (-3 db, 4-pole Bessel filter) before digitalization at 1 kHz. Microelectrodes had a tip resistance ranging from 1 to 5 mΩ. Voltage clamp measurements were performed in a solution containing (in mm): 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl solution, and the recording chamber was continually perfused. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-22 °C). No leak subtraction was done during the experiments. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. unless otherwise specified (25Thomas D. Wimmer A.B. Karle C.A. Licka M. Alter M. Khalil M. Ulmer H.E. Kathofer S. Kiehn J. Katus H.A. Schoels W. Koenen M. Zehelein J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Subunit Expression and Immunohistochemistry—COS-1 cells (2 × 104) were grown on fibronectin coated coverslips in DMEM with penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and fetal calf serum (Pan Biotech) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen) and 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA encoding wild type or mutant KCNQ1 subunits FLAG-tagged at their C terminus. Plasmids were generated by cloning of the appropriate DNA fragments into the pFLAG-CMV-5.1 vector (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and nitrogen-fixed according to Neuhaus et al. (26Neuhaus E.M. Horstmann H. Almers W. Maniak M. Soldati T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG antibody staining was performed at 4°C over night using a 1:1000 dilution of the affinity-purified monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in 2% BSA/PBS. After washing with PBS (2 × 30 min), coverslips were incubated overnight in 2% BSA/PBS at 4 °C with a 1:500 diluted secondary antibody (MFP 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes) in 2% BSA/PBS. Coverslips were washed in PBS (2 × 30 min) and mounted in Citifluor AF2 (Plano). Clinical and Genetic Characterization—The index patient, a now 17-year-old boy, was diagnosed with congenital deafness at the age of 10 months. Further diagnosis revealed a prolonged QTc of 0.56 s (Fig. 1, patient III.2, closed square). Treatment with propranolol was started. Because of side effects the dosage had been reduced. In the following years recurrent syncopes occurred in association with physical and emotional stress especially during swimming. Consequently, the propranolol dosage was readjusted to 3 mg/kg/day. Since the age of five no more syncopal episodes appeared under treatment with propranolol. The index patient has a 4 years younger sister who also was diagnosed with congenital deafness and prolonged QTc interval of 0.52 s (Fig. 1, patient III.1, closed circle). Treatment with propranolol at a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day was started at the age of 6 months. Recurrent syncopes occurred in the last three years in association with physical stress especially during swimming. Because of recurrent events under an adequate dosage of propranolol, implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator was strongly advised but has been refused by the family. Until today no episodes of cardiac arrest occurred. The family history revealed no other family members with congenital deafness, recurrent syncope, or sudden death. ECG and clinical history of the parents, the mother's sister, and the mother's parents were inconspicuous. The uncle of the index patient (Fig. 1, II.1) has a history of epileptic seizures, an ECG could not be obtained. The index patient's parents are distantly related because ancestral consanguinity occurred five generations ago. Genetic Analysis—We focused our analysis on the JLNS candidate genes encoding the potassium channel subunits KCNQ1 and KCNE1, which together form the IKs channel (5Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 6Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Exon sequences of both genes were assayed by PCR of genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of all family members followed by SSCP analysis (23Zehelein J. Thomas D. Khalil M. Wimmer A.B. Koenen M. Licka M. Wu K. Kiehn J. Brockmeier K. Kreye V.A. Karle C.A. Katus H.A. Ulmer H.E. Schoels W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the intronless KCNE1 gene revealed no abnormalities in the corresponding sequence and allowed us to exclude the β-subunit encoding gene as the cause of the dysfunction. Subsequently, SSCP analysis of PCR products was focused on the pore forming α-subunit encoding gene KCNQ1. The pattern of exon 1-derived PCR products of mutated carrier appeared disordered compared with healthy individuals and symptomatic subjects with three abnormal SSCP bands (Fig. 2A, lanes III.1 and III.2) clearly differed from their heterozygous parents, paternal uncle, maternal grandfather (Fig. 2A, lanes II.1, II.2, II.3, and I.1), and inconspicuous maternal grandmother (Fig. 2A, lane I.2). To identify the mutation underlying the altered migration pattern, DNA sequence analysis of exon 1-derived PCR products of the family members was performed on both strands and revealed a single nucleotide change. Due to a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at the exon 1 (uppercase letters) intron 1 (lowercase letters) border of the KCNQ1 gene (TGGATGgtacgt ≫ TGGATGatacgt), one of the most conserved nucleotides at the splice donor sequence (14Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) is altered in individuals carrying the mutated allele. Both symptomatic patients appeared homozygous for the observed replacement, whereas parents, paternal uncle, and maternal grandfather appeared heterozygous (Fig. 2B). Altered Transcription in KCNQ1 Mutant Carriers—Expression analysis was performed using cDNA fragments generated by RT-PCR of total RNA from blood cells (lymphocytes) of healthy and affected individuals. As expected from the KCNQ1 mRNA sequence (27Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 5472-5479Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in healthy individuals primer KCNQ1-433 and LQT-201 exclusively amplified a 277-bp KCNQ1 cDNA fragment (Fig. 2C, lane I.2). Corresponding to the altered splice donor site, heterozygous family members produce two different KCNQ1 cDNA fragments, the 277-bp cDNA fragment of the wild type allele, and a shorter 186-bp cDNA fragment of the mutant allele (Fig. 2C, lanes II.1, II.2, II.3, and I.1). Symptomatic patients, homozygous for the mutant allele, solely amplify the shorter 186bp cDNA fragment (Fig. 2C, lanes III.1 and III.2). DNA sequence analysis showed that heterozygous individuals produce a normal spliced wild type KCNQ1 transcript and an alternative spliced mutant KCNQ1 transcript lacking exon 1. The JLNS patients selectively produce transcripts missing exon 1 (Fig. 2D). It is important to note that the human heart expresses two different KCNQ1-isoforms, the wild type KCNQ1 subunit transcript isoform 1 (embl: AF000571) encoding 676 amino acids (27Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 5472-5479Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and an alternative spliced transcript, KCNQ1-isoform 2 (embl: NM_181798), encoding a KCNQ1 subunit lacking the N-terminal 127 amino acids (24Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Consequently, altered transcripts encoding both isoforms were expected to appear in lymphocytes of mutant carriers (Fig. 3). However, RT-PCR analysis of total RNA of lymphocytes detected isoform 1 but could not detect isoform 2 transcripts. Composition of Mutant KCNQ1 Isoforms—In the heart both isoforms are transcribed (24Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 27Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 5472-5479Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Deletion of KCNQ1 exon 1 yielded mutant isoform 1 transcripts (KCNQ1-iso1M) composed of exon 1a fused to exon 2-15 and mutant isoform 2 transcripts (KCNQ1-iso2M) composed of exon 1b fused to exon 2-15 (Fig. 3). Skipping of exon 1 generates a frameshift that introduced a premature termination codon at exon 4. Accordingly, mutant isoform 1 subunits consist of the exon 1a-encoded N-terminal 129 amino acids (aa) fused to 76 aa encoded by the introduced frameshift, whereas mutant isoform 2 subunits were composed of the exon 1b-encoded N-terminal 2 aa fused to the same, frameshift provided 76 aa (Fig. 3). Thus, homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the JLNS causing mutation express truncated KCNQ1 subunits of either 205 aa (KCNQ1-iso1M) or 78 aa (KCNQ1-iso2M), which have little similarity to KCNQ1 potassium channel subunits present in healthy individuals. Functional Properties of Mutant KCNQ1 Subunits—First, we analyzed homomeric channels formed by wild type KCNQ1-iso1 subunits or mutant KCNQ1-iso1M and KCNQ1-iso2M subunits following injection of cRNA (1.8 ng each) into Xenopus oocytes. Currents were elicited by 2-s steps to potentials ranging from -60 to 120 mV (increment 20 mV), and tail currents were recorded at -40 mV. The holding potential was -80 mV, and pulses were applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz during all electrophysiological measurements (25Thomas D. Wimmer A.B. Karle C.A. Licka M. Alter M. Khalil M. Ulmer H.E. Kathofer S. Kiehn J. Katus H.A. Schoels W. Koenen M. Zehelein J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, expression of KCNQ1-iso1 subunits produced channels with a mean tail current amplitude of 0.98 ± 0.092 μA (n = 20) (Fig. 4A, column 1), whereas oocytes expressing mutant KCNQ1-iso1M (Fig. 4A, column 2) or KCNQ1-iso2M subunits (Fig. 4A, column 7) produced no currents (KCNQ1-iso1M: 0.041 ± 0.01 μA, n = 20; KCNQ1-iso2M: 0.037 ± 0.011 μA, n = 20) comparable with uninjected oocytes (Fig. 4A, column 4). Mutant KCNQ1 Subunits Affect KCNQ1-iso1 Channels—To further investigate the functional consequences of this JLNS mutation, we determined the ability of the mutant subunits to influence wild type KCNQ1-iso1 currents. In coexpression experiments the same amount (1.8 ng) of KCNQ1-iso1M or KCNQ1-iso2M cRNA was injected with equal amounts of KCNQ1-iso1 cRNA, and the resulting currents were compared with KCNQ1-iso1 currents. KCNQ1-iso1M subunits caused little changes (5%) with currents similar to KCNQ1-iso1 currents (0.932 ± 0.079 μA, n = 20; Fig. 4A, column 3). Surprisingly, mutant KCNQ1-iso2M subunits reacted differently and caused a pronounced reduction (45%) of KCNQ1-iso1 currents to 0.543 ± 0.055 μA (n = 20) (Fig. 4A, column 6), an attribute basically associated to dominant-negative RWS-type, but absent from JLNS-type, mutations (12Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Kyndt F. van den Hoff M. Baro I. Escande D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). KCNQ1 Mutant Isoforms Cause Dominant-negative Suppression of IKs—To examine whether the truncated mutant KCNQ1 subunits interfere with IKs, we measured Xenopus oocytes injected with equal amounts (1.8 ng) of KCNQ1-iso1, KCNQ1-iso2, KCNQ1-iso1M, or KCNQ1-iso2M cRNA together with (1.8 ng) KCNE1 cRNA. The combination of KCNQ1-iso1 and KCNE1 subunits induced outward potassium currents with properties nearly identical to native cardiac IKs with an average tail amplitude of 3.58 ± 0.5 μA (n = 20, Fig. 4B and E, column 1), whereas coexpression of KCNQ1-iso2 with KCNE1 displayed very low IKs amplitudes of 0.02 ± 0.02 μA (Fig. 4E, column 2) not different from uninjected control oocytes (Fig. 4E, column 6). In contrast, expression of KCNE1 β-subunits alone produced small IKs amplitudes of 0.31 ± 0.04 μA (Fig. 4E, column 5) thought to be generated by interaction with endogenous Xenopus KCNQ1 subunits (6Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Coexpression of mutant KCNQ1-iso1M with KCNE1 exhibited tail currents of 0.17 ± 0.02 μA (Fig. 4, D and E, column 3) representing only 5% of the non-mutant isoform 1/KCNE1 current. Therefore the mutant protein KCNQ1-iso1M failed to produce a relevant potassium current when coinjected with KCNE1. Similarly, mutant isoform 2-encoded subunits (KCNQ1-iso2M) were not able to produce potassium currents in combination with KCNE1 subunits (0.141 ± 0.02 μA) (Fig. 4E, column 4). Currents smaller than KCNE1 produced currents implied an interaction of mutant KCNQ1 subunits with channels composed of endogenous Xenopus KCNQ1 and KCNE 1 subunits. To investigate the effect of mutant KCNQ1 subunits on IKs, we injected KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cRNA (1.8 ng each) together with 1.8 ng of cRNA encoding mutant isoform 1 or isoform 2 subunits into Xenopus oocytes. In the presence of KCNQ1-iso1M subunits, IKs were suppressed in a dominant-negative fashion by ∼62% producing a tail current of 1.36 ± 0.28 μA (Fig. 4, C and E, column 7). Coexpression of KCNQ1-iso1 with mutant KCNQ1-iso2M and KCNE1 suppressed IKs even stronger (86%) and gave a significantly lower tail current of 0.49 ± 0.1 μA (Fig. 4E, column 8). KCNQ1 Wild Type and Mutant Subunit Expression in COS-1 Cells—To study whether mutant subunits show differences in abundance, cellular distribution, and cellular localization, transient transfections of COS-1 cells were performed to express mutant and wild type KCNQ1 subunits that were FLAG-tagged at their C terminus. Antibody staining using anti-FLAG antibodies showed that mutant and wild type subunits were distributed in a similar pattern (Fig. 5, A-C), indicating that the marked truncation of the mutant subunits did neither compromise their cellular location nor their transport to the cell surface. This is in line with the functional analysis of wild type and mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes. The JLNS is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease characterized by a profound hearing loss associated with QT prolongation in ECG, syncopal attacks, seizures, and sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. JLNS-associated mutations have been identified in the pore-forming α-subunit KCNQ1 and in the auxiliary β-subunit KCNE1 (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J.

With this study we characterized the structural and functional features of a mutation at the splice donor site of the KCNQ1 geneÕs exon 1 (G477 + 1A) in a German family with JLNS. Mutant carriers produce KCNQ1 transcripts lacking exon 1 leading to a frameshift. By this, a premature stop codon is introduced causing the expression of truncated KCNQ1 subunits. Thus, the JLNS patients in this family selectively produce altered transcripts, leading to mutant isoform 1 subunits (KCNQ1-iso1M) composed of 205 aa comprising one-third of the first transmembrane segment (129 aa encoded by exon 1a fused to 76 aa encoded by the frameshift) and mutant isoform 2-derived subunits (KCNQ1-iso2M) composed of 78 aa (2 aa encoded by exon 1b fused to the frameshift provided 76 aa) lacking any KCNQ1 transmembrane segment. In consequence, KCNQ1 wild type and mutant subunits show little structural similarities. In agreement with these findings, mutant subunits encoded by isoform 1 or 2, KCNQ1-iso1M and KCNQ1-iso2M, respectively, were unable to form homomeric potassium channels. Moreover, KCNQ1-iso1M subunits failed to affect the formation of homomeric KCNQ1-iso1 channels, whereas the much smaller KCNQ1-iso2M subunits, when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, reduced KCNQ1-iso1 currents to 46%, a feature well assigned to RWS-type mutations and used to distinguish RWS from JLNS mutations (12Mohammad-Panah R.

Of even greater importance is that in coexpression experiments with KCNE1, mutant KCNQ1 subunits showed the ability to affect IKs currents in a dominant-negative mode with current reduction to 38 and 14% (KCNQ1-iso1M and KCNQ1-iso2M), respectively. Thus, mutant subunits confer properties more related to RWS-associated than to JLNS-associated KCNQ1 mutations (12Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Kyndt F. van den Hoff M.

Heterozygous individuals appear asymptomatic with normal QTc intervalls (this report and Ref. 17Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Richard P. Denjoy I. Hainque B. Romey G. Drici M.D. Guicheney P. Barhanin J.

Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 141-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In respect to such a discrepancy, expression of mutant KCNQ1 subunits and hence their ability to influence IKs in the heart might be regulated on an individual level. A lack of IKs reduction in healthy heterozygous individuals implies mechanisms that in cardiomyocytes prevent the potentially noxious influence of the truncated subunits. In this view, the abundance and distribution of the truncated subunits in cardiaomyocytes could be affected, or alternatively, the transport of the truncated subunits to the cell surface could be impaired leading to the absence of IKs channels composed of mutant and wild type subunits. Interestingly, anti-FLAG antibody staining of COS-1 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the FLAG-tagged mutant and wild type subunits revealed a similar expression pattern with mutant and wild type subunits indistinguishably distributed. In combination with their functional analysis in Xenopus oocytes, these data suggested that independent of their truncation, mutant subunits were transported to the cell surface, like wild type subunits. Apart from these features, we do not know whether the stability of the truncated subunits in cardiomyocytes differs from the stability of wild type subunits, yet an additional fact that could explain the presence of healthy heterozygous individuals. On the other hand, a recently described mRNA surveillance system, the nonsense-mediated decay, which rapidly degrades mutant transcripts carrying a premature stop codon (20Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 21Wagner E. Lykke-Andersen J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might offer an alternative explanation how cardiomyocytes abolish or reduce the dominant-negative effect required to establish the recessive nature of JLNS in heterozygous carriers with KCNQ1 transcripts lacking exon 1.

One is 3-hydroxykynurenine transaminase (HKT), which is primarily responsible for catalyzing the transamination of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) to xanthurenic acid (XA). Interestingly, XA is used by malaria parasites as a chemical trigger for their development within the mosquito.

This is the first time that the three-dimensional crystal structures of an AGT with its amino acceptor, glyoxylic acid, and amino donor, alanine, have been determined. The protein is dimeric and adopts the type I-fold of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases. The PLP co-factor is covalently bound to the active site in the crystal structure, and its binding site is similar to those of other AGTs. The comparison of the AeAGT-glyoxylic acid structure with other AGT structures revealed that these glyoxylic acid binding residues are conserved in most AGTs. Comparison of the AeAGT-alanine structure with that of the Anopheles HKT-inhibitor complex suggests that a Ser-Asn-Phe motif in the latter may be responsible for the substrate specificity of HKT enzymes for 3-HK.

Mosquitoes transmit malaria, which is considered the most prevalent life-threatening disease in the world (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). In mosquitoes, transamination of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) 2The abbreviations used are: 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; AeAGT, Ae. aegypti alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase; AeHKT, Ae. aegypti HKT; AGT, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase; AnHKT, Anopheles HKT; DrAGT, Drosophila AGT; hAGT, human AGT; HKT, 3-HK transaminase; LLP, lysine-pyridoxal 5-phosphate; PLP, pyridoxal 5-phosphate; XA, xanthurenic acid. to xanthurenic acid (XA) is the major branch pathway of tryptophan metabolism (2Li J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15781-15787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). XA has been identified as a natural chemical signal produced by mosquitoes, which induces exflagellation of malaria parasites in the midgut (4Garcia G.E. Wirtz R.A. Barr J.R. Woolfitt A. Rosenberg R.

Morris H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that mosquitoes have evolved two alanine glyoxylate aminotransferases (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One is the previously cloned Aedes aegypti 3-HK transaminase (AeHKT) (3Han Q. Fang J. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15781-15787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), homologous to human AGT (hAGT), which primarily catalyzes the transamination of 3-HK to XA in mosquitoes. The other is a typical dipteran insect AGT, which primarily catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylic acid to glycine (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the genomes of other available model species (including cyanobacteria, archaea, yeast, plants, fruit fly, honeybee, frog, fish, rat, mouse, and human) revealed only one AGT in their genomes, which makes possessing two AGTs a unique property of mosquitoes. Based on both phylogenetic analysis and biochemical characterization, AeAGT is closely related to Drosophila AGT (DrAGT) and AeHKT is closely related to hAGT (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Han Q. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The different roles of these two aminotransferases in the mosquito may be better understood by examining their substrate specificities and temporal expression patterns in the context of the mosquito life cycle, discussed in more detail previously (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mosquito larvae eat protein-rich food, and a considerable portion of the tryptophan obtained from these food supplies is oxidized to 3-HK (2Li J. Li G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In humans and other mammals, kynurenine aminotransferase I and II catalyze the transamination of kynurenine to kynurenic acid and 3-HK to XA (8Guidetti P. Okuno E. Schwarcz R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Han Q. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ae. aegypti kynurenine aminotransferase shows high activity toward kynurenine but no activity toward 3-HK (10Han Q. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Fang J. Han Q. Li J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, conversion of 3-HK to XA is catalyzed mainly by AeHKT in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Because mosquitoes cannot dispose of 3-HK through hydrolysis and subsequent oxidations like mammals, the transamination of the chemically reactive 3-HK to the relatively chemically stable XA by HKT is considered the mechanism by which mosquitoes prevent 3-HK from overaccumulating (7Han Q. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such an explanation remains a valid argument for the functional evolution of the mosquito AGTs. Interestingly, 3-HK is also the initial precursor for the production of ommochromes that are major eye pigments in mosquitoes. Compound eye development and eye pigmentation occur mainly during the pupal and early adult stages. Coincidently, HKT activity is diminished in pupae and adults correlating with the accumulation of high levels of 3-HK in the compound eyes (13Li J. Beerntsen B.T. James A.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of AeHKT is likely a tactic to allow 3-HK to be transported and used for eye pigmentation. Although it seems clear that detoxification of 3-HK is a major function of AeHKT in mosquito larvae, the enzyme exhibits high AGT activity and likely plays a critical role in metabolizing glycolate-derived glyoxylate as well, especially in adults, because males eat the part of plants that is normally glycolaterich. Consequently, the interruption of AeHKT expression during the adult stages would affect the metabolism of glyoxylic acid. Therefore, a highly substrate-specific (i.e. highly active with regard to the glyoxylic acid to glycine pathway but without detectable HKT activity) and stage-specific AeAGT has evolved in mosquitoes. Biochemical characterization shows that AeAGT is highly specific for catalyzing glyoxylic acid to glycine processing. AeHKT, on the other hand, primarily catalyzes the transamination of 3-HK to XA but also exhibits the same activities as AeAGT. To understand the structural basis underlying the stringent substrate specificity of AeAGT as compared with that of AeHKT, it is essential to determine the three-dimensional structure of AeAGT. In this study, we determined the native three-dimensional crystal structure of AeAGT as well as the structures with its specific substrates, alanine and glyoxylic acid, respectively. This is the first time the crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate complexes for AGTs have been reported. We have also compared AeAGT complex structures with the available AGT structures and discussed the possible residues involved in substrate specificity. The results from this study, in conjunction with the results of previous studies dealing with the molecular and biochemical characterization of AeHKT (3Han Q. Fang J. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15781-15787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Han Q. Li J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), AeAGT (6Han Q.

A. 2006; 103: 5711-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), provide an interesting example of protein functional adaptation and evolution, in this case to meet certain physiological requirements during development. Overexpression and Purification of AeAGT Recombinant Protein—Fulllength AeAGT was overexpressed in a baculovirus/insect cell protein expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant AeAGT was purified as described previously (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The molecular weight and purity of the proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. AeAGT Crystallization and Substrate Soaking—Initial crystallization screening was performed using Hampton Research Crystal Screens (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The volume of reservoir solution was 500 μl, and the drop volume was 2 μl, containing 1 μl of protein sample and 1 μl of reservoir solution. Quality AeAGT crystals were obtained in a solution containing 5 mg ml-1 protein, 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.13 m magnesium acetate, 4% butanol, and 0.1 m cacodylic acid at pH 6.5. Single crystals suitable for x-ray analysis appeared within 1 to 2 weeks at 4 °C. Alanine-enzyme and glyoxylic acid-enzyme complexes were obtained by soaking the crystals in 2.5 mm alanine and 1 mm glyoxylic acid, respectively, in the crystallization buffer for 1 week. Data Collection and Processing—Individual AeAGT crystals were cryogenized using 25% glycerol in crystallization buffer as a cryoprotectant solution. Diffraction data from AeAGT crystals were collected at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source, Beamline X25 (λ = 0.9795 Å). Data collection was done using an ADSC Q315 charge-coupled device detector. All data were indexed and integrated using HKL software (15Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend. Data Collection and Processing.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure of AeAGT was determined by the molecular replacement method. The initial search model was built with the homology module in Insight II (Accelrys) using hAGT (Protein Data Bank code 1h0c) as the template structure (17Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The program Molrep (18Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4174) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite was employed to calculate both the cross-rotation and translation of the homology model. The initial model was subjected to iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement with Refmac 5.2 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) and graphic sessions for model building using the program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were automatically added and refined with ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) together with Refmac 5.2. For the AeAGT structure, a careful inspection of the electron density in the enzyme active site was performed when the R-factor dropped to a value of 0.20 at 1.75 Å. This revealed an electron density compatible with one butanol molecule, which was subsequently manually modeled based on both the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. The AeAGT-alanine and AeAGT-glyoxylic acid complex structures were refined by using the final coordinates of the AeAGT native structure as the starting model from which all solvent and butanol molecules were removed. The substrate molecules were modeled only when the R-factor dropped to a value of 0.2 at full resolution for the AeAGT-alanine structure and a value of 0.2 at 1.75 Å resolution for the AeAGT-glyoxylic acid structure. Structure Analysis—Superposition of structures was done using Lsqkab (22Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite. Protein and substrate interaction was analyzed using Ligplot (23Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). The figures were generated using Pymol (24DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) and Ligplot (23Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The structure of AeAGT was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.75 Å resolution. The final model contains 385 residues, yielding a crystallographic R-value of 17.3% and an Rfree value of 20.3% with ideal geometry (Table 1). There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit that form the homodimer. The residues of the two subunits in AeAGT are numbered 1A to 385A for chain A and 1B to 385B for chain B. The refinement results are summarized in Table 1. All residues are in favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The last eight residues (386-393) were not defined in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map and are absent from the final model. The protein architecture revealed by AeAGT consists of the prototypical fold of aminotransferase subgroup I (26Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct.

As observed in other subgroup I aminotransferases, the functional unit of AeAGT consists of a homodimer. Active Site of AeAGT—Residual electron density clearly revealed the presence of covalently bound pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) in the cleft situated at the interface of the subunits in the biological dimer (Figs. 1 and 2A). This cleft also corresponds to the cofactor binding sites in the related enzymes and therefore defines the active site of AeAGT. The C4A atom of PLP is covalently attached to the NZ of Lys206A through the formation of an internal Schiff base, the internal aldimine giving rise to residue LLPA, represented as sticks in Fig. 2A. The PLP-pyridoxal ring is stacked between residues Trp105A and Val182A by hydrophobic interactions, and the C2A atom of PLP exhibits hydrophobic interaction with the Thr151A side chain. The side chains of Ser155A and Asp180A are hydrogen-bonded to O-3 and N-1 of the pyridoxal, respectively. The phosphate moiety of the PLP is anchored by polar interactions with the peptide amide groups of residues Gly79A and His80A as well as by the side chains of Ser78A, His80A, and Gln205A. The binding site of the PLP-phosphate is completed by hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr257B and Tyr260B from the second subunit in the biological dimer (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal extension makes a turn around residues Gly24A, Pro25A, and Gly26A exposing the Pro25A carbonyl group toward the active site. This conformation allows for polar interaction with the NZ of Lys206A and could also interact with the amino group from the pyridoxamine intermediate during the enzymatic reaction. Substrate Recognition and Catalysis—Enzyme activity assays of AeAGT revealed that alanine acts efficiently as an amino group donor substrate during the transamination reaction, yielding pyruvate, and glyoxylic acid acts efficiently as an amino acceptor, yielding glycine (6Han Q. Kim S.R. Ding H. Li J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The enzyme-catalyzed reaction is shown in Scheme 1. To identify the structural determinants of AeAGT involved in substrate recognition and binding, we determined the three-dimensional crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with alanine (Fig. 3) and glyoxylic acid (Fig. 4). Inspection of the AeAGT-alanine complex crystal structure reveals that the substrate lies near the internal Schiff base between the PLP cofactor and the NZ of Lys206A. However, PLP is still in its internal aldimine form (Fig. 3). Several residues, structurally conserved throughout the aminotransferases described thus far, define the substrate binding site and contact the alanine molecule. In particular, Arg356A forms a strong salt bridge with the alanine carboxylate group at a distance of 2.5 Å. A hydrogen-bonding network, involving Ser155A and Gly345A backbone oxygen atoms, locks the Arg356A side chain in the optimal conformation for alanine binding. The anchoring of the alanine carboxylic moiety by Arg356A in the AeAGT-alanine complex (Fig. 3) results in the reactive α-amino group being placed into the ideal position (the nitrogen atom is above the PLP C4A reactive center at a distance of 3.7 Å) for attacking the PLP C4A atom and forming the external aldimine. The alanine is also recognized by a number of interactions with protein residues, including Tyr257B, His45B, Pro25A, Ser155A, and Leu347A (Fig. 3). Gly26A is located at the turning point of the loop that dives into and partially plugs the enzyme active site, thus shielding the substrate binding pocket from the bulk solvent. It is interesting that alanine was found only in one subunit of the dimer. Alanine is a primary amino acid substrate for most of AGTs, but its Km is much higher than glyoxylic acid, and therefore this might be a reason that the alanine concentration in the soaking solution was not high enough for the amino acid to get into the active site of the enzyme in all of the molecules of the crystal. A similar behavior was observed in the complex of Paracoccus denitrificans aromatic amino acid aminotransferase with 3-phenylpropionate (30Okamoto A. Nakai Y. Hayashi H. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. J.

Detoxifying glyoxylic acid is the major function of AGTs in mammals, including human beings. It has been proposed that peroxisomal AGT is responsible for detoxifying glycolate-derived glyoxylic acid, whereas mitochondrial AGT plays a major role in detoxifying hydroxyproline-derived glyoxylic acid (32Birdsey G.M. Lewin J. Holbrook J.D. Simpson V.R. Cunningham A.A. Danpure C.J. Proc. Biol. Sci. 2005; 272: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar, 37Watts R.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In plants, AGT has been known to be involved in the photorespiratory glyoxylic acid cycle within peroxisomes (38Rehfeld D.W. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4803-4811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Liepman A.H. Olsen L.J. Plant J. 2001; 25: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In yeast, disruption of AGT can lead to glycine auxotrophy (40Schlosser T. Gatgens C. Weber U. Stahmann K.P. Yeast. 2004; 21: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The importance of hepatic AGT in minimizing endogenous oxalate production in some mammals has been clearly shown by the autosomal recessive disorder of glyoxylic acid metabolism primary hyperoxaluria type 1, a potentially lethal condition in which AGT deficiency leads to excessive oxalate synthesis and excretion and the deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney (41Danpure C.J.

Because there have not been any reports regarding the three-dimensional crystal structure of an AGT-glyoxylic acid complex, the structure reported here provides the essential basis for understanding the generic interaction of glyoxylic acid with AGTs. Structurally, glyoxylic acid lies near the internal aldimine, and the C-2 atom of glyoxylic acid is above the PLP C4A reactive center at a distance of 3.0 Å. As in the alanine complex, the carboxylate group of glyoxylic acid forms a tight ion pair with Arg356A at a distance of 2.9 Å, and Ser155A and Gly345A backbone oxygen atoms fix the Arg356A side chain in the optimal conformation for glyoxylic acid binding. One oxygen atom of the glycine carboxylate group also forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser155A. Other residues around the glyoxylic acid molecule within 4 Å are Tyr57B, His45B, Arg25A, Ser155A, LLPA, and Thr260B, and in particular Tyr257B, Pro25A, and LLPA, which establish hydrophobic interactions with glyoxylic acid. Finally, Ser155A OG is bound to the O-2 atom of glyoxylic acid (Fig. 4B). Comparison with Other AGT Structures with Regard to Substrate Specificity—In principle, differences in enzyme function should be reflected in both the primary and three-dimensional structures. Based on the available three-dimensional crystal structures of AGTs, hAGT (17Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol.

AnHKT shares 73% amino acid sequence identity with AeHKT, and an AnHKT-inhibitor complex structure with an inhibitor that is structurally similar to 3-HK and kynurenine has been determined (14Rossi F.

Both AnHKT and AeHKT exhibit high activity toward 3-HK and kynurenine (3Han Q. Fang J. Li J. J. Biol.

J. 2006; 397: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On superposing the AeAGT-alanine complex onto the AnHKT-inhibitor structure (Fig. 5A), we identified the residues within4Åof both ligands and found that most residues are conserved. An exception was the Ser43-Asn44-Phe45 triad of AnHKT that is changed to Gly44A-His45A-Leu46A in AeAGT (Fig. 5B). The amino acid sequence alignment shows that AeHKT and AnHKT share the same sequence in this area (boxed in Fig. 5C). The results suggest that the Ser-Asn-Phe motif is involved in 3-HK and kynurenine substrate recognition for mosquito HKTs. A future mutation experiment may confirm this hypothesis. Glyoxylic acid is the most suitable substrate for all AGTs, and therefore its binding site should be conserved in AGTs. A three-dimensional crystal structure of hAGT-amino-oxyacetic acid (AGT inhibitor) is available for comparison (17Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On superposing hAGT structure onto the AeAGT-glyoxylic acid complex structure (Fig. 6A), we identified the residues within4Åof both ligands and found that all the residues (Ser, Pro, Arg, PLP, and Tyr (in the other unit)) were the same in both structures (Fig. 6B). The sequence comparison showed that Anopheles AGT, AeHKT, and AnHKT also shared the same residues for glyoxylic acid binding and that yeast AGT and Nostoc AGT shared similar residues, with Ser substituted by Thr.FIGURE 6A, α-carbon representation in stereo of AeAGT (pink) superimposed onto hAGT (blue).

This duplication occurred before the mosquito/fruit fly divergence. The primary function of the mosquito AGT and HKT enzymes is quite different. The three-dimensional structures of AeAGT and its complexes with alanine and glyoxylic acid obtained in this study, in comparison with the three-dimensional structure of the AnHKT, provide some reasonable explanation regarding the structural basis underlying the substrate specificity between mosquito AGT and HKT. As this is the first report of the structures of an AGT with its native substrates, it may also help in understanding the catalyzing mechanism of AGTs, particularly hAGT, which is related to a lethal condition in humans.

Both are located on cytochrome b, a transmembrane protein of the bc1 complex that is encoded on the mitochondrial genome. To better understand the parameters that affect ligand binding at the Qn site, we applied the Qn site inhibitor ilicicolin H to select for mutations conferring resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screen resulted in seven different single amino acid substitutions in cytochrome b rendering the yeast resistant to the inhibitor. Six of the seven mutations have not been previously linked to inhibitor resistance. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of mitochondrial membranes isolated from the mutants confirmed that the differences in sensitivity toward ilicicolin H originated in the cytochrome bc1 complex.

The cytochrome bc1 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a homodimeric protein embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria (1Trumpower B.L. Encycl. Biol. Chem. 2004; 1: 528-534Crossref Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of three catalytic subunits carrying prosthetic groups, which are cytochrome b with two b-type hemes, cytochrome c1 and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein with its [2Fe-2S] cluster (2Berry E.A Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are 7 supernumerary subunits lacking any cofactors (3Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 102-129Crossref Google Scholar). Cytochrome b is the only protein of the complex that is encoded by the organelle DNA; all the other subunits are encoded by the nucleus (4Sidhu A. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10649-10656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bc1 complex transfers two electrons from ubiquinol to two molecules of cytochrome c, while translocating four protons from the negative to the positive side of the membrane via the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism (5Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two catalytic sites involved in the Q cycle mechanism. The site where ubiquinol is oxidized, center P (Qp site), and the site where quinone is reduced, center N (Qn site), are located near the electropositive and electronegative sides of the membrane, respectively. Both sites are located on cytochrome b and have different heme prosthetic groups, heme bL at center P and heme bH at center N. There are several compounds that inhibit specifically the Qp or the Qn site (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). One of the Qp site inhibitors, atovaquone, is of pharmaceutical relevance because of its anti-protozoal and anti-fungal properties (7Kessl J.J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Zwicker K. Hill P.

The Qp site has been characterized by applying Qp site inhibitors, which show more structural homology to the Qp site substrate ubiquinol than the few Qn site inhibitors known to date. It was shown recently that ilicicolin H, a new inhibitor isolated from the imperfect fungus Cylindrocladium ilicicola, acts at the Qn site of the S. cerevisiae bc1 complex (8Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B.

Ilicicolin H is a 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-α-pyridone with a decalin ring system. The 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridone is the chromophore of tenellin, produced by the insect-pathogenic fungus Beumeria bassiana (8Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Even though the structures of the three Qn site inhibitors are clearly different, there are some similarities (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 8Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar for a comparison of the structures). Ilicicolin H possesses a phenol ring, a feature that is also present in antimycin. There is also a resemblance with funiculosin, which shares the pyridone ring system with ilicicolin H. Similar effects of ilicicolin H and funiculosin on the cytochrome b optical spectrum have been observed. It was therefore concluded that the pyridone ring system plays an important role for ilicicolin H and funiculosin binding (8Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study we wanted to shed some light on the Qn site by applying the novel center N inhibitor ilicicolin H to isolate cytochrome b mutants in S. cerevisiae. From previous work, we know that antimycin displaces semiquinone from center N in the bovine bc1 complex (15Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently we have found that all three of the center N inhibitors eliminate the EPR detectable signal attributed to the stable semiquinone at center N in the yeast enzyme. We thus anticipate that the location of resistance conferring mutations might identify amino acids that contribute to semiquinone stability at center N. Seven cytochrome b mutations, differing from the wild-type protein by only one amino acid exchange, were obtained. The sequenced mutations were confirmed and assigned to the cytochrome b gene using genetic complementation techniques. Six of the seven mutations obtained in this study have not been described before. The effects of these mutations on the activity of the enzyme, as well as the sensitivity of the altered cytochrome b proteins toward ilicicolin H, were determined enzymatically. We also checked the mutant yeast strains for cross-resistance using antimycin and funiculosin.

Funiculosin was a gift of Novartis, Basel, Switzerland. Ilicicolin H was obtained from the Merck sample repository. The inhibitors were added as ethanolic solutions to agar-containing medium at ∼50 °C to obtain final concentrations of 5 and 10 μm ilicicolin H, 5 μm funiculosin, and 0.1 μm antimycin. Isolation of Resistant Mutants—A YPD culture of the wild-type strain W303-1B was plated for single colonies on YPDA. Ten individual subclones were randomly picked and each subclone was inoculated into YP10 medium supplemented with adenine and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. After washing, ∼5 × 107 cells from each subclone were spread on N3 plates containing 5 and 10 μm ilicicolin H. Each subclone produced a different number of resistant colonies after 5-10 days incubation at 30 °C. Randomly picked colonies were subcloned on YPDA and then checked for ilicicolin H resistance and resistance to cycloheximide. This allowed separation of mutations affecting cell permeability. The ilicicolin H resistant strains were crossed with the rho0 strain KL14-4A/60 to establish that the mutation was mitochondrial. The resulting diploid clones were sporulated and the dissected asci spores were tested for their ability to grow on N3 medium supplemented with ilicicolin H. The mutant strains were then mapped by crossing them with the rho- tester strains RE11, RD1, and PK1, which have retained different segments of the cytochrome b gene. The diploid strains were grown for at least 15 generations in W10, to get homoplasmic cells, and then spread for single colonies on W0. The amount of cells spread was calculated such that the cells were countable but yet statistically conclusive. Several plates where evaluated per clone. The resulting colonies were replica plated on N3 and N3 supplemented with ilicicolin H to determine the frequency of respiring clones rendered sensitive toward the drug by double homologous recombination (16Colson A.-M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 167: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All further experiments were carried out with the diploid strains resulting from the crossing of the resistant strains with KL14-4A/60, because the diploid strains then contained the mitochondrial genome of the resistant strains. Sequencing—The primers used for amplifying and sequencing exon 1 of the cytochrome b gene were: pMD1 (sense primer): 5′-ATG GCA TTT AGA AAA TCA AAT GTG TAT TTA AG-3′; pMD2 (antisense primer): 5′-CCA TAA TAT AAA CCT TTA GCC ATA TGC-3′. The primers for amplifying and sequencing exon 4 were: pMD3 (sense primer): 5′-CTC AGT ATC TAA CCC TCT AAT CCA GAG ATT C-3′; pMD4 (antisense primer): 5′-ACC TAA AGT ATT AGG TGA ATA GAA TAC-3′. Growth in Non-fermentable Medium—Diploid mutants were grown to log phase in YPD medium, washed, and the cells were then used for the inoculation of non-fermentable medium (N3) to a starting A600 of 0.15. Measurements in log phase were taken approximately every 90 min. Isolation of Mitochondrial Membranes—Mitochondrial membranes were prepared as described elsewhere (18Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. One liter of 2% YPD was inoculated with the corresponding strain and used for membrane purification. Before breaking the cells, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate were added to the buffer. The total buffer volume was two times the wet weight of the cell pellet. An equal volume of glass beads (Sigma, 425-600 μm) was then added. The last washing step was with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Membranes were stored at -20 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 50% glycerol. Determination of bc1 Complex Concentrations—Cytochrome b concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the sodium dithionite-reduced minus ascorbate-reduced enzyme using an extinction coefficient of 25 mm-1 cm-1 at 563-578 nm. Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Activity and Inhibitor Titrations—The assay buffer contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.01% Tween-20. Measurements were performed with membranes diluted to obtain a concentration of 10 nm cytochrome bc1 complex in assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm potassium cyanide and 30 μm cytochrome c. The reaction was started by adding decyl-ubiquinol (DBH2) to a final concentration of 50 μm after stirring the enzyme 90 s in the absence or presence of inhibitor. Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550-539 nm with the Aminco DW2a™ spectrophotometer in the dual wavelength mode. An extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm-1 was used to calculate cytochrome c reduction at 550-539 nm (19Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activity of the bc1 complex after stirring 90 s without inhibitor was determined prior to each inhibitor titration. The activity of the membranes from each mutant was determined simultaneously with that of wild-type membranes. For each inhibitor concentration, measurements were taken in duplicate and the average value was calculated. Turnover numbers were calculated on the basis of cytochrome b content. The non-inhibited enzymatic activity was 65 + 6 s-1, which was set at 100%. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed with a Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstation using the Discover 3® module within the Insight II® software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The view of the structure of center N was constructed from the coordinates of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV) with stigmatellin bound at center P (20Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Roβmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Selecting for S. cerevisiae Cytochrome b Mutations Conferring Resistance to the Novel Qn Site Inhibitor Ilicicolin H—The novel inhibitor ilicicolin H was used to select for spontaneous mutants exhibiting resistance in S. cerevisiae. As a first step, an inhibitor concentration for plates had to be determined that would suppress the growth of wild-type cells, but would still allow mutants to survive. That threshold was between 5 and 10 μm ilicicolin H. As described above, ten haploid W303-1B colonies were randomly picked and streaked on N3 plates containing 5 and 10 μm ilicicolin H to screen for resistant mutants. To differentiate mutations that modified cell permeability from the mutations in the cytochrome b gene, the mutants were tested for their resistance toward cycloheximide (21Subik J. Ulaszewski S. Goffeau A. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among the 52 randomly picked colonies from the ilicicolin H plates, 40 were resistant to cycloheximide concentrations up to 1 μg/ml (data not shown). These were discarded. Determining if the Mutation Is of Mitochondrial Origin—The cytochrome bc1 complex in S. cerevisiae is composed of ten subunits, with cytochrome b being the only protein encoded by the mitochondrial (mt) 2The abbreviations used are: mt, mitochondrial; EPR, electroparamagnetic resonance. DNA. To rule out that the mutation was in one of the other subunits and hence of nuclear origin, the ilicicolin H-resistant, cycloheximide-sensitive clones were crossed with the rho0 strain KL14-4A/60. The resulting diploid progeny had the mtDNA of the corresponding resistant clone. These were then sporulated, and the spores of the dissected asci were tested for growth on drug plates. All twelve cycloheximide-sensitive strains showed a mitochondrial DNA segregation pattern of the ilicicolin H resistance (data not shown). The diploid-resistant clones resulting from these crosses were then used for most of the experiments unless otherwise specified. Sequencing Exon 1 and Exon 4 of the Cytochrome b Gene from the Haploid-resistant Strains—It was known that previously identified mutations conferring resistance to Qn site inhibitors are located in exon 1 or exon 4 of the cytochrome b gene. Both of these exons were thus sequenced from two directions in the ilicicolin H-resistant, cycloheximide-sensitive strains. Mutations were found in either exon 1 or exon 4. Table 1 shows the different amino acid mutations, their position in the protein, followed by the codon that was changed. The selection yielded seven different mutations; serine at position 20 to threonine (S20T) or leucine (S20L), glutamine at position 22 to glutamate (Q22E) or threonine (Q22T), glycine 37 to serine (G37S) or aspartate (G37D), and leucine 198 to phenylalanine (L198F).TABLE 1Cytochrome b mutations conferring ilicicolin H resistance in S. cerevisiae Shown are the different mutations obtained after selection for ilicicolin H resistance on plates, the exon location and frequency of the mutation, and the growth characteristics of the yeast strains on a non-fermentable medium.MutationCodon changeExon locationFrequencyGrowthS20TTCA ACA11NormalS20LTCA TTA11ImpairedQ22ECAA GAA13NormalQ22TCAA CTA12NormalG37DGGT GAT12ImpairedG37SGGT AGT12NormalL198FTTA TTT41Normal Open table in a new tab The most frequently occurring mutation was Q22E, which was obtained three times independently from different W303-1B subclones (Table 1). Q22T was obtained two times from independent subclones, while G37S and G37D were both obtained two times, each from the same original subclone. Further characterization of the mutant strains was performed with one representative for each mutation found. The glycine at position 37 of the yeast cytochrome b seems to be a favorable location for mutations, since mutations at this position conferring resistance to antimycin and funiculosin have been described previously (22di Rago J.-P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12564-12570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23di Rago J.-P. Perea J. Colson A.-M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutation described previously was glycine to valine, which had been obtained in eight independent isolated mutants. It was concluded that at glycine 37 the mutated codon could give rise to at least seven different amino acids as a result of a single base change, but that some might not be found because they would confer a respiratory deficiency (22di Rago J.-P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12564-12570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the two glycine 37 mutations selected in this study, G37D, shows an impaired growth phenotype on plates containing a non-fermentable carbon source (Table 1). Another strain, carrying the S20L mutation, also shows an impaired growth phenotype on non-fermentable medium. Interestingly, there was one additional mutation emerging at both sites, G37S and S20T, for which growth on glycerol plates is not hampered. In the case of G37D, the small, non-polar glycine is exchanged with aspartate, containing a charged polar side chain. That exchange obviously has a more detrimental effect than replacing the glycine with serine, which has an uncharged polar side chain. In the case of serine 20, it is a more subtle change to replace an amino acid with an uncharged polar side chain with an amino acid similar in size and characteristics, threonine, than with an amino acid with a non-polar side chain, leucine. The remaining five resistant mutant strains show growth similar to that of the wild-type strain on non-fermentable medium (Table 1). The L198F mutation has been described before as a funiculosin resistance-conferring mutation (23di Rago J.-P. Perea J. Colson A.-M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of the other mutations are described here for the first time. Further characterization of the mutant strains was performed with one representative for each mutation found. Genetic Mapping of the Resistant Clones—To confirm that the mutations identified by sequencing are responsible for the resistance, and to exclude the possibility of additional mutations elsewhere in the cytochrome b gene, crosses between the ilicicolin H-resistant/cycloheximide-sensitive strains and relevant rho- tester strains were performed as described previously (16Colson A.-M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 167: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By using rho- mutant strains containing only sections of the cytochrome b gene, mutations can be mapped to defined areas of the gene. These strains are deprived of large parts of mtDNA, and the remaining wild-type sequence is amplified until the mtDNA reaches its original size (17Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This accounts for the different recombination frequencies observed for distinct rho- strains; the smaller the remaining, amplified fragment, the higher the frequency. Panel A in Fig. 1 shows schematically the exons (E1-E6) separated by introns of the wild-type cytochrome b gene, and underneath the regions that are covered by the rho- strains used in this study. Strain RE11 covers the first three exons and parts of exon 4. Strain PK1 covers exon 1, and RD1 consists of the last four exons. The results of the crosses are shown in panel B in Fig. 1. The four columns represent the crossing of the three rho- strains and one rho0 strain with the resistant strains. After ∼15 generations in W10 medium to obtain progeny containing only homoplasmic cells, a countable, comparable amount of cells was spread on W0 plates and replica plated on non-fermentable glycerol medium, and on glycerol plates supplemented with 5 μm ilicicolin H. In crossings with RE11, only the resistant strains carrying the mutation in exon 1 of the cytochrome b gene showed recombination, ranging from 6 to 19%. RE 11 covers parts of exon 4, but is lacking the area where mutation Leu-198 is localized, no crossing over was possible. In crossings with PK1, which only consists of exon 1 of the cytochrome b gene, the recombination efficiency ranges from 72 to 86% for the strains carrying the mutation in that part of the gene, 0% for L198F. As mentioned above, the frequency of recombination changes significantly, depending on the size of the fragment. There was no homologous recombination when the resistant clones were crossed with RD1, except for the strain carrying the L198F mutation, an area that is covered by this rho- strain. Also shown are the results of the control crossings with the rho0 strain KL14-4A/60. The results of the crossings proved that the mutations found by sequencing the cytochrome b genes of the resistant strains were responsible for the resistance toward ilicicolin H. Localization of the Amino Acids Altered in the Ilicicolin H-resistant Strains—The location of the amino acids that are mutated in the resistant strains at the Qn site provides some insight into the basis for the inhibitor resistance. The secondary structure of the yeast cytochrome b is shown in Fig. 2A. The protein spans the inner mitochondrial membrane eight times with both N and C termini in the mitochondrial matrix. Most of the mutations are near the N terminus, except the mutation at position Leu-198, which is located in helix D. The crystal structure of cytochrome b in Fig. 2B shows the mutational sites serine 20, glutamine 22, glycine 37, and leucine 198, in addition to ubiquinone and the bH heme at center N. This view of the crystal structure shows that leucine 198, serine 20, and glutamine 22 are close (<5 Å) to the ubiquinone ring in the center N pocket. In contrast, glycine 37, which also confers resistance to several other center N inhibitors (22di Rago J.-P. Colson A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12564-12570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is rather distant from the quinone ring (9.2 Å). Growth on Plates Containing Inhibitor—After confirming the mutations by genetic crossing, the mutant strains were tested for their growth characteristics. All of the strains grew normally on glucose. Their growth on plates containing nonfermentable medium is shown in Fig. 3. For this experiment, the resistant diploid strains resulting from the crosses with KL14-4A/60 were used. For comparison, strains were grown on plates supplemented with either 5 μm ilicicolin H, 5 μm funiculosin, or 0.1 μm antimycin. For the latter two inhibitors, the appropriate concentration for plates was determined as described for ilicicolin H above. The upper part of the panel in Fig. 3 shows the results of the incubation of the resistant clones at the normal 30 °C growth temperature, while the lower panels show the same subset of strains grown at 34 °C to check if the mutations rendered the bc1 complex temperature-sensitive. The panels on the left show the growth of the various strains on the non-fermentable carbon source in the absence of any inhibitor. The figure shows the plates after 6 days of incubation, except for the antimycin plates, which are shown after fourteen days, because it took longer for the resistant cells to emerge with antimycin present. For most of the strains there was not much difference if they were grown at 30 or 34 °C. The L198F-resistant strain did not grow on antimycin plates at 34 °C, but did grow at 30 °C. The S20L resistant strain, one of the slow-growers, which had problems growing at 30 °C on all plates, did not grow at all at 34 °C. At 30 °C, the S20T, Q22E, Q22T, G37S, and L198F resistant strains grew at a rate similar to the wild-type strain when grown on glycerol alone. Their growth was also not impaired when grown on plates containing 5 μm ilicicolin H, irrespective of whether the clones were grown at 30 or 34 °C. Except for the L198F mutation, which conferred ilicicolin H and funiculosin resistance at both 30 and 34 °C, there was no other mutation that conferred strong resistance to either funiculosin or antimycin. The two strains with S20L and G37D cytochrome b mutations grew poorly on non-fermentable medium at 30 °C, the former being more impaired than the latter. The S20L strain showed weak ilicicolin H resistance and cross-resistance to funiculosin. Notably, the S20L strain grew better at 30 °C when funiculosin was present, but did not grow at 34 °C, regardless if inhibitors were added or not. The wild-type strain grew only on the glycerol plate when no inhibitors were present (results not shown). Respiratory Competence in Liquid Medium—To compare the growth characteristics of the resistant clones, they were grown in the non-fermentable liquid N3 medium at 30 °C. The growth in liquid medium (Fig. 4) confirmed the results obtained with plates (Fig. 3). Two strains, S20L and G37D, showed impaired growth in the non-fermentable medium and, like on the plates, growth of the S20L strain was more impaired than G37D. The other mutant strains grew at rates similar to the wild-type strain. Effect of the Cytochrome b Mutations on the Activity of the bc1 Complex—To assess the"

Inhibition of FBP activity by AICAR occurs at physiologically relevant concentrations and may represent a form of regulation of gluconeogenic flux in Salmonella enterica. An efficient cellular metabolism that can adapt to changing environmental conditions requires the integration of many biochemical pathways. Subtle interactions that exist between pathways in the metabolic network are in general not well understood. One level of these interactions involves metabolites common to multiple pathways. Cellular metabolites can impact physiology through roles in transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, or by mediating allosteric effects on key enzymes. One such central metabolite with regulatory capabilities is 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR). 3The abbreviations used are: AICAR, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribotide; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-1,6-P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. 3The abbreviations used are: AICAR, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribotide; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-1,6-P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fru-2,6-P, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. AICAR is a purine nucleotide biosynthetic intermediate and the substrate for AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase, encoded by the purH gene in Salmonella enterica. AICAR is also generated as a byproduct of histidine biosynthesis, released by the enzyme imidazole glycerol-phosphate synthase (Fig. 1A). AICAR has been shown to impact different metabolic pathways in diverse organisms. Bochner and Ames (1Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Cell. 1982; 29: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) proposed that 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside 5′-triphosphate formed from the accumulation of AICAR is an alarmone for C1-folate deficiency in S. enterica, although this conclusion, in its simplest form, was not supported by subsequent work (2Rohlman C.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7200-7210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AICAR has been shown to be a negative effector of cytochrome terminal oxidase cbb3 production in Rhizobium etli (3Soberon M. Lopez O. Miranda J. Tabche M.L. Morera C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and was recently shown to affect regulation of purine biosynthesis genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Rebora K. Laloo B. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2005; 170: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that AICAR accumulation inhibits the conversion of aminoimidazole ribotide to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl pyrimidine phosphate in the biosynthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate in S. enterica (5Allen S. Zilles J.L. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6130-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, AICAR has been shown to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (6Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), which plays a critical role in energy balance and the response to metabolic stress (7Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, AICAR inhibits proliferation of several types of cancer cells (8Xiang X. Saha A.K. Wen R. Ruderman N.B. Luo Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 9Rattan R. Giri S. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39582-39593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AICAR has been shown to inhibit gluconeogenesis in mammals due to inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (10Vincent M.F. Marangos P.J. Gruber H.E. van den Berghe G. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vincent M.F. Erion M.D. Gruber H.E. van den Berghe G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.11; FBP) catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P) to fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate (12Benkovic S.J. deMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). FBP is important for the regulation of flux between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1B); as the enzyme is inhibited by AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P) (13Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar). Fru-2,6-P is a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate Fru-1,6-P, which binds at the active site (14Pilkis S. El-Maghrabi M. Pilkis J. Claus T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Lipscomb W.N. Marcus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas AMP binds to an allosteric site (16Taketa K. Pogell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ke H.M. Zhang Y.P. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which causes a structural transition from the active R state of the enzyme to the inactive T state (18Liang J.Y. Zhang Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FBP from mammalian sources has been extensively studied at the biochemical level. In Escherichia coli, FBP activity is required for growth on glycerol, succinate, or acetate as sole carbon and energy source (19Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli FBP has been shown to be activated by Mg2+ and inhibited by AMP and Fru-2,6-P, similar to the mammalian enzymes, although Mg2+ activation and AMP inhibition did not display cooperativity, as in the mammalian enzymes (20Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A. Gibson K.M. Lu G. Hehir M.J. Phelan P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of Fru-2,6-P inhibition of E. coli FBP is not clear; Fru-2,6-P inhibition is not synergistic with AMP inhibition as in mammalian systems (20Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A.

Biochem. 1983; 52: 617-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Phosphoenolpyruvate has been shown to relieve AMP inhibition of E. coli FBP (21Marcus F. Edelstein I. Rittenhouse J. Biochem.

Recently, the crystal structure of E. coli FBP was reported; these authors also demonstrated activation of FBP by phosphoenolpyruvate and postulated a novel allosteric binding site for this compound (24Hines J.K.

The studies described here demonstrate that purH mutants of S. enterica are unable to use glycerol or other gluconeogenic carbon sources in the absence of exogenous histidine. Results show that this growth phenotype is due to inhibition of FBP by the accumulation of AICAR. AICAR-resistant alleles of fbp were isolated and the mutant proteins were purified and characterized in vitro. FBP is inhibited by AICAR at physiologically relevant concentrations and thus this interaction may represent a form of regulation relevant under some growth conditions, such as folate stress. All strains used in this study are derivatives of S. enterica LT2 and are listed with their genotypes in Table 1. The purH355 allele contains a thymidine inserted at position 716, resulting in a frameshift and generating a truncated PurH protein of 266 amino acids.

Transduction Methods—The high-frequency generalized transducing mutant version of bacteriophage P22 (HT105/1 int-201) was used in all transductions (31Schmieger H. Mol. Gen.

Isolation of Linked Insertions—Transposons (Tn10d(Tc)) genetically linked to the mutation allowing utilization of glycerol as sole carbon source in a purH mutant were isolated by standard genetic techniques (34Kleckner N. Roth J. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 125-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of each insertion was determined by sequencing using a PCR-based protocol (35Caetano-Anolles G.

A DNA product was amplified with degenerate primers and primers derived from the Tn10d(Tc) insertion sequence as described and sequenced at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology DNA Sequence Facility. The fbp gene was amplified from wild-type and mutant strains using genomic DNA as a template and the forward primer, 5′-TACTTTGCTGGCGCGATTCACCTG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-TGTTTTCGTTTCCGCCTCATCTGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were purified and ligated into SmaI-cut pSU19. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α and screened for vectors containing inserts. The identity of the resulting plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids for expression of His-tagged FBP were constructed as described above using plasmid DNA as the template and the forward primer 5′-GCAGGGAAAGTCATATGAAAACG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGCGCGTCCGGGTATTCGCGGATAAA-3′ (engineered restriction sites underlined). These PCR products were ligated into pET20 (Novagen) digested with NdeI and XhoI and screened as described above. Plasmids are listed in Table 1. Cultures (10 ml) of DM9297 containing an fbp-expression plasmid (Table 1), grown overnight in LB with 11 mm glucose, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin, were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB with 2.5 mm glucose, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) to an optical density at 650 nm of 0.6–0.7 and induced with 1 mm arabinose. After 3 h at 37°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P-8849) and disrupted with a French pressure cell (15,000 lb/inch2). The crude extract was clarified by centrifugation (39,000 × g, for 30 min at 4 °C). The clarified extract was loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A, then the column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer A. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient (20 column volumes) from 50 to 500 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing FBP as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis were pooled, concentrated to 7–10 mg/ml, exchanged into buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, pH 7.0), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. FBP activity was determined using a coupled, spectrophotometric assay (37Pontremoli S. Traniello S. Luppis B. Wood W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3459-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of FBP were thawed and diluted to 0.05 μg/ml in buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, 20% glycerol, pH 7.0) immediately prior to assay. Reactions (1 ml) contained: 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0–100 μm Fru-1,6-P, 0–25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2 mm NADP+, 50 μm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.8 units of phosphoglucose isomerase, and FBP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of FBP (250 ng), and the reduction of NADP+ was monitored at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). The linear steady-state portion of the A340 versus time plot was used to determine the kinetic parameters kcat, Km (Fru-1,6-P), and Hill coefficient by fitting initial velocity data to Equation 1 (R2 ≥ 0.99), ν=Vmax×SH/(KmH+SH)(Eq. 1) where ν is velocity, S is either the concentration of varied cofactor or substrate, Vmax is the velocity at saturating substrate and cofactor, Km is the Michaelis constant for the varied cofactor or substrate, and H is the Hill coefficient. The velocity data as plotted in the double-reciprocal form was fit by the following function, y=(a+bx+cx2)/(1+ex)(Eq. 2) where x is 1/[substrate], and y is 1/velocity. The initial slope is defined as b – ae, the slope of the asymptote is c/e, the y intercept is a, and the asymptote intercept is (be – c)/e2. Inhibition by AMP was studied by using saturating Fru-1,6-P (100 μm), five concentrations of MgCl2 (0.5–8 mm), and five concentrations of AMP (0–8 μm for FBP(wt), 0–0.6 mm for FBP(T19I), and 0–8 mm for FBP(G20D) and FBP(T23I)). Inhibition by AICAR was studied by using saturating Fru-1,6-P (100 μm), five concentrations of MgCl2 (0.5–8 mm), and five concentrations of AICAR (0–120 μm for FBP(wt) and 0–10 mm for mutant FBP enzymes). Inhibition data were fit to the following equation (Equation 3) for nonlinear mixed-type inhibition (R2 ≥ 0.95), ν=Vmax×SH/[((1+(I/Kic))×Ka)+(1+(I/Kiu))×SH(Eq. 3) where ν is the velocity, Vmax is the velocity with saturating substrate and cofactor with no inhibitor present, Ka is the Michaelis constant for Mg2+, S is the concentration of Mg2+, Kic is the competitive dissociation constant for inhibitor from the enzyme-inhibitor complex, Kiu is the uncompetitive dissociation constant for inhibitor from the enzyme-inhibitor complex, I is the concentration of inhibitor, and H is the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ derived from Equation 1. Linear and nonlinear regression analysis was preformed using SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software). Salmonella purH Mutants Are Unable to Use Glycerol as a Sole Carbon and Energy Source—The observation was made that a purH mutant strain of S. enterica (DM2) was unable to grow on minimal medium containing glycerol as sole carbon and energy source and supplemented with adenine and thiamine (Table 2). Further experiments demonstrated that this growth defect was eliminated by the addition of exogenous histidine. This finding led to the hypothesis that the accumulation of the purine biosynthetic intermediate, AICAR, was inhibiting an enzyme(s) required for growth on glycerol medium. AICAR is also generated as a byproduct of histidine biosynthesis; therefore addition of exogenous histidine reduces the intracellular concentration of AICAR in a purH mutant (5Allen S. Zilles J.L. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6130-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Mutations in fbp allow purH mutants to grow on minimal glycerol medium in the absence of histidineDoubling timeaDoubling times are calculated from the results of three independent cultures ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Mutations That Allow a purH Mutant to Grow on Glycerol Medium in the Absence of Histidine Map to the fbp Locus—A purH mutant (DM2) was plated on minimal glycerol medium supplemented with adenine and thiamine and mutagenized with diethyl sulfate (3 μl spotted in the middle of a plate containing 108 colony forming units). Colonies appeared within 48 h and were concentrated in a ring around the spot of diethyl sulfate; 24 colonies were purified and re-tested for the glycerol-positive phenotype. One of these mutants was a purH+ revertant; and it was discarded. Twelve of the remaining strains were chosen at random for further study. The causative mutation in each was found to be genetically linked to a transposon located near the fbp locus. Six of these mutants were reconstructed and the fbp gene was amplified by PCR, cloned into pSU19, and sequenced. Three unique mutations were identified, causing the following amino acid substitutions: T19I, G20D, and T23I. Mutations causing the T19I and T23I substitutions were independently isolated multiple times. Isogenic strains containing each of the three mutations on the chromosome were constructed and tested for their ability to grow on minimal glycerol medium supplemented with adenine and thiamine (Table 2). The presence of any of these three mutations allowed a purH mutant to grow on minimal glycerol medium supplemented with adenine and thiamine. Strains containing null mutations in fbp also fail to grow on other gluconeogenic carbon sources such as acetate and succinate (19Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to glycerol, purH mutants failed to use acetate and succinate as sole carbon and energy sources in the absence of exogenous histidine (data not shown). The Mutant FBP Enzymes Are Resistant to Inhibition by AICAR and AMP in Vitro—Wild-type and mutant FBP enzymes were purified as His6-tagged fusion proteins via Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The purified enzymes were judged to be ∼90% pure by image analysis (Phoretix TotalLab) (Fig. 2). Kinetic parameters were determined from initial velocity data for the purified enzymes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows the ν versus substrate concentration for varying [Fru-1,6-P] (A.1) and [MgCl2](B.1) and the respective double reciprocal plots (A.2,B.2). These data as illustrated in the ν versus [Fru-1,6-P] and ν versus [Mg2+] plots are best fit by a modified Hill equation and the double reciprocal plots show data that are nonlinear and have a rising trend. This is characteristic of enzymes displaying positive cooperativity. To verify positive cooperativity, Hill plots were constructed for the assays with saturating Mg2+ and varied Fru-1,6-P (A.3) and the assays with saturating Fru-1,6-P and varied Mg2+ (B.3). Both plots are linear with a slope (n) corresponding to the Hill coefficient (H) derived from Equation 1. The kinetic parameters for the wild-type and variant S. enterica enzymes were derived using Equation 1 and are listed in Table 3. The values obtained for the wild-type enzyme were similar to those reported for the E. coli enzyme (20Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A. Gibson K.M. Lu G. Hehir M.J. Phelan P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim.

The plots comparing the velocity of NADP+ reduction while varying the concentration of Fru-1,6-P (series A) or Mg2+ (series B) are shown.

The double-reciprocal plots of the ν versus [Mg2+] were found to be nonlinear and inhibition visually appeared to be competitive relative to [Mg2+]. The plots were nonlinear because of the cooperative behavior of Mg2+ binding to the enzymes. Linearity was obtained by raising the [Mg2+] to the power of the Hill coefficient of the specific enzymes, which was determined using Equation 1 (Table 3). A representative double reciprocal plot of wild-type FBP inhibition by AICAR is shown in Fig. 4. The type of inhibition exhibited for AMP and AICAR was determined by graphing initial rate data in the form of double reciprocal plots at various inhibitor concentrations and Dixon plots (1/ν versus [I]). By comparing actual data to theoretical values obtained by fitting the non-linear data to various inhibition equations it was found that the data are best described by Equation 3 for mixed-type inhibition. The inhibition constants are shown in Table 4. This means that AMP and AICAR bind to both the E and E·Mg complex. The high Kiu values and low Kic values obtained from the fits indicated that AMP and AICAR bind more tightly to the free enzyme and weaker to the E·Mg complex. Shown in the inset of Fig. 4 is a replot of the slopes for the theoretical data in Fig. 4 versus [AICAR]1. The relationship is linear indicating that AICAR and AMP (data not shown) do not inhibit the enzymes in a cooperative manner. As predicted from the phenotypic data, all three mutant forms of FBP had significantly higher Ki values than the wild-type enzyme (Kic ∼ 120–1100-fold for AMP, ∼45–60-fold for AICAR; Kiu ∼ 100–1500-fold for AMP, 20–40-fold for AICAR).TABLE 4Inhibition constants for wild-type and mutant Fpb enzymesEnzymeKaMg(II)−AICARaaKa for Mg2+ determined when varying either AICAR or AMP.KicAICARKiuAICARKaMg(II)−AMPaaKa for Mg2+ determined when varying either AICAR or AMP.KicAMPKiuAMPmmμmmmμmFBP(wt)1.3 ± 0.137.3 ± 5.6165 ± 152.3 ± 0.21.31 ± 0.264.14 ± 0.44FBP(T19I)2.7 ± 0.31700 ± 3906320 ± 9202.2 ± 0.3155 ± 52404 ± 53FBP(G20D)4.4 ± 0.52160 ± 5104610 ± 7504.6 ± 0.71360 ± 340657 ± 150FBP(T23I)1.2 ± 0.11160 ± 2203800 ± 3202.7 ± 0.31450 ± 3306120 ± 1100a Ka for Mg2+ determined when varying either AICAR or AMP. Open table in a new tab Results herein showed that the inability of S. enterica purH mutants to grow on gluconeogenic carbon sources in the absence of exogenous histidine is due to inhibition of FBP by the accumulation of the purine biosynthetic intermediate AICAR. Revertant mutations restoring growth of the purH mutant on glycerol mapped to fbp, and resulted in variants of FBP that were resistant to inhibition by AICAR and AMP. The three variant proteins characterized in this work (T19I, G20D, and T23I) had lesions located in the AMP binding site of the FBP protein as determined from the crystal structure of the pig kidney enzyme (17Ke H.M. Zhang Y.P. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in the partial alignment in Fig. 5, the AMP binding site is highly conserved between both bacterial and mammalian enzymes. S. enterica FBP is 97% identical and 98% similar to E. coli FBP, 43% identical and 63% similar to the pig kidney enzyme, and 44% identical and 63% similar to the human liver enzyme. Like the mammalian enzyme, but unlike the E. coli enzyme, FBP from S. enterica displayed cooperative kinetic behavior that had not been reported (mammalian hMg(II) ∼ 2 (38Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) (20Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A. Gibson K.M. Lu G. Hehir M.J. Phelan P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. enterica FBP also displayed cooperative behavior for Fru-1,6-P that has not been reported for any FBP studied to date. Moreover, the S. enterica enzyme did not show cooperative kinetic behavior for AMP or AICAR inhibition, whereas this behavior has been shown for these inhibitors in the mammalian enzyme (mammalian hAMP = 2 (16Taketa K.

Thr19 corresponds to Thr27 in the mammalian enzymes; the side chain of this residue contacts the phosphate group of AMP in the crystal structure (17Ke H.M. Zhang Y.P. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and replacement of Thr27 in the porcine enzyme with alanine increased the Ki for AMP 1300-fold (40Shyur L.F.

In this work, the T19I substitution increased the Kic for AMP 118-fold and the K 98-fold. Thr23iu corresponds to Thr31 in the mammalian enzymes; the side chain of this residue forms a hydrogen bond with the purine base of AMP in the crystal structure, and site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed its importance in AMP inhibition (39Chen M.

Gly20 corresponds to Gly28 of the mammalian enzymes, which forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule in the AMP binding site but has not been studied by site-directed mutagenesis (42Iversen L.F.

A previous report on an AMP-insensitive fbp mutant of E. coli found that growth was unaffected by the presence of this mutation unless the allele was highly expressed, but further characterization of the enzyme was not reported (46Sedivy J.M. Babul J. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The purine biosynthetic intermediate AICAR was shown to bind to the AMP binding pocket of human liver FBP by crystallographic studies (42Iversen L.F. Brzozowski M. Hastrup S. Hubbard R. Kastrup J.S. Larsen I.K. Naerum L. Norskov-Lauridsen L. Rasmussen P.B. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Lundgren K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and shown to inhibit FBP in rat liver extracts (10Vincent M.F. Marangos P.J. Gruber H.E. van den Berghe G. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vincent M.F. Erion M.D. Gruber H.E. van den Berghe G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All three substitutions described in this work significantly reduce inhibition of the enzyme for both AMP and AICAR. It is interesting to note that a perfect correlation does not exist between the effects of each substitution on inhibition by AMP and AICAR despite the fact that both compounds bind at the same site. In particular, the T23I substitution increases the Kic for AMP 1100-fold, but only increases the Kic for AICAR 31-fold. This observation may be explained by crystallographic data demonstrating that AICAR binds in a slightly different orientation than AMP; specifically, the imidazole ring of AICAR is rotated 180° relative to AMP in the crystal structure (42Iversen L.F. Brzozowski M. Hastrup S. Hubbard R. Kastrup J.S. Larsen I.K. Naerum L. Norskov-Lauridsen L. Rasmussen P.B. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Lundgren K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The side chain of this residue forms hydrogen bonds to the purine ring and a water molecule in the AMP-bound structure, but in the AICAR-bound structure, the side chain hydrogen bond to the water molecule is replaced by a backbone nitrogen hydrogen bond from the same Thr residue. If the substitution of Ile for this Thr residue still allows the backbone hydrogen bond while eliminating the side chain hydrogen bond, this could explain the different effects of this substitution with respect to the two inhibitors. The Kic determined for AICAR with the wild-type enzyme (37.3 ± 5.6 μm) agrees well with the IC50 determined by Iversen et al. (42Iversen L.F. Brzozowski M. Hastrup S. Hubbard R. Kastrup J.S. Larsen I.K. Naerum L. Norskov-Lauridsen L. Rasmussen P.B. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Lundgren K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for the human liver enzyme. This is significant because it indicates that AICAR inhibits FBP at a physiologically relevant concentration. Bochner and Ames (47Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined the intracellular concentration of AICAR in Salmonella to be 105 μm in minimal glucose medium, whereas Rohlman and Matthews (2Rohlman C.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7200-7210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) measured concentrations of 40–150 μm in E. coli strain W3110. AICAR has many physiological effects in various organisms. These data suggest that in enteric bacteria AICAR has the potential to affect flux through gluconeogenesis, as FBP is a key control point for this pathway. The concentration of AICAR would be expected to decrease in response to exogenous purines or histidine due to feedback inhibition of the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds. It is known that AICAR levels increase significantly in response to folate stress (∼3–6-fold) due to inhibition of the PurH enzyme (1Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Cell. 1982; 29: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Rohlman C.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7200-7210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that the PurH enzyme is sensitive to high temperature (48Downs D.M. Purine Metabolism and Cryptic Prophages in Salmonella typhimurium.. University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT1987Google Scholar). Considering the in vitro kinetic parameters and in vivo pool sizes, it seems likely that flux through gluconeogenesis may be altered under growth conditions that impact the concentration of AICAR exemplified by blocking PurH by mutation. In summary, the work described here has identified three amino acid substitutions in FBP from Salmonella that cause insensitivity to both AMP and AICAR. An additional potential regulatory role for the small molecule AICAR has been identified, although further work is necessary to determine whether this effect is physiologically relevant. Finally, the use of purH mutants could provide a powerful genetic selection for AMP-insensitive mutants of FBP, including substitutions that might not be predicted based on structural information.

Here we report the crystal structures of the Bacillus subtilis imidazolonepropionase and its complex at 2.0-Å resolution with substrate analog imidazole-4-acetic acid sodium (I4AA). The structure of the native enzyme contains two domains, a TIM (triose-phosphate isomerase) barrel domain with two insertions and a small β-sandwich domain. The TIM barrel domain is quite similar to the members of the α/β barrel metallo-dependent hydrolase superfamily, especially to Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase. A metal ion was found in the central cavity of the TIM barrel and was tightly coordinated to residues His-80, His-82, His-249, Asp-324, and a water molecule. X-ray fluorescence scan analysis confirmed that the bound metal ion was a zinc ion. An acetate ion, 6 Å away from the zinc ion, was also found in the potential active site. In the complex structure with I4AA, a substrate analog, I4AA replaced the acetate ion and contacted with Arg-89, Try-102, Tyr-152, His-185, and Glu-252, further defining and confirming the active site. The detailed structural studies allowed us to propose a zinc-activated nucleophilic attack mechanism for the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.

The histidine degradation pathway is highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (1Revel H.R. Magasanik B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1960; 235: 2058-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, the histidine degradation pathway is operated by the hut (histidine utilization) genes, and the Bacillus subtilis hut operon encodes proteins in the order of HutP, HutH, HutU, HutI, HutG, HutM (3Chasin L.A. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5165-5178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yoshida K. Sano H. Seki S. Oda M. Fujimura M. Fujita Y. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).There are four enzymes (histidase or HutH, urocanase or HutU, imidazolonepropionase or HutI, and formiminoglutamase or HutG) in the histidine degradation pathway in bacteria as well as in mammals, catalyzing four reactions accordingly: 1) Histidine → urocanate + NH4 (catalyzed by histidase, EC 4.3.1.3); 2) urocanate + H2O → 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid (catalyzed by urocanase, EC 4.2.1.49); 3) 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid (IPA) 4The abbreviations used are: IPA, 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid; I4AA, imidazole-4-acetic acid; TIM, triose-phosphate isomerase; Se-Met, selenomethionine; CCD, charge-coupled device; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 4The abbreviations used are: IPA, 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid; I4AA, imidazole-4-acetic acid; TIM, triose-phosphate isomerase; Se-Met, selenomethionine; CCD, charge-coupled device; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. + H2O → N-formimino-l-glutamic acid (catalyzed by imidazolonepropionase, EC 3.5.2.7) (Fig. 1A); 4) N-formimino-l-glutamic acid + H2O → glutamate + HCONH2 (catalyzed by formiminoglutamase, EC 3.5.3.8).Among the four enzymes, the first three-dimensional structure determined was the 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of histidase or HutH from Pseudomonas putida by Schulz and co-workers in 1999 (7Schwede T.F. Badeker M. Langer M. Retey J. Schulz G.E. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Schwede T.F. Retey J. Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5355-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It was found that there was a polypeptide modification, forming a novel catalytically essential electrophilic group. The second structure was of urocanase or HutU, also from P. putida, and the structure was determined by the same group who solved the histidase in 2004 (9Kessler D. Retey J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The third structure solved was the last enzyme in the histidine degradation pathway, formiminoglutamase or HutG from Vibrio cholerae, which was determined by Wu et al. 5R. Wu, R. Zhang, C. Shonda, and A. Joachimiak, manuscript in preparation. 5R. Wu, R. Zhang, C. Shonda, and A. Joachimiak, manuscript in preparation. and deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 1XFK. The imidazolonepropionase or HutI is the only enzyme left in this pathway that has no published structural information so far, although some properties of this enzyme have been studied in Salmonella typhimurium (10Smith G.R. Halpern Y.S. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3320-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 11299 (11Rao D.R. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1961; 236: 2996-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and other organisms during 1960s and 1970s. The maximal activity of this enzyme occurred at pH 7.4 with a narrow pH optimum, and its Michaelis constant was calculated to be 7 μm (12Snyder S.H. Silva O.L. Kies M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2996-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also mentioned in the literature that 1 mm EDTA could not affect the enzyme activity, whereas 0.1 mm p-chloromercuribenzoate could inhibit the activity completely, and the inhibition could be reversed 12% by adding 0.3 mm reduced glutathione (12Snyder S.H. Silva O.L. Kies M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2996-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the enzyme was not a metalloprotein but a cysteine-dependent enzyme. In the following 20 years, there was no publication on the imidazolonepropionase until 1997, when Holm and Sander suggested that this enzyme could form a TIM barrel and belonged to a novel α/β barrel amidohydrolase superfamily based on the residue-by-residue optimal alignment and superimposition of the three-dimensional structures of urease, phosphotriesterase, and adenosine deaminase (13Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).Here we present the crystal structures of an imidazolonepropionase or HutI from B. subtilis, a native enzyme and an enzyme complex with its substrate analog imidazole-4-acetic acid (Fig. 1B), each to 2.0-Å resolution. This work reports the first crystal structures of the imidazolonepropionase family, and a catalytic mechanism has been proposed for this family of enzymes based on the high-resolution structures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation and Crystallization—Selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled imidazolonepropionase was prepared using the method described by Doublie (14Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), and both wild-type and Se-Met-substituted proteins were purified and crystallized using the same procedure reported previously (15Yu Y. Li L. Zheng X. Liang Y.H. Su X.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sodium salt of a substrate analog, imidazole-4 acetic acid (I4AA) was purchased from Sigma (Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Number 56368-58-2). Crystals of the enzyme in complex with I4AA were obtained by co-crystallization, adding 50 mm I4AA into the mother liquor of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 2% (w/v) benzamidine hydrochloride.X-ray Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data of Se-Met enzyme crystal were collected on a MAR165 charge-coupled device detector at beamline BW7A, European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg outstation around the K-edge of selenium, and the exact wavelengths used in the data collection were determined by the fluorescence scan. The native crystal diffracted to better than 2.0 Å and belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 57.73 Å, b = 106.34 Å, c = 66.47 Å, β = 89.93°. The data of the complex crystal were collected to 2.0-Å resolution on a MAR165 charge-coupled device at beamline 3W1A, Beijing synchrotron radiation facilities. The complex crystal was isomorphous with the native enzyme crystal. Both types of crystals were flash-cooled and maintained at 100 K by a flow of cold nitrogen gas. All data sets were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK packages (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar).

Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The input diffraction data were prepared and converted for use in auto rickshaw using programs of the CCP4 suite (18Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). FA (normalized anomalous scattering magnitude) values were calculated using the program SHELXC (19Sheldrick G.M. Hauptman H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller R. Usón I. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. IUCr and Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 333-351Google Scholar). Based on an initial analysis of the data, the maximum resolution for substructure determination and initial phase calculation was set to 2.5 Å. All of the potential 24 selenium atoms were found using the program SHELXD (20Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The correct hand for the substructure was determined using the programs ABS (21Hao Q. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and SHELXE (22Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The occupancies of all substructure atoms were refined using the program MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994). The overall figure of merit of the final phases from MLPHARE was 0.287 before solvent flattening. The initial phases were improved using density modification and phase extension to 2.0-Å resolution using the program DM (18Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The figures of merit of the phases were 0.794 after density modification and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. 95% of the structure model was built automatically using the program ARP/wARP (23Perrakis A.

Ealick S. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag Press, Berlin1990: 189-195Google Scholar) manually. The refinement of the structure was performed using crystallography and NMR System (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) combined with manual rebuilding of the model. The reflections from 20.0 to 2.0-Å resolutions were used for refinement, and the sigma cut off of data used was set to 0. Eight percent of the total reflections were set aside as test set. The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined with the same strategy as the native enzyme structure. The coordinates of I4AA were obtained from IUCr, Crystal Structure Communications (27Okabe N. Hayashi T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1999; 55: 1142-1144Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and placed manually into the positive electron density map, and the model was further refined. The stereochemistry qualities of the two structures were checked by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).The figures in the paper were prepared by programs Pymol, ClustalX (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the model was assigned using the program DSSP (31Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12100) Google Scholar).X-ray Fluorescence Scan Analysis—To determine what kind of metal ion binds to the protein, fluorescence scan analysis of the protein solution used for crystallization was performed at beamline 911-3, MAX laboratory (Lund, Sweden). The wavelength ranges of the experiments were selected near the K-edge of Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Determination of the Native Enzyme and the Complex—The structure of B. subtilis imidazolonepropionase could be solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method using Se-Met-substituted protein. The crystals formed in the space group P21 with β angle nearly equal to 90°, and there were two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The Se-Met crystals diffracted to better than 2.0-Å resolution, and the structure model was finally refined to a crystallographic R-value of 18.8% (Rfree = 22.1%) when data from 20.0 to 2.0-Å resolution of the peak data set were used. The stereochemistry quality of the final model is reasonable as checked by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); only one residue, His-272, is in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot; however, this residue is well defined in the density maps and stabilized by hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues through water bridges. The final model shows residues 3-415 in both monomers. The two monomers are quite similar to each other with an r.m.s.d. (root mean square deviation) of 0.292 Å with 413 Cα atoms aligned. For the complex structure, the final Rcryst and Rfree values of the complex structure model were 0.185 and 0.216, respectively, and the stereochemistry quality of the final model was reasonable. The crystallographic and refinement information of the two structures were summarized in Table 1.The Overall Structure—The B. subtilis imidazolonepropionase consists of 421 amino acids and exists as homodimer (Fig. 2A), consistent with the result of gel filtration experiments (data not shown). The two molecules are closely packed around a two-fold symmetry axis. A total of 1904 Å2 of accessible area per monomer is buried in the dimer interface, accounting for about 12% of the entire surface area. Residues involved in the dimer interface are mainly from α-helices or loops protruding from the molecular surface; the interacting residues are 88-97, 133-141, 299-304, 327-351, 386-401 with mostly hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.FIGURE 2A, the structure of B. subtilis imidazolonepropionase dimer.

The TIM barrel domain, which is composed of eight parallel β-strands and eight α-helices, is somewhat distorted and interrupted by two insertions: residues 79-122 (Insertion I) between β1-strand and α1-helix, forming a coil and three helices; and residues 294-308 (Insertion II) between β7-strand and α7-helix, forming a helix and a coil. The β-strands and α-helices in the barrel are connected by two kinds of loops, the β-α loops (from β-strand to α-helix) and the α-β loops (from α-helix to β-strand). Comparatively, the β-α loops are much longer and more flexible than the α-β loops, and located at the entrance of the central cavity of the TIM barrel domain; it is thus likely that the β-α loops are more important for the enzyme activity. The structure-based sequence alignment and the topology diagram of the protein are presented as Fig. 2, C and D.The small β-sandwich domain, lying at the bottom of the barrel far from the central cavity as shown in Fig. 2B, is composed of two separate peptide segments from both N and C termini (residues 3-70 and 365-415). This domain is connected to the TIM barrel domain by two linkers: the first linker is a β-strand (residues 71-74, βE), and the second linker is an α-helix (residues 350-364, αE); an extra insertion (residues 389-398) in this domain including αF-helix interacts tightly with the neighbor subunit.The Substrate Binding Sites and Putative Active Center—Although the previous studies reported that EDTA did not affect the activity of the imidazolonepropionase (12Snyder S.H. Silva O.L. Kies M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2996-2998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implicating the enzyme was not a metalloprotein, we did observe a penta-coordinated metal ion in the density map (Fig. 3A), further confirmed by the anomalous difference Fourier map (data not shown). The metal ion is located in the central cavity of the TIM barrel and directly coordinated by His-80-Nϵ2, His-82-Nϵ2, His-249-Nϵ2, Asp-324-Oδ1, and a water molecule (W1 in Fig. 3A) with distances of 2.10 Å, 2.18 Å, 2.28 Å, 2.32 Å, and 2.02 Å, respectively (marked in Fig. 3C). These residues are fully conserved across different organisms (Fig. 2C). The metal-bound water also forms a hydrogen bond with Glu-252 through a water bridge (W2 in Fig. 3A). Later, the x-ray fluorescence scan of the enzyme gave clear absorption jump only at the spectrum over K-edge of Zn2+ (data not shown), which unambiguously demonstrated that this metal ion was a zinc ion.FIGURE 3Zinc and substrate binding sites of the enzyme. A, the native enzyme structure. B, the complex structure. The key residues and ligands were marked and represented in stick mode (carbon, cyan; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; and zinc, yellow). The Fo - Fc maps were calculated with zinc, water bound to zinc, acetate and I4AA molecules omitted and drawn at a contour level of 3σ. C, the superimposition of the native enzyme structure (carbon atoms in yellow) and complex structure (carbon atoms in cyan). The distances marked are from the native enzyme structure, indicating the zinc coordination and the salt bridge between acetate ion and the residue Arg-89.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Close to the cavity center of the TIM barrel, an acetate ion was also observed (Fig. 3A); this acetate ion was most likely from the crystallization buffer containing 0.2 m sodium acetate. This acetate was quite close to the zinc ion site (about 6 Å away) and formed very nice salt bridges with Arg-89-Nη1 (2.95 Å) and Arg-89-Nη2 (2.29 Å). This scenario of zinc ion plus the acetate ion around the TIM barrel cavity center immediately suggested to us that this place was the active site because the acetate binding site could well be the binding site for the carboxyl group of IPA (see Fig. 1A), the substrate of the enzyme. Furthermore, the zinc ion with the coordinated water was positioned well for catalysis.To confirm the active site and elucidate the catalytic mechanism of the imidazolonepropionase, crystals of the enzyme in complex with its substrate analog I4AA were made, and their crystal structure was solved. The Fo - Fc density omit map clearly showed that I4AA molecule was bound to the enzyme at the same place where the acetate ion was bound in the native structure (Fig. 3, B and C). The overall structure of the complex is very similar to that of the native enzyme with an r.m.s.d. of 0.13 Å among 413 Cα atoms aligned in subunit A between the two structures. The only notable differences between the two structures are mainly from residues Arg-89, Glu-252, Tyr-102, and His-272 (Fig. 3C) caused by the insertion of I4AA molecule into the active site. In the complex structure, the zinc ion and the coordinated water molecule are located exactly at the same place as in the native enzyme structure. The carboxyl group of I4AA is located very close to the acetate binding site in the native enzyme structure, with about 0.6 Å shift toward the zinc site; so is the side chain of Arg-89, which still forms nice salt bridges with the carboxyl group of I4AA. Besides the salt bridges with Arg-89, I4AA forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr-102, Tyr-152, His-185, and Glu-252; these bonds keep the I4AA molecule in a correct orientation in the central cavity. The imidazole ring of the I4AA is positioned very close to the water molecule coordinated to zinc and replaces the water molecule (see Fig. 3C) bridging zinc-bound water and Glu-252 in the native structure, indicating a possible nucleophilic attack by zinc-activated water in the hydrolysis reaction.Among the residues involved in zinc and I4AA binding, consequently important to the enzyme function, most of them are located close to the central cavity of the TIM barrel as expected from many other TIM barrel enzymes with known structures and catalytic mechanisms. His-80, His-82, Arg-89, and Tyr-102 are from the Insertion I region; His-185, His-249, and His-272 are located at the C terminus of β-strands 3, 5, and 6, respectively; and Tyr-152, Glu-252, and Asp-324 are located in the β-α loops 2, 5, and 8, respectively (Fig. 2C). Insertion I (αA-, αB-, and αC-helices) lies as a lid on the entrance of central cavity (Fig. 2A), making the zinc and substrate binding site deeply buried in the molecule. The tight coordination and deep buried location could be the reason why the zinc ion was hard to dissociate from the enzyme with EDTA. Although Insertion I covers the central cavity, there is a narrow hydrophilic tunnel leading to the barrel core in the structure, which can be the entrance path for the substrate. Because the inserted helices connect to the TIM barrel through long loops, the entire region could be flexible and change to different conformations during hydrolysis reaction.Structural and Functional Homologs—In a search for related homologs of B. subtilis imidazolonepropionase using BLAST (32Lopez R.

In the present work, we have studied the effects of mutations in helix 34 both in vivo and in vitro. Several nucleotides in helix 34 that are either highly conserved or form important tertiary contacts in 16 S rRNA (U961, C1109, A1191, and A1201) were mutated, and the mutant ribosomes were expressed in the Escherichia coli MC250 Δ7 strain that lacks all seven chromosomal rRNA operons. Mutations at positions A1191 and U961 reduced the efficiency of subunit association and resulted in structural rearrangements in helix 27 (position 908) and helix 31 (position 974) of 16 S rRNA. All mutants exhibited increased levels of frameshifting and nonsense readthrough. The effects on frameshifting were specific in that -1 frameshifting was enhanced with mutant A1191G and +1 frameshifting with the other mutants. Mutations of A1191 moderately (∼2-fold) inhibited tRNA translocation. No significant effects were found on efficiency and rate of initiation, misreading of sense codons, or binding of tRNA to the E site. The data indicate that helix 34 is involved in controlling the maintenance of the reading frame and in tRNA translocation.

The data indicate that helix 34 is involved in controlling the maintenance of the reading frame and in tRNA translocation. Protein synthesis in bacteria entails four phases, initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling. The elongation cycle comprises three major steps. First, a complex of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 4The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-G, elongation factor G; IF, initiation factors; DMS, dimethyl sulphate; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide methyl-p-toluenesulphonate; h, helix; IC, initiation complex; WT, wild type. 4The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-G, elongation factor G; IF, initiation factors; DMS, dimethyl sulphate; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide methyl-p-toluenesulphonate; h, helix; IC, initiation complex; WT, wild type. GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the A site of the ribosome carrying initiator fMet-tRNAfMet or peptidyl-tRNA in the P site. Once aminoacyl-tRNA is accommodated in the peptidyl transferase center, the peptide bond is formed rapidly, yielding deacylated tRNA in the P site and peptidyl-tRNA in the A site. The cycle is completed by translocation of the tRNA·mRNA complex catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G). During translocation, peptidyl-tRNA is displaced from the A site to the P site, whereas deacylated tRNA is moved from the P site to the E site and released from the ribosome. Following translocation, the ribosome enters another round of elongation or, when a stop codon is encountered, proceeds to termination.The ribosome is a molecular machine that undergoes strictly coordinated movements during translation (1Ogle J.M.

Cell. 1998; 92: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During decoding, the formation of the codon-anticodon duplex induces a conformational change at the decoding site and a global rearrangement of the 30 S domains, as shown by crystal structures of the 30 S ribosomal subunit (3Ogle J.M.

Tarry Jr., M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Conformational rearrangements of the 30 S subunit are important for the regulation of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and, thereby, for tRNA selection (3Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Tarry Jr., M.J.

After aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site and peptide bond formation, the interaction of EF-G with the ribosome induces structural changes of the ribosome that are related to translocation, as suggested by cryoelectron microscopy (7Agrawal R.K.

Although the resolution of the cryoelectron microscopy studies is generally not high enough to precisely identify the residues involved in the conformational changes, rearrangements seem to include an opening and closing of a putative mRNA channel (7Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Frank J. Agrawal R.K.

Nature. 2000; 406: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), as well as a number of other conformational rearrangements (12Tama F. Valle M. Frank J. Brooks III, C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Some of these movements involve regions of 16 S rRNA that constitute the A site, i.e. h34, h44, and h18.H34 of 16 S rRNA is located in the head of the 30 S subunit and forms part of the decoding region. Genetic studies suggested that mutations in h34 have multiple effects on ribosome function (14Moine H. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations at positions 1054, 1057, 1058, 1199, and 1200 affected cell growth rate, ribosome synthesis, and ribosome incorporation into polysomes and led to enhanced readthrough of stop codons as well as +1 and -1 frameshifting (14Moine H. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Prescott C.D. Kornau H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1567-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility of h34 seems to be important for translocation because the antibiotic spectinomycin, which binds to h34 and presumably interferes with its movements relative to h35 and h38, inhibits translocation (11Peske F. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Morgan E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In ribosome complexes with EF-G, which mimicked an early state of translocation, nucleotides 1054 and 1201 in h34 were protected from chemical modification, whereas no protections of these residues were found in the ground-state complexes before or after translocation (17Matassova A.B. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which the mobility of h34 may modulate functions of the ribosome is not known. In the present work, we introduced mutations at positions that seemed likely to act as pivots for h34 movements (Fig. 1) and examined the effects of the mutations on decoding, maintenance of the reading frame, and translocation, as well as on the ribosome structure as monitored by chemical footprinting.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBuffer and Reagents—Buffer A was composed as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2.

The mutated fragment was cloned back into the pSTL102 plasmid. The XL1 strain of E. coli was used for all genetic manipulations and phage growth. For the preparation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis, strain CJ236 was used as a host for M13 phage. Strain MC250 lacking chromosome-encoded rRNA and encoding a streptomycin-resistance mutation in S12 as selection marker (21Thompson J. Kim D.F. O'Connor M. Lieberman K.R. Bayfield M.A. Gregory S.T.

For the displacement of the prrnS12 plasmid originally present in the cells, transformants were grown on LB plates containing streptomycin. The loss of the prrnS12 plasmid was monitored by the loss of the kanamycin resistance encoded on the plasmid. The absence of wild-type rRNA in the cell was confirmed by primer extension analysis (22Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol.

Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9214-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). E. coli strain MC127 carrying one of the pSG plasmids was transformed by one of the plasmids carrying a mutation in the 16 S rRNA gene or the control plasmid pSTL102. The activity of β-galactosidase was determined from at least three independent experiments as described (24O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initiation complexes were purified and concentrated by centrifugation through 1.1 m sucrose cushions at 200,000 × g for 2 h on a Sorvall M120GX ultracentrifuge. To prepare pretranslocation complexes, ternary complex (see below) was added to the initiation complex, the incubation continued for 1 min at 37 °C to form a pretranslocation complex that was purified by ultracentrifugation as described above. Ternary complexes of EF-Tu·GTP and tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) or [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe were formed by incubating EF-Tu (30 μm), EF-Ts (0.02 μm), GTP (1 mm), phosphoenol pyruvate (3 mm), pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml), tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) (10 μm), ATP (3 mm), l-phenylalanine (30 μm), and S100 fraction (2% v/v) as a source of Phe-tRNA synthetase and were purified by gel filtration as described (20Rodnina M.V.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To prepare pretranslocation complexes, EF-Tu ternary complexes were prepared in the same way except that precharged purified [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (10 μm) was used and S100, ATP, and phenylalanine were omitted.Biochemical Assays—The amount of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe and f[3H]Met-tRNAfMet bound to ribosomes was determined by nitrocellulose filtration, applying aliquots of the reaction mixture to the filters (Sartorius), and washing with buffer A. Filters were dissolved, and radioactivity was measured in a QS361 scintillation mixture. Binding of the ternary complex to the ribosome was measured after a 1-min incubation at 20 °C. To quantify dipeptide formation, the reaction was quenched with 0.5 m KOH, and then the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, neutralized, and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a RP18 column (Merck, Darmstadt) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (26Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid-liquid scintillation counting. To induce translocation, EF-G was preincubated with 1 mm GTP for 15 min at 37 °C and added to the pretranslocation complex at the indicated concentrations. The extent of translocation (>85%) was determined by reaction with puromycin (1 mm puromycin, 10 s, 37 °C) (27Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Density gradients of 10-40% (w/v) sucrose were prepared in buffer A containing MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations (7, 14, or 21 mm). 100 μlof0.4 μm ribosome solution in the respective buffer were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °°C and loaded on top of the gradient. Centrifugation was carried out for 17 h at 21,000 rpm at 4 °°C (Beckman SW41 or SW28 rotors).In Vitro Frameshifting and Misreading Assays—To measure the frequency of -1 frameshifting and misreading on mutant ribosomes, mRNA constructs of the following coding sequence were used: AUGUUUUUG and AUGUUGUUU. Initiation complexes (0.2 μm) were incubated with 0.4 μm ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe and 0.05 μm EF-G for 1 min at 20 °C. The efficiency of -1 frameshifting (Efs) was calculated from the ratio of the tripeptide fMet-Phe-Phe to initiation complex (IC) formed on the AUGUUUUUG mRNA corrected for the -1 frameshifting frequency measured with wild-type ribosomes, Efs = ([fMet-Phe-Phemutant]/[ICmutant])/([fMet-Phe-PheWT]/[ICWT]). The misreading level was calculated from the ratio of the dipeptide fMet-Phe to initiation complex formed on the AUGUUGUUU mRNA corrected for the misreading frequency of wild-type ribosomes, E = ([fMet-Phemutant]/[ICmutant])/([fMet-PheWT]/[ICWT]).Kinetic Experiments—Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were performed in buffer A on an SX-18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) as described previously (6Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Savelsbergh A. Katunin V. Mohr D. Peske F. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1517-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of proflavin was excited at 470 nm and measured after passing KV 500 filters (Schott). With the apparatus used, time constants up to 500 s-1 could be measured. Experiments were performed by rapidly mixing equal volumes (60 μl of each) of ternary complex and ribosome complex at the indicated concentrations.Chemical Probing—DMS, kethoxal, and CMCT modifications were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C (28Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Ribosomal RNA was purified by repeated phenol extractions, and modified sites were determined by primer extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (28Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) using a set of oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers spaced such as to cover the entire length of 16 S rRNA.RESULTSChoice of Mutation Positions and Construction of Mutants— Bases of 16 S rRNA were exchanged at positions C1109, A1191, A1201, and U961 of h34 (Fig. 1A) for the following reasons. C1109 is located in the loop between h34, h35, and h38. C1109 is highly conserved and was predicted to form a tertiary contact with the G933-C1384 base pair (29Cannone J.J. Subramanian S. Schnare M.N. Collett J.R. D'Souza L.M. Du Y. Feng B. Lin N. Madabusi L.V. Muller K.M. Pande N. Shang Z. Yu N. Gutell R.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 2-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) in the neck region of 30 S subunit. In the high resolution crystal structures of the isolated 30 S subunit from Thermus thermophilus or the 70 S ribosome from E. coli, this tertiary contact is not present (3Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Tarry Jr., M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 30Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). It is possible that the contact between C1109 and the G933-C1384 base pair is present in 70 S ribosomes or that it forms at an intermediate stage of translation. The mutation C1109G is expected to prevent the formation of the tertiary contact.A1191 is a highly conserved nucleotide that is located at the junction of several 16 S rRNA helices, h34, and an element comprising h35/h36/h38, where the antibiotic spectinomycin binds (31Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The structures of the T. thermophilus 30 S subunit (3Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Tarry Jr., M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and the E. coli 70 S ribosome (30Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) suggest that A1191 may form hydrogen bonds with nucleotides in the vicinity, mainly G1068 and C1066, thereby stabilizing the structure of the decoding center. The three base replacements A1191C, A1191G, and A1191U that were tested are expected to affect the network of interactions in different ways (Fig. 1B).In the crystal structure of the 30 S subunit (3Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Tarry Jr., M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), the non-conserved nucleotide A1201 forms hydrogen bonds with the highly conserved nucleotide U961, and the Watson-Crick base pair U961-A974 deduced from the secondary structure predictions (29Cannone J.J. Subramanian S. Schnare M.N. Collett J.R. D'Souza L.M. Du Y. Feng B. Lin N. Madabusi L.V. Muller K.M. Pande N. Shang Z. Yu N. Gutell R.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 2-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) is not present. According to the crystal structure, the formation of a triple interaction A1201-U961-A974 seems possible, and this may affect the orientation of h34. Accordingly, three mutants were constructed, including the single mutations A1201U and U961A and the double mutation A1201U/U961A in which hydrogen bonds between the bases at positions 1201 and 961 should be restored, whereas the 961-974 base pair cannot be formed (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that somewhat different orientations of either A1201 or U961 were found in the two different 70 S E. coli structures reported recently (30Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar); however, in these orientations, mutations of A1201 or U961 are also expected to alter the structure of the region.Plasmids carrying mutations in h34 of 16 S rRNA in the rrnB operon were constructed in such a way that the C1192U mutation in 16 S rRNA that is carried by the original pSTL102 plasmid (32Triman K. Becker E. Dammel C. Katz J. Mori H. Douthwaite S. Yapijakis C. Yoast S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was reverted to the wild-type C1192; the same reversion to the wild-type sequence of h34 was performed in the control plasmid. Two plasmids, pSTL102(C1192), which carries the A2058G mutation in 23 S rRNA, and pLK35, coding for wild-type 16 S rRNA, were used as controls. The plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain MC250 that lacked all seven chromosomal rRNA operons and contained the gene for streptomycin-resistant S12 protein on the chromosome (21Thompson J. Kim D.F. O'Connor M. Lieberman K.R. Bayfield M.A. Gregory S.T. Green R. Noller H.F. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9002-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The latter marker was essential for plasmid exchange. The mutation in S12 (K42R) confers streptomycin resistance due to the loss of a direct contact to the antibiotic (K45R in T. thermophilus (31Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar)); the strain has essentially wild-type doubling times and no accuracy phenotype. The doubling times of strains expressing ribosomes with mutations at positions C1109, A1201, and U961 were essentially the same as of the parent strain, whereas mutations at position A1191 reduced the growth rate by about 30% (not shown).Intersubunit Interactions—To test whether mutations in h34 altered the interactions between 30 S and 50 S subunits, we studied subunit association by sucrose gradient centrifugation at different Mg2+ concentrations. At the Mg2+ concentrations used (7, 14, or 21 mm Mg2+), wild-type ribosomes were present as 70 S (Fig. 2), and the fraction of 30 S and 50 S subunits was negligible. Mutations at position C1109 and the double mutation A1201/U961 had no effect on subunit association. The single mutations A1191C and A1201U had a slight effect. The replacements A1191G, A1191U, and U961A impaired subunit association at low Mg2+ concentrations, and the formation of the respective 70 S ribosomes required elevated concentrations of Mg2+ (Fig. 2). 30 S subunits with the A1191G mutation were not fully associated to 70 S even at 21 mm Mg2+. However, all mutant ribosomes were able to bind mRNA and fMet-tRNAfMet, and the efficiency of initiation complex formation was about 80% in all cases (not shown). The rate of initiation complex formation, as studied by the fluorescence change of fluorescein attached to the 3′ end of the mRNA at position +12 from the initiator AUG codon, was not changed by any of the mutations (not shown).FIGURE 2Effect of mutations on subunit reassociation. 30 S and 50 S subunits were incubated in buffer A at 7 mm (black bars), 14 mm (gray bars), or 21 mm (white bars) Mg2+ and analyzed by sucrose density centrifugation at the respective Mg2+ concentration. The amount of free 30 S subunits relative to the total amount of 30 S subunits is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As h34 is not directly involved in intersubunit contacts, the defects in subunit association caused by h34 mutations presumably originate from effects on the structure of regions at the interface that are distant from h34. To identify regions of 16 S rRNA that were affected by the mutations, the structure of 16 S rRNA was probed by chemical modification. Isolated 30 S subunits, 70 S ribosomes formed upon the addition of wild-type 50 S subunits to 30 S subunits, and the respective 30 S and 70 S initiation complexes were treated with DMS and CMCT, and the modification pattern was analyzed by primer extension (28Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As ribosome reactivation is known to improve the functional activity of ribosome preparations, we compared ribosomes reactivated by heating for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of elevated Mg2+ concentrations (20 mm) (33Hogan J.J. Noller H.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with non-treated ribosomes. On the side of the 30 S subunit, h14, h20, h23, h24, h25, h27, h44, and h45 are involved in intersubunit bridges with the 50 S subunit. A number of these contacts can be monitored by chemical foot-printing. Most of the protected nucleotides are found in five extended stem-loop structures around positions 700 (h23), 790 (h24), 900 (h27), and 1408-1495 (h44) (34Merryman C. Moazed D. McWhirter J. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Position A908 in h27, which in wild-type 30 S initiation complexes was accessible for DMS modification, was protected upon binding of the 50 S subunit (34Merryman C. Moazed D. McWhirter J. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and this protection was abolished by the A1191G mutation (Fig. 3A). That mutant 30 S subunits efficiently formed 70 S ribosomes was further supported by the observation that residues A1413 and A1418 (Fig. 3B) as well as residues 700 and 790 (not shown) were equally well protected upon 70 S formation with wild-type and mutant 30 S subunits. Reactivities to other chemical reagents, kethoxal and CMCT, were not altered by the mutations in h34. These data indicate that mutations in h34 altered the structure or orientation of h27, thereby affecting intersubunit contacts and the efficiency of subunit association. Replacements A1201U, U961A, and A1201/U961 resulted in a strong enhancement of the reactivity of A974 against DMS (Fig. 3C), suggesting that tertiary interactions of these bases were disrupted by the mutations (possibly triple interactions between A1201, U961, and A974, as described above), and A974 was exposed by the resulting conformational change. The same modification patterns were observed upon reassociation of 30 S subunits with wild-type 50 S subunits or 50 S subunits from the pSRL102(C1192) strain that carried the A2058G mutation in 23 S rRNA (data not shown).FIGURE 3Structural changes at the interface side of the 30 S subunits.
