https://openalex.org/W2049637545,"Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent, debilitating panic attacks. In individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate. In a rat model of panic disorder, chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses. The dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin (ORX, also known as hypocretin), which have a crucial role in arousal, vigilance and central autonomic mobilization, all of which are key components of panic. Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model, and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX (Hcrt) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses. Moreover, we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of ORX in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety. Taken together, our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2014739744,"Excessive synaptic loss is thought to be one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta), a peptide secreted in an activity-modulated manner by neurons, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by removing dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, issues regarding the subcellular source of Abeta, as well as the mechanisms of its production and actions that lead to synaptic loss, remain poorly understood. In rat organotypic slices, we found that acute overproduction of either axonal or dendritic Abeta reduced spine density and plasticity at nearby ( approximately 5-10 mum) dendrites. The production of Abeta and its effects on spines were sensitive to blockade of action potentials or nicotinic receptors; the effects of Abeta (but not its production) were sensitive to NMDA receptor blockade. Notably, only 30-60 min blockade of Abeta overproduction permitted induction of plasticity. Our results indicate that continuous overproduction of Abeta at dendrites or axons acts locally to reduce the number and plasticity of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1990707414,"Descending projections from sensory areas of the cerebral cortex are among the largest pathways in the brain, suggesting that they are important for subcortical processing. Although corticofugal inputs have been shown to modulate neuronal responses in the thalamus and midbrain, the behavioral importance of these changes remains unknown. In the auditory system, one of the major descending pathways is from cortical layer V pyramidal cells to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain. We examined the role of these neurons in experience-dependent recalibration of sound localization in adult ferrets by selectively killing the neurons using chromophore-targeted laser photolysis. When provided with appropriate training, animals normally relearn to localize sound accurately after altering the spatial cues available by reversibly occluding one ear. However, this ability was lost after eliminating corticocollicular neurons, whereas normal sound-localization accuracy was unaffected. The integrity of this descending pathway is therefore critical for learning-induced localization plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1999825570,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C (CMT2C) is an autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by limb, diaphragm and laryngeal muscle weakness. Two unrelated families with CMT2C showed significant linkage to chromosome 12q24.11. We sequenced all genes in this region and identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the TRPV4 gene, C805T and G806A, resulting in the amino acid substitutions R269C and R269H. TRPV4 is a well-known member of the TRP superfamily of cation channels. In TRPV4-transfected cells, the CMT2C mutations caused marked cellular toxicity and increased constitutive and activated channel currents. Mutations in TRPV4 were previously associated with skeletal dysplasias. Our findings indicate that TRPV4 mutations can also cause a degenerative disorder of the peripheral nerves. The CMT2C-associated mutations lie in a distinct region of the TRPV4 ankyrin repeats, suggesting that this phenotypic variability may be due to differential effects on regulatory protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2064672822,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pleiotropic cytokine promoting inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling as well as regulation of immune responses. Although IL-1β contributes to growth and metastatic spread in experimental and human cancers, the molecular mechanisms regulating the conversion of the inactive IL-1β precursor to a secreted and active cytokine remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that NALP3 inflammasome is constitutively assembled and activated with cleavage of caspase-1 in human melanoma cells. Late stage human melanoma cells spontaneously secrete active IL-1β via constitutive activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and IL-1 receptor signaling, exhibiting a feature of autoinflammatory diseases. Unlike human blood monocytes, these melanoma cells require no exogenous stimulation. In contrast, NALP3 functionality in intermediate stage melanoma cells requires activation of the IL-1 receptor to secrete active IL-1β; cells from an early stage of melanoma require stimulation of the IL-1 receptor plus the co-stimulant muramyl dipeptide. The spontaneous secretion of IL-1β from melanoma cells was reduced by inhibition of caspase-1 or the use of small interfering RNA directed against ASC. Supernatants from melanoma cell cultures enhanced macrophage chemotaxis and promoted in vitro angiogenesis, both prevented by pretreating melanoma cells with inhibitors of caspases-1 and -5 or IL-1 receptor blockade. These findings implicate IL-1-mediated autoinflammation as contributing to the development and progression of human melanoma and suggest that inhibiting the inflammasome pathway or reducing IL-1 activity can be a therapeutic option for melanoma patients.

Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). Pro-IL-1β is then cleaved by caspase-1 to biologically active mature IL-1β, resulting in its release into the extracellular space, where it initiates the inflammatory response (4.Dinarello C.A.

A pioneering study to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling caspase-1 activity led to the identification and characterization of the “inflammasome,” an elaborate multi-protein complex whose assembly and activation is responsible for the recruitment and activation of caspases-1 and -5 (21.Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). Each inflammasome includes members of the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins. Diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and nonmicrobial danger-associated molecular patterns are sensed intracellularly by NLRs, resulting in oligomerization of NLRs. Following oligomerization, NLRs interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)), a central adaptor protein of inflammasome, through homotypic interactions of pyrin domain. ASC then interacts with pro-caspase-1 through its homotypic interactions of CARD domain, yielding cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1β to the active IL-1β (22.Tschopp J.

In the present study, we provide evidence that constitutively activated inflammasome mediates the conversion of the cytoplasmic (inactive) IL-1β precursor to a secreted and active form of IL-1β in human melanoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human melanoma cells from the late stage of the disease spontaneously secrete biologically active IL-1β in the absence of exogenous stimuli because of constitutive activation of the inflammasome and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. This feature falls into the category of autoinflammatory diseases, which may be unique to late stage melanoma. Caspase inhibitors (Z-VAD-FMK, Z-YVAD-FMK, and Z-WEHD-FMK) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and IL-1Ra (anakinra, Kineret®) was purchased from Amgen, Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate13-acetate (PMA), and muramyl dipeptide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human IL-1α was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Protein G-Sepharose beads were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-caspase-5 antibody (ab17825, rabbit polyclonal) was obtained from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Anti-human IL-1β antibody (affinity-purified goat polyclonal) and anti-caspase-1 p20 antibody (2225, rabbit polyclonal) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA), respectively. Anti-ASC antibody (rabbit polyclonal), anti-NALP1 antibody (mouse monoclonal) and anti-NALP3 antibody (mouse monoclonal) were from Alexis Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG and anti-goat IgG) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Human melanoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were established from different stages of disease progression in the laboratory of Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) with the exception of A375. WM35 and WM1552C are from “early stage melanoma” such as radial growth phase (RGP). Patients were cured by surgical removal of these primary lesions. Others are metastatically competent melanomas, either from “intermediate stage melanoma” such as vertical growth phase (VGP) primary tumors whose patients developed metastasis later (WM75, WM115, WM278, and WM793B) or from “late stage melanoma” such as distant metastasis (A375, HS294T, and 1205Lu). Melanoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) (except HS294T) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc.) (for HS294T) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The THP-1 cell line (derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient) was differentiated with 50 nm (31 ng/ml) PMA for 24 h before each experiment. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Astarte Biologics, Redmond, WA) were maintained in growth medium (catalog number 2015; Astarte Biologics). Human melanoma tissues were obtained from surgical specimens with patient consent under institutional review board-approved protocols, adhering to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. The tumors were processed for histological and biological analyses. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues using a goat polyclonal antibody against human IL-1β (R & D Systems). Briefly, 4-μm-thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized and hydrated. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed in 0.01 m citrate buffer (Antigen retrieval citra solution; BioGenex Laboratories, San Ramon, CA). The sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated with 10 μg/ml of primary antibody for overnight at 4 °C, followed by biotinylated donkey anti-goat IgG for 30 min and ABComplex/horseradish peroxidase avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. The immunoreactants were visualized with diaminobenzidine substrate. Hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for counter staining. Human tumors were minced into small pieces (∼2 mm3). Single cell suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 37 °C with intermittent vortex, followed by sequentially passing through 70- and 40-μm filters. Red blood cells were lysed using 1× red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience). Dead cells were removed with a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The cells were washed and subjected to biological analyses including ELISA and Western blotting. The cells were cultured in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) at 80% confluence. After 24 h, the supernatants (secreted IL-1β) were collected and centrifuged at 210 × g for 5 min. Intracellular IL-1β was assessed by lysing cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The lysate was then subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed by ELISA for IL-1β, IL-1α (R & D Systems), and IL-8 (CXCL8) (eBioscience). Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nalge Nunc International) were used. The limits of sensitivity were 1–2, 3.9, and 7.8 pg/ml for IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-8, respectively. They were also analyzed by a multiplex antibody bead kit for IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2; Invitrogen). The limits of sensitivity were 3 (IL-6), 3 (IL-8), and 10 pg/ml (MCP-1). Cytotoxicity was determined by CytoTox 96 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity = 100 × (experimental lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) − spontaneous LDH)/(maximum LDH − spontaneous LDH). The cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The lysates were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.4 μm) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 60 V for 1.5 h. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by the incubation with secondary antibodies. The blots were then developed with horseradish peroxidase substrate (West Femto Solution; Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature and analyzed using GelDoc 200 (Bio-Rad). The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were agitated with 5 μg of anti-ASC antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and mixed with protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of 50% slurry) overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, then mixed with SDS sample buffer, and heated to 90 °C for 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE. The samples were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then probed with antibodies. siRNA duplexes targeting ASC (Hs_PYCARD_5, CGGGAAGGTCCTGACGGATGA, and Hs_PYCARD_1, CAGCCTGGAACTGGACCTGCA) and scrambled siRNA for nonspecific gene silencing were from Qiagen. Transfection of siRNA duplexes (2 nm) was carried out using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, the medium was replaced to OptiMEM (300 μl), and the cells were incubated for additional 24 h. The supernatants and cell lysates were collected for ELISA analysis and Western blotting analysis, respectively. Melanoma conditioned media (MCM) were obtained from supernatants of human melanoma cells after 24 h of cultivation in OptiMEM and centrifuged at 210 × g for 5 min. THP-1 cells, seeded at 80% confluence, were cultured in MCM for 24 h, and the cell lysates were subjected to ELISA analysis. QCMTM Chemotaxis cell migration assay (Millipore, Temecula, CA) was used. 1205Lu MCM was obtained after 24 h of cultivation of 1205Lu cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 and added to serum-free RPMI 1640 in the feeder tray (lower well). THP-1 cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 were placed into migration chamber and cultured for 2 h. The cells that migrated to the underside or through the membrane were mixed with lysis buffer/CyQuant GR dye solution (Millipore), incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and analyzed with a fluorescence plate reader using a 480/520-nm filter set. HUVECs suspended in MCM-containing serum-free M199 medium were cultured for 17 h on polymerized growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). They were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Fisher) for 10 min at room temperature and visualized under microscope (40× magnification). The number of tube-like structures with closed networks of vessel-like tubes was counted by two observers independently. All of the experiments were replicated at least thrice. The results were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test to compare two groups. One-way analyses of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls tests were used to compare multiple groups. The data are presented as the means ± S.E., and differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. We analyzed the lysates and supernatants of nine human melanoma cell lines. Three metastatic (A375, HS294T, and 1205Lu) and one VGP (WM793B) melanoma cell lines were found to synthesize and secrete IL-1β (Fig. 1A). However, IL-1β secretion was not detectable in two VGP (WM278 and WM75) melanoma cell lines despite the presence of intracellular IL-1β. Neither IL-1β synthesis nor secretion was detected in one VGP (WM115) and two RGP (WM35 and WM1552C) melanoma cell lines. LDH levels in the supernatant were low, confirming that the release of IL-1β was not caused by cell death. To explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for secretion of IL-1β in melanoma, we selected two metastatic melanoma cell lines that secrete IL-1β, 1205Lu and HS294T cells, for further study. We examined the ability of TLR4 ligand (LPS) and IL-1 itself to stimulate IL-1 synthesis and release. Human recombinant IL-1α was used to measure the levels of endogenous IL-1β. PMA-primed THP-1 cells were used as a control. 1205Lu, HS 294T, and THP-1 cells synthesized and secreted IL-1β spontaneously, and the synthesis and secretion were significantly enhanced by the stimulation (Fig. 1B). LDH levels revealed that increased IL-1β release was not the result of increased cell death. For melanoma cells, IL-1α was more effective as a stimulant of IL-1β compared with LPS, whereas LPS was more effective for monocytic cells. To determine whether the inflammasome pathway is utilized in IL-1β secretion mechanisms in human melanoma cells, we first examined the expression of inflammasome components. Western blotting analysis revealed the expression of each component of the inflammasome in 1205Lu and HS294T cells (Fig. 2A). When stimulated with IL-1α, the synthesis of pro-IL-1β (31-kDa form) was increased. However, the levels of the inflammasome components were unchanged, suggesting that 1205Lu and HS294T cells contain constitutive inflammasome components without additional stimulation. ASC is required for NALP3 activation of caspase-1. To further explore the ASC interaction with NALP3, we immunoprecipitated ASC in cell lysates. PMA-primed THP-1 cells were used as a positive control. Immunoprecipitation revealed co-precipitation of NALP3 with ASC in THP-1, 1205Lu, and HS294T cells (Fig. 2B). NALP3 inflammasome assembly was detected even without IL-1α stimulation, suggesting that inflammasome is assembled constitutively in 1205Lu and HS294T cells. We then examined the cleavage and activation of caspases in 1205Lu and HS294T cells. Activated (cleaved) fragments of caspase-1 (p20) and caspase-5 (p20) were observed in the lysates of 1205Lu and HS294T cells without IL-1α stimulation (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the inflammasome is assembled and activated constitutively, resulting in activation and cleavage of caspases in IL-1β-secreting human melanoma cells. We next used siRNA to silence ASC. Scrambled siRNA served as a control. Knockdown of ASC resulted in 70 and 93% reduction of IL-1β secretion compared with control siRNA in 1205Lu and HS294T cells, respectively (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether IL-1β secretion from melanoma cells requires active caspase-1 and -5, caspase inhibitors were used in cultures of unstimulated as well as stimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, spontaneous and stimulated secretion of IL-1β were reduced by the pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD), caspase-1, 4 inhibitor (Z-YVAD), or caspase-1, 4, 5 inhibitor (Z-WHED). Slight cell death was observed at base line and after caspase inhibition in these cells. These data indicate that inflammatory caspases (caspase-1 and -5) are necessary for releasing IL-1β in human melanoma cells. Because both inactive IL-1β (uncleaved pro-IL-1β) and active (cleaved) IL-1β can be detected by IL-1β ELISA, we determined whether IL-1β secreted from melanoma cells is biologically functional. IL-1Ra was used to block the IL-1R, and as shown in Fig. 4A, there was a reduction of IL-1β synthesis (95% reduction) and release (79% reduction) in 1205Lu cells. These data suggest that active IL-1R signaling is responsible for constitutive IL-1β synthesis and release from melanoma cells. We also tested whether IL-1R signaling affects other cytokines/chemokines known to be associated with melanoma progression (30.Raman D. Baugher P.J. Thu Y.M. Richmond A. Cancer Lett. 2007; 256: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). When treated with IL-1Ra, 1205Lu cells produced and secreted 90% less IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. To define the biological role of melanoma-derived IL-1β and the downstream mediators induced by IL-1β in tumor microenvironment, we generated supernatants (MCM) of 1205Lu cells after 24 h of cultivation. MCM significantly enhanced the production of IL-1β (2.7-fold) and IL-1α (6.9-fold) in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4B). Whereas pretreating 1205Lu cells with IL-1Ra (MCM/IL-1Ra) abolished this effect, adding IL-1Ra to MCM (MCM+IL-1Ra) attenuated but did not abolish the effect, suggesting that not only melanoma-derived IL-1 itself but also the downstream mediators induced by IL-1 mediate the paracrine effect. We then examined the effect of melanoma-derived IL-1β and its mediators on macrophage chemotaxis. Whereas 1205Lu MCM enhanced chemotaxis of THP-1 cells 2.7-fold, the effect was abolished by pretreating 1205Lu cells with caspase inhibitors (Z-VAD or Z-YVAD) or IL-1R blockade (Fig. 4C). Adding caspase inhibitors or IL-1Ra into MCM showed no direct inhibitory effects on chemotaxis (data not shown). 1205Lu cells secreted IL-8, an enhancer and stimulator of angiogenesis (31.Li A. Dubey S. Varney M.L. Dave B.J. Singh R.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 32.Bar-Eli M. Pathobiology. 1999; 67: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When 1205Lu cells were treated with caspase inhibitors or IL-1Ra, the release of IL-8 was significantly inhibited (55% inhibition by caspase inhibitors and 91% inhibition by IL-1Ra) (Fig. 4D, left panel). HUVECs were also used to determine the effect of MCM on angiogenesis in vitro. Compared with medium alone (control), 1205Lu MCM induced 1.8-fold more tubular structures formed by HUVECs (Fig. 4D, center and right panels). However, tube formation was reduced when 1205Lu cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors or IL-1R blockade (Fig. 4D, center and right panels). Taken together, these data indicate the biological function of melanoma-derived IL-1β in a paracrine fashion. Because early and intermediate stage melanoma cell lines did not secrete IL-1β at base line, we examined the ability of LPS and IL-1 to induce IL-1 release from these cells. The secretion of IL-1β was induced by IL-1α in three VGP melanoma cell lines (WM278, WM75, and WM115) that did not secrete IL-1β at base line (Table 1). On the contrary, the secretion was not induced by IL-1α in RGP melanoma cell lines (WM35 an"
https://openalex.org/W1984397453,"Background The 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of mRNAs contain cis elements involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Over half of all mammalian genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites that lead to different 3′UTRs for a gene. Studies have shown that the alternative polyadenylation (APA) pattern varies across tissues, and is dynamically regulated in proliferating or differentiating cells. Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, in which differentiated cells are reprogrammed to an embryonic stem (ES) cell-like state, has been intensively studied in recent years. However, it is not known how 3′UTRs are regulated during cell reprogramming. Methods/Main Findings Using a computational method that robustly examines APA across DNA microarray data sets, we analyzed 3′UTR dynamics in generation of iPS cells from different cell types. We found that 3′UTRs shorten during reprogramming of somatic cells, the extent of which depends on the type of source cell. By contrast, reprogramming of spermatogonial cells involves 3′UTR lengthening. The alternative polyadenylation sites that are highly responsive to change of cell state in generation of iPS cells are also highly regulated during embryonic development in opposite directions. Compared with other sites, they are more conserved, can lead to longer alternative 3′UTRs, and are associated with more cis elements for polyadenylation. Consistently, reprogramming of somatic cells and germ cells involves significant upregulation and downregulation, respectively, of mRNAs encoding polyadenylation factors, and RNA processing is one of the most significantly regulated biological processes during cell reprogramming. Furthermore, genes containing target sites of ES cell-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in different portions of 3′UTR are distinctively regulated during cell reprogramming, suggesting impact of APA on miRNA targeting. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these findings indicate that reprogramming of 3′UTRs by APA, which result from regulation of both general polyadenylation activity and cell type-specific factors and can reset post-transcriptional gene regulatory programs in the cell, is an integral part of iPS cell generation, and the APA pattern can be a good biomarker for cell type and state, useful for sample classification. The results also suggest that perturbation of the mRNA polyadenylation machinery or RNA processing activity may facilitate generation of iPS cells."

However, the underlying mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to sarcopenia have not been thoroughly investigated. To directly examine the role of chronic oxidative stress in vivo, we used a mouse model that lacks the antioxidant enzyme CuZnSOD (Sod1). Sod1(-/-) mice are characterized by high levels of oxidative damage and an acceleration of sarcopenia. In the present study, we demonstrate that muscle atrophy in Sod1(-/-) mice is accompanied by a progressive decline in mitochondrial bioenergetic function and an elevation of mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Sod1(-/-) muscle exhibits a more rapid induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and loss of myonuclei. Furthermore, aged Sod1(-/-) mice show a striking increase in muscle mitochondrial content near the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Despite the increase in content, the function of mitochondria is significantly impaired, with increased denervated NMJs and fragmentation of acetylcholine receptors. As a consequence, contractile force in aged Sod1(-/-) muscles is greatly diminished. Collectively, we show that Sod1(-/-) mice display characteristics of normal aging muscle in an accelerated manner and propose that the superoxide-induced NMJ degeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction are potential mechanisms of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2160647546,"Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy (SPSMA) and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type IIC (HMSN IIC, also known as HMSN2C or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C (CMT2C)) are phenotypically heterogeneous disorders involving topographically distinct nerves and muscles. We originally described a large New England family of French-Canadian origin with SPSMA and an American family of English and Scottish descent with CMT2C. We mapped SPSMA and CMT2C risk loci to 12q24.1-q24.31 with an overlapping region between the two diseases. Further analysis reduced the CMT2C risk locus to a 4-Mb region. Here we report that SPSMA and CMT2C are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 (TRPV4). Functional analysis revealed that increased calcium channel activity is a distinct property of both SPSMA- and CMT2C-causing mutant proteins. Our findings link mutations in TRPV4 to altered calcium homeostasis and peripheral neuropathies, implying a pathogenic mechanism and possible options for therapy for these disorders."

Here we report that mutations in the TRPV4 gene cause congenital distal SMA, scapuloperoneal SMA, HMSN 2C. We identified three missense substitutions (R269H, R315W and R316C) affecting the intracellular N-terminal ankyrin domain of the TRPV4 ion channel in five families. Expression of mutant TRPV4 constructs in cells from the HeLa line revealed diminished surface localization of mutant proteins. In addition, TRPV4-regulated Ca(2+) influx was substantially reduced even after stimulation with 4alphaPDD, a TRPV4 channel-specific agonist, and with hypo-osmotic solution. In summary, we describe a new hereditary channelopathy caused by mutations in TRPV4 and present evidence that the resulting substitutions in the N-terminal ankyrin domain affect channel maturation, leading to reduced surface expression of functional TRPV4 channels."

Using site-directed mutagenesis of the capsid surface, Asokan et al. generate a variant that efficiently transduces a wide range of muscle groups while avoiding the liver. Reengineering the receptor footprints of adeno-associated virus (AAV) isolates may yield variants with improved properties for clinical applications. We generated a panel of synthetic AAV2 vectors by replacing a hexapeptide sequence in a previously identified heparan sulfate receptor footprint with corresponding residues from other AAV strains. This approach yielded several chimeric capsids displaying systemic tropism after intravenous administration in mice. Of particular interest, an AAV2/AAV8 chimera designated AAV2i8 displayed an altered antigenic profile, readily traversed the blood vasculature, and selectively transduced cardiac and whole-body skeletal muscle tissues with high efficiency. Unlike other AAV serotypes, which are preferentially sequestered in the liver, AAV2i8 showed markedly reduced hepatic tropism. These features of AAV2i8 suggest that it is well suited to translational studies in gene therapy of musculoskeletal disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1978455510,"Functions have yet to be defined for the majority of genes of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent responsible for the most serious form of human malaria. Here we report changes in P. falciparum gene expression induced by 20 compounds that inhibit growth of the schizont stage of the intraerythrocytic development cycle. In contrast with previous studies, which reported only minimal changes in response to chemically induced perturbations of P. falciparum growth, we find that approximately 59% of its coding genes display over three-fold changes in expression in response to at least one of the chemicals we tested. We use this compendium for guilt-by-association prediction of protein function using an interaction network constructed from gene co-expression, sequence homology, domain-domain and yeast two-hybrid data. The subcellular localizations of 31 of 42 proteins linked with merozoite invasion is consistent with their role in this process, a key target for malaria control. Our network may facilitate identification of novel antimalarial drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2069280713,"The authors detect cytosolic histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), a nuclear transcriptional repressor, in damaged axons in brains of humans with multiple sclerosis and of mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination. They show a cytotoxic mechanism in which the exported HDAC1 impairs mitochondrial transport, independent of its nuclear function. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in transcriptional repression. We detected cytosolic HDAC1 in damaged axons in brains of humans with multiple sclerosis and of mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination, in ex vivo models of demyelination and in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate and tumor necrosis factor-α. Nuclear export of HDAC1 was mediated by the interaction with the nuclear receptor CRM-1 and led to impaired mitochondrial transport. The formation of complexes between exported HDAC1 and members of the kinesin family of motor proteins hindered the interaction with cargo molecules, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial movement and inducing localized beading. This effect was prevented by inhibiting HDAC1 nuclear export with leptomycin B, treating neurons with pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity or silencing HDAC1 but not other HDAC isoforms. Together these data identify nuclear export of HDAC1 as a critical event for impaired mitochondrial transport in damaged neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2143196035,"Structural variants (SVs) are a major source of human genomic variation; however, characterizing them at nucleotide resolution remains challenging. Here we assemble a library of breakpoints at nucleotide resolution from collating and standardizing ~2,000 published SVs. For each breakpoint, we infer its ancestral state (through comparison to primate genomes) and its mechanism of formation (e.g., nonallelic homologous recombination, NAHR). We characterize breakpoint sequences with respect to genomic landmarks, chromosomal location, sequence motifs and physical properties, finding that the occurrence of insertions and deletions is more balanced than previously reported and that NAHR-formed breakpoints are associated with relatively rigid, stable DNA helices. Finally, we demonstrate an approach, BreakSeq, for scanning the reads from short-read sequenced genomes against our breakpoint library to accurately identify previously overlooked SVs, which we then validate by PCR. As new data become available, we expect our BreakSeq approach will become more sensitive and facilitate rapid SV genotyping of personal genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2066499437,"Therapeutic glycoproteins have played a major role in the commercial success of biotechnology in the post-genomic era. But isolating recombinant mammalian cell lines for large-scale production remains costly and time-consuming, due to substantial variation and unpredictable stability of expression amongst transfected cells, requiring extensive clone screening to identify suitable high producers. Streamlining this process is of considerable interest to industry yet the underlying phenomena are still not well understood. Here we examine an antibody-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) clone at single-cell resolution using flow cytometry and vectors, which couple light and heavy chain transcription to fluorescent markers. Expression variation has traditionally been attributed to genetic heterogeneity arising from random genomic integration of vector DNA. It follows that single cell cloning should yield a homogeneous cell population. We show, in fact, that expression in a clone can be surprisingly heterogeneous (standard deviation 50 to 70% of the mean), approaching the level of variation in mixed transfectant pools, and each antibody chain varies in tandem. Phenotypic variation is fully developed within just 18 days of cloning, yet is not entirely explained by measurement noise, cell size, or the cell cycle. By monitoring the dynamic response of subpopulations and subclones, we show that cells also undergo slow stochastic fluctuations in expression (half-life 2 to 11 generations). Non-genetic diversity may therefore play a greater role in clonal variation than previously thought. This also has unexpected implications for expression stability. Stochastic gene expression noise and selection bias lead to perturbations from steady state at the time of cloning. The resulting transient response as clones reestablish their expression distribution is not ordinarily accounted for but can contribute to declines in median expression over timescales of up to 50 days. Noise minimization may therefore be a novel strategy to reduce apparent expression instability and simplify cell line selection."
https://openalex.org/W2044368898,Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays an essential role in the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)- and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced IκB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Here we report that TNFα and IL-1β induce Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys<sup>158</sup> residue within the kinase domain. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys<sup>158</sup> residue <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys<sup>158</sup> residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with TAK1 wild type or a TAK1 mutant containing a K158R mutation revealed the importance of this site in TNFα and IL-1β-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys<sup>158</sup> is essential for its own kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction pathways in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation.

Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). TNF, as well as other members of this cytokine family, is a type II transmembrane protein, which self-assembles into noncovalently bound trimers (1.Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

TNF occurs also as a soluble trimeric protein, which is derived from the transmembrane form by limited proteolysis (1.Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

TNF is mainly released from activated macrophages and T-cells, but it can also be produced by a variety of other cell types, especially after contact with bacterial products. TNF interacts with two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which both belong to the TNF receptor superfamily. Whereas TNFR1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types, TNFR2 is typically found on immune and endothelial cells (3.Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Remarkably, soluble and transmembrane TNF differ in their capability to stimulate signaling via TNFR1 and TNFR2. Whereas transmembrane TNF (memTNF) triggers signaling potently via both TNF receptors, soluble TNF trimers (sTNF) only activate TNFR1 robustly and show none or only limited activity on TNFR2 (4.Grell M.

TNFR1 contains a death domain (DD) and utilizes this protein-protein interaction domain to recruit intracellular signaling proteins involved in the activation of proinflammatory pathways, but also in cell death induction. For example, activation of the classical NFκB pathway and the various MAP kinases by TNFR1 rely on recruitment of the DD-containing serine-threonine kinase RIP, the DD-containing adaptor protein TRADD, and a complex of the TRADD-interacting TRAF2 protein with cIAP1 and cIAP2 (3.Wajant H.

Notably, RIP has also been implicated in TNFR1-induced necrosis, and TRADD, together with FADD and caspase-8, is crucially involved in TNFR1-mediated apoptosis (3.Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). In general, the signaling mechanisms utilized by TNFR1 are biochemically well understood and the importance of the various signaling intermediates of TNFR1 have been verified in vivo in corresponding knock-out mice. In contrast to the detailed picture we have of TNFR1 signaling, the signaling mechanisms of TNFR2 are poorly defined. In fact, the mechanistically best investigated aspect of TNFR2 signaling is the capability of this receptor to modulate TNFR1 signaling. So, TNFR2 can specifically enhance TNFR1-mediated apoptosis by depletion of the NFκB-promoting/caspase-8 inhibitory TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex from TNFR1 via competitive recruitment to TNFR2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation (7.Duckett C.S.

In most of these reports, apoptosis was not directly triggered by TNFR2, but was mediated indirectly by up-regulation of transmembrane TNF, which then secondarily stimulated TNFR1 (16.Vercammen D.

There is further evidence from the rat-mouse cytotoxic T-cell hybridoma PC60 that TNFR2 can also induce cell death independently from TNFR1, but the underlying signaling mechanisms are unknown (18.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2904-2913PubMed Google Scholar). It is clearly evident from analyses of TNFR1 knock-out mice that TNFR2 activation alone is sufficient to stimulate most of the signaling pathways activated by TNFR1, including those leading to activation of NFκB, ERK, JNK, p38, and Akt. Accordingly, TNFR2 elicits a variety of non-apoptotic cellular responses in TNFR1-deficient T-cells and TNFR1-deficient endothelial cells. For example, TNFR2 is necessary for antigen-driven differentiation and survival of T-cells (19.Kim E.Y. Teh H.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6812-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20.Kim E.Y. Priatel J.J. Teh S.J. Teh H.S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TNFR2 further mediates up-regulation of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1/JE in endothelial cells (21.Chandrasekharan U.M. Mavrakis L. Bonfield T.L. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for a neuroprotective role of TNFR2 (26.Arnett H.A. Mason J. Marino M. Suzuki K. Matsushima G.K. Ting J.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 27.Fontaine V. Mohand-Said S. Hanoteau N. Fuchs C. Pfizenmaier K. Eisel U. J.

With regard to TNFR2-induced migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells a crucial role has been demonstrated for the tyrosine kinase BMX and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (29.Zhang R. Xu Y. Ekman N. Wu Z. Wu J. Alitalo K. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51267-51276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Activation of the latter has also been implicated in the neuroprotective effects of TNFR2 (28.Marchetti L. Klein M. Schlett K. Pfizenmaier K. Eisel U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32869-32881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The mammalian transcription factors of the NFκB family are homo- or heterodimers of p65/RelA, RelB, cRel, NFκB1/p50, and NFκB2/p52. The latter are released by limited proteasomal proteolysis from the precursor proteins p105 (p50) and p100 (p52) (30.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, NFκB dimers are retained in the cytoplasm by binding of inhibitors of the IκB family. The structural hallmark of IκBs is a repeat containing six or seven ankyrin domains that mediate interaction and inhibition of the NFκB proteins. Notably, in addition to their N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD), p105 and p100 also contain an IκB domain in their C terminus (30.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These precursor proteins can therefore act as IκBs. Activation of NFκBs, thus their translocation into the nucleus, occurs after IκB degradation or in the case of p105 and p100 after destruction of the IκB domain by limited processing. Degradation/processing of IκB proteins and p105 are triggered via the classical NFκB pathway (30.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this pathway, treatment with appropriate inducers, such as TNF, IL-1, or LPS results in stimulation of the kinase activity of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex composed of the scaffolding protein NEMO and the serine/threonine kinases IKK1 and IKK2. Phosphorylation of IκB proteins by the IKK complex then marks these inhibitory proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (30.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast, the alternative or noncanonical NFκB pathway, which triggers p100 processing and activation of p52-containing NFκBs, relies on phosphorylation of p100 by IKK1, independent from NEMO and IKK2 (30.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31.Hoffmann A. Natoli G. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6706-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Notably, TRAF2 is required by many stimuli to induce the classical NFκB pathway, whereas it elicits together with TRAF3 an inhibitory function in the noncanonical pathway (32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, TRAF3 recruits the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex to NIK, a MAP3K crucially involved in the activation of the noncanonical NFκB pathway (32.Sun S.C. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the resulting complex, the TRAF2-associated cIAPs ubiquitinate NIK and thereby trigger the proteasomal degradation of this protein. Receptors that activate the noncanonical NFκB pathway deflect the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex from the cytoplasm and thereby prevent degradation of newly synthesized NIK, which now stimulates IKK1 and p100 processing. Here, we show that membrane TNF, but not soluble TNF trimers, induces p100 processing by activation of TNFR2 in several cell lines and primary immune cells. This identifies the noncanonical NFκB pathway as a cellular TNF response that can be specifically assigned to TNFR2 and membrane TNF. NCTC, HEK293, HeLa, HeLa-TNFR2, EM-2, Kym1, and Jurkat-TNFR2 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (PAA, Pasching, Germany), containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Jurkat-TNFR2, HeLa-TNFR2, and HeLa-TNFR2-TRAF1 transfectants have been described elsewhere (8.Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). TNF mutations conferring specificity for TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively, have been described by Lötscher et al. (35.Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for soluble TNF. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). The various Flag-tagged variants of soluble TNF used in this study were produced in HEK293 cells and purified by affinity chromatography on anti-Flag mAb M2-agarose. The TRAF2-specific antibody, TRAF1, anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-RelB, anti-IκBα, and anti-lamin B were purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-tubulin was from Dunn Labortechnik (Asbach, Germany), anti-p100 from Upstate (Temecula, CA), anti-β-actin from Sigma, and anti-cRel and anti-NIK and anti-pIκBα from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). TNFR2-Fc was purchased from Wyeth Pharma (Münster, Germany). TNFR1-Fc was a kind gift from Pascal Schneider (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). The IKK2 inhibitor TPCA-1 was from Tocris Bioscience, (Ellisville, MO). NCTC cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding N-terminal YFP fusion proteins of non-cleavable membrane TNF variants (36.Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N. Gooding L. Kriegler M. Cell. 1990; 63: 251-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) binding both TNF receptors (YFP-TNFΔ1–12) or only TNFR1 (YFP-TNFΔ1–12(32W/86T)) or TNFR2 (YFP-TNFΔ1–12(143N/145R)) with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the supplier's protocol. An expression plasmid encoding soluble TNF was used as a control. After 48 h, expression of membrane TNF was verified by FACS analysis using a TNF-specific PE-conjugated antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) recognizing the various TNF variants irrespective of their TNF receptor specificity and a corresponding isotype control (mouse IgG1, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Transfected cells used for experiments were regularly >60% positive for expression of the various membrane TNF variant. Cells (2 × 104) were seeded in triplicate in 96-well tissue plates and were then either stimulated with TNF-expressing NCTC transfectants (2 × 104 per well) or with the indicated recombinant TNF variants. After 18 h of cell culture, supernatants were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and analyzed for IL-8 with a commercially available ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNFR2-expressing cells were either challenged in a 4:1 ratio with NCTC transfectants expressing the indicated TNF variant or with the recombinant purified forms of TNF. After the indicated time points, cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. For preparation of total cell lysates, cells were lysed in 4× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors I and II (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After sonification (10 pulses), samples were boiled for 5 min at 96 °C. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Protein binding sites on the membrane were further saturated by incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. Proteins of interest were finally detected by sequential incubation with primary antibodies of the indicated specificity and corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and visualization of antigen-antibody complexes using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Alternatively, IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Cells retained in a leukoreduction system chamber were subjected to Ficoll (PAA, Pasching, Germany) density gradient centrifugation to gain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). T-cells were isolated from PBMCs using a MACS separator and CD3-specific micro beads (Milteny Biotech, Auburn, CA). T-cells were controlled for purity by FACS analysis with a CD3-specific antibody (Milteny Biotech) and activated by stimulation with PHA (5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and IL-2 (20 units/ml, Chiron, München, Germany) for 7 days. HEK293 cells (25 × 106) were electroporated (4-mm cuvette, 250 V, 1800 μF, maximum resistance) in medium containing 40 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the different membrane TNF variants or the corresponding empty vector using an Easyject Plus electroporator (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Two days post-transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for TNF receptor specificity by FACS. In brief, transfectants were incubated on ice with Fc fusion proteins (4 μg/ml) of the extracellular domain of TNFR1 and TNFR2 for 30 min. TRAILR3-Fc (kind gift of Pascal Schneider, University of Lausanne, Switzerland) served as a negative control. Cells were washed three times and were then incubated (ice, 1 h) with 1 μg/ml anti-Fc-PE (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany). After removal of unbound anti-Fc-PE by washing cells three times with PBS, cell-bound receptor-Fc/anti-Fc-PE complexes were measured by FACS analysis (BD Callibur, BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Purified ligands (100 μl, 80–100 μg/ml) were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a BioSep-SEC-S3000 (300 × 7.8) gel filtration column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) equilibrated with PBS at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Calibration of the column was carried out with the column performance check standard aqueous SEC 1 solution (Phenomenex) containing bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), IgG (150 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa). HeLa-TNFR2 cells (∼105) were seeded on glass coverslips and cultured overnight at 37 °C. After incubation either with medium, Flag-TNF(32W/86T) for 45 min, or Flag-TNC-scTNF(143N/145R) for 18 h, cells were fixed with 2% formalin solution in PBS (10 min, room temperature), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and treated with 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (30 min, room temperature) to block nonspecific protein binding. Anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100 in PBS) anti-RelB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50 in PBS), and anti-p100 (Upstate, 1:100 in PBS) antibodies were then applied overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing three times for 5 min with PBS, cells were incubated with Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg Germany) in a 1:600 dilution in PBS (1 h, room temperature). Following another three rounds of PBS rinsing, cells were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) as antifading compound. Coverslips were imaged with a laser confocal setup (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) via a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 oil objective attached to a Axiovert 135TV microscope (both Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Göttingen, Germany). Mean nuclear and cytosolic fluorescence intensities were determined within a cell using ImageJ software. Ratios of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence were calculated from >120 cells for every condition in three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks with Tukey posthoc test by the use of SigmaStat 3.5 software (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Significance was assumed for p < 0.05. Binding of soluble TNF results in strong activation of TNFR1, but fails to stimulate robust TNFR2 signaling (3.Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). For other members of the TNF receptor superfamily that remained inactive/poorly active upon binding of their soluble trimeric ligands (e.g. CD95L and CD95, OX40L and OX40, APRIL and TACI, and TRAIL and TRAILR2), it has been observed that receptor activation becomes possible upon oligomerization of the soluble ligand molecules. In fact, bacterially produced preparations of His-tagged soluble TNF mutants recognizing TNFR2, which contains significant amounts of aggregated ligand trimers, activates TNFR2 (data not shown). As expected the corresponding eukaryotically produced secretable Flag-tagged trimeric variant of TNF(143N/145R) was unable to activate TNFR2 (Fig. 1D). Notably, Flag-tagged TNF(143N/145R) remained inactive despite oligomerization with anti-Flag antibody (data not shown), a treatment enabling Flag-tagged variants of CD95L (37.Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), OX40L (38.Müller N. Wyzgol A. Münkel S. Pfizenmaier K. Wajant H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2296-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), APRIL (39.Bossen C. Cachero T.G. Tardivel A. Ingold K. Willen L. Dobles M. Scott M.L. Maquelin A. Belnoue E. Siegrist C.A. Chevrier S. Acha-Orbea H. Leung H. Mackay F. Tschopp J. Schneider P. Blood. 2008; 111: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and TRAIL (40.Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wüest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schönherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to gain high activity on CD95, OX40, TACI, and TRAILR2. We recently observed that some soluble ligands of the TNF family benefit from covalent linkage of their subunits in a way resulting in strongly enhanced activity without overcoming, however, the need for oligomerization (38.Müller N. Wyzgol A. Münkel S. Pfizenmaier K. Wajant H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2296-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41.Berg D. Lehne M. Müller N. Siegmund D. Münkel S. Sebald W. Pfizenmaier K. Wajant H. Cell Death. Differ. 2007; 14: 2021-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that not only oligomerization, but also “stabilization” of the trimeric structure of TNF(143N/145R) is necessary to gain a highly active TNFR2-specific agonist. To achieve “stabilization” of the TNF(143N/145R) trimer, we used a single chain cassette, in which three TNF(143N/145R) domains were genetically linked by two short peptide linkers. To achieve self-assembly of the scTNF(143N/145R) cassette into oligomers of defined stoichiometry, we further linked the scTNF(143N/145R) cassette N-terminally with the Flag-tagged trimerization domain of chicken tenascin-C (TNC). The latter forms tightly packed trimers because of strong non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonding (42.Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Fischer D. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10602-10608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the huge majority (>95%) of Flag-TNC-scTNF(143N/145R) purified from cell culture supernatants by anti-Flag affinity chromatography eluted in gel filtration analysis with a molecular mass of 120–150 kDa, which is consistent with the expected self-assembly of three scTNF(143N/145R) cassettes in the formation of a defined species of molecules containing nine TNF domains (Fig. 1, A–C). To prove that the increased avidity of Flag-TNC-scTNF(143N/145R) compared with conventional Flag-TNF(143N/145R) does not compromise TNFR2 specificity conferred by the Flag-TNC-143N/145R mutation, we analyzed TNF-induced IL-8 production in HeLa cells, which express no TNFR2, and corresponding TNFR2 transfectants. Whereas conventional TNFR1-specific Flag-TNF(32W/86T) readily induced IL-8 production in both cell types, Flag-TNC-scTNF(143N/145R) induced IL-8 production only in the TNFR2-expressing HeLa variant (Fig. 1D). Flag-TNC-scTNF(143N/145R)-induced IL-8 production was significantly lower than those induced via TNFR1, but this was in good accord with earlier observations, indicating that TNFR2 is only a weak activator of the classical NFκB pathway in HeLa cells (8.Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Müller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently found that TRAF1 enhances the capability of TNFR2 to activate the classical NFκB pathway and to induce IL-8 production (33.Wicovsky A. Henkler F. Salzmann S. Scheurich P. Kneitz C. Wajant H. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1769-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore also"

Here, we analysed chemical and biological activity of P. aeruginosa Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) in clonal strains, including mucoid and non-mucoid phenotypes, isolated during a period of up to 7.5 years from a CF patient. Chemical structure by MS spectrometry defined lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lipid A and peptidoglycan (PGN) muropeptides with specific structural modifications temporally associated with CF lung infection. Gene sequence analysis revealed novel mutation in pagL, which supported lipid A changes. Both LPS and PGN had different potencies when activating host innate immunity via binding TLR4 and Nod1. Significantly higher NF-kB activation, IL-8 expression and production were detected in HEK293hTLR4/MD2-CD14 and HEK293hNod1 after stimulation with LPS and PGN respectively, purified from early P. aeruginosa strain as compared to late strains. Similar results were obtained in macrophages-like cells THP-1, epithelial cells of CF origin IB3-1 and their isogenic cells C38, corrected by insertion of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). In murine model, altered LPS structure of P. aeruginosa late strains induces lower leukocyte recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage and MIP-2, KC and IL-1beta cytokine levels in lung homogenates when compared with early strain. Histopathological analysis of lung tissue sections confirmed differences between LPS from early and late P. aeruginosa. Finally, in this study for the first time we unveil how P. aeruginosa has evolved the capacity to evade immune system detection, thus promoting survival and establishing favourable conditions for chronic persistence. Our findings provide relevant information with respect to chronic infections in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2003868977,"Apelin plays a prominent role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. To explore further upstream the role played by this peptide, nonpeptidic agonists and antagonists of the apelin receptor are required. To identify such compounds that do not exist to date, we used an original fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to screen a G-protein-coupled receptor-focused library of fluorescent compounds on the human EGFP-tagged apelin receptor. This led to isolated E339-3D6 that displayed a 90 nM affinity and behaved as a partial agonist with regard to cAMP production and as a full agonist with regard to apelin receptor internalization. Finally, E339-3D6 induced vasorelaxation of rat aorta precontracted with noradrenaline and potently inhibited systemic vasopressin release in water-deprived mice when intracerebroventricularly injected. This compound represents the first nonpeptidic agonist of the apelin receptor, the optimization of which will allow development of a new generation of vasodilator and aquaretic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2060163190,"Recording from hippocampal slices, the authors find that brief stimulation triggers long-lasting synaptic barrages in mossy cells and hilar interneurons that arise from persistent firing in semilunar granule cells. Transient stimulation of different entorhinal cortex pathways activated distinct assemblies of hilar neurons, representing a previously unknown mechanism of short-term information storage that persisted for up to 10 seconds. Here we found that perforant path stimulation in rat hippocampal slices evoked long-lasting barrages of synaptic inputs in subpopulations of dentate gyrus mossy cells and hilar interneurons. Synaptic barrages triggered persistent firing in hilar neurons (hilar up-states). We found that synaptic barrages originate from semilunar granule cells (SGCs), glutamatergic neurons in the inner molecular layer that generate long-duration plateau potentials in response to excitatory synaptic input. MK801, nimodipine and nickel all abolished both stimulus-evoked plateau potentials in SGCs and synaptic barrages in downstream hilar neurons without blocking fast synaptic transmission. Hilar up-states triggered functional inhibition in granule cells that persisted for more than 10 s. Hilar cell assemblies, identified by simultaneous triple and paired intracellular recordings, were linked by persistent firing in SGCs. Population responses recorded in hilar neurons accurately encoded stimulus identity. Stimulus-evoked up-states in the dentate gyrus represent a potential cellular basis for hippocampal working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2094658769,"Changes in emotional state are known to alter neuronal excitability and can modify learning and memory formation. Such experience-dependent neuronal plasticity can be long-lasting and is thought to involve the regulation of gene transcription. We found that a single fear-inducing stimulus increased GluR2 (also known as Gria2) mRNA abundance and promoted synaptic incorporation of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in mouse cerebellar stellate cells. The switch in synaptic AMPAR phenotype was mediated by noradrenaline and action potential prolongation. The subsequent rise in intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive ERK/MAPK signaling triggered new GluR2 gene transcription and a switch in the synaptic AMPAR phenotype from GluR2-lacking, Ca(2+)-permeable receptors to GluR2-containing, Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors on the order of hours. The change in glutamate receptor phenotype altered synaptic efficacy in cerebellar stellate cells. Thus, a single fear-inducing stimulus can induce a long-term change in synaptic receptor phenotype and may alter the activity of an inhibitory neural network."
https://openalex.org/W3096977082,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a malignant astrocytic tumor associated with low survival rates because of aggressive infiltration of tumor cells into the brain parenchyma. Expression of the actin binding protein α-actinin has been strongly correlated with the invasive phenotype of GBM in vivo. To probe the cellular basis of this correlation, we have suppressed expression of the nonmuscle isoforms α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 and examined the contribution of each isoform to the structure, mechanics, and motility of human glioma tumor cells in culture. While subcellular localization of each isoform is distinct, suppression of either isoform yields a phenotype that includes dramatically reduced motility, compensatory upregulation and redistribution of vinculin, reduced cortical elasticity, and reduced ability to adapt to changes in the elasticity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Mechanistic studies reveal a relationship between α-actinin and non-muscle myosin II in which depletion of either α-actinin isoform reduces myosin expression and maximal cell-ECM tractional forces. Our results demonstrate that both α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 make critical and distinct contributions to cytoskeletal organization, rigidity-sensing, and motility of glioma cells, thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the observed correlation between α-actinin expression and GBM invasiveness in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2021369642,"With the availability of new generation sequencing technologies, bacterial genome projects have undergone a major boost. Still, chromosome completion needs a costly and time-consuming gap closure, especially when containing highly repetitive elements. However, incomplete genome data may be sufficiently informative to derive the pursued information. For emerging pathogens, i.e. newly identified pathogens, lack of release of genome data during gap closure stage is clearly medically counterproductive.We thus investigated the feasibility of a dirty genome approach, i.e. the release of unfinished genome sequences to develop serological diagnostic tools. We showed that almost the whole genome sequence of the emerging pathogen Parachlamydia acanthamoebae was retrieved even with relatively short reads from Genome Sequencer 20 and Solexa. The bacterial proteome was analyzed to select immunogenic proteins, which were then expressed and used to elaborate the first steps of an ELISA.This work constitutes the proof of principle for a dirty genome approach, i.e. the use of unfinished genome sequences of pathogenic bacteria, coupled with proteomics to rapidly identify new immunogenic proteins useful to develop in the future specific diagnostic tests such as ELISA, immunohistochemistry and direct antigen detection. Although applied here to an emerging pathogen, this combined dirty genome sequencing/proteomic approach may be used for any pathogen for which better diagnostics are needed. These genome sequences may also be very useful to develop DNA based diagnostic tests. All these diagnostic tools will allow further evaluations of the pathogenic potential of this obligate intracellular bacterium."

Absolute counts of subtypes of monocytes and of lymphocytes were determined after staining with monoclonal antibodies and analysis by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients and stimulated with various bacterial stimuli. Concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, interferon (FN)-alpha and of IFN-gamma were estimated in supernatants by an enzyme immunoassay. Infection by H1N1 was accompanied by an increase of monocytes. PBMCs of patients evoked strong cytokine production after stimulation with most of bacterial stimuli. Defective cytokine responses were shown in response to stimulation with phytohemagglutin and with heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae. Adaptive immune responses of H1N1-infected patients were characterized by decreases of CD4-lymphocytes and of B-lymphocytes and by increase of T-regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs).Infection by the H1N1 virus is accompanied by a characteristic impairment of the innate immune responses characterized by defective cytokine responses to S.pneumoniae. Alterations of the adaptive immune responses are predominated by increase of Tregs. These findings signify a predisposition for pneumococcal infections after infection by H1N1 influenza."

However, these approaches still require time-consuming procedures including transfection and drug selection, or costly synthetic molecules.Here we report an efficient and handy alternative for E. histolytica gene down-regulation mediated by bacterial double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting parasite genes. The Escherichia coli strain HT115 which is unable to degrade dsRNA, was genetically engineered to produce high quantities of long dsRNA segments targeting the genes that encode E. histolytica beta-tubulin and virulence factor KERP1. Trophozoites cultured in vitro were directly fed with dsRNA-expressing bacteria or soaked with purified dsRNA. Both dsRNA delivery methods resulted in significant reduction of protein expression. In vitro host cell-parasite assays showed that efficient downregulation of kerp1 gene expression mediated by bacterial dsRNA resulted in significant reduction of parasite adhesion and lytic capabilities, thus supporting a major role for KERP1 in the pathogenic process. Furthermore, treatment of trophozoites cultured in microtiter plates, with a repertoire of eighty-five distinct bacterial dsRNA segments targeting E. histolytica genes with unknown function, led to the identification of three genes potentially involved in the growth of the parasite.Our results showed that the use of bacterial dsRNA is a powerful method for the study of gene function in E. histolytica. This dsRNA delivery method is also technically suitable for the study of a large number of genes, thus opening interesting perspectives for the identification of novel drug and vaccine targets."
https://openalex.org/W2045444646,"Ataxin-1 (Atx1), a member of the polyglutamine (polyQ) expanded protein family, is responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Requirements for developing the disease are polyQ expansion, nuclear localization and phosphorylation of S776. Using a combination of bioinformatics, cell and structural biology approaches, we have identified a UHM ligand motif (ULM), present in proteins associated with splicing, in the C-terminus of Atx1 and shown that Atx1 interacts with and influences the function of the splicing factor U2AF65 via this motif. ULM comprises S776 of Atx1 and overlaps with a nuclear localization signal and a 14-3-3 binding motif. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of S776 provides the molecular switch which discriminates between 14-3-3 and components of the spliceosome. We also show that an S776D Atx1 mutant previously designed to mimic phosphorylation is unsuitable for this aim because of the different chemical properties of the two groups. Our results indicate that Atx1 is part of a complex network of interactions with splicing factors and suggest that development of the pathology is the consequence of a competition of aggregation with native interactions. Studies of the interactions formed by non-expanded Atx1 thus provide valuable hints for understanding both the function of the non-pathologic protein and the causes of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1967070205,"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) regulates dopamine (DA) bioavailability. Its product, L-DOPA, is an established treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that TH regulation influences locomotion. Site-specific phosphorylation of TH at ser31 and ser40 regulates activity. No direct evidence shows that ser40 phosphorylation is the dominating mechanism of regulating TH activity in vivo, and physiologically-relevant stimuli increase L-DOPA biosynthesis independent of ser40 phosphorylation. Significant loss of locomotor activity occurs in aging as in PD, despite less loss of striatal DA or TH in aging compared to the loss associated with symptomatic PD. However, in the substantia nigra (SN), there is equivalent loss of DA or TH in aging and at the onset of PD symptoms. Growth factors increase locomotor activity in both PD and aging models and increase DA bioavailability and ser31 TH phosphorylation in SN, suggesting that ser31 TH phosphorylation status in the SN, not striatum, regulates DA bioavailability necessary for locomotor activity.We longitudinally characterized locomotor activity in young and older Brown-Norway Fischer 344 F(1) hybrid rats (18 months apart in age) at two time periods, eight months apart. The aged group served as an intact and pharmacologically-naïve source of deficient locomotor activity. Following locomotor testing, we analyzed DA tissue content, TH protein, and TH phosphorylation in striatum, SN, nucleus accumbens, and VTA. Levels of TH protein combined with ser31 phosphorylation alone reflected inherent differences in DA levels among the four regions. Measures strictly pertaining to locomotor activity initiation significantly correlated to DA content only in the SN. Nigral TH protein and ser31 phosphorylation together significantly correlated to test subject's maximum movement number, horizontal activity, and duration.Together, these results show ser31 TH phosphorylation regulates DA bioavailability in intact neuropil, its status in the SN may regulate locomotor activity generation, and it may represent an accurate target for treating locomotor deficiency. They also show that neurotransmitter regulation in cell body regions can mediate behavioral outcomes and that ser31 TH phosphorylation plays a role in behaviors dependent upon catecholamines, such as dopamine."

https://openalex.org/W2128003746,"Mitochondria are thought to play a crucial role in the etiology of muscle insulin resistance (IR). The aim of this study was to gain more insight into the timing and nature of mitochondrial adaptations during the development of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced IR. Adult Wistar rats were fed HFD or normal chow for 2.5 and 25 wk. Intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) were quantified in vivo using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Muscle oxidative capacity was assessed in vivo using (31)P MRS and in vitro by measuring mitochondrial DNA copy number and oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria. MRS in tibialis anterior muscle revealed 3.3-fold higher IMCL content and 1.2-fold increased oxidative capacity after 2.5 wk of HFD feeding. The latter result could be fully accounted for by increased mitochondrial content. After 25 wk of HFD, maximal ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate plus malate remained unaffected, while IMCL and mitochondrial content had further increased compared to controls (5.1-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively). Interestingly, in vivo oxidative capacity at this time point was identical to controls. These results show that skeletal muscle in HFD-induced IR accompanied by IMCL accumulation requires a progressively larger mitochondrial pool size to maintain normal oxidative capacity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2025045229,"The adaptor protein APPL1 (adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology (PH), phosphotyrosine binding (PTB), and leucine zipper motifs) was first identified as a binding protein of AKT2 by yeast two-hybrid screening. APPL1 was subsequently found to bind to several membrane-bound receptors and was implicated in their signal transduction through AKT and/or MAPK pathways. To determine the unambiguous role of Appl1 in vivo, we generated Appl1 knock-out mice. Here we report that Appl1 knock-out mice are viable and fertile. Appl1-null mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios, without obvious phenotypic abnormalities. Moreover, Akt activity in various fetal tissues was unchanged compared with that observed in wild-type littermates. Studies of isolated Appl1(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that Akt activation by epidermal growth factor, insulin, or fetal bovine serum was similar to that observed in wild-type MEFs, although Akt activation by HGF was diminished in Appl1(-/-) MEFs. To rule out a possible redundant role played by the related Appl2, we used small interfering RNA to knock down Appl2 expression in Appl1(-/-) MEFs. Unexpectedly, cell survival was unaffected under normal culture conditions, and activation of Akt was unaltered following epidermal growth factor stimulation, although Akt activity did decrease further after HGF stimulation. Furthermore, we found that Appl proteins are required for HGF-induced cell survival and migration via activation of Akt. Our studies suggest that Appl1 is dispensable for development and only participate in Akt signaling under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2022868895,"We reported previously that islets isolated from individual, outbred Swiss-Webster mice displayed oscillations in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) that varied little between islets of a single mouse but considerably between mice, a phenomenon we termed ""islet imprinting."" We have now confirmed and extended these findings in several respects. First, imprinting occurs in both inbred (C57BL/6J) as well as outbred mouse strains (Swiss-Webster; CD1). Second, imprinting was observed in NAD(P)H oscillations, indicating a metabolic component. Further, short-term exposure to a glucose-free solution, which transiently silenced [Ca2+](i) oscillations, reset the oscillatory patterns to a higher frequency. This suggests a key role for glucose metabolism in maintaining imprinting, as transiently suppressing the oscillations with diazoxide, a K(ATP)-channel opener that blocks [Ca2+](i) influx downstream of glucose metabolism, did not change the imprinted patterns. Third, imprinting was not as readily observed at the level of single beta cells, as the [Ca2+](i) oscillations of single cells isolated from imprinted islets exhibited highly variable, and typically slower [Ca2+](i) oscillations. Lastly, to test whether the imprinted [Ca2+](i) patterns were of functional significance, a novel microchip platform was used to monitor insulin release from multiple islets in real time. Insulin release patterns correlated closely with [Ca2+](i) oscillations and showed significant mouse-to-mouse differences, indicating imprinting. These results indicate that islet imprinting is a general feature of islets and is likely to be of physiological significance. While islet imprinting did not depend on the genetic background of the mice, glucose metabolism and intact islet architecture may be important for the imprinting phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2155586887,"Background Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. Methodology/Principal Findings The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22±0.15, 1.12±0.15, 1.08±0.08, 1.12±0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (≤1.50, 1.51–3.00, 3.01–5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10±4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81–1.68) was clearly observed. Conclusions/Significance In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2018212012,"The receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is considered a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and promotes glucose and lipid metabolism in mature adipocytes. We recently identified the yeast Sterile 20 (Ste20) protein kinase ortholog, Map4k4, in an RNA interference-based screen as an inhibitor of PPARgamma expression in cultured adipocytes. Here, we show that RNA interference-mediated silencing of Map4k4 elevates the levels of both PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2 proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without affecting PPARgamma mRNA levels, suggesting that Map4k4 regulates PPARgamma at a post-transcriptional step. PPARgamma degradation rates are remarkably rapid as measured in the presence of cycloheximide (t(1/2) = 2 h), but silencing Map4k4 had no effect on PPARgamma degradation. However, depletion of Map4k4 significantly enhances [(35)S]methionine/cysteine incorporation into proteins, suggesting that Map4k4 signaling decreases protein translation. We show a function of Map4k4 is to inhibit rapamycin-sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. In addition, our results show mTOR and 4E-BP1 are required for the increased PPARgamma protein expression upon Map4k4 knockdown. Consistent with this concept, adenovirus-mediated expression of Map4k4 decreased PPARgamma protein levels and mTOR phosphorylation. These data show that Map4k4 negatively regulates PPARgamma post-transcriptionally, by attenuating mTOR signaling and a 4E-BP1-dependent mechanism."

Antibodies of the IgG class, with increasing significance as therapeutics, are glycosylated at a conserved site in the constant Fc region. We hypothesized that disruption of protein-carbohydrate interactions in the glycosylated domain of antibodies leads to the exposure of aggregation-prone motifs. Aggregation is one of the main problems in protein-based therapeutics because of immunogenicity concerns and decreased efficacy. To explore the significance of intramolecular interactions between aromatic amino acids and carbohydrates in the IgG glycosylated domain, we utilized computer simulations, fluorescence analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis. We find that the surface exposure of one aromatic amino acid increases due to dynamic fluctuations. Moreover, protein-carbohydrate interactions decrease upon stress, while protein-protein and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions increase. Substitution of the carbohydrate-interacting aromatic amino acids with non-aromatic residues leads to a significantly lower stability than wild type, and to compromised binding to Fc receptors. Our results support a mechanism for antibody aggregation via decreased protein-carbohydrate interactions, leading to the exposure of aggregation-prone regions, and to aggregation."

To investigate whether recent seasonal human or swine H1N1 vaccines could induce cross-reactive immune responses against infection with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, mice, ferrets or mini-pigs were administered with various regimens (once or twice) and antigen content (1.77, 3.5 or 7.5 microg HA) of a-Brsibane/59/07, a-CAN01/04 or RgCA/04/09xPR8 vaccine. Receipt of a-CAN01/04 (2-doses) but not a-Brisbane/59/07 induced detectable but modest (20-40 units) cross-reactive serum antibody against CA/04/09 by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays in mice. Only double administration (7.5 microg HA) of both vaccine in ferrets could elicit cross-reactivity (30-60 HI titers). Similar antigen content of a-CAN01/04 in mini-pigs also caused a modest approximately 30 HI titers (twice vaccinated). However, vaccine-induced antibody titers could not suppress active virus replication in the lungs (mice) or virus shedding (ferrets and pigs) of immunized hosts intranasally challenged with CA/04/09. Furthermore, neither ferrets nor swine could abrogate aerosol transmission of the virus into naïve contact animals. Altogether, these results suggest that neither recent human nor animal H1N1 vaccine could provide complete protectivity in all animal models. Thus, this study warrants the need for strain-specific vaccines that could yield the optimal protection desired for humans and/or animals."

BRAP2 inhibition of nuclear accumulation was dependent on phosphorylation sites flanking the respective NLSs, where substitution of the cyclin-dependent kinase site T124 of T-ag with Ala or Asp prevented or enhanced BRAP2 inhibition of nuclear import, respectively. Substitution of T427 within the NLS of ppUL44 gave similar results, whereas no effect of BRAP2 was observed on nuclear targeting of other viral proteins, such as herpes simplex virus-1 pUL30, which lacks a phosphorylation site near its NLS, and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein. Pulldowns/AlphaScreen assays indicated direct, high-affinity binding of BRAP2(442–592) to T-ag(111–135), strictly dependent on negative charge at T124 and the NLS.

Numerous studies also suggest that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) play a pathogenic role in SLE. However, it is unclear whether estrogen can modulate the function of PDCs to influence the development of SLE. In the present study, PDCs from murine spleens were treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) and CpG respectively or both in vitro, then cell viability, costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine secretion of PDCs, as well as stimulatory capacity of PDCs to B cells were analyzed. Results showed that E2 and CpG increased the cell viability and costimulatory molecule expression on PDCs synergistically. Moreover, the intracellular and extracellular secretion of IFN-α was increased by E2 or E2 plus CpG. In addition, E2 and CpG also increased the stimulatory capacity of PDCs to B cells, and the viability of B cells was decreased after neutralizing IFN-α significantly. In the experiments in vivo, mice received daily s.c. injections of E2 and CpG respectively or both, then we found that the plasma concentration of IgM were elevated by E2 and CpG synergistically and the expression of IFN-α/β in spleens were noticeably increased by CpG plus E2 compared with the treatment of E2 or CpG only. This study indicates that E2 could exacerbate PDCs' activation with CpG, which further activates B cells to upregulate susceptibility to autoantigens. IFN-α plays an important role in the stimulatory effect of PDCs on B cells. E2 stimulation of IFN-α production may result in female prevalence in autoimmune diseases such as SLE through activation of PDCs. This study provides novel evidence of relationship between estrogen and SLE and also sheds light on gender biases among SLE patients."
https://openalex.org/W2000202783,"Hemostasis is a defense mechanism which protects the organism in the event of injury to stop bleeding. Recently, we established that all the known major mammalian hemostatic factors are conserved in early vertebrates. However, since their highly vascularized gills experience high blood pressure and are exposed to the environment, even very small injuries could be fatal to fish. Since trypsins are forerunners for coagulation proteases and are expressed by many extrapancreatic cells such as endothelial cells and epithelial cells, we hypothesized that trypsin or trypsin-like proteases from gill epithelial cells may protect these animals from gill bleeding following injuries. In this paper we identified the release of three different trypsins from fish gills into water under stress or injury, which have tenfold greater serine protease activity compared to bovine trypsin. We found that these trypsins activate the thrombocytes and protect the fish from gill bleeding. We found 27 protease-activated receptors (PARs) by analyzing zebrafish genome and classified them into five groups, based on tethering peptides, and two families, PAR1 and PAR2, based on homologies. We also found a canonical member of PAR2 family, PAR2-21A which is activated more readily by trypsin, and PAR2-21A tethering peptide stops gill bleeding just as trypsin. This finding provides evidence that trypsin cleaves a PAR2 member on thrombocyte surface. In conclusion, we believe that the gills are evolutionarily selected to produce trypsin to activate PAR2 on thrombocyte surface and protect the gills from bleeding. We also speculate that trypsin may also protect the fish from bleeding from other body injuries due to quick contact with the thrombocytes. Thus, this finding provides evidence for the role of trypsins in primary hemostasis in early vertebrates."

Alternatively, a small minority survives by maintaining telomeric repeats through recombination among telomeres. The recombination-based telomere maintenance in trt1Delta cells is inhibited by the telomere protein Taz1. In addition, catalytically inactive full-length Trt1 (Trt1-CI) and truncated Trt1 lacking the T-motif and reverse transcriptase (RT) domain (Trt1-DeltaT/RT) can strongly inhibit recombination-based survival. Here, we investigated the effects of deleting the heterochromatin proteins Swi6 (HP1 ortholog) and Clr4 (Suv39 family of histone methyltransferases) and the telomere capping complex subunits Poz1 and Ccq1 on Taz1- and Trt1-dependent telomere recombination inhibition. The ability of Taz1 to inhibit telomere recombination did not require Swi6, Clr4, Poz1, or Ccq1. Although Swi6, Clr4, and Poz1 were dispensable for the inhibition of telomere recombination by Trt1-CI, Ccq1 was required for efficient telomere recruitment of Trt1 and Trt1-CI-dependent inhibition of telomere recombination. We also found that Swi6, Clr4, Ccq1, the checkpoint kinase Rad3 (ATR ortholog), and the telomerase regulatory subunit Est1 are all required for Trt1-DeltaT/RT to inhibit telomere recombination. However, because loss of Swi6, Clr4, Rad3, Ccq1, or Est1 did not significantly alter the recruitment efficiency of Trt1-DeltaT/RT to telomeres, these factors are likely to enhance the ability of Trt1-DeltaT/RT to inhibit recombination-based survival by contributing to the negative regulation of telomere recombination."

Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). Notch consists of a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors (Notch1–4), which can be activated by interaction with membrane-tethered ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag2 family expressed on neighboring cells (2.Lai E.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Notch is cleaved by γ-secretase (3.Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), releasing from the membrane the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) 3The abbreviations used are: NICDNotch intracellular domainAPPamyloid precursor proteinAPP-CTFAPP C-terminal fragmentAβamyloid β-peptideERendoplasmic reticulumKRBKreb's Ringer bicarbonatePC12pheochromocytoma12OAG1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerolPTBphosphotyrosine bindingPRRproline-rich regionROCreceptor-operated channelsiRNAsmall interfering RNASOCstore-operated channelTFWtrophic factor withdrawalTGthapsigarginTRPCtransient receptor potential channelDAPTN-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl esterPBSphosphate-buffered salineANOVAanalysis of varianceRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative RTSPRRshort PRRE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. that translocates to the nucleus. NICD associates with CSL (an acronym for the mammalian CBF-1, Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless and Caenorhabditis elegans Lag-1 transcription factors (4.Furukawa T. Maruyama S. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Cell. 1992; 69: 1191-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) to control the expression of target genes, most notably the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors belonging to the Hes (hairy and enhancer of split) (5.Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Herp (Hes-related protein) family (6.Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). These transcription factors in turn regulate the ability of the cells to respond to environmental clues. In the absence of Notch signaling, CSL represses transcription of Notch target genes, and following activation by Notch, CSL is converted into a transcriptional activator and activates transcription of the same genes (7.Schweisguth F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R129-R138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the Notch gene in mice results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality, supporting a major role for Notch in regulating cell fate (8.Conlon R.A. Reaume A.G. Rossant J. Development. 1995; 121: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Alterations in Notch signaling are associated with tumorigenesis suggesting that dysfunction of intracellular Notch prevents differentiation, ultimately guiding undifferentiated cells toward malignant transformation (9.Stylianou S. Clarke R.B. Brennan K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 10.Miele L. Golde T. Osborne B. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). One key regulator of Notch signaling is Numb, an evolutionarily conserved adapter protein identified by its ability to control cell fate in the nervous system of Drosophila (11.Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Loss of Numb expression has been shown to promote tumorigenesis (12.Pece S. Serresi M. Santolini E. Capra M. Hulleman E. Galimberti V. Zurrida S. Maisonneuve P. Viale G. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) suggesting that the function of Numb is important for limiting signaling through the Notch pathway. Numb is lost in >50% of human breast carcinoma samples, and its level is inversely correlated with grade and proliferation rate (12.Pece S. Serresi M. Santolini E. Capra M. Hulleman E. Galimberti V. Zurrida S. Maisonneuve P. Viale G. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Numb contains two protein-protein interaction domains, a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a proline-rich region (PRR) (13.Verdi J.M. Schmandt R. Bashirullah A. Jacob S. Salvino R. Craig C.G. Program A.E. Lipshitz H.D. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Whereas only one form of Numb has been identified in Drosophila, mammals produce four Numb isoforms that differ in the length of the PTB (lacking or containing an 11-amino acid insert) and PRR (lacking or containing a 48-amino acid insert) domains (13.Verdi J.M. Schmandt R. Bashirullah A. Jacob S. Salvino R. Craig C.G. Program A.E. Lipshitz H.D. McGlade C.J. Curr.

Emerging evidence supports the notion that the Numb isoforms are functionally significant and have different biologic effects (13.Verdi J.M. Schmandt R. Bashirullah A. Jacob S. Salvino R. Craig C.G.

Neuromolecular Med. 2002; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line, it was shown that expression of Numb isoforms with short PRR promote differentiation but not proliferation, whereas expression of Numb isoforms with long PRR promote proliferation but not differentiation (15.Verdi J.M. Bashirullah A. Goldhawk D.E. Kubu C.J. Jamali M. Meakin S.O. Lipshitz H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Expression of Numb isoforms that lack the insertion in the PTB (short PTB or SPTB) but not those with the insertion (long PTB or LPTB) increases neuronal vulnerability to apoptotic insults through a mechanism that involves perturbation of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis (16.Chan S.L. Pedersen W.A. Zhu H. Mattson M.P. Neuromolecular Med. 2002; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The intracellular messenger Ca2+ controls a vast array of cellular functions ranging from short term responses, such as motility and secretion, to longer term control of gene expression, cell division, and various metabolic reactions (17.Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another major role for Ca2+ is in cell death in physiological settings or during injury or diseases (18.Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 205-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19.Munaron L. Antoniotti S. Lovisolo D. J. Cell Mol.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control cellular Ca2+ dynamics are complex, with ion channels and pumps in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) playing major roles in regulating both rapid and long term changes in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Ca2+ entry is controlled by voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels, store-operated channels (SOCs), and receptor-operated channels (ROCs). The latter are classified according to the initial stimulus for channel activation. Whereas SOCs are recruited in response to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (22.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 23.Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), ROCs are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (24.Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although the exact molecular configuration of SOCs and ROCs has not been conclusively identified, much attention has been focused on the role of canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) subfamily in this process (25.Venkatachalam K. Montell C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 387-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The TRPC subfamily of proteins consists of seven mammalian TRPC isoforms numbered from 1 to 7 and is expressed in a variety of tissues, with surprisingly high levels of expression seen in the brain and heart (26.Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Functional studies showed that they form voltage-independent cationic channels with distinct gating and biophysical properties when heterogeneously expressed in various cell lines (26.Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Among the TRPC members, TRPC6 has been linked to diverse cellular functions, and its aberrant expression has been associated with various disease states such as cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and glomerulosclerosis (27.Kuwahara K. Wang Y. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3114-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 28.Inoue R. Jensen L.J. Shi J. Morita H.

Schiavi S. Henger A. Kretzler M. Shankland S.J. Reiser J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that the switch of Numb isoforms increases neuronal vulnerability to TFW-induced death by a mechanism that involves Notch-dependent transcription of TRPC6. Our results may have important implications for the development of therapeutic modalities to counteract perturbations of Ca2+ signaling in various disease states. Antibodies used for immunodetection of Notch and NICD were anti- Notch1 (G-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Val-177 anti-NICD (Upstate), respectively. The polyclonal antibodies to Numb were obtained from Santa Cruz (sc-15590) and Upstate (anti-pan-Numb). The antibodies to TRPC1–7 were kindly provided by Dr. Schilling (Case Western University). Additional antibodies included: anti-Rab5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and actin (Sigma). Immunofluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG) were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). All commercial antibodies were used within the concentration ranges recommended by the manufacturer. Additional reagents included: Lipofectamine 2000, TRIzol, and Opti-MEM I-reduced medium (Invitrogen); DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) and β-Secretase Inhibitor II (Calbiochem); oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), carbachol, cyclopiazonic acid, and thapsigargin (Sigma); SKF96365 and nifedipine (Tocris); ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences); propidium iodide, Hoechst, and Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes); and a γ-secretase fluorometric (EDANS/DABCYL) assay kit (R&D Systems). The pcDNA3.1 constructs for all four human Numb isoforms have been described previously (30.Pedersen W.A. Chan S.L. Zhu H. Abdur-Rahman L.A. Verdi J.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells were transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 with or without cDNAs for each of the human Numb isoforms. Stably expressing clones were selected with G418 and maintained as previously described (30.Pedersen W.A. Chan S.L. Zhu H. Abdur-Rahman L.A. Verdi J.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31.Kyriazis G.A. Wei Z. Vandermey M. Jo D.G. Xin O. Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. J. Biol.

Cultures were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, antibiotic, and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Trophic factor withdrawal (TFW) was accomplished by washing cultures four times (2 ml per wash) with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) with subsequent incubation in 1 ml of Locke's buffer (30.Pedersen W.A.

DAPT and FK506 were dissolved in DMSO and used to inhibit γ-secretase and calcineurin activity, respectively. Control cultures were treated with equivalent volumes of DMSO. Cell viability was assessed using the fluorescent DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 as described previously (32.Chan S.L. Fu W. Zhang P. Cheng A. Lee J. Kokame K. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28733-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cells were stained for 15 min at 37 °C with 2 μm propidium iodide and 5 μg/ml Hoechst dye in PBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted at microscope slides using DPX mounting medium for histology (Fluka) and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Fluorescent images of three random fields per coverslip were acquired, and morphologically distinct apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei were counted. The data from three independent experiments were statistically examined by paired t test and are expressed as means ± S.E. Cells were counted, and the percent cell death was assessed using a ratio of propidium iodide-stained cells to total number of cells. Stably transfected PC12 cells were cultured as described above to 50–70% confluency. TRPC3 and TRPC6 were knocked down using Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen): TRPC3, UCAUCUUCCUGGGUCUGCUUUGUGUU and TRPC6, AACAUUCCAAAGUCAAGCAUAUUCC. A Stealth RNAi Negative duplex with limited homology to any known sequences in human, mouse, and rat genomes was used as control (Invitrogen). Notch siRNA consisting of a pool of three to five target-specific sequences was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I-reduced medium for 24–48 h and then subjected to the experimental treatments described above. Real-time fluorescence measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were performed as described previously (16.Chan S.L. Pedersen W.A. Zhu H. Mattson M.P. Neuromolecular Med. 2002; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of 2.5 μm of the acetoxymethylester form of fura-2 (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C, washed three times with serum-free RPMI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted in a closed, heated chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon TSE 100 Eclipse). Cells were superfused with Krebs Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution containing (in mm): 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.57 MgSO4, 1.18 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, and 10 glucose. Cells were perfused for 15 min prior to beginning experiments to remove extracellular dye. Ratiometric measurement of fura-2 fluorescence was performed using a collimated light beam from a xenon arc lamp filtered at 340 and 380 nm and focused onto Cells via a 20× fluorescence objective (Super Fluor 20, Nikon). The fluorescence was collected from 30–50 cells simultaneously monitored. Only one field was used per dish. Protocols were executed, and data were collected on-line with InCyte software (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). Background fluorescence signals were collected at the same rate for the same wavelengths and were subtracted from the corresponding fluorescence images. In some experiments Ca2+ was omitted from the KRB buffer without (Ca2+-deficient buffer) or with 100 μm EGTA (Ca2+-free buffer). SOCE was induced by stimulation with thapsigargin (TG, 1 μm) as described previously (33.Chan S.L. Liu D. Kyriazis G.A. Bagsiyao P. Ouyang X. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37391-37403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34.Wang J. Shimoda L.A. Sylvester J.T. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: L848-L858Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Measurements were taken until [Ca2+]i reached resting level. Cells were then superfused with 2 mm Ca2+-containing KRB. Measurements were continued for 2–4 min after Ca2+ peak was recorded. In most instances, fluorescence ratios (fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 340 nm divided by that with excitation at 380) were reported. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and 1 μg of total extracted RNA was used for synthesis of first-strand cDNA using SuperScriptTM III RNase H reverse transcriptase and 1 μg of oligo(dT). Successively, 2 μl of each cDNA was PCR-amplified on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system by using SYBR Green PCR core reagents and 300 nm primers in a 25-μl reaction volume. PCR primers for the TRPC homologs were designed based on published sequences in GenBankTM (Table 1). The integrity of the RT-PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Melting curves for all TRPCs showed one specific peak. We used 18 S mRNA as an endogenous control to normalize variations in RNA extraction, the degree of RNA degradation, and variability in RT efficiency. We quantified the results with the comparative Ct method (35.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123232) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences of TRPC primers used for real-time RT-PCRTargetGenBankTM accession no.OrientationSequence (5′–3′)Predicted sizeNucleotide locationbpTRPC1AF061266ForwardCGACACCTTCCACTCGTTCA641716–1780ReverseGCGCTAAGGAGAAGATGTACCAGATRPC2NM017011ForwardGTTCCAGTTTCTCTTCTGGACCAT1901804–1994ReverseCAGCATCGTCCTCGATCTTCTTRPC3AB022331ForwardCATGCAGTGCAAAGACTTCGTAG74531–605ReverseTTCAGAATGGCTTCCACCTCTTTRPC4NM_080396ForwardCTCTGCAGATATCTCTGGGAAGAAT671514–1581ReverseCACGAGGCAGTATATGAATAAGAACTTTTRPC5AY064411ForwardTGAAACCCTTCAGTCACTCTTCTG1022038–2140ReverseAGTAGCTCCCACAAACTCCGTGTRPC6NM_053559ForwardAGTGTACAGAATGCAGCCAGAAAC79758–837ReverseCAGCCCTTTGTAGGCATTGATCTRPC7XM_225159ForwardCCCTTTAACCTGGTGCCGA1132665–2778 Open table in a new tab Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). Protein quantification, electrophoretic separation, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes were performed as described previously (33.Chan S.L. Liu D. Kyriazis G.A. Bagsiyao P. Ouyang X. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37391-37403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% milk in Tween Tris-buffered saline (TTBS)) overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories), and bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies included rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TRPC3 and TRPC6. Membranes were stripped and re-probed with the actin antibody to verify and normalize protein loading (50 μg of total protein, unless stated otherwise). For immunodetection of blots, enhanced chemiluminescence was applied. The intensity of the signals obtained was evaluated by densitometry and semiquantified using National Institutes of Health Image software based on the ratio between the intensity of the protein of interest divided by the intensity of actin in each experiment. Each experiment presented was repeated at least three times using different cell lysates. Following experimental treatments, cultured cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and for 1 h in blocking solution (0.02% Triton X-100, 5% normal horse or goat serum in PBS). After nonspecific binding was blocked, coverslips were incubated with a polyclonal antibody to TRPC6 or a polyclonal Numb antibody (1:500) in combination with a monoclonal antibody to the organelle marker Rab5 (early endosomes). All antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. After three washes, coverslips were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies and then mounted. Immunofluorescence staining was examined by confocal microscopy (Zeiss) using the ×63 oil immersion objective lens, and images were processed by using the imaging software. The activity of γ-secretase in cell extracts was determined using a commercially available secretase kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems). The method is based on the γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of a specific peptide conjugated to the fluorescent reporter molecules EDANS and DABCYL, which results in the release of a fluorescent signal that can be detected using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation at 355 nm/emission at 510 nm). The level of γ-secretase enzymatic activity is proportional to the fluorometric reaction (36.Arumugam T.V. Chan S.L. Jo D.G. Yilmaz G. Tang S.C. Cheng A. Gleichmann M. Okun E. Dixit V.D. Chigurupati S. Mughal M.R. Ouyang X. Miele L. Magnus T. Poosala S. Granger D.N. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cellular calcineurin phosphatase activity was measured using a commercial non-radioactive Calcineurin Cellular Activity Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Biomol). The RII phosphopeptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVpSVAAE) derived from the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase, was used as the substrate for calcineurin. PC12 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. After removal of free phosphate from the supernatant in the Desalting Column Resin, the lysates were incubated with RII phosphopeptide (1.64 mg/ml) in assay buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40 with 0.5 mm CaCl2 or with 10 mm EGTA. Purified recombinant calcineurin was used as the positive control. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of Biomol GREENTM reagent, and absorbance was measured at A620 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad). A standard curved was plotted as A620 nmversus nanomoles of PO4 (used as the standard). Calcineurin activity was determined by subtracting the EGTA-insensitive activity from total activity. Comparison between two groups was performed using Student's t test, whereas multiple comparisons between more than two groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests by least significant difference. Data evaluated for the effects of two variables was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Results are presented as means ± S.E. For all analyses, statistical significance is defined as a p value of ≤0.05. To determine whether the Notch pathway is activated in response to TFW, we measured the level of NICD, the activated form of Notch (1.Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar), by immunoblotting with the antibody Val-177, specific for NICD. In untreated cultures of PC12 cells, the NICD protein level was low but was rapidly up-regulated after TFW (Fig. 1A). Consistent with activation of the Notch pathway, the nuclear accumulation of NICD (supplemental Fig. S1) and the expression of the Notch downstream gene Hes1 (Fig. 1B) were detected after TFW. To further confirm the involvement of the Notch pathway in TFW-induced death, we employed the small molecule γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT to pharmacologically inhibit the proteolytic processing of Notch to NICD (36.Arumugam T.V.

https://openalex.org/W2084021513,"Background Control measures which reduce individual exposure to malaria are expected to reduce disease, but also to eventually reduce immunity. Reassuringly, long term data following community wide ITN distribution show sustained benefits at a population level. However, the more common practice in Sub-Saharan Africa is to target ITN distribution on young children. There are few data on the long term outcomes of this practice. Methodology/Principal Findings Episodes of febrile malaria were identified by active surveillance in 383 children over 18 months of follow up. In order to compare the short and long term outcomes of ITN use, we examined interactions between ITN use and age (12–42 months of age versus 42–80 months) in determining the risk of febrile malaria. ITN use and older age protected against the first or only episode of malaria (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.33, 95%CI 0.17–0.65 and HR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.17–0.51, respectively). The interaction term between ITN use and older age was HR = 2.91, 95%CI 1.02–8.3, p = 0.045, indicating that ITNs did not protect older children. When multiple episodes were included in analysis, ITN use and older age were again protective against malaria episodes (Incident Rate Ratio [IRR] = 0.43 95%CI 0.27–0.7) and IRR = 0.23, 95%CI 0.13–0.42, respectively) and the interaction term indicated that ITNs did not protect older children (IRR = 2.71, 95%CI 1.3–5.7, p = 0.008). Conclusions/Significance These data on age interactions with ITN use suggest that larger scale studies on the long term individual outcomes should be undertaken if the policy of targeted ITN use for vulnerable groups is to continue."

Inhibitors of cell cycle transitions are degraded to allow progression into the subsequent cell cycle phase. For example, the tyrosine kinase and Cdk1 inhibitor Wee1 is degraded during G2 and mitosis to allow mitotic progression. Previous studies suggested that the N terminus of Wee1 directs Wee1 destruction. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy, we report that multiple regions of Wee1 control its destruction. Most notably, we find that the activation domain of the Wee1 kinase is also required for its degradation. Mutations in this domain inhibit Wee1 degradation in somatic cell extracts and in cells without affecting the overall Wee1 structure or kinase activity. More broadly, these findings suggest that kinase activation domains may be previously unappreciated sites of recognition by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway.

The tyrosine kinase Wee1 inhibits mitotic entry, and its degradation is essential for exit from the G2 phase of the cell cycle (1.Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Here, Wee1 inactivates the mitosis-specific cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1-cyclin B complex during the S and G2 phases by phosphorylating Cdk1 at tyrosine 15. However, Wee1 activity is opposed by the phosphatase Cdc25, which removes phosphate from tyrosine 15 on Cdk1, thereby activating Cdk1-cyclin B at the G2-M transition (2.Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A major mechanism that tips the balance toward Cdc25 and mitotic entry is Wee1 degradation during G2, and as this occurs active Cdc25 and Cdk1-cyclin B form a positive feedback loop, which ensures that mitotic entry is unidirectional (3.Pomerening J.R. Sontag E.D. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 4.Pomerening J.R. Kim S.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 565-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, Wee1 degradation is an essential component of the Cdk1 activation circuit. Wee1 degradation has been observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Xenopus egg extracts, and somatic cells (5.McMillan J.N. Theesfeld C.L. Harrison J.C. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, the nuclei are required for proper Wee1 degradation, and the completion of DNA replication is required to achieve maximal rates of Wee1 degradation (6.Michael W.M. Newport J. Science. 1998; 282: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, Wee1 degradation is part of a sensing mechanism that signals the completion of the DNA replication phase, ensuring proper timing of entry into mitosis. For example, when DNA replication stalls, this fail-safe mechanism allows defects to be corrected before cells enter mitosis. Indeed, current theories suggest that many cancer cells have ineffective checkpoint pathways that cause them to divide with incompletely replicated DNA, which leads to genomic instability (12.Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.V. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. Kletsas D. Yoneta A. Herlyn M. Kittas C. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2005; 434: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion are the findings that wee1 knock-out mice are not viable and that wee1−/− cells undergo mitotic catastrophe (13.Tominaga Y. Li C. Wang R.H. Deng C.X. Int J Biol Sci. 2006; 2: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wee1 phosphorylation is required for its degradation and is regulated by the DNA replication checkpoint (6.Michael W.M. Newport J. Science. 1998; 282: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10.Ayad N.G. Rankin S. Murakami M. Jebanathirajah J. Gygi S. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here in the presence of the DNA replication checkpoint, Wee1 phosphorylation is negligible, whereas when DNA replication proceeds normally, Wee1 phosphorylation and degradation and mitotic entry are normal. One aspect of Wee1 degradation conserved between embryonic and somatic cell cycles is the requirement for SCF 3The abbreviations used are: SCFubiquitin ligase containing Skp1, cul1, and F box proteinβ-trcpβ-transducin repeat containing proteinMS/MStandem mass spectrometryE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. ubiquitin ligases that target Wee1 for destruction by the proteasome. Our prior studies uncovered a novel Wee1-interacting protein, Tome-1 (trigger of mitotic entry), which is required for Wee1 degradation during G2 and binds to Wee1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, as does the well characterized F-box protein β-trcp-1 (10.Ayad N.G.

Taniguchi M. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Redundant mechanisms regulate Wee1 degradation, because either β-trcp or Tome-1 depletion stabilizes Wee1 during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (11.Smith A. Simanski S. Fallahi M. Ayad N.G. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear which sequence elements target Wee1 for destruction via SCFβ-trcpversus Tome-1. For example, phosphorylation of serine 38 is required for degradation of Xenopus Wee1 in vitro and in vivo, yet this site is not conserved in human Wee1 (10.Ayad N.G. Rankin S. Murakami M. Jebanathirajah J. Gygi S. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15.Kim S.Y. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, the domain containing human Wee1 serine 53 and 123, which are required for association with β-trcp and degradation, is not conserved in Xenopus Wee1A (14.Watanabe N. Arai H. Nishihara Y.

Prior studies that have attempted to identify the sequences of SCF substrates required for degradation have relied on mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation sites necessary for interactions with SCF ubiquitin ligases. However, analyses are sometimes difficult because phosphorylated SCF substrates are efficiently targeted for degradation. Here we report a method for identifying sites required for substrate turnover, which relies on cell-based screens to detect stabilized protein targets following chemical mutagenesis. Using this method we show that the kinase activation domain of human somatic Wee1 is required for proper degradation during G2 and mitosis. Further, the Wee1 kinase activation domain and the newly identified sites required for its destruction are conserved, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily important mechanism that controls Wee1 proteolysis. Mutagenesis of the PGL3 vector-Wee1 was performed by treating 1-μg aliquots of plasmid DNA with 1 m hydroxylamine (hydroxylamine hydrochloride; Sigma), pH 6.7, for 70 min at 70 °C. The DNA was washed with the Qiagen Miniprep kit PB buffer with three extra washes with PE buffer to remove hydroxylamine. The washed Wee1-luciferase plasmids were transformed into MACH1 competent cells and plated as previously described for site-directed mutagenesis (16.Sato T.K. Panda S. Miraglia L.J. Reyes T.M.

Approximately 1,100 colonies were picked from these plates. 96 deep-well plates filled with Terrific Broth and carbenecillin (Sigma) from the NucleoSpin Robot-96 plasmid purification kit (Macherey-Nagel) were inoculated with one colony for each well and grown overnight at 37 °C in a shaker at 230 rpm along with transformed colonies with control constructs of unaltered pGL3Wee1-luciferase and pGL3 vector only. The resulting bacterial cultures were pelleted, and the plasmid was purified using the NucleoSpin Robot-96 plasmid purification kit (Macherey-Nagel) using the Microlab Star Robot (Hamilton). The resulting purified DNA clones were loaded into 96-well UV spectrometry plates, and the DNA concentrations were determined. The DNA was normalized using the Microlab Star (Hamilton) via dilution and spotted in quadruplicate onto 384-well plates (Corning) with the Minitrak from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, resulting in 40 ng of DNA/well. Asynchronous HeLa cells were harvested with trypsin, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. TransIT LT-1 (Mirus) transfection reagent was diluted in OptiMEM medium along with vector only DNA such that 85 ng of plasmid DNA and 125 μg of Mirus reagent were present per 20 μl of final mixture. The Mirus transfection reagent mixture was spotted with the Multidrop 384 (Titan) onto each 384-well plate in aliquots of 20 μl/well and incubated for 30 min. The HeLa cell/media mixture was spotted with the Multidrop 384 (Titan) onto each plate after transfection reagent DNA mixing in aliquots of 20 μl/well. The plates were covered with sterile metal lids with aerating holes and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for 20 h. A Brite-lite luminescence reporter gene assay system (PerkinElmer Life Science) was spotted with the Multidrop 384 (Titan) onto the 384-well plates in aliquots of 40 μl/well, and each plate was incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Each plate was read using the Analyst GT from Molecular Devices, and the relative luminescence values were determined. The relative luminescence values were taken for each well. The relative luminescence values were loaded and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. The Wee1 gene purchased from Invitrogen is the same as the NCBI (Wee1 tyrosine kinase; Homo sapiens; NP 003381), with the exception of base pair 256, which is an A, not a C. DNA purifications were performed using Qiagen Mini or Maxi prep kits according to the manufacturer's protocols. PCR purification and agarose gel extractions were performed using the Qiagen QIAquick kit. Wee1 was cloned using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites using standard protocols into the Myc-tagged pCS2 mammalian expression vector. The Wee1-luciferase construct was made through standard cloning of Wee1 from the pCS2 plasmid into the pGL3 luciferase expression vector (Promega) using EcoRI and XhoI. Wild-type and mutant Wee1 constructs were cloned into a modified pCS2-FLAG expression plasmid using EcoRI and NotI. The GC codon optimized opti-Wee1 construct was made by GenScript and was cloned into the cs2 Myc-tagged mammalian expression vector. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of Wee1 was performed using the following primers: FL483H, GGGCGATAGTCGTTTTCATGCAAATGAAGTTTTAC; RL483H, GTAAAACTTCATTTGCATGAAAACGACTATCGCCC; FS480A, CAAGTTGAAGAGGGCGATGCTCGTTTTCTTGCAAATG; RS480A, CATTTGCAAGAAAACGAGCATCGCCCTCTTCAACTTG; FS471A, GGCATGTAACAAGGATCGCAAGTCCACAAGTTGAAGAG; RS471A, CTCTTCAACTTGTGGACTTGCGATCCTTGTTACATGCC; FS472A, CATGTAACAAGGATCTCCGCTCCACAAGTTGAAGAGG; RS472A, CCTCTTCAACTTGTGGAGCGGAGATCCTTGTTACATG; FL483F, GAGGGCGATAGTCGTTTTTTCGCAAATGAAGTTTTACAG; and RL483F, CTGTAAAACTTCATTTGCGAAAAAACGACTATCGCCCTC. PCR was performed using the opti-Wee1 construct as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis PCR primers were used at a concentration of 125 nmol and opti Wee1 at 50 ng using KOD Hotstart DNA polymerase (EMD Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol, with the cycling program of one initial min at 95 °C, followed by 16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 6 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were digested with DpnI (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol for 3 h, and then the restriction enzyme mixtures were heat-inactivated. These digests were ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase at 15 °C. The ligations were transformed into MACH1 competent cells with a 10-min incubation on ice, a 1-min incubation at 37 °C, a 2-min incubation on ice, and 15 min of incubation shaking at 37 °C in 200 μl of SOC medium at 230 rpm. Transformations were plated onto LB plates containing 100 μg/liter carbenicillin (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitations were made from transfected 293 Freestyle cells (Invitrogen) and then were silver-stained using Pierce silver SNAP stain for mass spectrometry kit. Protein bands of Wee1 were excised, digested, and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Briefly, the excised bands were reduced and alkylated prior to trypsin digestion. Following digestion the peptides were extracted and taken to dryness. The digestion mixtures were reconstituted in 0.1 m acetic acid, loaded onto precolumns (360 mm outer diameter × 100 mm inner diameter fused silica; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with 3-cm irregular C18 (5–15 μm nonspherical; YMC, Inc., Wilmington, NC) and washed with 0.1 m acetic acid for 5 min before switching in-line with the resolving column (7-cm spherical C18; 360-mm outer diameter × 100-mm inner diameter fused silica). Once the columns were in-line, the peptides were eluted along a gradient from 2% to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid at an approximate flow rate of 350 nl/min. All of the samples were analyzed using a Thermo Electron LTQ (San Jose, CA). Electrospray was accomplished using a pulled fused silica emitter tip of ∼5 μm with a voltage of 1.7 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode with the top five most abundant ions in each spectrum selected for sequential MS/MS experiments. The exclusion list was used (1 repeat, 180-s return time) to increase dynamic range. All of the MS/MS spectra were searched with Sequest (version 2.7) using sample-dependent data bases. The searches were performed with a fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteine and variable oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine and threonine. The data base search results were tabulated and visually inspected for correct assignment using Scaffold version 1.7 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR). In vitro degradation assays were performed as previously described (17.Ayad N.G. Rankin S. Ooi D. Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown and synchronized as previously described (17.Ayad N.G. Rankin S. Ooi D. Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Five hours after the final thymidine release, HeLa cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in swelling buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm creatine phosphate, 0.4 mm ATP, pH 7.4, 0.04 mm EGTA, pH7.7, and protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma)) in a ratio of 1:0.75 of pellet volume to buffer volume and allowed to incubate on ice for 20 min. A small volume of unlysed cells were added to −20 °C 70% ethanol for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to determine cell cycle state (mitotic index was calculated by measuring phosphohistone H3 staining). Cell lysis was performed by Dounce homogenization, and complete cell lysis was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. The resulting cell lysates were passed through a 26.5-gauge needle and spun at top speed in a 4 °C tabletop centrifuge (∼21,000 × g) for 20 min. The resulting pellet was discarded, and the cell extract supernatant was saved for in vitro degradation assays. Radiolabeled in vitro translated proteins of Wee1 mutants were made using the Promega TnT SP6 coupled reticulate lysate system according to the manufacturer's directions for in vitro translation with 1 μg of Myc-tagged cs2 plasmid constructs. Degradation assays were assembled on ice with 20 μl of cell extracts, 1 μl of radiolabeled protein, and 1 μl of reaction mixture energy mix (150 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm ATP, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.7), cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma), and 0.1 mg/ml ubiquitin (Boston BioChem) in a 1:1:1 ratio). The reactions were moved from ice to room temperature, and the time points were taken by adding 4 μl of reaction mixture to 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol. Pulse-chase analysis was performed essentially as described (11.Smith A. Simanski S. Fallahi M. Ayad N.G. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with Myc-wild-type Wee1, Myc-S53A/123A-Wee1, Myc-S472A/L483F Wee1, Myc-K328M-Wee1 (9.Watanabe N. Arai H. Iwasaki J. Shiina M. Ogata K. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

An identical protocol was utilized for pulse-chase performed in supplemental Fig. S3. HeLa cells were plated at 40% confluency in 10-cm dishes with 10 ml of 1× HeLa medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin) containing 2 mm thymidine and grown in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 10% CO2 for 18–20 h. The cells were released from the thymidine block by washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline and adding 9 ml of Optimem to the plate for transfection. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection was done according to the manufacturer's instructions with 7 μg of pCS2+MT-HsOptiWee1, S472A mutant of Wee1, L483F mutant of Wee1, or vector alone. 1 μg of pCS2+eGFP was added to determine transfection efficiency (greater than 90% in all experiments). The cells were transfected shortly after release from the thymidine block, and the complexes were allowed to incubate with cells for 4–6 h. Each 10-cm transfected plate was then split into a 6-well dish and plated in 1× HeLa medium containing 2 mm thymidine and allowed to incubate for 18–20 h. The cells were released from the thymidine block, and the time points were collected every 2 h for 10 h by scraping cells in growth medium, washing once in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and snap freezing pellets in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS-containing sample buffer and processed for phosphohistone, Myc, or Skp-1 immunoreactivity. Anti-Myc (A-14; Santa Cruz), anti-Wee1(H-300; Santa Cruz), anti-skp1(H-163; Santa Cruz), anti-p-histone (H3) (Ser 10-R; Santa Cruz), ant-Cdk1 (9112; Cell Signaling), phospho-Y15-Cdk1 (9111S; Cell Signaling), and anti-green fluorescent protein (FL; Santa Cruz) rabbit polyclonal IgG were used as primary antibodies. Anti-rabbit IgG donkey IgG (GE Healthcare) was used as secondary antibody. Imaging of Western blots was performed using the GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus Western blotting detection system. We established a cell-based screening method to identify sites that control Wee1 degradation based on the studies of Sato et al. (16.Sato T.K. Panda S. Miraglia L.J. Reyes T.M. Rudic R.D. McNamara P. Naik K.A. FitzGerald G.A. Kay S.A. Hogenesch J.B. Neuron. 2004; 43: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), using a human Wee1-luciferase (Wee1-Luc) fusion as a surrogate to measure Wee1 turnover. C-terminal fusions of proteins with luciferase to measure degradation have been validated for a number of unstable proteins including cyclin B1 and p27Kip1 (18.Verma R. Peters N.R. D'Onofrio M. Tochtrop G.P. Sakamoto K.M. Varadan R. Zhang M. Coffino P. Fushman D. Deshaies R.J. King R.W. Science. 2004; 306: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19.Zhang G.J. Safran M. Wei W. Sorensen E. Lassota P. Zhelev N. Neuberg D.S. Shapiro G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat Med. 2004; 10: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed, we established that Wee1 is a very unstable protein relative to luciferase (supplemental Fig. S1) and that turnover of Wee1-Luc was very similar to that of Wee1 (supplemental Fig. S1). To identify mutations that might affect Wee1 turnover, we treated Wee1-Luc plasmid DNA with hydroxylamine and transformed Escherichia coli to isolate individual mutated plasmids whose concentration was normalized and spotted robotically on 384-well plates. Each clone (1,100 total) was then individually transfected into HeLa cells, which were cultured for 24 h before adding Brite-lite reagent (PerkinElmer Life Science) to simultaneously lyse cells and determine luminescence. We then retested any clone that gave a signal 1.5 times greater than that generated by wild-type Wee1-Luc. Once we identified the most stable Wee1-Luc constructs (those having the highest signal relative to wild-type Wee1 luciferase, shown in Fig. 1A), we sequenced the Wee1 coding region to identify potential mutations (supplemental Fig. S2). These mutations were then shuttled into Myc epitope-tagged Wee1 and assessed for their steady-state levels relative to wild-type, Myc-tagged Wee1 following transfection in HeLa cells. In asynchronous, S phase/G2 cells or mitotic cells, the three Wee1 mutants (R253H, R167Q/E273K, and the G106S/L483F) were more highly expressed than wild-type Wee1 (Fig. 1B), and here increased levels of protein directly correlated with increased luciferase activity of Wee1-Luc fusions, confirming that Wee1-Luc was an accurate surrogate of Wee1. To demonstrate that Wee1 degradation was indeed inhibited by these mutations, we measured the turnover of either Myc-wild-type Wee1 or the corresponding Wee1 mutant proteins in somatic cell extracts (Fig. 2). Extracts from S phase/G2-arrested HeLa cells were incubated with either in vitro translated 35S-labeled wild-type Wee1, R253H-Wee1, R167Q/E273K-Wee1, or G106S/L483F-Wee1. At specific intervals, the reactions were terminated, and their in vitro degradation rates were determined following SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Indeed all three of these mutants had reduced rates of turnover compared with wild-type Wee1 (Fig. 2), and their relative rates of degradation were inversely proportional to their steady-state levels (Fig. 1), with the G106S/L483F-Wee1 mutant having the slowest degradation rate. Because the G106S/L483F Wee1 mutant was the most stable (Fig. 1 and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3), we tested the contribution of glycine 106 or leucine 483 to Wee1 turnover. Mutating glycine 106 to serine did not affect the steady-state levels of Wee1, suggesting that changes in turnover were due to changing leucine 483. Indeed, mutation of leucine 483 to alanine, phenylalanine, or even histidine was sufficient to stabilize Wee1 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Phosphorylation of the N-terminal Wee1 residues serines 53 and 123 are important for its turnover (9.Watanabe N. Arai H. Iwasaki J. Shiina M. Ogata K. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14.Watanabe N. Arai H. Nishihara Y. Taniguchi M. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Given the locale of leucine 483 within the Wee1 kinase activation domain (residues 461–488) (20.Squire C.J. Dickson J.M. Ivanovic I. Baker E.N. Structure. 2005; 13: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we postulated that this domain was necessary for Wee1 destruction and that degradation might be mediated by phosphorylation of serines 471, 472, and/or 480 that reside within this domain. To test this notion, we initially performed liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis of immunopurified FLAG-tagged Wee1 expressed in 293F cells, which allowed us to express a sufficient quantity of protein for analysis. We demonstrated that serine 472 was indeed phosphorylated (Fig. 3B; phosphorylation of endogenous Wee1 has been recently reported by another group to be induced during mitosis) (21.Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z. Kéri G. Stemmann O. Mann M. Mol Cell. 2008; 31: 438-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of serine 472 to alanine led to marked increases in steady-state levels of the protein, and the same effects were also observed in S471A- and S480A-Wee1 mutants (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). When directly compared with the known S53A and S123A stabilizing mutations, the kinase activation domain mutants S471A, L483A (F, H), S472A, or S480A had much more profound effects on the steady-state levels of Wee1, and this was also the case for T257A (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3; for comparison we also mutated residue Thr257 to alanine, which was predicted to be phosphorylated by Prosite). Notably, pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that Wee1 turnover was severely impaired when we mutated serine 472 to alanine and leucine 483 to phenylalanine (Fig. 3D). Whereas ∼50% of wild-type Wee1 was turned over after 1 h, the S472A/L483F mutant remained stable during that time frame and continued to be more stable than wild-type Wee1 over 4 h. By contrast, the S53A/S123A mutant was only slightly more stable than wild-type Wee1. Therefore, serines within the kinase activation domain of Wee1, along with leucine 483, are required for proper Wee1 degradation in somatic cells. Possible explanations for the increased stability of the kinase activation domain mutants were that they disturbed Wee1 structure or kinase activity. To assess the structural consequences of these mutations, modeling and energy minimization of the Wee1 structure was performed and compared with that of wild-type Wee1 (20.Squire C.J. Dickson J.M. Ivanovic I. Baker E.N. Structure. 2005; 13: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, the L483F or S472A Wee1 mutant structures were very similar to wild-type Wee1 (Fig. 4A). Because the Wee1 N terminus is lacking in the Wee1 crystal structure, the affects of these mutations on structure and folding of the Wee1 N terminus could not be assessed. However, the S472A and L483F mutants did not affect the phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residue, serine 53, which is also required for Wee1 turnover in somatic cells (Fig. 4C). To test whether the S472 and L483 played critical roles in mitotic entry, HeLa cells expressing wild-type, S472A, or L483F Wee1 were synchronized at the G1/S transition by a double-thymidine block and were then released. Serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3 was then monitored to measure mitotic entry. As expected, control HeLa cells transfected with empty vector entered mitosis 6 h after thymidine release, and this was blocked in cells expressing wild-type Wee1 (Fig. 4B). Further, cells expressing the S472A or L483 Wee1 also failed to enter mitosis, and indeed here the block was slightly more complete than wild-type Wee1 (Fig. 4B). Therefore the mutations in the kinase activation domain that stabilize Wee1 do not affect its overall structure or function. To test the effects of these activation domain mutations on Wee1 kinase activity, FLAG-tagged wild-type, S472A, or L483F Wee1 were transfected into HeLa cells, and phosphorylation of endogenous Cdk1 by Wee1 was detected using a commercially available phospho-Y15-Cdk1 antibody. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4, wild-type Wee1 increased phosphorylation of Cdk1 to the same extent as the S472A or L483F mutant. Therefore, the effects of activation domain mutations on Wee1 turnover are independent of effects on kinase activity. Consistent with this notion, mutating serine 472 or leucine 483 in a kinase-inactive version of Wee1, K328M-Wee1 (9.Watanabe N. Arai H. Iwasaki J. Shiina M. Ogata K. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14.Watanabe N. Arai H. Nishihara Y. Taniguchi M. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), impaired turnover as judged by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 4C). Prior studies have suggested key roles for N-terminal serine residues of Wee1 (serines 53 and 123) in directing Wee1 destruction, yet the unbiased screen reported herein has established that the kinase activation domain also contributes to Wee1 turnover. Consistent with this notion, we find that an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking serines 53 and 123 is still rapidly turned over (supplemental Fig. S5). Thus, other domains of Wee1 contribute to harness its levels and may suggest that multiple ubiquitin ligases and kinases control Wee1 turnover. Such differential regulation may explain how Wee1 is controlled during mitotic entry, apoptosis, and development (22.Murakami M.S. Moody S.A. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Development. 2004; 131: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation domain, like the Wee1 N terminus, is a major site of Wee1 turnover. The precise mechanisms that control Wee1 remain unresolved. Both the N terminus and the activation domain of Wee1 contain or are proximal to putative PEST regions, which often contribute to degradation and are consistent with the observation that two or more substrate degrons are necessary to promote efficient binding of ubiquitin ligases (supplemental Fig. S6) (23.Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 24.Hao B. Oehlmann S. Sowa M.E. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol Cell. 2007; 26: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, one would predict that the binding of β-trcp and/or Tome-1 to Wee1 would be compromised by stabilizing mutations in the activation domain. However, we only detected slight defects in binding of β-trcp or Tome-1 to S472A or L483F Wee1, at least in vitro. 4L. Owens and N. G. Ayad, unpublished observations. This is perhaps due to the presence of N-terminal residues that provide an alternate docking site for these ubiquitin ligases. Alternatively, the S472A and L483F mutations may disrupt binding to another protein required for Wee1 turnover. Indeed, a recent paper demonstrates that cyclin A1/Cdk2 binds somatic Wee1 kinase at multiple sites including Leu483 and Arg611 (25.Li C. Andrake M. Dunbrack R. Enders G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 1: 116-130Google Scholar). These two sites were identified via our mutagenesis approach as required for Wee1 turnover (Fig. 1 and supplemental Figs. S2 and S7). Thus, these data suggest that cyclin A1/Cdk2 may be an important regulator of somatic Wee1 turnover. Cyclin A1/Cdk2 could control Wee1 degradation either by inducing Wee1 recognition by ubiquitin ligases or by inducing Wee1 transport to the cytoplasm where it is degraded. Consistent with the former possibility, we find that Cyclin A1/Cdk2 increases Wee1 recognition by Tome-1 and β-trcp (supplemental Fig. S8). Whether cyclin A1/Cdk2-dependent mechanisms contribute to the increased stability of the S472A and L483F mutants remains to be determined. However, the Wee1 activation domain is clearly required for efficient turnover of Wee1 and is linked to phosphorylation of at least one serine residue, serine 472. It will be important to determine whether such requirements are important in Wee1-directed control of embryonic cell mitotic entry and gastrulation (22.Murakami M.S. Moody S.A. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Development. 2004; 131: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The unbiased hydroxylamine-directed mutagenesis and cell-based screens described herein to assess Wee1 turnover can easily be applied to resolve the control of other cell cycle regulators. For instance, although phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187 was thought to direct recognition by an E3 ligase containing the ubiquitin ligase Skp-2, subsequent studies using a mouse knock-in model demonstrated that phosphorylation of this site was dispensable for control of p27Kip1 turnover (26.Malek N.P. Sundberg H. McGrew S. Nakayama K. Kyriakides T.R. Roberts J.M. Kyriakidis T.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although this may indicate that ubiquitin ligases other than Skp-2 such as Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex (KPC) regulate p27Kip1 destruction in vivo, Skp-2 mediated destruction of p27Kip1 may also require sites that have not been identified (27.Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Our cell-based means of identifying sites required for protein destruction can be easily implemented to identify these sites as well as those of virtually every unstable protein. Although hydroxylamine-mediated mutagenesis is ideally suited for cDNAs such as Wee1 that are GC rich because it specifically targets GC pairs (28.Tessman I. Poddar R.K. Kumar S. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 9: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we have also utilized error-prone PCR, which is more efficient than hydroxylamine at introducing random mutations, and have identified putative new degrons for p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. 5S.

To study the role of asparagine residues in the stabilization of antigen-antibody complexes, we examined the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and the corresponding HyHEL-10 variable domain fragment (Fv). We introduced Ala and Asp substitutions into the Fv side chains of l-Asn-31, l-Asn-32, and l-Asn-92, which interact directly with residues in HEL via hydrogen bonding in the wild-type Fv-HEL complex, and we investigated the interactions between these mutant antibodies and HEL. Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis showed that all the mutations decreased the negative enthalpy change and decreased the association constants of the interaction. Structural analyses showed that the effects of the mutations on the structure of the complex could be compensated for by conformational changes and/or by gains in other interactions. Consequently, the contribution of two hydrogen bonds was minor, and their abolition by mutation resulted in only a slight decrease in the affinity of the antibody for its antigen. By comparison, the other two hydrogen bonds buried at the interfacial area had large enthalpic advantage, despite entropic loss that was perhaps due to stiffening of the interface by the bonds, and were crucial to the strength of the interaction. Deletion of these strong hydrogen bonds could not be compensated for by other structural changes. Our results suggest that asparagine can provide the two functional groups for strong hydrogen bond formation, and their contribution to the antigen-antibody interaction can be attributed to their limited flexibility and accessibility at the complex interface.

IntroductionThe specific recognition of ligands by proteins is a fundamental biological phenomenon (1.Böhm H.J. Schneider G. Protein-Ligand Interactions: From Molecular Recognition to Drug Design (Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry). 1st Ed. 19. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2003: 21-51Google Scholar), and the interaction between antigen and antibody in the immune system is a typical example. Antibodies acquire their affinity and specificity for various target antigens by changing the amino acid residue composition of their six hyper-variable regions, known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) 3The abbreviations used are: CDRcomplementarity-determining regionHELhen egg white lysozymeVHvariable region of immunoglobulin heavy chainVLvariable region of immunoglobulin light chainFvfragment of immunoglobulin variable regionsITCisothermal titration calorimetryr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. The abbreviation used for the mutants is, for example, LN31A, which is the mutant of HyHEL-10 Fv in which Ala is substituted for Asn-31 in the VL chain. (2.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Bilofsky H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 4471-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite the small number of amino acid residues composing the CDRs, antibodies can precisely bind a large number of target antigens (3.Kabat E.A. Wu T. T Bilofsky H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6609-6616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these residues, serine and asparagine, for example, are located at specific positions in the CDRs in the germ line protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Many structural studies have shown that these residues are essential for the affinity and specificity of the antigen-antibody interaction (4.Padlan E.A. Proteins Struct. Funct.

There are various forces determining the affinity and specificity of these interfacial complementarities, including noncovalent bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions (17.Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol.

Among those noncovalent bonds, hydrogen bonds play a unique and functionally important role in molecular associations because of its involvement in both thermodynamic and kinetic processes. First, hydrogen bonds are strong and directional enough to control and direct the structures within molecular assemblies. Second, from a mechanistic point of view, the energy of hydrogen bonds, which is between that of van der Waals interactions and covalent bonds, allows biomolecules to associate and dissociate quickly at room temperature. These features of hydrogen bonds form the basis by which specific recognition is achieved quickly with moderate affinity (25.Desiraju G.R. Steiner T. The Weak Hydrogen Bond in Structural Chemistry and Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 343-440Crossref Google Scholar). Many studies show that hydrogen bonds play a significant role in a wide range of biomolecular interactions in terms of generating affinity and specific recognition (26.Fersht A.R. Shi J.P.

It is also reported that hydrogen bonds can make a favorable enthalpic contribution to protein-ligand interactions (32.Torigoe H. Nakayama T. Imazato M. Shimada I. Arata Y. Sarai A. J. Biol.

Thus, the subject of hydrogen bonding is of major interest in biological research.Here, we investigated the involvement of side chains of asparagine and serine in hydrogen bond formation. To elucidate the contribution of hydrogen bonds to the affinity and specificity of antigen-antibody interactions, mutagenesis in combination with both structural and thermodynamic analyses has been a productive and powerful strategy (35.Webster D.M. Henry A.H. Rees A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 123-129Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies can provide information on the structural complementary of the mutant antibody (or antigen) and its interaction with its counterpart (36.Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc.

In a previous study, we examined the role of indirect hydrogen bonds via interfacial water molecules in the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL interaction by thermodynamic analysis and x-ray structural analysis in combination with mutagenesis (48.Yokota A. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Kondo H. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5410-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We discovered that hydrogen bonds made a minor contribution by providing an enthalpic advantage to the interaction, despite the partial offset caused by entropy loss resulting from the hydrogen bonding stiffening the antigen-antibody complex (48.Yokota A. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Kondo H. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5410-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we further examined the role of hydrogen bonds in stiffening the antigen-antibody complex by focusing on the three residues Asn-31, Asn-32, and Asn-92 in the light chain, which have side-chain amide groups that participate in the formation of direct hydrogen bonds with residues in HEL (Fig. 1). Mutational analyses achieved by truncating these amide groups in the antibody side chains should give further insight into the effect of direct hydrogen bonding on complex formation. We constructed six Fv mutants, LN31D, LN31A, LN32D, LN32A, LN92D, and LN92A, and performed thermodynamic analyses of the interaction between these HyHEL-10 Fv mutants and HEL by means of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in combination with x-ray crystallographic analysis of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes. Based on our results, we elucidated the contribution of direct hydrogen bonds at the atomic level to the antigen-antibody interaction. We also discussed the role of interfacial asparagine residues in the antigen-antibody interaction with respect to their role in achieving specificity and affinity of antibodies for target antigens.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Fv FragmentsTo elucidate the role of interfacial asparagine residues in direct hydrogen bond formation in HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complexes, we constructed, expressed, and purified six mutant Fv fragments named LN31A, LN31D, LN32A, LN32D, LN92A, and LN92D. With the exception of LN32A and LN92A, we obtained purities of greater than 95%, and the final yields were greater than 10 mg/liter of culture. LN92A could not be expressed using the established expression system. Furthermore, the yield of LN32A was low following purification, despite the level of expression, and thus only a limited number of experiments were performed for LN32A.Inhibition of Enzymatic Activity of Hen Lysozyme by Mutant Fv FragmentsTsumoto and co-workers (42.Tsumoto K.

Thus, we investigated the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HEL by the wild-type Fv fragment and the five of the mutant Fv fragments LN31A, LN31D, LN32A, LN32D, and LN92D (Fig. 2). The wild-type Fv fragment and LN31D showed a similar level of inhibition of HEL enzymatic activity, and for LN92D this level was only slightly lower than that of the wild type. By comparison, the level of inhibition of HEL enzymatic activity shown by LN32D was notably lower than that of the wild type. LN31A and LN32A displayed no inhibitory activities toward HEL. These results suggest that the mutations harbored by LN31A, LN32A, and LN32D play an important role in target antigen affinity.FIGURE 2Inhibition of lysozyme enzymatic activity by HyHEL-10 Fv.

The thermogram for each experiment was obtained by titrating the HEL solution with the Fv solution and then subtracting the base line obtained from titrating buffer with the Fv solution (Fig. 3). Thermodynamic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the Asp substitution mutants LN31D (l-Asn-31) and LN92D (l-Asn-92), thermodynamic analysis revealed that a small loss in binding enthalpy (ΔΔH, 6.9 kJ mol−1 for LN31D, and ΔΔH, 5.1 kJ mol−1 for LN92D) and a smaller (close to zero) gain in binding entropy led to a minor loss in Gibbs energy of binding compared with the wild-type-HEL interaction, and it resulted in a small decrease in the binding affinity constants for LN31D (Ka, 17.8 × 107m−1) and LN92D (Ka, 14.0 × 107m−1). By comparison, for LN31A, LN32A, and LN32D there was a large decrease in negative binding enthalpy, and there was a decrease in binding entropy loss, which notably decreased the Gibbs energy of binding. These results indicated that the interaction between HEL and each Ala or Asp substitution in the Fv fragments at l-Asn-31, l-Asn-32, and l-Asn-92 led to unfavorable enthalpy changes and favorable entropy changes and that the enthalpy-entropy compensation reduced the loss in the Gibbs energy change, to some degree. For LN31A, LN32A, and LN32D, the large decrease in enthalpy change failed to maintain affinity for HEL, resulting in marked 600-, 500-, and 100-fold decreases in their binding affinity constant, respectively, compared with that of the wild type. The changes in heat capacity for LN31A, LN31D, LN32D, and LN92D, estimated from the values of enthalpy change of temperature dependence, were −2.35, −1.70, −1.01, and −1.68 kJ mol−1 K−1, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3Thermodynamic analyses of interactions between HyHEL-10 Fv mutants and HEL by isothermal titration calorimetry. Thermogram and titration curves for LN31A-HEL (A), LN32D-HEL (B), and LN92D-HEL (C) are shown.

Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of Mutant Fv-HEL ComplexesThe crystal structures of mutant HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complexes were solved at resolutions sufficient for determining local structural differences (1.8 Å) (supplemental Table S1). Most of the interfacial water molecules, which mediate the Fv-HEL interaction, were conserved among the mutant Fv-HEL and wild-type complexes (supplemental Table S2). Additional interfacial water molecules appear in the LN32D-HEL and LN92D-HEL complexes.Crystal structures of mutant HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complexes were superimposed onto the wild-type Fv-HEL complex by means of the LSQKAB (65.Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2308) Google Scholar) and COMPER programs in the CCP4 software suite (62.Collaborative Computational Project, No 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The resultant r.m.s.d. between C-α atoms of each mutant-HEL complex and that of the wild-type Fv-HEL complex are shown in Table 2. The structure of the LN31D-HEL complex is similar to that of the wild-type Fv-HEL complex, apart from the region containing 17–19 residues in HEL adjacent to its epitope, which is out of alignment in the other mutant Fv-HEL complexes (48.Yokota A. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Kondo H. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5410-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the LN32D-HEL and LN92D-HEL complexes is relatively distinct from that of the wild-type Fv-HEL complex. In LN32D-HEL and LN92D-HEL, the r.m.s.d. value for each polypeptide obtained by superposing the corresponding polypeptide and the r.m.s.d. value for the Fv fragment obtained by superposing Fv chains are very low. These observations indicate that the Asp substitution at l-Asn-32 and l-Asn-92 did not introduce drastic structural changes to the respective domains. However, the r.m.s.d. values for VL and/or VH, in the case of HEL fitting, and the r.m.s.d. values for HEL, in the case of Fv fitting, especially for the l-Asn-32 Fv-HEL complex, are moderately large. This finding shows that the orientation of VL and/or VH (in other words Fv) with HEL in the"

Transcriptional profiling of cancer SP cells isolated by H33342 fluorescence analysis is a newly emerging approach to discover cancer stem cell markers and aberrant differentiation pathways. Using Affymetrix expression microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we investigated differential gene expression between SP and non-SP (NSP) cells isolated from human mammary carcinoma cell lines. A total of 136 genes were up-regulated in breast cancer SP relative to NSP cells, one of which was the fetal stem cell factor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target SOX17. Strikingly, we discovered that SOX17 was down-regulated by H33342 in a dose-dependent manner. In SP cells, which expel H33342, down-regulation of SOX17 was less pronounced than in NSP cells, which retain H33342. As a result of this, SOX17 displayed a 10–20-fold overexpression in cancer SP relative to NSP cells. Similar results were obtained for further stemness-related genes, namely EPC1 and SPRY1. These findings establish a previously unidentified gene-regulatory impact of H33342 as a novel mechanism responsible for differential gene expression in cancer SP cells.

Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7808) Google Scholar). According to this concept, only cancer stem cells self-renew infinitely, whereas most of their progenies undergo aberrant differentiation and consecutively cease proliferation. Several lines of evidence suggest that tumor recurrence, chemoresistance, and metastasis are driven by a yet poorly defined subset of cancer stem cells (2.Dean M. Fojo T. Bates S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (3052) Google Scholar, 3.Weigelt B. Peterse J.L. van't Veer L.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). There is an enormous clinical interest in cancer stem cell assessment as a future tool in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer (4.Kakarala M. Wicha M.S. J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, with respect to human solid tumors, the development and evaluation of robust techniques for the detection of putative cancer stem cells are still awaited.

Thus, cancer SP cells are well established as bona fide cancer stem cells (24.Wu C. Alman B.A. Cancer Lett. 2008; 268: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Preliminary expression analyses suggested an up-regulation of stemness-related genes, such as NOTCH1, in cancer SP cells relative to NSP cells (11.Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R.

Recently, global transcriptional profiling of cancer SP versus NSP cells has emerged as a novel approach to discover surrogate markers of cancer stem cells and to dissect aberrant intratumoral differentiation pathways (14.Zhou J.

Using Affymetrix gene expression microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the present study investigated differential gene expression between cancer SP and NSP cells isolated from the CAL-51 and UACC-893 human mammary carcinoma cell lines. Here, we establish a previously unidentified gene-regulatory impact of H33342 as a novel mechanism responsible for differential expression of stemness-related genes in cancer SP cells. This is critical for the future understanding and evaluation of cancer SP cells as putative cancer stem cells. Hoechst 33342 side population non-SP reverse transcription ATP-binding cassette gene ontology. The human breast cancer cell lines CAL-51 and UACC-893 were obtained by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), respectively. Culture conditions and routine maintenance have been described previously (19.Christgen M. Ballmaier M. Bruchhardt H. von Wasielewski R. Kreipe H. Lehmann U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Proliferation capacity of cancer SP cells was determined using an assay previously described by Patrawala et al. (11.Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6207-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Briefly, sorted cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 1 cell/well using the robotic plating device of a MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). One week after the sort, wells with small colonies (defined as a cluster of ≥4 cells) were identified under a Labovert inverted phase contrast microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany), and colony sizes (cells/colony) were assessed manually using a cell counter (hand piece counter; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Subsequently, growth of the colonies (n = 50 colonies/cell type) was monitored by microscopic reinspection and recounting 14 and 21 days after the sort. SP cell detection was performed as described before (19.Christgen M. Ballmaier M. Bruchhardt H. von Wasielewski R. Kreipe H. Lehmann U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and H33342 (5 μg/ml; Sigma) for 90 min at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were maintained at 4 °C until analysis. SP inhibition was performed with the broad range ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter inhibitor verapamil (Sigma) and the ABCG2- specific inhibitor fumitremorgin c (Calbiochem). Dual wavelength fluorescence analysis and cell sorting were performed with a MoFlo cell sorter and Summit® v3.1 software. The H33342 dye was excited by a multiline UV (350–356 nm) Coherent Innova 90C krypton laser and fluorescence were measured at two wavelengths using a 450BP20 (Hoechst blue) and a 675LP (Hoechst red) optical filter and a 610DSP dichroic mirror. For global transcriptional profiling, cells were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and were subjected to extraction of total RNA. Quality and integrity of the RNA preparations were controlled by running all samples on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). RNA amplification and labeling were done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Small Sample Target Labeling Assay Version II; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and 10 μg of each biotinylated cRNA preparation was fragmented and placed in a hybridization mixture containing four biotinylated hybridization controls (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were hybridized to an identical lot of Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips for 16 h at 46 °C. Subsequently, GeneChips were washed, stained with SA-PE, and read using an Affymetrix GeneChip fluidic station 400 and an GCS 3000 scanner. Extracted probe set signal intensities were normalized using the MAS5 normalization algorithm (Affymetrix). Data from all samples and probe sets were uploaded into the statistical package BRB-ArrayTools version 3.5.0-Patch_2 for filtering and statistical analyses (27.Simon R. Korn E. McShane L. Radmacher M. Wright G. Zhao Y. Design and Analysis of DNA Microarray Investigations. Springer, New York2004Google Scholar). Signal intensities of probe sets with low signal intensity (<70) were raised to the threshold of 70. All subsequent analyses were done on data from log2-transformed expression values. Probe sets showing minimal variation across the set of samples were excluded from the analyses. Probe sets whose expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the median in at least 20% of the samples were retained (2101 probe sets). Cell fraction (SP versus NSP) was introduced as a new variable into the BRB-ArrayTools experiment descriptor for examination of the expression data by scatter plot analysis (27.Simon R. Korn E. McShane L. Radmacher M. Wright G. Zhao Y. Design and Analysis of DNA Microarray Investigations. Springer, New York2004Google Scholar). Then, two-class comparison was performed to identify genes differentially expressed between SP and NSP cells using parametric t tests. Genes were considered statistically significant if their p value was <0.001 to limit the number of false positive findings. Functional annotation and gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis were performed with DAVID software (28.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24981) Google Scholar). The GOchart analytical module was run with an EASE score of 0.1 and a count threshold of 9. Affymetrix probe sets with a signal intensity of ≥70 in CAL-51 (n = 14.151) served as population background. Term enrichment ≥2-fold was considered relevant (28.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (24981) Google Scholar). Extraction of total RNA and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (29.Christgen M. Bruchhardt H. Hadamitzky C. Rudolph C. Steinemann D. Gadzicki D. Hasemeier B. Römermann D. Focken T. Krech T. Ballmaier M. Schlegelberger B. Kreipe H. Lehmann U. J. Pathol. 2009; 217: 620-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Quantitative assessment of gene expression normalized to two housekeeping genes (β-GUS and TBP) was performed with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), Sybr Green I (Invitrogen), and QuantiTect® primer assays (Qiagen) on an ABI Prism 7700 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Statistical significance was determined by parametric t tests using GraphPad Prism software. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 40 μg of total cellular protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-SOX17 (clone 2F9; OriGen Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and anti-β-actin antibodies (clone AC15; Acris, Hiddenhausen, Germany). 293T cells transiently transfected with a pCMV6 expression vector encoding for full-length SOX17 (OriGen Technologies) served as positive control. Digital band densitometry was performed with AIDA software. The CAL-51 human breast cancer cell line is composed of ∼99% NSP cells and a small fraction of about 1% classical SP cells, which expel H33342 in a verapamil- and fumitremorgin c-sensitive manner (Fig. 1A) (19.Christgen M. Ballmaier M. Bruchhardt H. von Wasielewski R. Kreipe H. Lehmann U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with the findings in other cancers and our previously reported data (16.Wang J. Guo L.P. Chen L.Z. Zeng Y.X. Lu S.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3716-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18.Szotek P.P. Pieretti-Vanmarcke R. Masiakos P.T. Dinulescu D.M. Connolly D. Foster R. Dombkowski D. Preffer F.

Lehmann U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 306: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), freshly isolated and recultivated CAL-51 NSP cells initially formed very small colonies but later on failed to sustain proliferation, whereas purified CAL-51 SP cells maintained neoplastic cell growth (Fig. 1B). Thus, CAL-51 represents a suitable model to study cancer SP cells, which are thought to function as cancer stem cells (24.Wu C. Alman B.A. Cancer Lett. 2008; 268: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To investigate differential gene expression between cancer SP and NSP cells, three different, consecutive cell culture passages of CAL-51 were each subjected independently to H33342 dual wavelength fluorescence analysis and were each sorted into SP and NSP cell fractions (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, these biological replicates of CAL-51 SP and NSP cells were all subjected to global transcriptional profiling using Affymetrix expression microarrays. Examination of the expression data by scatter plot analysis indicated that CAL-51 SP and NSP cells from the same culture passage had clearly dissimilar gene expression profiles (Fig. 2B). Noteworthy, NSP cells from different culture passages showed virtually identical gene expression patterns (Fig. 2C). SP cells from different culture passages showed almost identical gene expression profiles as well (Fig. 2D). Hence, a two-class comparison was performed, in which the cell fraction represented the class-defining label. At the p = 0.001 significance level, parametric t tests identified 165 probe sets corresponding to 136 genes as up-regulated and 10 probe sets corresponding to 8 genes as down-regulated in CAL-51 SP cells (Fig. 2E and supplemental Table 1). Functional annotation and gene ontology term enrichment analyses revealed that the genes up-regulated in CAL-51 SP cells were significantly enriched in regulators of transcription, signal transduction, organ development, and anatomical structure morphogenesis (Fig. 2F and supplemental Table 2). Interestingly, these genes included the fetal hematopoietic stem cell factor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target SOX17 (30.Du Y.C. Oshima H. Oguma K. Kitamura T. Itadani H. Fujimura T.

Morrison S.J. Cell. 2007; 130: 470-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), which was chosen for further analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a 20-fold overexpression of SOX17 mRNA in CAL-51 SP relative to NSP cells (Fig. 2G). To validate up-regulation of SOX17 in breast cancer SP cells further, we employed the UACC-893 mammary carcinoma cell line (Fig. 3A). Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a 10-fold overexpression of SOX17 mRNA in UACC-893 SP relative to NSP cells (Fig. 3B). According to the study of Decraene et al. (32.Decraene C. Benchaouir R. Dillies M.A. Israeli D. Bortoli S. Rochon C. Rameau P. Pitaval A. Tronik-Le Roux D. Danos O. Gidrol X. Garcia L. Piétu G. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 132-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to H33342, the fluorescence dye that enables SP cell detection, does not modulate global gene expression. Nonetheless, we hypothesized that differential gene expression between cancer SP and NSP cells might result from a yet unidentified gene-regulatory impact of this dye. Suppose that H33342 exposure would suppress transcription of a gene, its down-regulation might be less pronounced in SP cells, which expel H33342, than in NSP cells, which retain H33342. Hence, if NSP cells are employed as a reference, this gene would appear to be up-regulated in SP cells. This consideration prompted us to assess the impact of H33342 on the expression of SOX17. Strikingly, brief H33342 exposure indeed induced a dose-dependent down-regulation of SOX17 in both CAL-51 and UACC-893 cells (Fig. 4, A–C). Next, SOX17 mRNA levels were monitored during the entire process of SP cell detection and isolation performed according to international standard procedures. In unsorted CAL-51 cells, SOX17 mRNA expression declined 13-fold in response to the labeling with H33342 (Fig. 4D). In isolated CAL-51 NSP cells, SOX17 mRNA expression had declined 60-fold, whereas in CAL-51 SP cells, SOX17 mRNA expression had declined only 3-fold and slowly recovered during long term recultivation (Fig. 4D). As a result of the differential suppression following H33342 labeling, SOX17 mRNA expression was 20-fold higher in CAL-51 SP cells compared with CAL-51 NSP cells (Fig. 4D). Similar observations were made for additional genes. The enhancer of polycomb EPC1 and the regulator of branching morphogenesis SPRY1 were both up-regulated in SP relative to NSP cells isolated from CAL-51 and UACC-893 (Figs. 2G and 3B). Like SOX17, both genes were down-regulated by H33342 in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that this was the underlying mechanism responsible for the differential expression of those genes between cancer SP and NSP cells (Fig. 4, A and B). However, H33342 did not influence the expression of the basal mammary epithelium marker JAG1, which was up-regulated in CAL-51 SP cells (Fig. 2G and supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, H33342 did not affect the expression of the ABC transporter ABCG2, the mediator of H33342 efflux, which is preferentially expressed in cancer SP cells (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Global transcriptional profiling of CAL-51 SP cells using Affymetrix gene expression microarrays.A, replicate isolations of SP and NSP cells from CAL-51.

Using the example of SOX17, a fetal hematopoietic stem cell factor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target (30.Du Y.C. Oshima H. Oguma K. Kitamura T. Itadani H. Fujimura T. Piao Y.S. Yoshimoto T.

Cell. 2007; 130: 470-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we herein establish a previously unidentified gene-regulatory impact of H33342 as a novel mechanism responsible for differential gene expression in cancer SP cells. Up-regulation of SOX17 in breast cancer SP relative to NSP cells was identified by global transcriptional profiling and was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Subsequently, we demonstrated that SOX17 is transcriptionally down-regulated by H33342 in a dose-dependent manner. In SP cells, which expel H33342, down-regulation of SOX17 was less pronounced than in NSP cells, which retain H33342. This differential suppression of SOX17 was shown to be the underlying mechanism responsible for a 10–20-fold overexpression of SOX17 in breast cancer SP relative to NSP cells. Similar observations were made for further stemness-related genes, namely EPC1 and SPRY1. Interestingly, Zheng et al. (33.Zheng X. Shen G. Yang X. Liu W. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have previously speculated that H33342 labeling may selectively deprive cancer NSP cells of stem cell characteristics or factors. The present study provides the first direct evidence that H33342 labeling indeed induces differential expression of well established stem cell genes, such as SOX17, in cancer SP versus NSP cells. Moreover, a brief survey of recently published profiling data revealed that SOX17 and EPC1 were among the candidate genes differentially expressed between SP and NSP cells from markedly different cellular contexts (25.Huang D. Gao Q. Guo L. Zhang C. Jiang W. Li H. Wang J. Han X. Shi Y. Lu S.H. Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34.Liang S.X. Summer R. Sun X. Fine A. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35.Behbod F. Xian W. Shaw C.A. Hilsenbeck S.G. Tsimelzon A. Rosen J.M. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This suggests that the transcriptional deregulation of SOX17 and EPC1 by H33342 during cancer SP cell isolation is a common phenomenon. Further stemness-related genes, such as NOTCH1 and CTNNB1, whose preferential expression in cancer SP cells has been reported before and reasoned to reflect the cancer stem cell nature of cancer SP cells (11.Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6207-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), may in fact be deregulated in an H33342-dependent manner as well. Taken together, this has significant implications for the understanding of cancer SP cells: (i) due to the gene-regulatory impact of H33342, neither cancer SP nor NSP cells maintain their original gene expression profile after the cell isolation, highlighting that comparative transcriptional profiling of isolated SP cells versus unsorted, H33342-unlabeled or NSP cells does not allow the distinction between true differential expression in SP cells and unwanted side effects of H33342; (ii) candidate genes or surrogate markers proposed to characterize cancer SP cells in their original state require a refined validation by demonstrating independence of their expression from H33342 exposure; (iii) due to the differential deregulation of multiple genes by H33342 in cancer SP relative to NSP cells, neither NSP cells nor H33342-unlabeled cells represent appropriate controls for the functional analysis of cancer SP cells. With these prerequisites in mind, one will refrain from further comparing and interpreting growth characteristics of cancer SP and NSP cells because of the overlapping effects of truly different cellular phenotypes and H33342-induced cellular changes. These conclusions necessitate a much more careful interpretation of the cancer SP cell phenotype in future studies. However, they should not give cause generally to reject the notion that cancer SP cells represent a sort of stem cell-like cancer cells. There is no doubt that SP cells from a wide variety of nonmalignant mammalian tissues are multipotent stem cells (7.Challen G.A. Little M.H. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Currently, however, there is no compelling explanation for the presence of SP cells in cancer except that these cancer SP cells are either derived from or mimic nonmalignant adult tissue stem cells (24.Wu C. Alman B.A. Cancer Lett. 2008; 268: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that this study successfully identified JAG1, a basal mammary epithelium marker, as up-regulated in CAL-51 breast cancer SP cells. Importantly, up-regulation of JAG1 was not related to H33342-dependent gene perturbation, and JAG1 has previously been implicated in the regulation of putative breast cancer stem cells (36.Phillips T.M. Kim K. Vlashi E. McBride W.H. Pajonk F. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37.Sansone P. Storci G. Giovannini C. Pandolfi S. Pianetti S. Taffurelli M. Santini D.

Moreover, expression of JAG1 is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in the clinics (39.Reedijk M. Pinnaduwage D. Dickson B.C. Mulligan A.M. Zhang H. Bull S.B. O'Malley F.P.

https://openalex.org/W2045086613,"The low-dielectric plasma membrane provides an energy barrier hindering transmembrane movement of charged particles. The positively charged, voltage-sensing fourth transmembrane domain (S4) of voltage-gated ion channels must surmount this energy barrier to initiate channel activation, typically necessitating both membrane depolarization and interaction with membrane lipid phospho-head groups (MLPHGs). In contrast, and despite containing S4, the KCNQ1 K(+) channel alpha subunit exhibits predominantly constitutive activation when in complexes with transmembrane beta subunits, MinK-related peptide (MiRP) 1 (KCNE2) or MiRP2 (KCNE3). Here, using a 2-electrode voltage clamp and scanning mutagenesis of channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we discovered that 2 of the 8 MiRP2 extracellular domain acidic residues (D54 and D55) are important for KCNQ1-MiRP2 constitutive activation. Double-mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis revealed energetic coupling of D54 and D55 to R237 in KCNQ1 S4 but not to 10 other native or introduced polar residues in KCNQ1 S4 and surrounding linkers. MiRP2-D54 and KCNQ1-R237 also similarly dictated susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of MLPHG hydrolysis, whereas other closely situated polar residues did not. Thus, by providing negative charge near the plasma membrane extracellular face, MiRP2 uses a lipomimetic mechanism to constitutively stabilize the activated KCNQ1 voltage sensor."

There is increasing evidence that T-cell responses are heterogeneous and that both the quality of the immune response and the balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T-cells determines the outcome of an infection. As Malaria parasites have been shown to induce immunosuppressive responses to the parasite and non-related antigens this study examined T-cell mediated pro-inflammatory and regulatory immune responses induced by malaria vaccination in children in an endemic area to determine if these responses were associated with vaccine immunogenicity.Using real-time RT- PCR we profiled the expression of a panel of key markers of immunogenecity at different time points after vaccination with two viral vector vaccines expressing the malaria TRAP antigen (FP9-TRAP and MVA-TRAP) or following rabies vaccination as a control.The vaccine induced modest levels of IFN-gamma mRNA one week after vaccination. There was also an increase in FoxP3 mRNA expression in both TRAP stimulated and media stimulated cells in the FFM ME-TRAP vaccine group; however, this may have been driven by natural exposure to parasite rather than by vaccination.Quantitative PCR is a useful method for evaluating vaccine induced cell mediated immune responses in frozen PBMC from children in a malaria endemic country. Future studies should seek to use vaccine vectors that increase the magnitude and quality of the IFN-gamma immune response in naturally exposed populations and should monitor the induction of a regulatory T cell response."
