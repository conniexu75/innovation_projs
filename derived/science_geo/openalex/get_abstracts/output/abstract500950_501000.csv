https://openalex.org/W2012987872,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are present at low concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors. It has been proposed that the isolation, ex vivo culture, and characterization of CTCs may provide an opportunity to noninvasively monitor the changing patterns of drug susceptibility in individual patients as their tumors acquire new mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we established CTC cultures from six patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Three of five CTC lines tested were tumorigenic in mice. Genome sequencing of the CTC lines revealed preexisting mutations in the PIK3CA gene and newly acquired mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1), PIK3CA gene, and fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR2), among others. Drug sensitivity testing of CTC lines with multiple mutations revealed potential new therapeutic targets. With optimization of CTC culture conditions, this strategy may help identify the best therapies for individual cancer patients over the course of their disease."

It does so by integrating its own genome into those of host cells, where it persists in a latent state. To better understand this process, Wagner et al. determined the sites where HIV integrated into three HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs for more than a decade. They found an over-representation of sites where HIV integrated into genes associated with cancer and cell proliferation. Also, multiple cells in the same individual harbored the same integration sites. This suggests that integration into specific genes may drive cell proliferation and viral persistence.

https://openalex.org/W2137291580,"Adverse prenatal environments can promote metabolic disease in offspring and subsequent generations. Animal models and epidemiological data implicate epigenetic inheritance, but the mechanisms remain unknown. In an intergenerational developmental programming model affecting F2 mouse metabolism, we demonstrate that the in utero nutritional environment of F1 embryos alters the germline DNA methylome of F1 adult males in a locus-specific manner. Differentially methylated regions are hypomethylated and enriched in nucleosome-retaining regions. A substantial fraction is resistant to early embryo methylation reprogramming, which may have an impact on F2 development. Differential methylation is not maintained in F2 tissues, yet locus-specific expression is perturbed. Thus, in utero nutritional exposures during critical windows of germ cell development can impact the male germline methylome, associated with metabolic disease in offspring."

Matsunaga et al. manipulated the wavefunction of these pairs in the superconductor NbN with an electromagnetic pulse that they transmitted through a thin layer of the material (see the Perspective by Pashkin and Leitenstorfer). The superconducting gap, which is the energy needed to break the pairs apart, oscillated at twice the frequency of the pulse's electric field. When they matched this frequency to half the gap, the authors excited a collective mode in the superconductor called the Higgs mode, a relative of the Higgs boson in particle physics.

https://openalex.org/W2053970377,"Building the cell wall is flipping difficult The cell wall of bacteria is constructed from a polysaccharide called peptidoglycan (PG). It forms a matrix that surrounds cells and is essential for the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane. Many of our most successful antibiotics target PG synthesis. The synthetic pathway involves the assembly of sugar building blocks on a lipid carrier at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. The reactions that produce this so-called lipid II precursor and the enzymes that catalyze them have been known for decades. However, the identity of the flippase enzyme that “flips” lipid II in the membrane to expose the sugar building blocks on the cell surface for polymerization has remained highly controversial. Sham et al. now show that the essential protein MurJ is the long sought-after flippase responsible for the translocation of lipid-linked cell wall precursors across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (see the Perspective by Young). The work completes the cell wall biogenesis pathway and defines the function of an attractive target for new antibiotics. Science , this issue p. 220 ; see also p. 139"

What then leads to transmission? Carlson et al. determined the amino acid sequence of viruses infecting 137 Zambian heterosexual couples in which one partner infected the other (see the Perspective by Joseph and Swanstrom). The authors then used statistical modeling and found that transmitted viruses are typically the most evolutionarily fit. That is, compared to other viral variants in the infected person, the transmitted virus most closely matches the most common viral sequence found in the Zambian population.

Otteson et al. found similar activity patterns in even the smallest of planktonic organisms, such as photosynthetic bacteria (see the Perspective by Armbrust). Because it's hard to take regular samples in the open ocean, the authors built a robotic sampler and set it adrift for several days in the mid-Pacific.

Casadei et al. used neutron crystallography to elucidate the mechanism of cytochrome c peroxidase (see the perspective by Groves and Boaz). In the highly reactive intermediate state termed compound I, the iron(IV) oxo, or ferryl, fragment was not protonated, whereas a nearby histidine residue was protonated. The sensitivity of neutron scattering to proton locations revealed these protonation states, where more common techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, have yielded more ambiguous results.

https://openalex.org/W1965372971,"Reciprocal Best Hits (RBH) are a common proxy for orthology in comparative genomics. Essentially, a RBH is found when the proteins encoded by two genes, each in a different genome, find each other as the best scoring match in the other genome. NCBI's BLAST is the software most usually used for the sequence comparisons necessary to finding RBHs. Since sequence comparison can be time consuming, we decided to compare the number and quality of RBHs detected using algorithms that run in a fraction of the time as BLAST. We tested BLAT, LAST and UBLAST. All three programs ran in a hundredth to a 25th of the time required to run BLAST. A reduction in the number of homologs and RBHs found by the faster algorithms compared to BLAST becomes apparent as the genomes compared become more dissimilar, with BLAT, a program optimized for quickly finding very similar sequences, missing both the most homologs and the most RBHs. Though LAST produced the closest number of homologs and RBH to those produced with BLAST, UBLAST was very close, with either program producing between 0.6 and 0.8 of the RBHs as BLAST between dissimilar genomes, while in more similar genomes the differences were barely apparent. UBLAST ran faster than LAST, making it the best option among the programs tested."
https://openalex.org/W1971353366,"Observing an embryonic Doppler effect The sound of an oncoming train changes as it passes you, a phenomenon termed the Doppler effect. Soroldoni et al. propose a similar event during the formation of vertebrate embryo body segments. It is generally thought that the internal timing of a genetic oscillator called the “segmentation clock” sets the rhythm of body segments called somites. However, time-lapse microscopy of the spatial waves of oscillations and the timing of body segment formation showed segments forming faster than spatial genetic oscillations. This “Doppler effect” occurs because the end of the oscillating tissue moves steadily into the oncoming waves. Thus, the rhythm of sequential body segmentation is a function of genetic oscillations, their changing wave pattern, and tissue shortening. Science , this issue p. 222"

Gelman et al. constructed a data set of 60 million transactions made by 75,000 people to test this theory. People do seem to go on a mini–spending spree after they get their paychecks or pensions. However, closer inspection reveals that that's mostly explained by the convenience of linking regular payments, such as rent and utilities, to regular income. Unsurprisingly, cash-strapped people are more likely to increase their spending in response to receiving income. Science , this issue p. 212"
https://openalex.org/W2002021306,"While nasopharyngeal sampling is the gold standard for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage, historically seen, saliva sampling also seems highly sensitive for pneumococcal detection. We investigated S. pneumoniae carriage in saliva from fifty schoolchildren by conventional and molecular methods. Saliva was first culture-enriched for pneumococci, after which, DNA was extracted from all bacterial growth and tested by quantitative-PCR (qPCR) for pneumococcus-specific genes lytA and piaA. Next, serotype composition of the samples was determined by serotype-specific qPCRs, conventional-PCRs (cPCR) and sequencing of cPCR amplicons. Although only 2 (4%) of 50 samples were positive by conventional diagnostic culture, 44 (88%) were positive for pneumococci by qPCR. In total, we detected the presence of at least 81 pneumococcal strains representing 20 serotypes in samples from 44 carriers with 23 carriers (52%) positive for multiple (up to 6) serotypes. The number of serotypes detected per sample correlated with pneumococcal abundance. This study shows that saliva could be used as a tool for future pneumococcal surveillance studies. Furthermore, high rates of pneumococcal carriage and co-carriage of multiple pneumococcal strains together with a large number of serotypes in circulation suggests a ubiquitous presence of S. pneumoniae in saliva of school-aged children. Our results also suggest that factors promoting pneumococcal carriage within individual hosts may weaken competitive interactions between S. pneumoniae strains."

However, little is known about their export out of mitochondria. Here we show that Fe-S assembly of mitoNEET, the first identified Fe-S protein anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane, strictly depends on ISC machineries and not on the CIA or CIAPIN1. We identify a dedicated ISC/export pathway in which augmenter of liver regeneration, a mitochondrial Mia40-dependent protein, is specific to mitoNEET maturation.

This step is controlled by frataxin, the protein lacking in Friedreich ataxia, the most common recessive ataxia in the Caucasian population (3.Puccio H. Simon D. Cossée M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F.

The crystal structure of mNT further shows an unusual cluster ligand environment because each [2Fe-2S] is coordinated by three cysteines (Cys-72, Cys-74, and Cys-83) and one histidine (His-87) in a CDGSH domain, and its stability decreases at a lower pH (17.Paddock M.L.

Finally, a recent study showed that human mNT is capable of Fe-S transfer to a bacterial apo-ferredoxin (FDX) in vitro (20.Zuris J.A. Harir Y. Conlan A.R. Shvartsman M. Michaeli D. Tamir S.

However, the physiological recipients and the conditions of mNT Fe-S transfer in living cells have not yet been identified. In this study, we analyzed the maturation pathway of mNT Fe-S and show that its assembly requires a specific HSC20/ABCb7/ALR branch pathway with no connection to the CIA machinery. We also provide evidence for a role of mNT in the Fe-S repair of cytosolic aconitase/IRP1, a critical regulator of genes important for iron homeostasis and oxygen sensing.

Membranes were scanned with an Odyssey® imaging system (Li-Cor), and quantitation was performed using Li-Cor Odyssey software. In some gel images, non-relevant or unnecessary lines were removed and demarcated clearly by using boxes. Total RNA from cells was extracted using the SV total RNA isolation system according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega), and the reverse transcription (1 µg of total RNA) was performed using the high-capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the FastStart DNA Master Plus SYBR Green I kit and the Roche Lightcycler system (Roche Applied Sciences). Primer sequences used were Hu-mNT, 5′-CTAGTGCACACGCCTTGCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGCTGCGATCCATTCAACTC-3′) (reverse); Hu-IscU2, 5′-CCCGACTCTATCACAAGAAGGTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATGCTGGAGCCCCCAC-3′) (reverse); and Hu-Abcb7, 5′-GCTCGAGCCTACCAGCAGATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCCTGTCTTTGGGCCAC-3′ (reverse). Sequence-specific primers were designed to span intron-exon boundaries to generate amplicons of ∼100 bp. Values were normalized to 18 S rRNA. The following siRNA duplexes were from Life Technologies®: CISD1 (mNT-0, catalog no. s31650; mNT-1, catalog no. s31651), Iscu-2 (catalog no. s23909), Nfs1 (catalog no. s17265), Mfrn-2 (catalog no. s37872), Hsc20 (catalog no. s45405), Abcb7 (catalog no. 117249), Alr (Alr-3, catalog no. s5703; Alr-4, catalog no. s5704), Nupb1 (catalog no. s9288), Narfl (catalog no. s34746), ciapin1 (catalog no. s32591), and negative control (catalog no. 4390843). They were used at final concentrations ranging from 1–10 nm. The pcDNA3-GPAT-C1F vector containing a noncleavable GPAT precursor was used as described previously (23.Martelli A. Wattenhofer-Donzé M. Schmucker S. Bouvet S. Reutenauer L. Puccio H. Frataxin is essential for extramitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins in mammalian tissues.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Total protein extracts from human cell lines were obtained by harvesting cells in Laemmli buffer (0.06 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)). Total protein extracts from mouse heart were obtained as described previously (24.Guillon B. Bulteau A.L. Wattenhofer-Donzé M. Schmucker S. Friguet B. Puccio H. Drapier J.C. Bouton C. Frataxin deficiency causes upregulation of mitochondrial Lon and ClpP proteases and severe loss of mitochondrial Fe-S proteins.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except for the final lysis, which was performed in 2.5× Laemmli buffer. Mitochondrion-enriched fractions were prepared using a conventional differential centrifugation procedure as described before (25.Ferecatu I. Bergeaud M. Rodríguez-Enfedaque A. Le Floch N. Oliver L. Rincheval V. Renaud F. Vallette F.M. Mignotte B. Vayssière J.L. Mitochondrial localization of the low level p53 protein in proliferative cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 387: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The digitonin (0.007%) method for preparing mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was also used as described previously (26.Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Aconitases: a class of metalloproteins highly sensitive to nitric oxide synthesis.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method. Cell viability was determined microscopically by trypan blue exclusion. Viable cell number was reported as a percentage of negative control (NC) siRNA-transfected cells. Cells were also analyzed for hallmarks of mitochondrial depolarization by using the membrane-permeable JC-1 dye, and flow cytometry was performed on an FC500 Beckman Coulter instrument. Mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated cells were used as a positive control. Human apo-IRP1 was generated by treatment of 290 µm holo-IRP1 with 7 mm DEA-NO in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 0.2 mm citrate, and 30 mm ammonium acetate for 1 h at 29 °C in a glove box and purification on a microbiospin equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 40 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Apo-IRP1 was preincubated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature under anaerobic conditions. Then, purified mNT44–108 (100 µm of holo-protein or disassembled protein) was incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere at 25 °C with apo-IRP1 (25 µm) in 100 mm BisTris (pH 6.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. At the indicated times, aliquots of the transfer reaction were used to measure aconitase activity. Disassembled mNT was prepared by incubation of the protein in buffer containing 100 mm BisTris pH 6.2 and 100 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 10 min. Chemical reconstitution of the aconitase Fe-S cluster was performed in the same buffer as the one used for the transfer reaction with 250 µm Na2S and Mohr's salt for 1 h at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. The transfer reaction, using Escherichia coli FDX as the recipient protein, was performed similarly at 20 °C with equal concentrations of holo-mNT and apo-E. coli FDX. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded from 350–550 nm (Varian Cary 100). In parallel, the transfer reaction was followed by differential migration of mNT and FDX holo- and apo-forms on native PAGE and Coomassie staining. Experiments on mNT stability were performed using 100 µm oxidized mNT in 100 mm BisTris (pH 6.2) with 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. The absorbance at 460 nm was monitored over time, and the percentage cluster loss was calculated using the absorbances at 460 nm at time 0 and at times 30, 65, and 150 min. Aconitase activity was measured as described previously (26.Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Aconitases: a class of metalloproteins highly sensitive to nitric oxide synthesis.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For mitochondrial aconitase activity, the lysis and enzymatic activity measurement steps were performed under an anaerobic atmosphere using buffers flushed with nitrogen gas. Recombinant human mNT missing the 43 N-terminal amino acids was expressed from the pET22b and pET28a vectors in BL21(DE3) cells with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were cultured at 22 °C for 20 h in the presence of 400 µm FeCl3 and then harvested for purification steps. The cleared lysate was applied to an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column on an Akta FPLC instrument (GE Healthcare). When required, a protease cleavage of the His tag was performed at this semipurification step using thrombin. The mNT fractions were further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). The mNT fractions from the size exclusion chromatography were pooled and concentrated to 4 mg/ml. Degassed buffers were used during the purification steps. Protein purity was assessed to be >99% using SDS-PAGE with an optical A280 nm/A458 nm ratio near 2.3. Two recombinant preparations of mNT (44–108) were finally obtained, one containing eight additional C-terminal residues derived from the His tag (LEHHHHHH) and the other containing three additional N-terminal residues derived from the thrombin cleavage site (GSH). For NMR analyses, expression of mNT44–108 was performed on a 1-L scale in M9 minimal medium (containing 0.001% thiamine-HCl and 10 µm FeCl3) supplemented with 1.0 g of 15NH4Cl and 4.0 g of [13C]d-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. For Mössbauer analysis, expression of mNT33–108 missing the 32 N-terminal amino acids (using the pET28a-mNT33–108 construct) was performed in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 57Fe-enriched ferric chloride. The N-terminal His tag of purified mNT33–108 was removed efficiently using thrombin. The E. coli apo-ferredoxin (full-length construct in pET21, a gift from Dr. S. Ollagnier de Choudens, Grenoble, France) was expressed and purified as described previously (27.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin gene from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The untreated and NO-treated IRP1 was a gift from Dr. J.-M. Moulis (CEA Grenoble, France). Mitochondrial aconitase from a porcine heart was from Sigma. 100 mg was dissolved in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8) and loaded on a HiScreen Capto Q ImpRes column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 M). Fractions containing aconitase were pooled and concentrated, and then the protein concentration was determined. Aconitase was reactivated by incubation for 1 h at room temperature under anaerobic conditions with 5× Mohr's salt and Na2S and then loaded on a NAP-5 gel filtration column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8) and 100 mm NaCl. Mössbauer spectra of purified 57Fe-labeled mNT33–108 in 50 mm phosphate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl were recorded at 4.2 K on a low-field Mössbauer spectrometer equipped with a Janis SVT-400 cryostat and weak field permanent magnets. The spectrometer was operated in a constant acceleration mode in transmission geometry (28.Carboni M. Clémancey M. Molton F. Pécaut J. Lebrun C. Dubois L. Blondin G. Latour J.M. Biologically relevant heterodinuclear iron-manganese complexes.Inorg. Chem. 2012; 51: 10447-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The isomer shifts were referenced against that of room temperature metallic iron foil. Data were analyzed with the WMOSS program (WEB Research, Edina, MN). NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker AVANCE 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation HSQC spectra were obtained on a 250 µm His-tagged 13C,15N-labeled holo-mNT44–108 protein sample at 298 K in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl. Iron and sulfur incorporation into apo-mNT (44–108) was carried out by the addition of 10 mm DTT, 500 µm [NH4]2Fe[SO4]2 and 500 µm sodium sulfide to 1.13 mg of purified 15N/13C double-labeled apo-mNT in 2.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl. All reactions were carried out in an anaerobic glove box (Jacomex, O2 <9 ppm). After 5 h at room temperature, the protein was desalted on a NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by UV-visible and NMR spectroscopy. All results are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for all pairwise comparisons of mean responses among the different treatment groups (SigmaStat). Two-tailed Student's t test was performed for all multiple pair comparisons. Differences between groups were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Biophysical studies support the presence of a [2Fe-2S] prosthetic group in purified recombinant mNT (15.Hou X. Liu R. Ross S. Smart E.J. Zhu H. Gong W. Crystallographic studies of human MitoNEET.J.

Therefore, we analyzed protein stability in two different human cell types, i.e. HeLa and HepG2 cells, grown under conditions that strongly reduce Fe-S biogenesis. First, cells were exposed to the lipophilic SIH iron chelator. Iron deficiency significantly decreased mNT at the protein level in both total extracts and mitochondria-enriched fractions (Fig. 1A). Time course experiments (Fig. 1B) demonstrated that the mNT protein level decreased within 16 h and was no longer detectable after 48 h upon iron starvation induced by SIH or b"

Tumors of the basal-like subtype have a poor prognosis due to inherent aggressiveness and the lack of targeted therapeutics. Basal-like tumors typically lack estrogen receptor-α, progesterone receptor and HER2/ERBB2, or in other words they are triple negative (TN). Continued evaluation of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) biology is essential to identify novel therapeutic targets. Expression of the pi subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABRP) is associated with the BLBC/TN subtype, and herein, we reveal its expression also correlates with metastases to the brain and poorer patient outcome. GABRP expression in breast cancer cell lines also demonstrates a significant correlation with the basal-like subtype suggesting that GABRP functions in the initiation and/or progression of basal-like tumors. To address this postulate, we stably silenced GABRP in two BLBC cell lines, HCC1187 and HCC70 cells. Decreased GABRP reduces in vitro tumorigenic potential and migration concurrent with alterations in the cytoskeleton, specifically diminished cellular protrusions and expression of the BLBC-associated cytokeratins, KRT5, KRT6B, KRT14, and KRT17. Silencing GABRP also decreases phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in both cell lines and selective inhibition of ERK1/2 similarly decreases the basal-like cytokeratins as well as migration. Combined, these data reveal a GABRP-ERK1/2-cytokeratin axis that maintains the migratory phenotype of basal-like breast cancer. GABRP is a component of a cell surface receptor, thus, these findings suggest that targeting this new signaling axis may have therapeutic potential in BLBC.

GABA(A) receptors are heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channels whose traditional role is to mediate synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. There are multiple GABA(A) receptor subunits (α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, θ, and π), with α, β, and γ all having multiple isoforms (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3). At least two α and two β subunits comprise most functional receptors.

While GABRP function in either the normal or cancerous breast has not been defined, the GABA(A) receptor ligand, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamine acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of GABA, are detected in the normal mammary gland (15.Mazurkiewicz M. Opolski A. Wietrzyk J. Radzikowski C. Kleinrok Z. GABA level and GAD activity in human and mouse normal and neoplastic mammary gland.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 18: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, breast cancer patient brain metastases exhibit a GABAergic phenotype including the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors, GABA transporters and GAD expression (16.Neman J. Termini J. Wilczynski S. Vaidehi N. Choy C. Kowolik C.M. Li H. Hambrecht A.C. Roberts E. Jandial R. Human breast cancer metastases to the brain display GABAergic properties in the neural niche.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A putative role for GABA(A) in breast cancer is further supported by the observation that propofol, a multifunctional drug with agonist activity for the GABA(A) receptor, induces actin reorganization and migration of breast cancer cells through collagen matrices (17.Garib V. Niggemann B. Zänker K.S. Brandt L. Kubens B.S.

GABA treatment correspondingly increases cell number, matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression and in vitro invasiveness in prostate cancer cells (19.Azuma H. Inamoto T. Sakamoto T. Kiyama S. Ubai T.

These results have been corroborated in patient samples where the primary tumor expression of GABA and GAD are positively correlated with high MMP expression and lymph node metastases in prostate cancer (19.Azuma H.

Comparable in vitro results have also been observed in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (21.Inamoto T. Azuma H. Sakamoto T. Kiyama S. Ubai T. Kotake Y. Watanabe M.

While contradictory, these findings suggest a critical role for GABAergic signaling in cancer, and enforce the need for continued evaluation of this pathway in distinct cancer types. Given the significant and subtype-specific elevation of GABRP in the BLBC subtype (7.Symmans W.F. Fiterman D.J. Anderson S.K. Ayers M. Rouzier R. Dunmire V. Stec J. Valero V. Sneige N. Albarracin C.

A single-gene biomarker identifies breast cancers associated with immature cell type and short duration of prior breastfeeding.Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that GABRP is functionally relevant in this disease. Utilizing publicly available gene expression data, we confirmed the correlation of GABRP with the BLBC subtype. Our studies also reveal, for the first time, that GABRP is associated with metastases to the brain and poorer patient survival. We further describe a requirement for GABRP in BLBC secondary tumorsphere formation and cell migration, both functional readouts of tumor aggressiveness. Silencing of GABRP expression in BLBC cell lines concomitantly diminishes basal-like cytokeratin expression and ERK1/2 activity, suggesting GABRP may mediate a pro-migratory cytoskeletal structure through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. These findings illustrate a previously unrecognized role for GABRP in promoting BLBC aggressiveness, and support further analysis of GABRP as a putative therapeutic target in this disease. Significance was determined by Student's t test assuming a two-tailed distribution and equal variance among sample populations. Twenty-six cDNA microarray datasets of human breast tumors were retrieved from Oncomine (oncomine.org) for in silico analyses.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and statistical significance determined using log-rank. For co-expression analysis, only breast cancer datasets that utilized Affymetrix HG-U133A or U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were included to eliminate platform-related variability. This list was then further refined to exclude sets where the samples were stroma or non-invasive breast cancer. These criteria provided 24 datasets for co-expression analysis (Table 1). Each dataset was evaluated for genes that positively correlate with GABRP using a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of ≥0.5. Pearson correlation coefficients between GABRP and KRT5, KRT6B, KRT14, and KRT17 were calculated and used to determine covariance of these factors in each data set. The overall significance of covariance between GABRP and basal keratin was determined by Fisher's combined probability test with values ≥0.05 considered significant.TABLE 1Human breast cancer gene expression datasets used for GABRP co-expression analysisStudyAffymetrix PlatformaThe same reporter ID for GABRP (205044_at) was used for each study.Sample nRefs.BittnerU133 Plus 2.0336Not publishedBosU133 Plus 2.0204Nature 459: 1005–1009 (2009)ChinU133A118Cancer Cell 10(6):529–541 (2006)DesmedtU133A198Clin.

Cells migrated toward complete media as above. Migrated cells were fixed and stained using the DiffQuik staining procedure. Three technical replicates were performed per experiment, where five unique fields (×10 (HCC70) and ×4 (HCC1187) magnification) were quantified per replicate.

https://openalex.org/W2060165446,"Apelin plays a prominent role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. We previously showed that the C-terminal Phe of apelin 17 (K17F) is crucial for triggering apelin receptor internalization and decreasing blood pressure (BP) but is not required for apelin binding or Gi protein coupling. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the important role of the C-terminal Phe in BP decrease may be as a Gi-independent but β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathway that could involve MAPKs. For this purpose, we have used apelin fragments K17F and K16P (K17F with the C-terminal Phe deleted), which exhibit opposite profiles on apelin receptor internalization and BP. Using BRET-based biosensors, we showed that whereas K17F activates Gi and promotes β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor, K16P had a much reduced ability to promote β-arrestin recruitment while maintaining its Gi activating property, revealing the biased agonist character of K16P. We further show that both β-arrestin recruitment and apelin receptor internalization contribute to the K17F-stimulated ERK1/2 activity, whereas the K16P-promoted ERK1/2 activity is entirely Gi-dependent. In addition to providing new insights on the structural basis underlying the functional selectivity of apelin peptides, our study indicates that the β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation and not the Gi-dependent signaling may participate in K17F-induced BP decrease."

https://openalex.org/W1990656513,"The Hsp70 family protein mortalin is an essential chaperone that is frequently enriched in cancer cells and exists in various subcellular sites, including the mitochondrion, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying its multiple subcellular localizations are not yet clear, their functional significance has been revealed by several studies. In this study, we examined the nuclear fractions of human cells and found that the malignantly transformed cells have more mortalin than the normal cells. We then generated a mortalin mutant that lacked a mitochondrial targeting signal peptide. It was largely localized in the nucleus, and, hence, is called nuclear mortalin (mot-N). Functional characterization of mot-N revealed that it efficiently protects cancer cells against endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress. Furthermore, compared with the full-length mortalin overexpressing cancer cells, mot-N derivatives showed increased malignant properties, including higher proliferation rate, colony forming efficacy, motility, and tumor forming capacity both in in vitro and in vivo assays. We demonstrate that mot-N promotes carcinogenesis and cancer cell metastasis by inactivation of tumor suppressor protein p53 functions and by interaction and functional activation of telomerase and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2039751833,"Previously, we demonstrated that dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio dramatically affects the fecal microbial taxonomic structure of kittens using targeted 16S gene sequencing. The present study, using the same fecal samples, applied deep Illumina shotgun sequencing to identify the diet-associated functional potential and analyze taxonomic changes of the feline fecal microbiome.Fecal samples from kittens fed one of two diets differing in protein and carbohydrate content (high-protein, low-carbohydrate, HPLC; and moderate-protein, moderate-carbohydrate, MPMC) were collected at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age (n = 6 per group). A total of 345.3 gigabases of sequence were generated from 36 samples, with 99.75% of annotated sequences identified as bacterial. At the genus level, 26% and 39% of reads were annotated for HPLC- and MPMC-fed kittens, with HPLC-fed cats showing greater species richness and microbial diversity. Two phyla, ten families and fifteen genera were responsible for more than 80% of the sequences at each taxonomic level for both diet groups, consistent with the previous taxonomic study. Significantly different abundances between diet groups were observed for 324 genera (56% of all genera identified) demonstrating widespread diet-induced changes in microbial taxonomic structure. Diversity was not affected over time. Functional analysis identified 2,013 putative enzyme function groups were different (p<0.000007) between the two dietary groups and were associated to 194 pathways, which formed five discrete clusters based on average relative abundance. Of those, ten contained more (p<0.022) enzyme functions with significant diet effects than expected by chance. Six pathways were related to amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism linking changes in dietary protein with functional differences of the gut microbiome.These data indicate that feline feces-derived microbiomes have large structural and functional differences relating to the dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio and highlight the impact of diet early in life."
https://openalex.org/W1978521856,"The control of IL-10 production in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that β-arrestin 2 positively regulates TLR-triggered IL-10 production in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism. In vitro studies with cells including peritoneal macrophages and HEK293/TLR4 cells have demonstrated that β-arrestin 2 forms complexes with p38 and facilitates p38 activation after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Deficiency of β-arrestin 2 and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity both ameliorate TLR4-stimulated IL-10 response. Additionally, in vivo experiments show that mice lacking β-arrestin 2 produce less amount of IL-10, and are more susceptible to LPS-induced septic shock which is further enhanced by blocking IL-10 signal. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which β-arrestin 2 negatively regulates TLR4-mediated inflammatory reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1996267000,"Members of Gram-positive Actinobacteria cause economically important diseases to plants. Within the Rhodococcus genus, some members can cause growth deformities and persist as pathogens on a wide range of host plants. The current model predicts that phytopathogenic isolates require a cluster of three loci present on a linear plasmid, with the fas operon central to virulence. The Fas proteins synthesize, modify, and activate a mixture of growth regulating cytokinins, which cause a hormonal imbalance in plants, resulting in abnormal growth. We sequenced and compared the genomes of 20 isolates of Rhodococcus to gain insights into the mechanisms and evolution of virulence in these bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer was identified as critical but limited in the scale of virulence evolution, as few loci are conserved and exclusive to phytopathogenic isolates. Although the fas operon is present in most phytopathogenic isolates, it is absent from phytopathogenic isolate A21d2. Instead, this isolate has a horizontally acquired gene chimera that encodes a novel fusion protein with isopentyltransferase and phosphoribohydrolase domains, predicted to be capable of catalyzing and activating cytokinins, respectively. Cytokinin profiling of the archetypal D188 isolate revealed only one activate cytokinin type that was specifically synthesized in a fas-dependent manner. These results suggest that only the isopentenyladenine cytokinin type is synthesized and necessary for Rhodococcus phytopathogenicity, which is not consistent with the extant model stating that a mixture of cytokinins is necessary for Rhodococcus to cause leafy gall symptoms. In all, data indicate that only four horizontally acquired functions are sufficient to confer the trait of phytopathogenicity to members of the genetically diverse clade of Rhodococcus."

PRMT5 is highly expressed in the heart; the functional role of PRMT5 in the heart, however, remains largely elusive. In the present study, we show that PRMT5 specifically interacts with GATA4 in both co-transfected HEK293T cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by co-immunoprecipitation. Importantly, this interaction leads to the arginine methylation of GATA4 at positions of 229, 265, and 317, which leads to an inhibition of the GATA4 transcriptional activity, predominantly through blocking the p300-mediated acetylation of GATA4 in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of PRMT5 substantially inhibited the acetylation of GATA4 and cardiac hypertrophic responses in phenylephrine-stimulated cardiomyocytes, whereas knockdown of PRMT5 induced GATA4 activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, in response to phenylephrine stimulation, PRMT5 translocates into the cytoplasm, thus relieving its repression on GATA4 activity in the nucleus and leading to hypertrophic gene expression in cardiomyocytes. These findings indicate that PRMT5 is an essential regulator of myocardial hypertrophic signaling and suggest that strategies aimed at activating PRMT5 in the heart may represent a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2101155004,"TRPV4, one of the TRP channels, is implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes including cell proliferation. However, the role of TRPV4 in liver fibrosis is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the role of TRPV4 in regulating HSC-T6 cell proliferation. TRPV4 mRNA and protein were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot in patients and rat model of liver fibrosis in vivo and TGF-β1-activated HSC-T6 cells in vitro. Both mRNA and protein of TRPV4 were dramatically increased in liver fibrotic tissues of both patients and CCl4-treated rats. Stimulation of HSC-T6 cells with TGF-β1 resulted in increase of TRPV4 mRNA and protein. However, TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cell proliferation was inhibited by Ruthenium Red (Ru) or synthetic siRNA targeting TRPV4, and this was accompanied by downregulation of myofibroblast markers including α-SMA and Col1α1. Moreover, our study revealed that miR-203 was downregulated in liver fibrotic tissues and TGF-β1-treated HSC-T6 cell. Bioinformatics analyses predict that TRPV4 is the potential target of miR-203. In addition, overexpression of miR-203 in TGF-β1-induced HSC significantly reduced TRPV4 expression, indicating TRPV4, which was regulated by miR-203, may function as a novel regulator to modulate TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2044520095,"Adult bone mass is controlled by the bone formation repressor sclerostin (SOST). Previously, we have shown that intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) bone anabolic therapy involves SOST expression reduction by inhibiting myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), which activates a distant bone enhancer. Here, we extended our SOST gene regulation studies by analyzing a role of class I and IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are known regulators of MEF2s. Expression analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed high expression of HDACs 1 and 2, lower amounts of HDACs 3, 5, and 7, low amounts of HDAC4, and no expression of HDACs 8 and 9 in constitutively SOST-expressing UMR106 osteocytic cells. PTH-induced Sost suppression was associated with specific rapid nuclear accumulation of HDAC5 and co-localization with MEF2s in nuclear speckles requiring serine residues 259 and 498, whose phosphorylations control nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Increasing nuclear levels of HDAC5 in UMR106 by blocking nuclear export with leptomycin B (LepB) or overexpression in transient transfection assays inhibited endogenous Sost transcription and reporter gene expression, respectively. This repressor effect of HDAC5 did not require catalytic activity using specific HDAC inhibitors. In contrast, inhibition of class I HDAC activities and expression using RNA interference suppressed constitutive Sost expression in UMR106 cells. An unbiased comprehensive search for involved HDAC targets using an acetylome analysis revealed several non-histone proteins as candidates. These findings suggest that PTH-mediated Sost repression involves nuclear accumulation of HDAC inhibiting the MEF2-dependent Sost bone enhancer, and class I HDACs are required for constitutive Sost expression in osteocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2010998590,"Interferon-α (IFN-α) is used clinically to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the detailed therapeutic mechanisms remain elusive. In particular, IFN-α has long been implicated in control of the cell cycle, but its actual point of action has not been clarified. Here, using time lapse imaging analyses of the human HCC cell line HuH7 carrying a fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci), we found that IFN-α induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phases, leading to apoptosis through an IFN-α type-2 receptor (IFNAR2)-dependent signaling pathway. Detailed analyses by time lapse imaging and biochemical assays demonstrated that the IFN-α/IFNAR2 axis sensitizes cells to apoptosis in the S/G2/M phases in preparation for cell death in the G0/G1 phases. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate the detailed mechanism of IFN-α as an anticancer drug, using Fucci-based time lapse imaging, which will be informative for treating HCC with IFN-α in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2030172337,"Ki67 is a protein widely used as cell-proliferation marker, with its cellular functions being hardly unveiled. In this paper, we present the direct interaction between Ki67 and PP1γ, a protein phosphatase showing characteristic accumulation on anaphase chromosomes via the canonical PP1-binding motif within Ki67. In cells depleted of Ki67, PP1γ is targeted to anaphase chromosomes less efficiently. Additionally, overexpression of Ki67, but not a mutant form without the ability to bind PP1γ, induced ectopic localization of PP1γ οn metaphase chromosomes. These observations demonstrate that Ki67 is one factor that defines the cellular behavior of PP1γ in anaphase. To explore the specific roles of the subset of PP1γ recruited on chromosome via its interaction with Ki67 (PP1γ-Ki67), endogenous Ki67 was replaced with a Ki67 mutant deficient in its ability to interact with PP1γ. Although no obvious defects in the progression of mitosis were observed, the timing of dephosphorylation of the mutant Ki67 in anaphase was delayed, indicating that Ki67 itself is one of the substrates of PP1γ-Ki67."
https://openalex.org/W2037450561,"The YvcK protein has been shown to be necessary for growth under gluconeogenic conditions in Bacillus subtilis. Amazingly, its overproduction rescues growth and morphology defects of the actin-like protein MreB deletion mutant by restoration of PBP1 localization. In this work, we observed that YvcK was phosphorylated at Thr-304 by the protein kinase PrkC and that phosphorylated YvcK was dephosphorylated by the cognate phosphatase PrpC. We show that neither substitution of this threonine with a constitutively phosphorylated mimicking glutamic acid residue or a phosphorylation-dead mimicking alanine residue nor deletion of prkC or prpC altered the ability of B. subtilis to grow under gluconeogenic conditions. However, we observed that a prpC mutant and a yvcK mutant were more sensitive to bacitracin compared with the WT strain. In addition, the bacitracin sensitivity of strains in which YvcK Thr-304 was replaced with either an alanine or a glutamic acid residue was also affected. We also analyzed rescue of the mreB mutant strain by overproduction of YvcK in which the phosphorylation site was substituted. We show that YvcK T304A overproduction did not rescue the mreB mutant aberrant morphology due to PBP1 mislocalization. The same observation was made in an mreB prkC double mutant overproducing YvcK. Altogether, these data show that YvcK may have two distinct functions: 1) in carbon source utilization independent of its phosphorylation level and 2) in cell wall biosynthesis and morphogenesis through its phosphorylation state."

https://openalex.org/W2047708479,"In targeted therapy, patient tumors are analyzed for aberrant activations of core cancer pathways, monitored based on biomarker expression, to ensure efficient treatment. Thus, diagnosis and therapeutic decisions are often based on the status of biomarkers determined by immunohistochemistry in combination with other clinical parameters. Standard evaluation of cancer specimen by immunohistochemistry is frequently impeded by its dependence on subjective interpretation, showing considerable intra- and inter-observer variability. To make treatment decisions more reliable, automated image analysis is an attractive possibility to reproducibly quantify biomarker expression in patient tissue samples. We tested whether image analysis could detect subtle differences in protein expression levels. Gene dosage effects generate well-graded expression patterns for most gene-products, which vary by a factor of two between wildtype and haploinsufficient cells lacking one allele. We used conditional mouse models with deletion of the transcription factors Stat5ab in the liver as well Junb deletion in a T-cell lymphoma model. We quantified the expression of total or activated STAT5AB or JUNB protein in normal (Stat5ab+/+ or JunB+/+), hemizygous (Stat5ab+/Δ or JunB+/Δ) or knockout (Stat5abΔ/Δ or JunBΔ/Δ) settings. Image analysis was able to accurately detect hemizygosity at the protein level. Moreover, nuclear signals were distinguished from cytoplasmic expression and translocation of the transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was reliably detected and quantified using image analysis. We demonstrate that image analysis supported pathologists to score nuclear STAT5AB expression levels in immunohistologically stained human hepatocellular patient samples and decreased inter-observer variability."

Two approaches are currently being pursued to elicit antibody-mediated protection: vaccines that induce potent and broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) or vaccines that induce “conventional antibodies,” which are less potent and broadly neutralizing in comparison. Although bnAbs may provide the greatest level of protection, their structural and genetic characteristics make their elicitation through vaccination a major challenge. In contrast, conventional HIV-1 antibodies have been induced by vaccination and correlated with reduced HIV-1 infection in a phase III vaccine trial. Here, I present evidence that both approaches should be pursued with equal vigor."
https://openalex.org/W2055127446,"Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) impedes protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2). It is subject to complex regulation by multiple upstream signaling pathways, through poorly described mechanisms. Precise integration of these signals is critical for eEF-2K to appropriately regulate protein translation rates. Here, an allosteric mechanism comprising two sequential conformations is described for eEF-2K activation. First, Ca(2+)/CaM binds eEF-2K with high affinity (Kd(CaM)(app) = 24 ± 5 nm) to enhance its ability to autophosphorylate Thr-348 in the regulatory loop (R-loop) by > 10(4)-fold (k(auto) = 2.6 ± 0.3 s(-1)). Subsequent binding of phospho-Thr-348 to a conserved basic pocket in the kinase domain potentially drives a conformational transition of the R-loop, which is essential for efficient substrate phosphorylation. Ca(2+)/CaM binding activates autophosphorylated eEF-2K by allosterically enhancing k(cat)(app) for peptide substrate phosphorylation by 10(3)-fold. Thr-348 autophosphorylation results in a 25-fold increase in the specificity constant (k(cat)(app)/K(m)(Pep-S) (app)), with equal contributions from k(cat)(app) and K(m)(Pep-S)(app), suggesting that peptide substrate binding is partly impeded in the unphosphorylated enzyme. In cells, Thr-348 autophosphorylation appears to control the catalytic output of active eEF-2K, contributing more than 5-fold to its ability to promote eEF-2 phosphorylation. Fundamentally, eEF-2K activation appears to be analogous to an amplifier, where output volume may be controlled by either toggling the power switch (switching on the kinase) or altering the volume control (modulating stability of the active R-loop conformation). Because upstream signaling events have the potential to modulate either allosteric step, this mechanism allows for exquisite control of eEF-2K output."
https://openalex.org/W2084681273,"The interaction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) with its receptors: TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B is critical for the promotion of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. To better understand the roles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNF-α, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B genes in the development of breast cancer, we explored the associations between SNPs in these three genes and breast cancer susceptibility in northeast Chinese Han women.This case-control study was conducted among 1016 breast cancer patients and 806 age-matched healthy controls. Seven SNPs in the TNF-α (rs1800629, rs361525), TNFRSF1A (rs767455, rs4149577 and rs1800693) and TNFRSF1B (rs1061622 and rs1061624) genes were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. In TNFRSF1B, the rs1061622 GT genotype and the G allele conferred a reduced susceptibility to breast cancer (P = 0.000662, OR = 0.706, 95% CI: 0.578-0.863; P = 0.002, OR = 0.769, 95% CI; 0.654-0.905, respectively). Moreover, the AG genotype, the AA genotype and the A allele in rs1061624 conferred an increased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.007, OR = 1.470, 95% CI:1.112-1.943; P = 0.00109, OR = 1.405 95% CI:1.145-1.724; P = 0.001, OR = 1.248 95% CI:1.092-1.426, respectively). These two SNPs also had associations with breast cancer risk under the dominant model. In haplotype analysis, the CTA (rs767455 C-rs4149577 T-rs1800693 A) haplotype in TNFRSF1A and the TA (rs1061622 T-rs1061624 A) haplotype in TNFRSF1B had higher frequencies in breast cancer patients (P = 0.00324; P = 0.000370, respectively), but the frequency of GG (rs1061622 G-rs1061624 G) haplotype in TNFRSF1B was lower in breast cancer patients (P = 0.000251). The associations of the three haplotypes remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. In addition, significant associations were also observed between TNFRSF1A polymorphisms and lymph node metastasis, P53, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) statuses.Our results suggest that rs1061622 and rs1061624 in TNFRSF1B may affect breast cancer risk, and SNPs in TNFRSF1A are associated with the clinical features of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988115869,"Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) is an atypical mitochondrial Ser/Thr phosphatase that modulates mitochondrial dynamics and participates in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. The mechanisms that regulate the phosphatase activity of PGAM5 are poorly understood. The C-terminal phosphoglycerate mutase domain of PGAM5 shares homology with the catalytic domains found in other members of the phosphoglycerate mutase family, including a conserved histidine that is absolutely required for catalytic activity. However, this conserved domain is not sufficient for maximal phosphatase activity. We have identified a highly conserved amino acid motif, WDXNWD, located within the unique N-terminal region, which is required for assembly of PGAM5 into large multimeric complexes. Alanine substitutions within the WDXNWD motif abolish the formation of multimeric complexes and markedly reduce phosphatase activity of PGAM5. A peptide containing the WDXNWD motif dissociates the multimeric complex and reduces but does not fully abolish phosphatase activity. Addition of the WDXNWD-containing peptide in trans to a mutant PGAM5 protein lacking the WDXNWD motif markedly increases phosphatase activity of the mutant protein. Our results are consistent with an intermolecular allosteric regulation mechanism for the phosphatase activity of PGAM5, in which the assembly of PGAM5 into multimeric complexes, mediated by the WDXNWD motif, results in maximal activation of phosphatase activity. Our results suggest the possibility of identifying small molecules that function as allosteric regulators of the phosphatase activity of PGAM5."

We have recently reported that targeting SphK2 induces apoptosis for human primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines infected by the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and this occurs in part through inhibition of canonical NF-κB activation. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of SphK2 has minimal impact for uninfected B-cell lines or circulating human B cells from healthy donors. Therefore, we designed additional studies employing primary human endothelial cells to explore mechanisms responsible for the selective death observed for KSHV-infected cells during SphK2 targeting. Using RNA interference and a clinically relevant pharmacologic approach, we have found that targeting SphK2 induces apoptosis selectively for KSHV-infected endothelial cells through induction of viral lytic gene expression. Moreover, this effect occurs through repression of KSHV-microRNAs regulating viral latency and signal transduction, including miR-K12-1 which targets IκBα to facilitate activation of NF-κB, and ectopic expression of miR-K12-1 restores NF-κB activation and viability for KSHV-infected endothelial cells during SphK2 inhibition. These data illuminate a novel survival mechanism and potential therapeutic target for KSHV-infected endothelial cells: SphK2-associated maintenance of viral latency."
https://openalex.org/W2007701240,"Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are presumed to have robust DNA repair pathways to ensure genome stability. PSCs likely need to protect against mutations that would otherwise be propagated throughout all tissues of the developing embryo. How these cells respond to genotoxic stress has only recently begun to be investigated. Although PSCs appear to respond to certain forms of damage more efficiently than somatic cells, some DNA damage response pathways such as the replication stress response may be lacking. Not all DNA repair pathways, including the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, have been well characterized in PSCs to date. MMR maintains genomic stability by repairing DNA polymerase errors. MMR is also involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to certain exogenous DNA-damaging agents. Here, we examined MMR function in PSCs. We have demonstrated that PSCs contain a robust MMR pathway and are highly sensitive to DNA alkylation damage in an MMR-dependent manner. Interestingly, the nature of this alkylation response differs from that previously reported in somatic cell types. In somatic cells, a permanent G2/M cell cycle arrest is induced in the second cell cycle after DNA damage. The PSCs, however, directly undergo apoptosis in the first cell cycle. This response reveals that PSCs rely on apoptotic cell death as an important defense to avoid mutation accumulation. Our results also suggest an alternative molecular mechanism by which the MMR pathway can induce a response to DNA damage that may have implications for tumorigenesis."

Here, we report, for the first time, the computational identification of small molecules able to inhibit dyskerin catalytic activity. Different in silico techniques were applied to select compounds and analyze the binding modes and the interaction patterns of ligands in the human dyskerin catalytic site. We also describe a newly developed and optimized fast real-time PCR assay that was used to detect dyskerin pseudouridylation activity in vitro. The identification of new dyskerin inhibitors constitutes the first proof of principle that the pseudouridylation activity can be modulated by means of small molecule agents. Therefore, the presented results, obtained through the usage of computational tools and experimental validation, indicate an alternative therapeutic strategy to target ribosome biogenesis pathway."

Male ICR mice were assigned to 6 groups; mice in each group were given tap water (normal and STZ diabetic groups) or STZ with BDSW of varying hardness (0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 ppm) for 4 weeks. The STZ with BDSW group exhibited lowered fasting plasma glucose levels than the STZ-induced diabetic group. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed that BDSW improves impaired glucose tolerance in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Histopathological evaluation of the pancreas showed that BDSW restores the morphology of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and increases the secretion of insulin in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that the expression of hepatic genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glucose oxidation, and glycogenolysis was suppressed, while the expression of the genes involved in glucose uptake, β-oxidation, and glucose oxidation in muscle were increased in the STZ with BDSW group. BDSW stimulated PI3-K, AMPK, and mTOR pathway-mediated glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. BDSW increased AMPK phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes and improved impaired AMPK phosphorylation in the muscles of STZ-induced diabetic mice. Taken together, these results suggest that BDSW is a potential anti-diabetic agent, owing to its ability to suppress hyperglycemia and improve glucose intolerance by modulating glucose metabolism, recovering pancreatic islets of Langerhans and increasing glucose uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2088601403,"Objective To establish the role of liver fibrosis as a predictive tool of response to pegylated interferon alpha (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) treatment in human immunodeficiency (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected patients, in addition to recognized predictive factors (HCV load, HCV genotype, IL-28B polymorphism). Patients and Methods A sample of 267 HIV/HCV coinfected patients was treated with Peg-IFN and RBV. Predictive factors of rapid (RVR) and sustained (SVR) virological response were analyzed. Independent variables were age, sex, IL28B, −238 TNF-α and −592 IL-10 polymorphisms, HCV genotype, HCV-RNA levels, significant fibrosis or cirrhosis and CD4+ T cell count. Results Patients infected by HCV genotype 1 (n = 187) showed RVR and SVR in 12% and 39% of cases, respectively. The parameters associated with RVR were IL28B genotype CC and plasma HCV-RNA levels <600000 IU/ml. Advanced liver fibrosis was negatively associated with SVR in patients without RVR. A SVR was obtained in 42% of subjects with HCV genotype 4, and the independent factors associated with SVR were IL28B genotype CC and an HCV-RNA <600000 IU/ml. A SVR was obtained in 66% of patients with HCV genotypes 2/3; in this case, the independent parameter associated with SVR was the absence of significant liver fibrosis. TNF-α and IL-10 polymorphisms were not associated with SVR, although a significantly higher percentage of −238 TNF-α genotype GG was detected in patients with significant liver fibrosis. Conclusions In HIV/HCV coinfected patients with HCV genotypes 1 or 4, RVR, mainly influenced by genotype IL28B and HCV-RNA levels, reliably predicted SVR after 4 weeks of therapy with Peg-IFN plus RBV.

https://openalex.org/W2039524153,"The first cell lineage determination in embryos takes place when two cell populations are set apart, each differentiating into the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM), respectively. It is widely believed that position/polarity cues play a key role in triggering this differentiation, but it remains unclear how extracellular cues are transduced into cell fate determination. Here, we provide evidence that supports that neogenin is implicated in relaying extracellular cues into the first cell fate determination in preimplantation mouse embryos. A polarized and transient distribution of neogenin was manifested in early blastomeres. Neogenin up-regulation by its overexpression accelerated ICM development in the blastocyst concomitant with the activation of the ICM-specific transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, and Nanog while its depletion by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) caused a developmental abnormality of poorly endowed ICM accompanied by the deactivation of Oct3/4, Sox2, and Nanog. Treatment with netrin-1 among neogenin ligands further impaired both embryonic development and ICM formation while repulsive guidance molecule c (RGMc) led to opposite consequences, enhancing ICM formation. From this study, we propose a model whereby neogenin interprets its own expression level to control the first cell fate determination in response to extracellular cues."

Tuberculosis remains a major infectious disease, with 8.6 million new cases estimated in 2012 claiming 1.3 million lives (1.World Health Organization Global tuberculosis control report 2013. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2013Google Scholar). Moreover, the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is believed to latently infect one-third of the world's population (2.Dye C. Williams B.G. The population dynamics and control of tuberculosis.Science. 2010; 328: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Treatment of tuberculosis requires the administration of a combination of four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) for at least 6 months. The remarkable ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in the infected host for years is well documented and involves the activation of complex regulatory pathways, as well as the production of specialized enzymes and transcriptional regulators (3.Wayne L.G.

We have recently demonstrated that treatment of mycobacteria with antimicrobial agents targeting cell wall biosynthesis (cerulenin, isoniazid, or ethambutol) improves bacterial survival in nonpermissive growth conditions (5.Turapov O.

Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is mediated by the transcriptional regulator RaaS (regulator of antimicrobial-assisted survival), which controls expression of putative ATP-dependent efflux pumps (Bcg_1278c/Bcg_1277 in Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) 4The abbreviations used are: BCGbacillus Calmette-GuérinITCisothermal titration calorimetry. and Rv1218c/Rv1217c in M. tuberculosis). Deletion of raaS from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis BCG genomes has no effect on mycobacterial growth in logarithmic phase. However, the deletion mutants in both mycobacteria are impaired in long-term survival at stationary phase. Moreover, the M. bovis BCG deletion mutant displays a survival defect during macrophage infection in murine lungs and spleen, whereas the M. tuberculosis deletion mutant does not persist during macrophage infection (5.Turapov O.

These results demonstrate that RaaS controls mycobacterial survival in various models of M. tuberculosis disease. In the present study, we conducted bioinformatic analyses and predicted that fatty acid derivatives of CoA are putative ligands of RaaS. We confirmed this experimentally by demonstrating specific binding of oleoyl-CoA to RaaS and the role of oleic acid, a precursor of oleoyl-CoA, in RaaS-mediated mycobacterial survival. We propose that fatty acid metabolites produced during active growth are also involved in controlling expression of genes encoding mycobacterial efflux pumps. bacillus Calmette-Guérin isothermal titration calorimetry.

An equivalent volume of sterile water was added to control cultures. Bacterial viability was assayed by counting colony-forming units on 7H10 agar. Total RNA was isolated from 30 ml of early logarithmic (7 days) or stationary phase (31 days) M. bovis BCG cultures after a 24-h exposure to 200 μm oleic acid using the guanidinium thiocyanate/TRIzol method (6.Waddell S.J.

Open table in a new tab The M. tuberculosis raaS gene was cloned into the NdeI and NheI sites of the pET15-Tev plasmid to generate a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein (4.Dutta N.K. Bandyopadhyay N. Veeramani B. Lamichhane G. Karakousis P.C. Bader J.S. Systems biology-based identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence genes in mouse lungs.MBio. 2014; 5: e01066-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Recombinant RaaS was purified using a HiTrap 1-ml IMAC HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutants of RaaS were generated using a GeneArt mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthetic oligonucleotides, containing the imperfect direct repeats (Pr14F and Pr14R in Table 1), were covalently labeled with ATTO 647N succinimidyl ester dye (Invitrogen). Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy binding titrations were carried out on a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader using a 635-nm light-emitting diode for excitation and a monochromator set at 680 nm (bandwidth of 20 nm) for emission in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 150 mm NaCl. RaaS protein and oleoyl-CoA (Sigma) were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 150 mm NaCl. RaaS (15 μm in a 1.4-ml cell) was then titrated at 25 °C by 5-μl injections of the ligand (250 μm in the syringe) using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal). Raw data were normalized and corrected for heats of dilution of the ligand. Binding stoichiometries, enthalpy values, and equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by fitting the corrected data to a bimolecular interaction model using Origin 7 software (OriginLab). Synchrotron x-ray scattering data were collected on the SWING beamline of the SOLEIL Synchrotron (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using a PCCD-170170 detector at a wavelength of 1.03 Å. The scattering patterns were measured by merging 10–20 data recordings with 1-s exposure time each for several solute concentrations at 1 and 3 mg/ml. To check for radiation damage, all successive exposures were compared, and no changes were detected. Using a sample-detector distance of 1.8 m, a range of momentum transfer of 0.0065 < s < 0.6 Å−1 was covered (s = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.5 Å is the x-ray wavelength). The data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to infinite dilution using the program PRIMUS (8.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Cryst. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The forward scattering, I(0), and the radius of gyration, Rg, were evaluated using Guinier approximation, assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg), the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0)exp(−s2Rg2)/3). Annealed Pr14F and Pr14R (Table 1), containing the RaaS-binding site or the raaS upstream region (174 bp), were used for EMSAs as described previously (5.Turapov O. Waddell S.J. Burke B. Glenn S.

Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction buffer (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 4% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 g of sheared salmon sperm DNA per reaction. 32P-Labeled annealed oligonucleotides and purified recombinant RaaS were added to the reaction at concentrations of 60 and 215 nm, respectively, except where stated otherwise. Oleoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and dodecyl-CoA were added to samples as indicated. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before running on a polyacrylamide gel as described above. Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 20% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid for 10 min, dried at 65 °C under vacuum, exposed overnight, and scanned with a Canon 5600F scanner. Wild-type RaaS and site-directed mutants were loaded onto 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (pH 8.5) for 20 min at 230 V. Gels were stained using colloidal Coomassie Blue stain (Sigma). Oleoyl-CoA was added at concentrations of 30 and 60 μm. RaaS is annotated as a member of the TetR transcriptional regulator family (pfam00440). It has a short N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal domain comprising the effector-binding site. The latter is responsible for the conformational and dynamic changes that regulate DNA binding. Many TetR proteins control expression of multidrug efflux pump systems in which DNA binding of the repressor is regulated by the corresponding exported drug that interacts with the ligand-binding domain (9.Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect direct binding of RaaS to any of the antimicrobials (ethambutol, isoniazid, and cerulenin) that enhance mycobacterial survival (5.Turapov O. Waddell S.J. Burke B. Glenn S. Sarybaeva A.A. Tudo G. Labesse G. Young D.I. Young M. Andrew P.W. Butcher P.D. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Mukamolova G.V. Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); the ITC traces displayed identical spikes with increasing antimicrobial concentrations (up to 5 mm). A sequence similarity search using PSI-BLAST identified RaaS as a member of the TetR family (1.4 × 10−10) based on the alignment of the first 60 N-terminal residues only. This search did not reveal any close homologs that might indicate the nature of the ligand regulating the RaaS activity. Close homologs (whose ligands are unknown) are found in mycobacteria, with sequence identities ranging from 99% (Mycobacterium marinum; 2 × 10−118) to 74% (Mycobacterium avium; 9 × 10−101). More distant homologs are also found in other actinobacteria, with sequence identities ranging between 56% (Rhodococcus jostii; 1 × 10−70) to 48% (Streptomyces sulphureus; 8 × 10−52). Extensive -fold recognition analysis was performed using the @TOME-2 server (10.Pons J.L. Labesse G. @TOME-2: a new pipeline for comparative modeling of protein-ligand complexes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W485-W491Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and a structural alignment with proteins sharing low sequence identity (<20%) with RaaS was generated. These distantly related proteins share a strong hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket within the C-terminal domain. One of these proteins, YsiA (FadR), is a transcriptional regulator of the fatty acid degradation pathway in Bacillus subtilis, and its structure has been solved in complex with stearoyl-CoA (Protein Data Bank ID 3WHB) (11.Badger J. Sauder J.M. Adams J.M. Antonysamy S. Bain K. Bergseid M.G. Buchanan S.G. Buchanan M.D. Batiyenko Y. Christopher J.A. Emtage S. Eroshkina A. Feil I. Furlong E.B. Gajiwala K.S. Gao X. He D. Hendle J.

Structural analysis of a set of proteins resulting from a bacterial genomics project.Proteins. 2005; 60: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Comparative modeling of RaaS suggested that it has features compatible with the binding of the CoA moiety of the acyl-CoA ligand, despite a low sequence identity to the regulator domain of YsiA (14%) (Fig. 1). In particular, the C-terminal domains (involved in ligand binding) of both proteins contain conservation clusters around a short motif DXR (Asp-138 and Arg-140 in RaaS). The conserved aspartate does not interact directly with the effector, but instead, it is involved in N-terminal cap of an α-helix and in the formation of a salt bridge with the conserved arginine. Arg-140 is then well positioned to directly interact with the adenosine acyl-CoA moiety of the YsiA ligand (ID 3WHB). We examined residues in the neighborhood position of the DXR motif. The Gln-154 lateral chain in FadR points toward the ligand in the YsiA structure. This residue is Arg-144 in RaaS. The substitution of glutamine to arginine suggests a possible salt bridge with the diphosphate group of acyl-CoA. Arg-144 is conserved in the close RaaS homologs and in FadR. In addition, for the RaaS models generated, Arg-144 is compatible with acyl-CoA binding. Further analysis of the dimeric structure of YsiA highlighted the possible role of Tyr-174 (corresponding to Tyr-174 in RaaS). This residue in the monomer is in contact with the ligand molecule bound to the other monomer. The aromatic ring of the tyrosine is stacked with the adenine ring of the acyl-CoA ligand. Thus, according to our dimer model, Tyr-174 in RaaS was postulated to play the same role as Tyr-174 in YsiA to stabilize the bound acyl-CoA. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that CoA derivatives of fatty acids might regulate RaaS-DNA binding. Mycobacterial growth media and eukaryotic cells (a natural niche for mycobacterial replication and persistence) are rich sources of oleate (12.Daniel J. Maamar H. Deb C. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses host triacylglycerol to accumulate lipid droplets and acquires a dormancy-like phenotype in lipid-loaded macrophages.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002093Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Mycobacteria convert oleate to oleoyl-CoA by fatty acyl-CoA ligases (13.Arora P. Goyal A. Natarajan V.T. Rajakumara E. Verma P. Gupta R. Yousuf M. Trivedi O.A. Mohanty D. Tyagi A. Sankaranarayanan R. Gokhale R.S. Mechanistic and functional insights into fatty acid activation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and oleoyl-CoA is an abundant fatty acid precursor for the synthesis of mycobacterial cell wall components. Therefore, we tested the effect of oleoyl-CoA on the RaaS-DNA interaction using EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, oleoyl-CoA was able to completely abolish the RaaS-mediated band shift at concentrations ≥15 μm. Using ITC, we demonstrated direct binding of oleoyl-CoA to RaaS and a dissociation constant (Kd) for oleoyl-CoA binding to RaaS of 3.65 ± 0.28 μm (Fig. 2B). We next investigated whether other acyl-coenzyme derivatives have any effect of the RaaS-DNA complex. Lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), and palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1) had no effect on the band shift in the EMSA (Fig. 3, A–C). Stearoyl-CoA (C18:0) showed a dose-dependent inhibition; however, it did not eliminate RaaS-DNA binding even at the highest concentration tested, 100 μm (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that RaaS preferably binds C18 fatty acid derivatives (C18:1 oleoyl-CoA or, to some extent, C18:0 stearoyl-CoA). Longer acyl-CoA metabolites (>C18) could not be tested in our assay due to their poor solubility. Our thorough sequence structure analysis (see above) suggested that three amino acids could be responsible for acyl-CoA binding in RaaS: Arg-140, Arg-144, and Tyr-174. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated three RaaS mutants in which these residues were replaced with alanine: R140A, R144A, and Y174A. We first confirmed the structural integrities of the RaaS proteins by performing small-angle x-ray scattering experiments. Guinier plot analysis yielded radii of gyration of 30.4 ± 1, 29.7 ± 1.8, and 30.7 ± 1.3 Å for the wild-type and mutant R144A and Y174A proteins, respectively. The R140A mutant was unstable at high concentrations, and therefore, it was not possible to obtain reliable data for this protein. The apparent molecular masses calculated from the I(0) values were 40, 44, and 40 kDa for wild-type RaaS, R144A, and Y174A, respectively, confirming that all proteins were present as folded homodimers in solution. We next investigated their binding to DNA. All three mutations caused substantial increases in the dissociation constant measured by fluorescence anisotropy, ranging from 129 ± 70 nm for R144A to 611 ± 120 and 654 ± 300 nm for Y174A and R140A, respectively, compared with 31 ± 6 nm determined for wild-type RaaS (Fig. 4). The reduced DNA binding affinity resulting from these mutations was consistent with the results of EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 5A, the mutant proteins did not cause substantial DNA band shifts under the conditions used. The observed changes in the RaaS-DNA binding affinity in the wild-type and mutant proteins could be explained by altered RaaS conformation and/or flexibility, as observed in other TetR-like regulators (14.Deng W. Li C. Xie J. The underling mechanism of bacterial TetR/AcrR family transcriptional repressors.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore could not use EMSA to investigate the influence of oleoyl-CoA on the interaction of mutant RaaS with its DNA-binding site. The mutants also required higher oleoyl-CoA concentrations for titration in ITC experiments compared with wild-type RaaS. In fact, the RaaS-oleoyl-CoA binding affinities for the mutant proteins could not be measured by ITC because oleoyl-CoA aggregates at the high concentrations required (>300 μm), reducing data quality. We therefore employed native gel electrophoresis to investigate oleoyl-CoA binding to RaaS mutants, measuring the effect of oleoyl-CoA binding on migration of RaaS proteins. As shown in Fig. 5B, the addition of 30 or 60 μm oleoyl-CoA resulted in more rapid migration of RaaS and an apparent reduction in size (indicated with an arrow), which could be explained either by dissociation of the dimer to a monomeric form or by an altered protein charge or flexibility. Treatment of the mutant proteins with 30 μm oleoyl-CoA had no pronounced effect on their migration patterns, whereas the addition of 60 μm oleoyl-CoA had a partial effect, resulting in formation of two forms of RaaS (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the conserved amino acids in the ligand-binding domain are indeed involved in binding oleoyl-CoA.FIGURE 5Site-directed mutations alter RaaS interaction with DNA and ligand binding.

We have recently shown that RaaS is an autorepressor protein, and its regulon includes several genes encoding efflux pumps and conserved proteins of unknown function (5.Turapov O. Waddell S.J. Burke B. Glenn S. Sarybaeva A.A. Tudo G. Labesse G. Young D.I. Young M. Andrew P.W. Butcher P.D. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Mukamolova G.V. Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In mycobacterial cells, oleic acid is converted to oleoyl-CoA by the coordinated action of fatty acyl-AMP ligases and acyl-CoA-synthesizing fatty acyl-CoA ligases (12.Daniel J. Maamar H. Deb C. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses host triacylglycerol to accumulate lipid droplets and acquires a dormancy-like phenotype in lipid-loaded macrophages.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002093Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in intracellular acyl-CoA concentration. An increase in oleoyl-CoA concentration should prevent the transcriptional repressor RaaS from binding DNA, leading to elevated expression of the RaaS efflux regulon in nonreplicating mycobacteria, which is detrimental to long-term survival. Expression levels of selected genes belonging to the RaaS regulon were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. We compared the effect of oleic acid treatment on expression of raaS, bcg_1277c, bcg_1278c, and drrC in logarithmic and stationary growth phases. Oleic acid had no statistically significant effect on expression of these genes in logarithmic phase (Fig. 6A). However, expression of RaaS-regulated genes (bcg_1277c, bcg_1278c, and drrC) was induced by 4.8-, 2.7-, and 3.7-fold, respectively, in stationary phase M. bovis BCG cultures 24 h after treatment with oleic acid (Fig. 6A). Expression of raaS (in the same operon as bcg_1277c and bcg_1278c) in stationary phase mycobacteria was also increased after treatment with oleic acid. Exposure of log phase mycobacteria to oleic acid did not result in growth alteration (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, the addition of oleic acid to 1-month-old stationary phase cultures completely abolished the antimicrobial survival-enhanced effect (Fig. 6C) mediated by RaaS, thus implicating oleoyl-CoA in the regulation of long-term mycobacterial survival. Expression of bacterial operons is tightly controlled by transcription factors, repressors or activators, which alter transcript levels in response to physiological bacterial state or environmental cues (15.Browning D.F.

In some cases, as pertinent here for RaaS, repressors are cotranscribed with their regulon (14.Deng W. Li C. Xie J. The underling mechanism of bacterial TetR/AcrR family transcriptional repressors.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RaaS is a transcriptional regulator that plays an important role in long-term mycobacterial survival in vitro and in vivo (5.Turapov O. Waddell S.J. Burke B. Glenn S. Sarybaeva A.A. Tudo G. Labesse G. Young D.I. Young M. Andrew P.W. Butcher P.D. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Mukamolova G.V. Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, RaaS mediates an improvement in mycobacterial survival after exposure of nonreplicating bacteria to antimicrobial agents targeting cell wall biosynthesis. Here, we have demonstrated that the RaaS-DNA complex is regulated by acyl-CoAs, specifically oleoyl-CoA and, to a lesser extent, stearoyl-CoA (Figs. 2B and 3). The addition of oleic acid, a precursor of oleoyl-CoA, completely abolished the survival-promoting effects of ethambutol and dysregulated the RaaS regulon (Fig. 5), confirming the biological relevance of oleoyl-CoA as a regulator of mycobacterial persistence. During the preparation of this manuscript, a crystal structure of RaaS (Rv1219c) was solved (16.Kumar N. Radhakrishnan A. Wright C.C. Chou T.H. Lei H.T. Bolla J.R. Tringides M.L. Rajashankar K.R. Su C.C. Purdy G.E. Yu E.W. Crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator Rv1219c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The structure analysis confirmed our predictions concerning the importance of Arg-140 and Arg-144, but not Tyr-174, in ligand binding. However, the structure revealed the presence of a very large hydrophobic cavity of 880 Å compared with the calculated volume of the aliphatic chain of oleoyl-CoA of 345 Å (Fig. 7B). The RaaS cavity size significantly exceeds volumes of the binding pocket of YsiA (403 Å) (Fig. 7A) or other mycobacterial TetR regulators such as EthR (399 Å; Protein Data Bank ID 4DW6) and KstR (190 Å; ID 3MNL). This striking difference in the RaaS structure indicates that other longer chain acyl-CoAs or complex lipids containing fatty acids might potentially fit into the binding pocket and regulate the DNA-binding activity of RaaS. Mycobacteria are able to produce and export a great variety of lipids containing fatty acids from oleic acid itself (17.Nazarova E.V. Shleeva M. O Morozova N.S. Kudykina Y.K. Vostroknutova G.N. Ruzhitsky A.O. Selishcheva A.A. Sorokoumova G.M. Shvets V.I. Kaprelyants A.S. Role of lipid components in formation and reactivation of Mycobacterium smegmatis “nonculturable” cells.Biochemistry. 2011; 76: 636-644PubMed Google Scholar) to acyl-trehaloses (18.Kaur D. Guerin M.E. Skovierová H. Brennan P.J. Jackson M. Biogenesis of the cell wall and other glycoconjugates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 69: 23-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is possible that the RaaS-regulated Rv1218c/Rv1217c pump is involved in the export of these oleate-containing lipids. Moreover, DrrC (which may also be regulated by RaaS) has been implicated in the export of the complex lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate in M. tuberculosis (19.Camacho L.R. Constant P. Raynaud C. Laneelle M.A. Triccas J.A. Gicquel B. Daffe M. Guilhot C. Analysis of the phthiocerol dimycocerosate locus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Evidence that this lipid is involved in the cell wall permeability barrier.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19845-19854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Derivatives of fatty acids have been previously demonstrated to regulate the expression of mycobacterial lipid transporters (20.Radhakrishnan A. Kumar N. Wright C.C. Chou T.H. Tringides M.L. Bolla J.R. Lei H.T. Rajashankar K.R. Su C.C. Purdy G.E. Yu E.W. Crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator Rv0678 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16526-16540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our findings support the importance of acyl-CoA metabolites in the regulation of mycobacterial efflux and long-term persistence. As free acyl-CoA accumulates, RaaS is released from its DNA-binding site, and downstream genes encoding efflux pumps are expressed (Fig. 8A). Depletion of free acyl-CoA allows RaaS to bind to DNA, resulting in repression of the downstream transporter genes (Fig. 8B). ATP-dependent efflux pumps are integral components of the energy and metabolic circuitry of growing cells, and their activity depends on the metabolic state of bacteria, which may be finely tuned by metabolites binding to transcriptional regulators. In non-growing cells, the levels of acyl-CoAs drop following the slowing down of metabolism. Under stressful conditions (for example, hypoxia or iron limitation), mycobacteria can redirect carbon flux from the tricarboxylic acid cycle to alternative metabolic pathways and to the synthesis of triacylglycerols (21.Baek S.H. Li A.H. Sassetti C.M. Metabolic regulation of mycobacterial growth and antibiotic sensitivity.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001065Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 22.Shi L. Sohaskey C.D.

Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This mechanism is important for long-term survival, as it generates storage compounds, removes toxic fatty acid derivatives, and depletes free fatty acids and their CoA derivatives (21.Baek S.H. Li A.H. Sassetti C.M. Metabolic regulation of mycobacterial growth and antibiotic sensitivity.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001065Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 22.Shi L. Sohaskey C.D.

Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that under stressful conditions or to survive long-term during infection, free RaaS binds to its DNA recognition sequence, repressing the transcription of this cluster of efflux pump genes and itself in a classical feedback loop (Fig. 8). We further propose that antimicrobial treatment potentiates this process, directly or indirectly inhibiting fatty acid synthases and rapidly depleting residual (C16–C18 chain) fatty acid precursors (23.Vilchèze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R.

We have shown that RaaS is a component of the complex regulatory mechanisms orchestrating a coordinated down-regulation of energy-consuming processes and the activation of long-term persistence. This is supported by our previous findings that M. tuberculosis employs the RaaS-mediated mechanism for in vitro persistence in prolonged stationary phase and during in vivo macrophage and mouse infections (5.Turapov O. Waddell S.J. Burke B. Glenn S. Sarybaeva A.A. Tudo G. Labesse G. Young D.I. Young M. Andrew P.W. Butcher P.D. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Mukamolova G.V. Antimicrobial treatment improves mycobacterial survival in non-permissive growth conditions.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Transposon inactivation of Rv1218c results in the highest fitness cost in macrophage culture (26.Stewart G.R. Patel J. Robertson B.D. Rae A. Young D.B. Mycobacterial mutants with defective control of phagosomal acidification.PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but the precise physiological role of the Rv1218c/Rv1217c (Bcg_1278c/Bcg_1277c) pump remains unknown. We propose that Rv1218c/Rv1217c likely transports lipid molecule(s) that are important for the initial stages of infection and may become toxic or are dispensable during nonreplicating persistence. Our findings suggest that this putative lipid contains fatty acid moieties (oleic and possibly also stearic acids), which are highly abundant in growing mycobacteria (as CoA derivatives) and are rapidly depleted in nonpermissive growth conditions. Our sequence analysis extended to Rv1216c and Rv1215c (Bcg_1276c and Bcg_1275c) highlights distant similarities to an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent membrane-embedded methyltransferase and a lipid esterase/transferase. Accordingly, these proteins might be predicted to modify a lipid precursor to be secreted by the Rv1218c/Rv1217c (Bcg_1278c/Bcg_1277c) efflux pump. Future experiments will focus on the nature of the molecules transported by Rv1218c/Rv1217c (Bcg_1278c/Bcg_1277c) and elucidation of their precise roles in mycobacterial growth, infection, and persistence. Our findings indicate that dysregulation of efflux pumps can be employed to kill non-growing mycobacteria.
