https://openalex.org/W3121447856,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the pandemic human respiratory illness COVID-19, is a global health emergency. While severe acute disease has been linked to an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, we sought to identify B cell responses that correlated with positive clinical outcomes in convalescent patients. We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects. Memory B cell subsets in convalescent subjects were composed of classical CD24 + class-switched memory B cells, but also activated CD24-negative and natural unswitched CD27 + IgD + IgM + subsets. Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in most seropositive subjects. IgM + memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over 3 months. Our findings suggest that the frequency of memory B cells is a critical indicator of disease resolution, and that IgM + memory B cells may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3124422938,"Human brain tissue models such as cerebral organoids are essential tools for developmental and biomedical research. Current methods to generate cerebral organoids often utilize Matrigel as an external scaffold to provide structure and biologically relevant signals. Matrigel however is a nonspecific hydrogel of mouse tumor origin and does not represent the complexity of the brain protein environment. In this study, we investigated the application of a decellularized adult porcine brain extracellular matrix (B-ECM) which could be processed into a hydrogel (B-ECM hydrogel) to be used as a scaffold for human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived brain organoids. We decellularized pig brains with a novel detergent- and enzyme-based method and analyzed the biomaterial properties, including protein composition and content, DNA content, mechanical characteristics, surface structure, and antigen presence. Then, we compared the growth of human brain organoid models with the B-ECM hydrogel or Matrigel controls in vitro . We found that the native brain source material was successfully decellularized with little remaining DNA content, while Mass Spectrometry (MS) showed the loss of several brain-specific proteins, while mainly different collagen types remained in the B-ECM. Rheological results revealed stable hydrogel formation, starting from B-ECM hydrogel concentrations of 5 mg/mL. hESCs cultured in B-ECM hydrogels showed gene expression and differentiation outcomes similar to those grown in Matrigel. These results indicate that B-ECM hydrogels can be used as an alternative scaffold for human cerebral organoid formation, and may be further optimized for improved organoid growth by further improving protein retention other than collagen after decellularization."
https://openalex.org/W3121425062,"Purpose Since the outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. We analyzed and compared the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics between survivors and non-survivors and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods Clinical and laboratory variables, radiological features, treatment approach, and complications were retrospectively collected in two centers of Hubei province, China. Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify the risk factors for mortality. Results A total of 432 patients were enrolled, and the median patient age was 54 years. The overall mortality rate was 5.09% (22/432). As compared with the survivor group (n = 410), those in the non-survivor group (n = 22) were older, and they had a higher frequency of comorbidities and were more prone to suffer from dyspnea. Several abnormal laboratory variables indicated that acute cardiac injury, hepatic damage, and acute renal insufficiency were detected in the non-survivor group. Non-surviving patients also had a high computed tomography (CT) score and higher rate of consolidation. The most common complication causing death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (18/22, 81.8%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;90 g/L (hazard ratio, 10.776; 95% confidence interval, 3.075–37.766; p &lt;0.0001), creatine kinase (CK-MB) &gt;8 U/L (9.155; 2.424–34.584; p = 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;245 U/L (5.963; 2.029–17.529; p = 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT) &gt;0.5 ng/ml (7.080; 1.671–29.992; p = 0.008), and CT score &gt;10 (39.503; 12.430–125.539; p &lt;0.0001) were independent risk factors for the mortality of COVID-19. Conclusions Low Hb, high LDH, PCT, and CT score on admission were the predictors for mortality and could assist clinicians in early identification of poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3121788241,"Objective Test whether high dose corticosteroid pulse therapy (HDCPT) with either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone is associated with increased survival in COVID-19 patients at risk of hyper-inflammatory response. Provide some initial diagnostic criteria using laboratory markers to stratify these patients. Methods This is a prospective observational study, 318 met the inclusion criteria. 64 patients (20.1%) were treated with HDCPT by using at least 1.5mg/kg/24h of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone equivalent. A multivariate Cox regression (controlling for co-morbidities and other therapies) was carried out to determine whether HDCPT (among other interventions) was associated with decreased mortality. We also carried out a 30-day time course analysis of laboratory markers between survivors and non-survivors, to identify potential markers for patient stratification. Results HDCPT showed a statistically significant decrease in mortality (HR = 0.087 [95% CI 0.021–0.36]; P &lt; 0.001). 30-day time course analysis of laboratory marker tests showed marked differences in pro-inflammatory markers between survivors and non-survivors. As diagnostic criteria to define the patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, we propose the following parameters (IL-6 &gt; = 40 pg/ml, and/or two of the following: C-reactive protein &gt; = 100 mg/L, D-dimer &gt; = 1000 ng/ml, ferritin &gt; = 500 ng/ml and lactate dehydrogenase &gt; = 300 U/L). Conclusions HDCPT can be an effective intervention to increase COVID-19 survival rates in patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, laboratory marker tests can be used to stratify these patients who should be given HDCPT. This study is not a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Future RCTs should be carried out to confirm the efficacy of HDCPT to increase the survival rates of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3122233080,"Evaluation of nasal spray drug absorption has been challenging because deposited particles are consistently transported away by mucociliary clearance during diffusing through the mucus layer. This study developed a novel approach combining Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques with a 1-D mucus diffusion model to better predict nasal spray drug absorption. This integrated CFD-diffusion approach comprised a preliminary simulation of nasal airflow, spray particle injection, followed by analysis of mucociliary clearance and drug solute diffusion through the mucus layer. The spray particle deposition distribution was validated experimentally and numerically, and the mucus velocity field was validated by comparing with previous studies. Total and regional drug absorption for solute radius in the range of 1 − 110 nm were investigated. The total drug absorption contributed by the spray particle deposition was calculated. The absorption contribution from particles that deposited on the anterior region was found to increase significantly as the solute radius became larger (diffusion became slower). This was because the particles were consistently moved out of the anterior region, and the delayed absorption ensured more solute to be absorbed by the posterior regions covered with respiratory epithelium. Future improvements in the spray drug absorption model were discussed. The results of this study are aimed at working towards a CFD-based integrated model for evaluating nasal spray bioequivalence."
https://openalex.org/W3123407365,"Background During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, advanced health systems have come under pressure by the unprecedented high volume of patients needing urgent care. The impact on mortality of this “patients’ burden” has not been determined. Methods and findings Through retrieval of administrative data from a large referral hospital of Northern Italy, we determined Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence curves to describe the in-hospital mortality, stratified by fixed covariates. Age- and sex-adjusted Cox models were used to quantify the effect on mortality of variables deemed to reflect the stress on the hospital system, namely the time-dependent number of daily admissions and of total hospitalized patients, and the calendar period. Of the 1225 subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 20 and May 13, 283 died (30-day mortality rate 24%) after a median follow-up of 14 days (interquartile range 5–19). Hospitalizations increased progressively until a peak of 465 subjects on March 26, then declined. The risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, increased for a higher number of daily admissions (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] per an incremental daily admission of 10 patients: 1.13, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.05–1.22, p = 0.0014), and for a higher total number of hospitalized patients (AHR per an increase of 50 patients in the total number of hospitalized subjects: 1.11, 95%CI 1.04–1.17, p = 0.0004), while was lower for the calendar period after the peak (AHR 0.56, 95%CI 0.43–0.72, p&lt;0.0001). A validation was conducted on a dataset from another hospital where 500 subjects were hospitalized for COVID-19 in the same period. Figures were consistent in terms of impact of daily admissions, daily census, and calendar period on in-hospital mortality. Conclusions The pressure of a high volume of severely ill patients suffering from COVID-19 has a measurable independent impact on in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3124527732,"Objectives Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a weight management approach in which food is consumed only within a specific period each day. The simplicity of this approach is appealing, but its efficacy is not known. The aim of this pilot cohort study was to assess adherence to TRE and its effects on weight and lipid profile. Methods Fifty participants with obesity attempted to follow TRE for 12 weeks. Surveys were conducted weekly over the phone to assess treatment adherence and ratings; and at 6 and 12 weeks, participants attended the clinic to be weighed, have their blood pressure taken and provide a blood sample for lipid profile. Treatment results were compared with data from previous comparable cohorts using other weight management methods. Results Mean age of the participants was 50 (SD = 12.0), mean weight 97kg (SD = 17.1), mean BMI = 35 (SD = 4.0) and most were female (74%). At weeks 6 and 12, 64% and 58% of participants continued to practice TRE on at least five days/week. Using the ‘last observation carried forward’ imputation, mean (SD) weight loss was 2.0 (1.7) kg and 2.6 (2.6) kg at 6 and 12 weeks. Among participants who provided follow-up data, those who adhered to the intervention for at least five days/week recorded greater weight loss than those with lower adherence (week 6: 2.5 (1.7) vs 1.0 (1.3), p = 0.003; week 12: 3.5 (2.7) vs 1.3 (2.0), p = 0.001). A total of 26% of the sample lost at least 5% of their body weight at 12 weeks. The intervention had no effect on blood pressure or lipid profile. Conclusions TRE results were modest, but at least on par with those achieved with more complex interventions, and weight loss did not decline at 12 weeks. A formal trial of the intervention is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3123412464,"Background Identification of vertebral fractures (VFs) is critical for effective secondary fracture prevention owing to their association with the increasing risks of future fractures. Plain abdominal frontal radiographs (PARs) are a common investigation method performed for a variety of clinical indications and provide an ideal platform for the opportunistic identification of VF. This study uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to identify the feasibility for the screening, detection, and localization of VFs using PARs. Methods A DCNN was pretrained using ImageNet and retrained with 1306 images from the PARs database obtained between August 2015 and December 2018. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated. The visualization algorithm gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for model interpretation. Results Only 46.6% (204/438) of the VFs were diagnosed in the original PARs reports. The algorithm achieved 73.59% accuracy, 73.81% sensitivity, 73.02% specificity, and an AUC of 0.72 in the VF identification. Conclusion Computer driven solutions integrated with the DCNN have the potential to identify VFs with good accuracy when used opportunistically on PARs taken for a variety of clinical purposes. The proposed model can help clinicians become more efficient and economical in the current clinical pathway of fragile fracture treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3120419130,"Background Tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking are associated with several diseases, and studies on the joint effects of smoking and drinking are rare. Objective This study investigates the joint effects of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on all-cause and premature mortality in a contemporary cohort. Methods The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is an ongoing nationally representative survey of subjects aged over 45 years in China that was performed every two years for a total of three waves from 2011 to 2015 in China. We used weighted logistic regression models to estimate the joint effects of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on all-cause and premature mortality. Results After adjusting for prespecified confounders, the odds ratios (ORs) of all-cause mortality were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.09–2.10) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.03–2.08) in smokers and smokers/drinkers, respectively. Compared with nonsmokers/nondrinkers, the OR of smokers/drinkers for premature death was 3.14 (95% CI: 1.56–6.34). In the female subgroup, there was an approximately 5-fold (OR = 4.95; 95% CI: 2.00–12.27) odds of premature mortality for smokers/drinkers compared to nonsmokers/nondrinkers. Conclusion This study found a joint effect of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on all-cause and premature mortality among a contemporary and nationally representative cohort in China. Our results suggested that the joint effects were more pronounced in women, but further research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3124824895,"Wildlife crime presents a growing threat to the integrity of ecological communities. While campaigns have raised consumer awareness, little is known about the socio-demographic profile of wildlife offenders, or how to intervene. Using data from China Judgements Online (2014–2018), we documented 4,735 cases, involving 7,244 offenders who smuggled, hunted, transported, sold and/or purchased protected species in contravention of China’s Criminal Law. Offenders were predominantly men (93.0% of 7,143 offenders), aged 30–44 (43.9% of 4,699), agricultural workers (48.4% of 3,960), with less schooling (78.6% of 4,699 &lt; senior secondary school). Socio-economic profiles related to crime seriousness, the type of illegal activity, motivation and taxon involved. These generalizations reveal scope to tailor specific intervention and mitigation approaches to offender profiles, through public information campaigns, proactive incentives opposed by punitive disincentives, and provision of alternative incomes."
https://openalex.org/W3121295341,"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been reported as a key player in the nosocomial spreading of COVID-19. Early detection of infected HCWs can prevent spreading of the virus in hospitals among HCWs and patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the asymptomatic infection of HCWs in a private clinic in the city of Santiago, Chile. Our study was conducted during a period of 5 weeks at the peak of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 413 HCWs and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. We found that a 3.14% of HCWs were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (14/413). Out of these, 7/14 were completely asymptomatic and did not develop symptoms within 3 weeks of testing. Sequencing of viral genomes showed the predominance of the GR clade; however, sequence comparison demonstrated numerous genetic differences among them suggesting community infection as the main focus of transmission among HCWs. Our study demonstrates that the protocols applied to protect HCWs and patients have been effective as no infection clusters due to asymptomatic carriers were found in the clinic. Together, these data suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs of this health center is not nosocomial."
https://openalex.org/W3121285541,"Pachychoroid spectrum diseases have been described as a new clinical entity within the spectrum of macular disorders. “Pachychoroid” is defined as choroidal thickening associated with dilated outer choroidal vessels often showing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration. Although various clinical studies on the pachychoroid spectrum diseases have been conducted, the pathophysiology of pachychoroid has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we attempted to establish a mouse model of pachychoroid. We sutured vortex veins in eyes of wild type mice to imitate the vortex vein congestion in pachychoroid spectrum diseases. Fundus photography and ultra-widefield indocyanine green angiography showed dilated vortex veins from the posterior pole to the ampulla in eyes after induction of choroidal congestion. Optical coherence tomography and tissue sections presented choroidal thickening with dilatation of choroidal vessels. The RPE-choroid/retina thickness ratios on the tissue sections in the treated day 1 and day 7 groups were significantly greater than that in the control group (0.19±0.03 and 0.16±0.01 vs. 0.12±0.02, P&lt;0.05 each). Moreover, immunohistochemistry using RPE flatmount revealed focal RPE degeneration in the treated eyes. Furthermore, inflammatory response-related genes were upregulated in eyes with choroidal congestion induction, and macrophages migrated into the thickened choroid. These results indicated that vortex vein congestion triggered some pachychoroid features. Thus, we have established a choroidal congestion mouse model by suturing vortex veins, which would potentially be useful for investigating the pathophysiology of pachychoroid spectrum diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3124180929,"It is known that hippocampal epileptogenesis is accompanied by hyperexcitability, glutamate-related neuronal dysfunctions and consequently cognitive deficits. However, the neuroprotective role of astrocytic glutamate uptake through the Glutamate Transporter-1 (GLT-1) remains to be unknown in these processes. Therefore, to assess the effect of glutamate uptake, pharmacological upregulation of GLT-1 using ceftriaxone administration (200 mg/kg/day, i.p, 5 days) was utilized in Li-PIL animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Glutamate concentration and glutamine synthetase activity were analyzed using biochemical assays. In addition, GLT-1 gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. Finally, cognitive function was studied using Morris water maze (MWM) test and novel object recognition task (NORT). Our results demonstrated that the acute phase of epileptogenesis (first 72 hours after Status Epilepticus) was accompanied by an increase in the hippocampal glutamate and downregulation of GLT-1 mRNA expression compared to controls. Ceftriaxone administration in epileptic animals led to a reduction of glutamate along with elevation of the level of glutamine synthetase activity and GLT-1 expression in the acute phase. In the chronic phase of epileptogenesis (4 weeks after Status Epilepticus), glutamate levels and GLT-1 expression were decreased compared to controls. Ceftriaxone treatment increased the levels of GLT-1 expression. Furthermore, impaired learning and memory ability in the chronic phase of epileptogenesis was rescued by Ceftriaxone administration. This study shows that astrocytic glutamate uptake can profoundly impact the processes of hippocampal epileptogenesis through the reduction of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and consequently rescuing of cognitive deficits caused by epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W3126130530,"Low objective socioeconomic status (SES) has been correlated with poor physical and mental health among older adults. Some studies suggest that subjective SES is also important for ensuring sound physical and mental health among older adults. However, few studies have been conducted on the impact of both objective and subjective SES on mental health among older adults. This study examines whether objective or subjective SES is associated with depressive symptoms in older adults in Myanmar. This cross-sectional study, conducted between September and December, 2018, used a multistage sampling method to recruit participants from two regions of Myanmar, for face-to-face interviews. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to evaluate the depressive symptoms. Participants were classified as having no depressive symptom (GDS score &lt;5) and having depressive symptoms (GDS score ≥5). Objective and subjective SES were assessed using the wealth index and asking participants a multiple-choice question about their current financial situation, respectively. The relationship between objective/subjective SES and depressive symptoms was examined using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mean age of the 1,186 participants aged 60 years and above was 69.7 (SD: 7.3), and 706 (59.5%) were female. Among them, 265 (22.3%) had depressive symptoms. After adjusting for objective SES and other covariates, only low subjective SES was positively associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 4.18, 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.98–5.87). This association was stronger among participants in the rural areas (urban areas, AOR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.08–4.05; rural areas, AOR: 5.65, 95% CI: 3.69–8.64). Subjective SES has a stronger association with depressive symptoms than objective SES, among older adults of the two regions in Myanmar, especially in the rural areas. Interventions for depression in older adults should consider regional differences in the context of subjective SES by reducing socioeconomic disparities among the communities."
https://openalex.org/W3125961719,"In recent years, in the context of China’s continuous medical and health reforms, the health status of Chinese women and children has been significantly improved through the continuous efforts of staff at all levels of maternal and child health care institutions. Many indicators in maternal health care have improved significantly, but the speed and magnitude of changes have varied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dynamic changes in China’s maternal health status from 2004 to 2018, in order to determine whether China’s medical and health reform measures in recent years have improved maternal health. A total of 6 evaluation indicators from the data of China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019 were selected. Then, based on the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) methodology, the entropy weighted technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), entropy weighted rank-sum ratio (RSR) method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation were employed in this study. In addition, sensitivity analysis was engaged to validate the stability and accuracy of the achieved results. The study results shows the ranking values of various methods were not exactly the same, but the overall trend was consistent. Overall, the maternal health care in China improved from 2004 to 2018 year by year, of which the top four were ranked from 2015 to 2018, and relatively poor from 2004 to 2006. This means that the policies and measures implemented in China’s medical and health reform in the past few decades have effectively promoted China’s maternal health care, and this will also provide a theoretical basis for future decisions to promote maternal health care."
https://openalex.org/W3122150670,"Objective We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the first 6 months of a 24 month multidisciplinary intervention program including circuit training and a balanced diet in children and adolescents with obesity. Methods A quasi-experimental intervention trial included 242 participants (age [mean±standard deviation]: 11.3±2.06 years, 97 girls) of at least 85th percentile of age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI). Participants were grouped into three to receive usual care (usual care group), exercise intervention with circuit training (exercise group), or intensive nutritional and feedback intervention with a balanced diet (nutritional group). Primary outcome was BMI z-score, while secondary outcomes included body composition, cardiometabolic risk markers, nutrition, and physical fitness. Results Among the participants, 80.6% had a BMI ≥ the 97th percentile for age and sex. The BMI z-score of the overall completers decreased by about 0.080 after 6 months of intervention (p &lt; 0.001). After the intervention, both exercise and nutritional groups had significantly lower BMI z-scores than the baseline data by about 0.14 and 0.075, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Significant group by time interaction effects were observed between exercise versus usual care group in BMI z-score (β, -0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.20 to -0.023) and adiponectin (β, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58); and between nutritional versus usual care group in waist circumference (β, -3.47; 95% CI, -6.06 to -0.89). No statistically significant differences were observed in any of the other secondary outcomes assessed. Conclusion Multidisciplinary intervention including circuit training and a balanced diet for children and adolescents with obesity reduced the BMI z-score and improved cardiometabolic risk markers such as adiponectin and waist circumference."
https://openalex.org/W3123347104,"Background A growing amount of evidence indicates in utero and early life growth has profound, long-term consequences for an individual’s health throughout the life course; however, there is limited data in preterm infants, a vulnerable population at risk for growth abnormalities. Objective To address the gap in knowledge concerning early growth and its determinants in preterm infants. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using a population of preterm (&lt; 37 weeks gestation) infants obtained from an electronic medical record database. Weight z-scores were acquired from discharge until roughly two years corrected age. Linear mixed effects modeling, with random slopes and intercepts, was employed to estimate growth trajectories. Results Thirteen variables, including maternal race, hypertension during pregnancy, preeclampsia, first trimester body mass index, multiple status, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, year of birth, length of birth hospitalization stay, total parenteral nutrition, and dextrose treatment, were significantly associated with growth rates of preterm infants in univariate analyses. A small percentage (1.32% - 2.07%) of the variation in the growth of preterm infants can be explained in a joint model of these perinatal factors. In extremely preterm infants, additional variation in growth trajectories can be explained by conditions whose risk differs by degree of prematurity. Specifically, infants with periventricular leukomalacia or retinopathy of prematurity experienced decelerated rates of growth compared to infants without such conditions. Conclusions Factors found to influence growth over time in children born at term also affect growth of preterm infants. The strength of association and the magnitude of the effect varied by gestational age, revealing that significant heterogeneity in growth and its determinants exists within the preterm population."
https://openalex.org/W3124695128,"In the context of a broad study aimed at examining dyeing technologies in the Timna textiles collection, three samples of prestigious fibers dyed with murex sea snail were identified. Our identification is based on the presence of 6-monobromoindigotin and 6 , 6-dibromoindigotin components (detected using HPLC analysis), which is considered unequivocal evidence for the use of murex-derived purple dyestuff. Furthermore, by comparing the analytical results with those obtained in a series of controlled dyeing experiments we were able to shed more light on the specific species used in the dyeing process and glean insights into the ancient dyeing technology. The samples originated from excavations at the extensive Iron Age copper smelting site of “Slaves’ Hill” (Site 34), which is tightly dated by radiocarbon to the late 11 th –early 10 th centuries BCE. While evidence for the important role of purple dyes in the ancient Mediterranean goes back to the Middle Bronze Age (early 2 nd millennium BCE), finds of dyed textiles are extremely rare, and those from Timna are the oldest currently known in the Southern Levant. In conjunction with other observations of the very high quality of the Timna textiles, this provides an exceptional opportunity to address questions related to social stratification and organization of the nomadic society operating the mines (early Edom), the “fashion” of elite in the region during the early Iron Age, trade connections, technological capabilities, and more."
https://openalex.org/W3122103099,"A novel five year Test and Vaccinate or Remove (TVR) wildlife research intervention project in badgers ( Meles meles) commenced in 2014 in a 100km 2 area of Northern Ireland. It aimed to increase the evidence base around badgers and bovine TB and help create well-informed and evidence-based strategies to address the issue of cattle-to-cattle spread and spread between cattle and badgers. It involved real-time trap-side testing of captured badgers and vaccinating those that tested negative for bTB (BadgerBCG–BCG Danish 1331) and removal of those that tested bTB positive using the Dual-Path Platform VetTB test (DPP) for cervids (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Medford, NY USA). Four diagnostic tests were utilised within the study interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), culture (clinical samples and post mortem), DPP using both whole blood and DPP using serum. BCG Sofia (SL222) was used in the final two years because of supply issues with BadgerBCG. Objectives for this study were to evaluate the performance of the DPP in field conditions and whether any trend was apparent in infection prevalence over the study period. A Bayesian latent class model of diagnostic test evaluation in the absence of a gold standard was applied to the data. Temporal variation in the sensitivity of DPP and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) due to the impact of control measures was investigated using logistic regression and individual variability was assessed. Bayesian latent class analysis estimated DPP with serum to have a sensitivity of 0.58 (95% CrI: 0.40–0.76) and specificity of 0.97 (95% CrI: 0.95–0.98). The DPP with whole blood showed a higher sensitivity (0.69 (95% CrI: 0.48–0.88)) but similar specificity (0.98 (95% Crl: 0.96–0.99)). The change from BCG Danish to BCG Sofia significantly impacted on DPP serum test characteristics. In addition, there was weak evidence of increasing sensitivity of IGRA over time and differences in DPP test sensitivity between adults and cubs. An exponential decline model was an appropriate representation of the infection prevalence over the 5 years, with a starting prevalence of 14% (95% CrI: 0.10–0.20), and an annual reduction of 39.1% (95% CrI: 26.5–50.9). The resulting estimate of infection prevalence in year 5 of the study was 1.9% (95% CrI: 0.8–3.8). These results provide field evidence of a statistically significant reduction in badger TB prevalence supporting a TVR approach to badger intervention. They give confidence in the reliability and reproducibility in the DPP Whole Blood as a real time trap-side diagnostic test for badgers, and describe the effect of vaccination and reduced infection prevalence on test characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3125279644,"Background Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and cats. Clinical symptoms of SFTS-infected cats resemble those of SFTS patients, whereas SFTS-contracted cats have high levels of viral RNA loads in the serum and body fluids. Due to the risk of direct infection from SFTS-infected cats to human, it is important to diagnose SFTS-suspected animals. In this study, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was newly developed to diagnose SFTS-suspected animals without non-specific reactions. Methodology/principle findings Four primer sets were newly designed from consensus sequences constructed from 108 strains of SFTSV. A RT-PCR with these four primer sets successfully and specifically detected four clades of SFTSV. Their limits of detection are 1–10 copies/reaction. Using this RT-PCR, 5 cat cases among 56 SFTS-suspected animal cases were diagnosed as SFTS. From these cats, IgM or IgG against SFTSV were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but not neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) test. This phenomenon is similar to those of fatal SFTS patients. Conclusion/significance This newly developed RT-PCR could detect SFTSV RNA of several clades and from SFTS-suspected animals. In addition to ELISA and PRNT test, the useful laboratory diagnosis systems of SFTS-suspected animals has been made in this study."

It has been reported that rebamipide, a mucoprotective drug, exerts a protective effect against NSAID-induced small intestinal damage; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of the small intestinal microbiota in the protective effect of rebamipide against indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage in mice. A comprehensive analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed an alteration in the composition of the small intestinal microbiota at the species level, modulated by the administration of rebamipide and omeprazole. The transplantation of the small intestinal microbiota of the mice treated with rebamipide suppressed the indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, exacerbated the indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage, which was accompanied by the alteration of the small intestinal microbiota. We found that the transplantation of the small intestinal microbiota of the rebamipide-treated mice ameliorated indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage and the omeprazole-induced exacerbation of the damage. These results suggest that rebamipide exerts a protective effect against NSAID-induced small intestinal damage via the modulation of the small intestinal microbiota, and that its ameliorating effect extends also to the exacerbation of NSAID-induced small intestinal damage by proton pump inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3121995718,"Computational methods have been widely used in drug design. The recent developments in machine learning techniques and the ever-growing chemical and biological databases are fertile ground for discoveries in this area. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning models in comparison to Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression for predicting the biological activity (pIC 50 ) of ALK-5 inhibitors as candidates to treat cancer. The generalization power of the models was assessed by internal and external validation procedures. A deep neural network model obtained the best performance in this comparative study, achieving a coefficient of determination of 0.658 on the external validation set with mean square error and mean absolute error of 0.373 and 0.450, respectively. Additionally, the relevance of the chemical descriptors for the prediction of biological activity was estimated using Permutation Importance. We can conclude that the forecast model obtained by the deep neural network is suitable for the problem and can be employed to predict the biological activity of new ALK-5 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3122399256,"Introduction Myocardial hemorrhage (IMH) and persistent microvascular obstruction (MVO) are associated with impaired myocardial recovery and adverse clinical outcomes in STEMI patients. However, their relationship with circulating inflammatory biomarkers is unclear in human patients. Methods and results Twenty consecutive patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention of first STEMI were included in a prospective study. Blood sampling was performed at admission, 4, 12, 24, 48 hours, 7 and 30 days after reperfusion for inflammatory biomarker (C reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and neutrophils count) assessment. At seven days, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed for infarct size, MVO and IMH assessment. Median infarct size was 24.6% Interquartile range (IQR) [12.0–43.5] of LV mass and edema was 13.2% IQR [7.7–36.1] of LV mass. IL-6 reached a peak at H24 (5.6 pg/mL interquartile range (IQR) [2.5–17.5]), CRP at H48 (11.7 mg/L IQR [7.1–69.2]), fibrinogen one week after admission (4.4 g/L IQR [3.8–6.7]) and neutrophils at H12 (9.0 G/L IQR [6.5–12.7]). MVO was present in 11 patients (55% of the study population) and hemorrhage in 7 patients (35%). Patients with IMH had significantly higher IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, and neutrophils levels compared to patients without IMH. Patients with persistent MVO had significantly higher CRP, fibrinogen and neutrophils level compared to patients without MVO, but identical IL-6 kinetics. Conclusion In human patients with acute myocardial infarction, intramyocardial hemorrhage appears to have a stronger relationship with inflammatory biomarker release compared to persistent MVO. Attenuating myocardial hemorrhage may be a novel target in future adjunctive STEMI treatments."

Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional, hospital-based study was conducted from December 2017 to March 2020. A total of 320 patients newly diagnosed with solid malignancy were examined to assess anemia prevalence. Results Of 320 patients with solid cancers, 245 (76.6%) were female and 75 (23.4%) were male. The median (interquartile range) age of 57 (45 ─ 66) years, range between 16 and 108 years. The types of cancer included were breast (29.1%), female genital tract (20.0%), colorectal (25.3%), head and neck (10.3%), urinary bladder (4.7%), prostate (5.0%), lung (2.5%), liver (2.2%) and lymphoma (0.9%). The prevalence of anemia at diagnosis of cancer was 44.1% across all cancer types. A higher anemia prevalence was noted in colorectal (n = 46/81, 56.8%) ( p = 0.047). Conclusion Patients with colorectal or female genital tract cancers had a higher anemia prevalence (56.8% and 43.8%, respectively) than did patients with other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3123061409,"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) impacts sexual and reproductive health (SRH), which is a prominent component of a patient´s quality of life and highly influenced by the cultural background. The aim of the study was to explore the interest of Mexican outpatients with RA in SRH and to examine patient view on SRH. Methods This cross-sectional study surveyed 303 consecutive outpatients with RA on their perceptions of SRH importance, SRH satisfaction, access to SRH information, preferences regarding SRH communication with healthcare professionals, and understanding of SRH (qualitative open-ended descriptions). Descriptive statistics and inferential analysis were used. Patient knowledge of each dimension of SRH was rated based on pre-specified criteria. Two assessors assigned ten major themes to each patient´s description of both dimensions of SRH. Results Patients perceived their SRH as an important component of their general health and wished to address the topic, although few had access to such communication. Female patients assigned lesser importance to SRH, showed lesser degree of satisfaction with SRH, and expressed preference for a truthful physician. Age showed a linear association with individual survey responses, except for satisfaction with reproductive health dimension. There was a linear association between increased age and decreased years of formal education with a lower level of SRH knowledge. Ten major themes emerged for each of the two dimensions of the SRH construct, although most individual descriptions were assigned to one or two major themes. Conclusions Further education and assessment of SRH in Mexican patients with RA is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3122284351,"Diarrhoeal diseases remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in poor urban communities in the Global South. Studies on food access and safety have however not considered the sources of discrete food categories and their propensity to harbour and transmit diarrhoeal disease pathogens in poor urban settings. We sought to contribute to knowledge on urban food environment and enteric infections by interrogating the sources and categories of common foods and their tendency to transmit diarrhoea in low-income communities in Accra. We modelled the likelihood of diarrhoea transmission through specific food categories sourced from home or out of home after controlling for alternate transmission pathways and barriers. We used structured interviews where households that participated in the study were selected through a multi-stage systematic sampling approach. We utilized data on 506 households from 3 low-income settlements in Accra. These settlements have socio-economic characteristics mimicking typical low-income communities in the Global South. The results showed that the incidence of diarrhoea in a household is explained by type and source of food, source of drinking water, wealth and the presence of children below five years in the household. Rice-based staples which were consumed by 94.5% of respondents in the week preceding the survey had a higher likelihood of transmitting diarrhoeal diseases when consumed out of home than when eaten at home. Sources of hand-served dumpling-type foods categorized as “staple balls” had a nuanced relationship with incidence of diarrhoea. These findings reinforce the need for due diligence in addressing peculiar needs of people in vulnerable conditions of food environment in poor urban settlements in order to reap a co-benefit of reduced incidence of diarrhoea while striving to achieve the global development goal on ending hunger."
https://openalex.org/W3122378051,"The association between maternal diet during pregnancy and allergy in offspring remains contentious. Here, we examined the association between maternal intake of vegetables and related nutrients during pregnancy and allergic diseases in offspring at one year of age. A cohort of 80,270 pregnant women enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study were asked to respond to a food frequency questionnaire during pregnancy and the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire at one year postpartum. The women were categorized into quintiles according to the energy-adjusted maternal intake of vegetables and related nutrients. Using the categorizations as exposure variables, the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for the allergic outcomes, including asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and food allergy, in the offspring per quintile at one year of age. Of the 80,270 participants, 2,027 (2.5%), 15,617 (19.6%), 3,477 (4.3%), 14,929 (18.7%), 13,801 (17.2%), and 25,028 (31.3%) children experienced asthma, wheeze, atopic dermatitis, eczema, food allergy, and some form of allergic disease, respectively. The aORs of each quintile of maternal vegetable intake for all allergic outcomes were close to 1.0 compared to the lowest quintile. The lowest aOR was found in the association of maternal cruciferous vegetable intake with asthma (aOR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96) and highest was found in the association of maternal total vegetable intake with atopic dermatitis (aOR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04–1.31). The risk of allergic outcomes for the various nutrients related to vegetable consumption was close to 1.0. The maternal intake of vegetables and various related nutrients during pregnancy had little or no association with any of the allergic outcomes, including asthma, wheezing, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and food allergy, in offspring at one year."
https://openalex.org/W3125432311,"Purpose To adapt and validate a previously developed decision tree for youth to identify bedrest for use in preschool children. Methods Parents of healthy preschool (3-6-year-old) children (n = 610; 294 males) were asked to help them to wear an accelerometer for 7 to 10 days and 24 hours/day on their waist. Children with ≥3 nights of valid recordings were randomly allocated to the development (n = 200) and validation (n = 200) groups. Wear periods from accelerometer recordings were identified minute-by-minute as bedrest or wake using visual identification by two independent raters. To automate visual identification, chosen decision tree (DT) parameters ( block length , threshold , bedrest-start trigger , and bedrest-end trigger ) were optimized in the development group using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method, which maximized the accuracy of DT-identified bedrest in 1-min epochs against synchronized visually identified bedrest (n = 4,730,734). DT's performance with optimized parameters was compared with the visual identification, commonly used Sadeh’s sleep detection algorithm, DT for youth (10-18-years-old), and parental survey of sleep duration in the validation group. Results On average, children wore an accelerometer for 8.3 days and 20.8 hours/day. Comparing the DT-identified bedrest with visual identification in the validation group yielded sensitivity = 0.941, specificity = 0.974, and accuracy = 0.956. The optimal block length was 36 min, the threshold 230 counts/min, the bedrest-start trigger 305 counts/min, and the bedrest-end trigger 1,129 counts/min. In the validation group, DT identified bedrest with greater accuracy than Sadeh’s algorithm (0.956 and 0.902) and DT for youth (0.956 and 0.861) (both P&lt;0.001). Both DT (564±77 min/day) and Sadeh’s algorithm (604±80 min/day) identified significantly less bedrest/sleep than parental survey (650±81 min/day) (both P&lt;0.001). Conclusions The DT-based algorithm initially developed for youth was adapted for preschool children to identify time spent in bedrest with high accuracy. The DT is available as a package for the R open-source software environment (“PhysActBedRest”)."

https://openalex.org/W3123074961,"We tested the effect of an annual caries preventive intervention, delivered by a fly-in/fly-out oral health professional team, with Indigenous children residing in a remote Australian community. Around 600 Indigenous children aged 5 to 17 years were invited to participate at baseline, of who 408 had caregiver consent. One hundred and ninety-six consented to the epidemiological examination and intervention (Intervention group) and 212 consented to the epidemiological examination only (Comparison group). The intervention, which occurred annually, comprised placement of fissure sealants on suitable teeth, and application of povidone-iodine and fluoride varnish to the whole dentition, following completion of any necessary restorative dental treatment. Standard diet and oral hygiene advice were provided. Caries increment (number of tooth surfaces with new dental caries) in both deciduous and permanent dentitions was measured at the 2-year follow-up. Comparison group children had significantly higher number of new surfaces with advanced caries in the permanent dentition than the Intervention group (IRR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.02–2.54; p = 0.04); with a preventive fraction of 43%. The effect of intervention remained significant with children in the Comparison group developing significantly more advanced caries lesions in the permanent dentition than the Intervention group children in the adjusted multivariable analysis (IRR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.03–4.71). Indigenous children exposed to the intervention had less increment in advanced dental caries in the permanent dentition than those not exposed to the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3123898589,"Background COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Point of Care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. They need to be easily usable by the general population in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO ® POC test and the results were recently published. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by the general public in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use. Methods 143 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plant workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use, with or without a tutorial video, were made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users’ ability to read the results. Results 88.4% of the test users judged the instructions for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3% of the users obtained a valid result and, according to the supervisors, 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the users. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback on the COVID PRESTO ® as a potential self-test. Neither age nor education had an influence. Conclusion COVID-PRESTO ® was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its use was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This POC test can become an easy-to-use tool to help detect whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the context of a second wave or a mass vaccination program."
https://openalex.org/W3125370025,"Risk-cost-benefit analysis requires the enumeration of decision alternatives, their associated outcomes, and the quantification of uncertainty. Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in one’s seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factors—such as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendees—makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3121652112,"We have been developing a method of plasma gene transfection that uses microdischarge plasma (MDP) and is highly efficient, minimally invasive, and safe. Using this technique, electrical factors (such as the electrical current and electric field created through processing discharge plasma) and the chemical factors of active species and other substances focusing on radicals are supplied to the cells and then collectively work to introduce nucleic acids in the cell. In this paper, we focus on the electrical factors to identify whether the electric field or electrical current is the major factor acting on the cells. More specifically, we built a spatial distribution model that uses an electrical network to represent the buffer solution and cells separately, as a substitute for the previously reported uniform medium model (based on the finite element method), calculated the voltage and electrical current acting on cells, and examined their intensity. Although equivalent circuit models of single cells are widely used, this study was a novel attempt to build a model wherein adherent cells distributed in two dimensions were represented as a group of equivalent cell circuits and analyzed as an electrical network that included a buffer solution and a 96-well plate. Using this model, we could demonstrate the feasibility of applying equivalent circuit network analysis to calculate electrical factors using fewer components than those required for the finite element method, with regard to electrical processing systems targeting organisms. The results obtained through this equivalent circuit network analysis revealed for the first time that the distribution of voltage and current applied to a cellular membrane matched the spatial distribution of experimentally determined gene transfection efficiency and that the electrical current is the major factor contributing to introduction."

These funds are designed to increase access to medications for addiction treatment, reduce unmet treatment need, reduce overdose death rates, and provide and sustain effective prevention, treatment and recovery activities. It is unclear whether or not the services developed using these funds will be sustained beyond the start-up period. Based on 34 (64%) State Opioid Response (SOR) applications, we assessed the states’ sustainability plans focusing on potential funding sources, policies, and quality monitoring. We found variable commitment to sustainability across response plans with less than half the states adequately describing sustainability plans. States with higher proportions of opioid prescribing, opioid misuse, and poverty had somewhat higher scores on sustainment. A text mining/machine learning approach automatically rated sustainability in SOR applications with an 82% accuracy compared to human ratings. Because life saving evidence-based programs and services may be lost, intentional commitment to sustainment beyond the bolus of start-up funding is essential."
https://openalex.org/W3124892620,"The uptake of technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and more recently digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) enable the characterization of 3-dimensional (3D) forest structure. These forest structural attributes are widely applied in the development of modern enhanced forest inventories. As an alternative to extensive ALS or DAP based forest inventories, regional forest attribute maps can be built from relationships between ALS or DAP and wall-to-wall satellite data products. To date, a number of different approaches exist, with varying code implementations using different programming environments and tailored to specific needs. With the motivation for open, simple and modern software, we present FOSTER (Forest Structure Extrapolation in R), a versatile and computationally efficient framework for modeling and imputation of 3D forest attributes. FOSTER derives spectral trends in remote sensing time series, implements a structurally guided sampling approach to sample these often spatially auto correlated datasets, to then allow a modelling approach (currently k-NN imputation) to extrapolate these 3D forest structure measures. The k-NN imputation approach that FOSTER implements has a number of benefits over conventional regression based approaches including lower bias and reduced over fitting. This paper provides an overview of the general framework followed by a demonstration of the performance and outputs of FOSTER . Two ALS-derived variables, the 95 th percentile of first returns height ( elev_p95 ) and canopy cover above mean height ( cover ), were imputed over a research forest in British Columbia, Canada with relative RMSE of 18.5% and 11.4% and relative bias of -0.6% and 1.4% respectively. The processing sequence developed within FOSTER represents an innovative and versatile framework that should be useful to researchers and managers alike looking to make forest management decisions over entire forest estates."
https://openalex.org/W3125370194,"Background People with cancer often have unidentified symptoms and social care needs. The Needs Assessment Tool-Cancer (NAT-C) is a validated, structured method of assessing patient/carer concerns and prompting action, to address unmet need. Aims Assess feasibility and acceptability of a definitive two-armed cluster randomised trial of NAT-C in primary care by evaluating: recruitment of GP practices, patients and carers; most effective approach of ensuring NAT-C appointments, acceptability of study measures and follow-up. Methods Non-blinded, feasibility study in four General Practices, with cluster randomisation to method of NAT-C appointment delivery, and process evaluation. Adults with active cancer were invited to participate with or without carer. Practices cluster randomised (1:1) to Arm I: promotion and use of NAT-C with a NAT-C trained clinician or Arm II: clinician of choice irrespective of training status. Participants completed study questionnaires at: baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients booked a 20 minute needs-assessment appointment post-baseline. Patients, carers and GP practice staff views regarding the study sought through interviews/focus groups. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, informed by Normalisation Process Theory. Progression to a definitive trial was assessed against feasibility outcomes, relating to: recruitment rate, uptake and delivery of the NAT-C, data collection and quality. Results Five GP practices approached, four recruited and trained to use the NAT-C. Forty-seven participants and 17 carers recruited. At baseline, 34/47 (72%) participants reported at least one moderate-severe unmet need, confirming study rationale. 32/47 (68%) participants received a NAT-C-guided consultation, 19 of which on Arm I. Study attrition at one month (n = 44 (94%), n = 16 (94%)), three months (n = 38 (81%), n = 14 (82%)) and six months (n = 32 (68%), n = 10 (59%)). Fifteen patient interviews conducted across the whole study and one focus group at each GP practice. Participants supported a definitive study and found measures acceptable. Conclusion The feasibility trial indicated that recruitment rate, intervention uptake and data collection were appropriate, with refinements, for a definitive multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial. Feasibility outcomes informed the design of a 2-armed cluster randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the NAT-C compared with usual care."
https://openalex.org/W3121155324,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with insulin resistance (IR). Due to an excess in storage of white adipose tissue, IR has an inflammatory process that overlaps with RA. This is performed by the activation/migration of monocytes carried out by the CCR2/CCL2 and CMKLR1/RvE1 chemokines systems. Furthermore, these can potentiate chronic inflammation which is the central axis in the immunopathogenesis of RA. We evaluated the association between the relative expression of CCR2 and CMKLR1 and the serum levels of their ligands CCL2 and RvE1, in the context of adiposity status with IR as a comorbidity in RA. We studied 138 controls and 138 RA-patients classified with and without IR. We evaluated adiposity, RA activity, IR status and immunometabolic profiles by routine methods. Insulin, CCL2 and RvE1 serum levels were determined by ELISA. Relative expression of CCR2 , CMKLR1 and RPS28 as constitutive gene by SYBR green RT-qPCR and 2 -ΔΔC T method. Increased measurements were observed of body adiposity and metabolic status as follows: RA with IR&gt;control group with IR&gt;RA without IR&gt; control group without IR. CCR2 and CMKLR1 relative expression was increased in RA without IR versus control without IR. CCR2 : 2.3- and 1.3-fold increase and CMKLR1 : 3.5- and 2.7-fold increase, respectively. Whereas, CCR2 expression correlates with CMKLR1 expression ( rho = 0.331) and IR status ( rho = 0.497 to 0.548). CMKLR1 expression correlates with inflammation markers ( rho = 0.224 to 0.418). CCL2 levels were increased in the RA groups but levels of RvE1 were increased in RA without IR. We conclude that in RA with IR, the chemokine receptors expression pattern showed a parallel increase with their respective ligands. RA and IR in conjunction with the pathological distribution of body fat mass might exacerbate chronic inflammation. These results suggest that high CCL2 levels and compensatory RvE1 levels might not be enough to resolve the inflammation by themselves."
https://openalex.org/W3121688648,"Background Bronchoscopy using radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is performed when a peripheral lung lesion (PLL) is suspected to be malignant. However, pulmonary tuberculosis is diagnosed in some patients, and healthcare workers could therefore be exposed to tuberculosis if sufficient precautions are not taken. In this study, we examined the proportion of and factors associated with unexpected exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS. Methods This retrospective study included 970 patients who received bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS between December 2015 and November 2018. Clinical, histological, radiological, and microbiological data were reviewed. Results Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 31 patients (3.2%) during bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS. Patients with a lower age were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with tuberculosis than elderly patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.951; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.924–0.978; P = 0.001). Among the various CT findings, a low HUs difference between pre- and post-enhanced CT (OR, 0.976; 95% CI, 0.955–0.996; P = 0.022), the presence of concentric cavitation (OR, 5.211; 95% CI, 1.447–18.759; P = 0.012), and the presence of satellite centrilobular nodules (OR, 22.925; 95% CI, 10.556–49.785; P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with diagnosis of tuberculosis. Conclusions The proportion of unexpected exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS was 3.2%. A higher risk was independently associated with a younger age and CT findings of a small difference in HUs between pre- and post-enhancement images, concentric cavitation, and the presence of a satellite centrilobular nodule."

In light of this, we sought to determine the seroprevalence of T . gondii infection in alcohol consumers in Durango, Mexico, and the association of T . gondii seroprevalence with characteristics of the population studied. Anti- T . gondii IgG and IgM antibodies were searched in sera of participants using commercially available enzyme immunoassays. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were then used to determine the association between T . gondii infection and the characteristics of the population studied. Of the 1544 people studied (mean age: 39.4±14.0 years), 173 (11.2%) tested positive for anti- T . gondii IgG antibodies. We were able to test 167 of the 173 anti- T . gondii IgG positive sera for anti- T . gondii IgM antibodies. Fifty-five (32.9%) of these 167 serum samples were positive for anti- T . gondii IgM antibodies. Bivariate analysis showed that visual impairment, history of surgery, and hepatitis were negatively associated with T . gondii IgG seropositivity ( P &lt;0.05). In women, seropositivity to T . gondii was positively associated with a history of pregnancy ( P &lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that T . gondii seropositivity was associated with the variables consumption of armadillo meat (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.04–5.22; P = 0.03), and the use of latrines for elimination of excretes (OR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.07–4.80; P = 0.03); and high (&gt;150 IU/ml) anti- T . gondii IgG antibodies were associated with consumption of both armadillo meat (OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.01–5.02; P = 0.04) and crowding at home (OR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.02–2.61; P = 0.03). We found a distinct T . gondii seroprevalence in people with alcohol consumption from those previously found in population groups in the region. This is the first study that illustrates the association between high anti- T . gondii antibodies and crowding in Mexico, and the second study on the association between T . gondii infection and consumption of armadillo meat and the use of latrines in this country. We conclude that epidemiology of T . gondii infection in people with alcohol consumption deserves further investigation."

Methods Three hundred and ten healthy blood donors (controls), 98 CAD, 74 UBCa and 38 LCa patients were included in this pilot study. The influence of 92 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and impact of cigarette smoking were analysed. Results Out of 92 SNPs tested, differences in distribution of 14 SNPs were detected between controls and patient groups. Only CTLA4 rs3087243 showed difference in both CAD and UBCa patient group compared to control group. Stratified by smoking status, the impact of smoking was associated to frequencies of 8, 3 and 4 SNPs in CAD, UBCa, LCa patients, respectively. None of these 92 SNPs showed a statistically significant difference to more than one type of disease among smoking patients. In non-smoking patients, 7, 3 and 6 SNPs were associated to CAD, UBCa, LCa, respectively. Out of these 92 SNPs, CTLA4 rs3087243 was associated to both non-smoking CAD and UBCa. The XRCC1 r s25487 was associated to both non-smoking UBCa and LCa. Conclusion SNPs might be important risk factors for CAD, UBCa and LCa. Distribution of the SNPs was specific for each patient group, not a random event. Impact of cigarette smoking on the disease was associated to the specific SNP sequences. Thus, smoking individuals with SNPs associated to risk of these serious diseases is an important target group for smoking cessation programs."
https://openalex.org/W3123190622,"It was shown earlier that dogs, when selecting between two dishes with snacks placed in front of them, left and right, prefer to turn either clockwise or counterclockwise or randomly in either direction. This preference (or non-preference) is individually consistent in all trials but it is biased in favor of north if they choose between dishes positioned north and east or north and west, a phenomenon denoted as “pull of the north”. Here, we replicated these experiments indoors, in magnetic coils, under natural magnetic field and under magnetic field shifted 90° clockwise. We demonstrate that ""pull of the north"" was present also in an environment without any outdoor cues and that the magnetic (and not topographic) north exerted the effect. The detailed analysis shows that the phenomenon involves also ""repulsion of the south"". The clockwise turning preference in the right-preferring dogs is more pronounced in the S-W combination, while the counterclockwise turning preference in the left-preferring dogs is pronounced in the S-E combination. In this way, south-placed dishes are less frequently chosen than would be expected, while the north-placed dishes are apparently more preferred. Turning preference did not correlate with the motoric paw laterality (Kong test). Given that the choice of a dish is visually guided, we postulate that the turning preference was determined by the dominant eye, so that a dominant right eye resulted in clockwise, and a dominant left eye in counterclockwise turning. Assuming further that magnetoreception in canines is based on the radical-pair mechanism, a ""conflict of interests"" may be expected, if the dominant eye guides turning away from north, yet the contralateral eye ""sees the north"", which generally acts attractive, provoking body alignment along the north-south axis."
https://openalex.org/W3123732832,"Aging is a multifactorial process that involves numerous genetic changes, so identifying anti-aging agents is quite challenging. Age-associated genetic factors must be better understood to search appropriately for anti-aging agents. We utilized an aging-related gene expression pattern-trained machine learning system that can implement reversible changes in aging by linking combinatory drugs. In silico gene expression pattern-based drug repositioning strategies, such as connectivity map, have been developed as a method for unique drug discovery. However, these strategies have limitations such as lists that differ for input and drug-inducing genes or constraints to compare experimental cell lines to target diseases. To address this issue and improve the prediction success rate, we modified the original version of expression profiles with a stepwise-filtered method. We utilized a machine learning system called deep-neural network (DNN). Here we report that combinational drug pairs using differential expressed genes (DEG) had a more enhanced anti-aging effect compared with single independent treatments on leukemia cells. This study shows potential drug combinations to retard the effects of aging with higher efficacy using innovative machine learning techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3123771721,"The yeast Spf1p protein is a primary transporter that belongs to group 5 of the large family of P-ATPases. Loss of Spf1p function produces ER stress with alterations of metal ion and sterol homeostasis and protein folding, glycosylation and membrane insertion. The amino acid sequence of Spf1p shows the characteristic P-ATPase domains A, N, and P and the transmembrane segments M1-M10. In addition, Spf1p exhibits unique structures at its N-terminus (N-T region), including two putative additional transmembrane domains, and a large insertion connecting the P domain with transmembrane segment M5 (D region). Here we used limited proteolysis to examine the structure of Spf1p. A short exposure of Spf1p to trypsin or proteinase K resulted in the cleavage at the N and C terminal regions of the protein and abrogated the formation of the catalytic phosphoenzyme and the ATPase activity. In contrast, limited proteolysis of Spf1p with chymotrypsin generated a large N-terminal fragment containing most of the M4-M5 cytosolic loop, and a minor fragment containing the C-terminal region. If lipids were present during chymotryptic proteolysis, phosphoenzyme formation and ATPase activity were preserved. ATP slowed Spf1p proteolysis without detectable changes of the generated fragments. The analysis of the proteolytic peptides by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation indicated that the preferential chymotryptic site was localized near the cytosolic end of M5. The susceptibility to proteolysis suggests an unexpected exposure of this region of Spf1p that may be an intrinsic feature of P5A-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W3124049496,"Butanolides have shown a variety of biological effects including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal effects against certain strains of Trypanosoma cruzi . Considering the lack of an effective drug to treat T . cruzi infections and the prominent results obtained in literature with this class of lactones, we investigated the anti- T . cruzi activity of five butanolides isolated from two species of Lauraceae, Aiouea trinervis and Mezilaurus crassiramea . Initially, the activity of these compounds was evaluated on epimastigote forms of the parasite, after a treatment period of 4 h, followed by testing on amastigotes, trypomastigotes, and mammalian cells. Next, the synergistic effect of active butanolides against amastigotes was evaluated. Further, metacyclogenesis inhibition and infectivity assays were performed for the most active compound, followed by ultrastructural analysis of the treated amastigotes and trypomastigotes. Among the five butanolides studied, majoranolide and isoobtusilactone A were active against all forms of the parasite, with good selectivity indexes in Vero cells. Both butanolides were more active than the control drug against trypomastigote and epimastigote forms and also had a synergic effect on amastigotes. The most active compound, isoobtusilactone A, which showed activity against all tested strains inhibited metacyclogenesis and infection of new host cells. In addition, ultrastructural analysis revealed that this butanolide caused extensive damage to the mitochondria of both amastigotes and trypomastigotes, resulting in severe morphological changes in the infective forms of the parasite. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of butanolides against the etiologic agent of Chagas disease and the relevance of isoobtusilactone A as a strong anti- T . cruzi drug, affecting different events of the life cycle and all evolutionary forms of parasite after a short period of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3124109877,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the major causes of chronic pain in dogs. However, the pathogenesis of OA has not been fully understood in dogs. The objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators, nerve growth factor and its receptor, and matrix metalloproteinases in the synovium of dogs with spontaneous OA as well as to elucidate their relationships with the severity of synovitis. Dogs that were diagnosed with stifle OA on the basis of radiographic findings were included, and the degree of synovitis was observed using stifle arthroscopy. The dogs were assigned to two different groups depending on their synovitis scores: the low-grade group (score of 1 or 2; n = 8) and high-grade group (score of 3 to 5; n = 18). The dogs showing no evidence of orthopedic disease were included in the control group (n = 6). Synovial tissue samples were collected from the sites at which synovitis scores were assessed using arthroscopy. Total RNA was extracted from the collected synovial tissue, and cDNA was synthesized. Subsequently, RT-qPCR were performed using canine-specific primer sets for IL1B , IL6 , CXCL8 , TNF , TGFB1 , PTGS2 , PTGES , MMP3 , MMP13 , NGF , NTRK1 , and PTGER4 . Expression levels of IL1B , IL6 , CXCL8 , and MMP13 were significantly higher in the high-grade group than in the control group. In addition, expression levels of IL1B , CXCL8 , TNF , and PTGS2 were significantly higher in the high-grade group than in the low-grade group. Expression levels of IL1B , IL6 , CXCL8 , TNF , PTGS2 , and PTGER4 showed significant positive correlation with synovitis score. In conclusion, all mRNA expression levels in the synovial membrane varied according to the degree of synovitis in dogs with spontaneous OA. Thus, this study may partially elucidate the pathogenesis of synovitis in dogs with spontaneous OA."
https://openalex.org/W3046628402,"Neurophysiological experiments have shown that a shared region of the primate visual system registers both radial and rotational motion. Radial and rotational motion also share computational features. Despite these neural and computational similarities, prior experiments have disrupted radial, but not rotational, motion sensitivity -a single dissociation. Here we report stimulus manipulations that extend the single dissociation to a double dissociation, thereby showing further separability between radial and rotational motion sensitivity. In Exp 1 bilateral plaid stimuli with or without phase-noise either radiated or rotated before changing direction. College students reported whether the direction changed first on the left or right–a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Phase noise generated significantly larger disruptions to rotational TOJs than to radial TOJs, thereby completing the double dissociation. In Exp 2 we conceptually replicated this double dissociation by switching the task from TOJs to simultaneity judgments (SJs). Phase noise generated significantly larger disruptions to rotational SJs than to radial SJs. This disruption pattern reversed after changing the plaids’ motion from same- to opposite-initial directions. The double dissociations reported here revealed distinct dependencies for radial and rotational motion sensitivity. Radial motion sensitivity depended strongly on information about global depth. Rotational motion sensitivity depended strongly on positional information about local luminance gradients. These distinct dependencies arose downstream from the neural mechanisms that detect local linear components within radial and rotational motion. Overall, the differential impairments generated by our psychophysical experiments demonstrate independence between radial and rotational motion sensitivity, despite their neural and computational similarities."
https://openalex.org/W3121356040,"It is necessary to consider how a glove box’s confinement function will be lost when evaluating the amount of radioactive material leaking from a nuclear facility during a fire. In this study, we build a model that consistently explains the weight loss of glove box materials because of heat input from a flame and accompanying generation of the pyrolysis gas. The weight loss suggests thinning of the glove box housing, and the generation of pyrolysis gas suggests the possibility of fire spreading. The target was polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), used as the glove box panel. Thermal gravimetric tests on PMMA determined the parameters to be substituted in the Arrhenius equation for predicting the weight loss in pyrolysis. The pyrolysis process of PMMA was divided into 3 stages with activation energies of 62 kJ/mol, 250 kJ/mol, and 265 kJ/mol. Furthermore, quantifying the gas composition revealed that the composition of the pyrolysis gas released from PMMA can be approximated as 100% methyl methacrylate. This result suggests that the released amount of methyl methacrylate can be estimated by the Arrhenius equation. To investigate the validity of such estimation, a sealed vessel test was performed. In this test, we observed increase of the number of gas molecules during the pyrolysis as internal pressure change of the vessel. The number of gas molecules was similar to that estimated from the Arrhenius equation, and indicated the validity of our method. Moreover, we also performed the same tests on bisphenol-A-polycarbonate (PC) for comparison. In case of PC, the number of gas molecules obtained in the vessel test was higher than the estimated value."
https://openalex.org/W3123984844,"Many animal and plant pathogenic bacteria employ a type three secretion system (T3SS) to deliver type three effector proteins (T3Es) into host cells. Efficient secretion of many T3Es in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris ( Xcc ) relies on the global chaperone HpaB. However, how the domain of HpaB itself affects effector translocation/secretion is poorly understood. Here, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify a novel domain at the C-terminal end of HpaB (amino acid residues 137–160) that contributes to virulence and hypersensitive response (HR). Both in vitro secretion assay and in planta translocation assay showed that the secretion and translocation of T3E proteins depend on the C-terminal region of HpaB. Deletion of the C-terminal region of HpaB did not affect binding to T3Es, self-association or interaction with T3SS components. However, the deletion of C-terminal region sharply reduced the mounts of free T3Es liberated from the complex of HpaB with the T3Es, a reaction catalyzed in an ATP-dependent manner by the T3SS-associated ATPase HrcN. Our findings demonstrate the C-terminal domain of HpaB contributes to disassembly of chaperone-effector complex and reveal a potential molecular mechanism underpinning the involvement of HpaB in secretion of T3Es in Xcc ."
https://openalex.org/W3125131235,"Background Cognitive enhancers (CE) are prescription drugs taken, either without a prescription or at a dose exceeding that which is prescribed, to improve cognitive functions such as concentration, vigilance or memory. Previous research suggests that users believe the drugs to be safer than non-users and that they have sufficient knowledge to judge safety. However, to date no research has compared the information sources used and safety knowledge of users and non-users. Objectives This study compared users and non-users of CE in terms of i) their sources of knowledge about the safety of CE and ii) the accuracy of their knowledge of possible adverse effects of a typical cognitive enhancer (modafinil); and iii) how the accuracy of knowledge relates to their safety beliefs. Methods Students (N = 148) from King’s College London (UK) completed an anonymous online survey assessing safety beliefs, sources of knowledge and knowledge of the safety of modafinil; and indicated whether they used CE, and, if so, which drug(s). Results The belief that the drugs are safe was greater in users than non-users. However, both groups used comparable information sources and have similar, relatively poor drug safety knowledge. Furthermore, despite users more strongly believing in the safety of CE there was no relationship between their beliefs and knowledge, in contrast to non-users who did show correlations between beliefs and knowledge. Conclusion These data suggest that the differences in safety beliefs about CE between users and non-users do not stem from use of different information sources or more accurate safety knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3125137490,"Under the conventional view, securities law is intended to protect ordinary (retail) investors. However, some scholars from the school of Law &amp; Economics (L&amp;E), guided by considerations of economic efficiency, claim instead that the principal function of securities law is to reduce transaction costs and risk to professionals. This paper examines those claims empirically. Our research design blends content analysis methods with expert survey techniques to arrive at numerical assessments of determinants of Polish securities law. We find that the L&amp;E view is supported by our data very weakly, only insofar as consumer protection is not the main driver of securities law. The veracity of this claim appears to be time-dependent. We do not find sufficient support for the main components of the L&amp;E view, i.e., that securities law is meant to reduce transaction costs and risk to professionals. However, our data does not refute the L&amp;E hypotheses, and, therefore, we consider them to be an open question. We phrase our conclusions cautiously because of the relatively small number of experts surveyed and of statutory sources of securities law in Poland."
