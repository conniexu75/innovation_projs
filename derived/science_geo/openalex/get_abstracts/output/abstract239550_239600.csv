https://openalex.org/W4238567307,"Deregulation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and diabetes. Akt/PKB activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Ser473 within the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif by an unknown kinase. We show that in Drosophila and human cells the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase and its associated protein rictor are necessary for Ser473 phosphorylation and that a reduction in rictor or mammalian TOR (mTOR) expression inhibited an Akt/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on Ser473 in vitro and facilitated Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1. Rictor-mTOR may serve as a drug target in tumors that have lost the expression of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that opposes Akt/PKB activation."

They have no motors or controllers, yet can have remarkably humanlike motions. This suggests that these machines are useful models of human locomotion; however, they cannot walk on level ground. Here we present three robots based on passive-dynamics, with small active power sources substituted for gravity, which can walk on level ground. These robots use less control and less energy than other powered robots, yet walk more naturally, further suggesting the importance of passive-dynamics in human locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2145371252,"Individual differences in DNA sequence are the genetic basis of human variability. We have characterized whole-genome patterns of common human DNA variation by genotyping 1,586,383 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 71 Americans of European, African, and Asian ancestry. Our results indicate that these SNPs capture most common genetic variation as a result of linkage disequilibrium, the correlation among common SNP alleles. We observe a strong correlation between extended regions of linkage disequilibrium and functional genomic elements. Our data provide a tool for exploring many questions that remain regarding the causal role of common human DNA variation in complex human traits and for investigating the nature of genetic variation within and between human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2103744312,"The OMEGA/Mars Express hyperspectral imager identified hydrated sulfates on light-toned layered terrains on Mars. Outcrops in Valles Marineris, Margaritifer Sinus, and Terra Meridiani show evidence for kieserite, gypsum, and polyhydrated sulfates. This identification has its basis in vibrational absorptions between 1.3 and 2.5 micrometers. These minerals constitute direct records of the past aqueous activity on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2005391856,"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the related medial wall play a critical role in recruiting cognitive control. Although ACC exhibits selective error and conflict responses, it has been unclear how these develop and become context-specific. With use of a modified stop-signal task, we show from integrated computational neural modeling and neuroimaging studies that ACC learns to predict error likelihood in a given context, even for trials in which there is no error or response conflict. These results support a more general error-likelihood theory of ACC function based on reinforcement learning, of which conflict and error detection are special cases."

The data acquired during the first 9 months of the mission already reveal a diverse and complex surface mineralogy, offering key insights into the evolution of Mars. OMEGA has identified and mapped mafic iron-bearing silicates of both the northern and southern crust, localized concentrations of hydrated phyllosilicates and sulfates but no carbonates, and ices and frosts with a water-ice composition of the north polar perennial cap, as for the south cap, covered by a thin carbon dioxide–ice veneer."
https://openalex.org/W2062133747,"Apoptosis is important in controlling hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers. However, the specific BCL-2 family member(s) that regulate HSC homeostasis are not precisely defined. We tested myeloid leukemia–1 (MCL-1) as an attractive candidate that is highly expressed in HSCs and regulated by growth factor signals. Inducible deletion of Mcl-1 in mice resulted in ablation of bone marrow. This resulted in the loss of early bone marrow progenitor populations, including HSCs. Moreover, growth factors including stem cell factor increased transcription of the Mcl-1 gene and required MCL-1 to augment survival of purified bone marrow progenitors. Deletion of Mcl-1 in other tissues, including liver, did not impair survival. Thus, MCL-1 is a critical and specific regulator essential for ensuring the homeostasis of early hematopoietic progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W1966841546,"Networks adapt to environmental demands by switching between distinct dynamical behaviors. The activity of frontal-lobe neurons during two-interval discrimination tasks is an example of these adaptable dynamics. Subjects first perceive a stimulus, then hold it in working memory, and finally make a decision by comparing it with a second stimulus. We present a simple mutual-inhibition network model that captures all three task phases within a single framework. The model integrates both working memory and decision making because its dynamical properties are easily controlled without changing its connectivity. Mutual inhibition between nonlinear units is a useful design motif for networks that must display multiple behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2130723340,"The response of the ocean redox state to the rise of atmospheric oxygen about 2.3 billion years ago (Ga) is a matter of controversy. Here we provide iron isotope evidence that the change in the ocean iron cycle occurred at the same time as the change in the atmospheric redox state. Variable and negative iron isotope values in pyrites older than about 2.3 Ga suggest that an iron-rich global ocean was strongly affected by the deposition of iron oxides. Between 2.3 and 1.8 Ga, positive iron isotope values of pyrite likely reflect an increase in the precipitation of iron sulfides relative to iron oxides in a redox stratified ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2064799463,"The Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) imaging spectrometer observed the northern circumpolar regions of Mars at a resolution of a few kilometers. An extended region at 240°E, 85°N, with an area of 60 kilometers by 200 kilometers, exhibits absorptions at wavelengths of 1.45, 1.75, 1.94, 2.22, 2.26, and 2.48 micrometers. These signatures can be unambiguously attributed to calcium-rich sulfates, most likely gypsum. This region corresponds to the dark longitudinal dunes of Olympia Planitia. These observations reveal that water alteration played a major role in the formation of the constituting minerals of northern circumpolar terrains."
https://openalex.org/W2034501757,"Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) from Earth's upper atmosphere have been detected with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite. The gamma-ray spectra typically extend up to 10 to 20 megaelectron volts (MeV); a simple bremsstrahlung model suggests that most of the electrons that produce the gamma rays have energies on the order of 20 to 40 MeV. RHESSI detects 10 to 20 TGFs per month, corresponding to ∼50 per day globally, perhaps many more if they are beamed. Both the frequency of occurrence and maximum photon energy are more than an order of magnitude higher than previously known for these events."
https://openalex.org/W1641295153,"The insertion of an iridium complex into an N-H bond in ammonia leads to a stable monomeric amido hydride complex in solution at room temperature. This reaction advances the transition-metal coordination chemistry of ammonia beyond its role for more than a century as an ancillary ligand. The precursor for this insertion reaction is an iridium(I) olefin complex with an aliphatic ligand containing one carbon and two phosphorus donor atoms. Kinetic and isotopic labeling studies indicate that olefin dissociates to give a 14-electron iridium(I) fragment, which then reacts with ammonia. This cleavage of the N-H bond under neutral conditions provides a foundation on which to develop future mild catalytic transformations of ammonia, such as olefin hydroamination and arene oxidative amination."
https://openalex.org/W2111670967,"Data from the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) on the Mars Express spacecraft identify the distinct mafic, rock-forming minerals olivine, low-calcium pyroxene (LCP), and high-calcium pyroxene (HCP) on the surface of Mars. Olivine- and HCP-rich regions are found in deposits that span the age range of geologic units. However, LCP-rich regions are found only in the ancient Noachian-aged units, which suggests that melts for these deposits were derived from a mantle depleted in aluminum and calcium. Extended dark regions in the northern plains exhibit no evidence of strong mafic absorptions or absorptions due to hydrated materials."

https://openalex.org/W2028316863,"The helix is a ubiquitous motif for biopolymers. We propose a heuristic, entropically based model that predicts helix formation in a system of hard spheres and semiflexible tubes. We find that the entropy of the spheres is maximized when short stretches of the tube form a helix with a geometry close to that found in natural helices. Our model could be directly tested with wormlike micelles as the tubes, and the effect could be used to self-assemble supramolecular helices."
https://openalex.org/W2044137708,"Coiled-coil proteins of the golgin family have been implicated in intra-Golgi transport through tethering coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles. The p115-golgin tether is the best studied, and here we characterize the golgin-84–CASP tether. The vesicles bound by this tether were strikingly different from those bound by the p115-golgin tether in that they lacked members of the p24 family of putative cargo receptors and contained enzymes instead of anterograde cargo. Microinjected golgin-84 or CASP also inhibited Golgi-enzyme transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, further implicating this tether in retrograde transport. These and other golgins may modulate the flow patterns within the Golgi stack."
https://openalex.org/W2058771345,"We describe several fossils referable to Gomphos elkema from deposits close to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at Tsagan Khushu, Mongolia. Gomphos shares a suite of cranioskeletal characters with extant rabbits, hares, and pikas but retains a primitive dentition and jaw compared to its modern relatives. Phylogenetic analysis supports the position of Gomphos as a stem lagomorph and excludes Cretaceous taxa from the crown radiation of placental mammals. Our results support the hypothesis that rodents and lagomorphs radiated during the Cenozoic and diverged from other placental mammals close to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2051354952,"The Mars Express Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) hyperspectral image data covering eastern Terra Meridiani indicate the ubiquitous presence of molecular water in etched terrain materials that disconformably overlie heavily cratered terrains and underlie the hematite-bearing plains explored by the Opportunity rover. Identification of crystalline water in kieserite (MgSO 4 ·H 2 O) is linked to materials exposed in a valley and plateau to the north of hematite-bearing plains. The mineralogical similarities between the etched terrain deposits examined with OMEGA data and the layered rocks examined by Opportunity imply that the ancient aqueous environments inferred from analyses of the rover data extend over regional scales."
https://openalex.org/W2024443281,"Although metal ions such as Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ are implicated to play a key role in Alzheimer disease, their role is rather complex, and comprehensive understanding is not yet obtained. We show that Cu2+ and Zn2+ but not Fe3+ renders the amyloid β peptide, Aβ1–40, nonfibrillogenic in nature. However, preformed fibrils of Aβ1–40 were stable when treated with these metal ions. Consequently, fibril growth of Aβ1–40 could be switched on/off by switching the molecule between its apo- and holo-forms. Clioquinol, a potential drug for Alzheimer disease, induced resumption of the Cu2+-suppressed but not the Zn2+-suppressed fibril growth of Aβ1–40. The observed synergistic effect of clioquinol and Zn2+ suggests that Zn2+-clioquinol complex effectively retards fibril growth. Thus, clioquinol has dual effects; although it disaggregates the metal ion-induced aggregates of Aβ1–40 through metal chelation, it further retards the fibril growth along with Zn2+.

Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). However, its effect on the amyloid fibril formation, especially in conjunction with Cu2+ or Zn2+, has not been understood so far. Therefore, it is important to obtain comprehensive understanding of the interactions with metal ions and their impact on the aggregation and amyloid fibril formation of Aβ peptides. In the present study, we investigated the role of some metal ions on the aggregation and fibrillogenic propensities of Aβ1–40. The results show that Cu2+ and Zn2+, but not Fe3+, render Aβ1–40 less fibrillogenic or non-fibrillogenic under conditions in which no significant metal ion-induced aggregation occurs. We used this system to examine the effects of metal ion chelators, EDTA and CQ, on the fibril growth of Aβ1–40. The results revealed the dual effects of CQ, explaining the underlying mechanism of clioquinol as a potential drug for Alzheimer disease. Materials—Human Aβ1–40 was purchased from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). CuCl2 dihydrate, anhydrous ZnCl2, and anhydrous FeCl3 were purchased in their purest forms from Aldrich. CQ (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, commonly known as clioquinol) was procured from Calbiochem. “Protein assay Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution” was purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Effects of CQ and Buffer Conditions on Metal Ion-induced Aggregation of Aβ1–40—50 μm Aβ1–40 in the indicated buffers in the presence or absence of indicated substances was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The final concentrations of Cu2+ or Zn2+ in the samples were 50 μm. Stock CQ solution was prepared in methanol, and it was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Peptide concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method using the commercial protein assay Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution and was represented as a percentage of recovery relative to the control without metal ion and CQ. We did not measure the trace contamination of the metal ions in our buffer system or from the peptide preparations. Therefore, the mentioned concentrations of the metal ions represent the added concentrations of the metal ions. Unless otherwise mentioned, the final concentration of methanol in our experiment due to the addition of CQ did not exceed 2%. Atomic Force Microscopy—Samples of 50 μm Aβ1–40 in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 μm metal ions were incubated for 5 min. An aliquot of the sample was placed on a mica surface and incubated for 1 min. Excess sample was drained and washed quickly with water to remove salts. The mica surface was air-dried. Atomic force microscopy imaging was performed using a dynamic force microscope, SPI3700-SPA300, Seiko Instruments. The scanning tip was a silicon microcantilever (SI-DF20, Seiko Instruments, spring constant = 13 newton/m, resonance frequency = 135 kHz). The scan rate was 0.5 Hz. Amyloid Fibril Growth of Aβ1–40—Samples of 50 μm (∼0.22 mg/ml) Aβ1–40 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl (referred to as buffer A henceforth) in the absence and presence of required concentrations of metal ions were incubated at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml sonicated fibrils (fibril seed). Aliquots (5 μl) of the samples were withdrawn at different time points and added to 1 ml of 5 μm thioflavin T in 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.5 (ThT solution). Fluorescence intensity at 485 nm, which is proportional to the extent of fibril-bound ThT (37Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and thus the amyloid fibril growth, was measured with an excitation wavelength of 445 nm using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. To test the effect of EDTA and CQ, the required concentrations of the chelators were added at the indicated time points. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)—ThT was added to the samples in buffer A to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the sample was placed on a glass slide. The TIRFM system to observe ThT-bound amyloid fibrils was developed based on an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described earlier (38Ban T. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Circular Dichroism—Samples of 0.22 mg/ml Aβ1–40 peptide alone in buffer A and the samples of the peptide and fibril seeds (5 μg/ml) incubated in the absence or presence of required concentrations of metal ions at 37 °C for 80 min were prepared. These samples were diluted 1:1 (v/v) with buffer A, and the far UV CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter at 37 °C with thermo-stated cell holder and a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The data shown are the mean residue ellipticity. Sedimentation Velocity Measurements—Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with An-60 rotor and two-channel charcoal-filled Epon cells. Samples (0.3 ml) of 30 μm Aβ1–40 in buffer A in the absence and in the presence of 50 μm metal ions or 100 μm CQ were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at the same temperature at 224,000 × g. The protein boundary was scanned at 12-min intervals for its absorbance at 225 nm. The boundary curves at every 24-min intervals are shown. The sedimentation data were analyzed using the software Origin 4.1 (OriginLab). Effects of CQ and Buffer Conditions on Metal Ion-induced Aggregation of Aβ1–40—In HEPES buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (pH 6.6 or 7.4), both 50 μm Zn2+ and 50 μm Cu2+ largely decreased the percentage of recovery of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 1, A and B). The Cu2+-induced decrease in the percentage of recovery was more significant at pH 6.6 than at pH 7.4, indicating the pH dependence of the Cu2+ effects. Although 100 μm CQ did not itself exhibit notable effect on the aggregation of Aβ1–40, it suppressed the metal ion-induced aggregation of the peptide, increasing its recovery (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, in HEPES buffer, Cu2+ and Zn2+ induce aggregation of Aβ1–40, in agreement with the earlier studies (19Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Paradis Jr., M-d. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol.

The atomic force microscopy images (Fig. 1D) indicated that metal ion-induced aggregates are amorphous in nature, supporting earlier reports (27Yoshiike Y. Tanemura K. Murayama O. Akagi T.

Importantly, metal ion-induced aggregation of Aβ1–40 depended on buffer conditions. In buffer A, we did not observe metal ion-induced loss of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, sedimentation velocity measurements showed that the metal iontreated or untreated Aβ1–40 do not exhibit significant change in their sedimentation property (Fig. 2). The apparent sedimentation coefficients of Aβ1–40 in buffer A alone and in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ and 50 μm Cu2+ were calculated to be 0.96, 0.86, and 1.05 s, respectively. Thus, our result shows that the metal ions do not promote significant aggregation of Aβ1–40 in buffer A. One possible reason for the observation made in buffer A could be that the formation of the phosphate complexes of these metal ions prevents their interaction with the Aβ peptide. However, our following results on the effects of Cu2+ and Zn2+ on the fibril growth and β-sheet formation of the peptide indicate that the peptide interacts with these metal ions in buffer A. Moreover, Cu2+ binding to the peptide in buffer A is further supported by the fluorescence quenching studies presented later on in this study. Thus, taking together these evidences, we presume that the observed lack of metal ion-induced aggregation in buffer A is not due to the lack of metal ion binding. Rather, it represents the conditions in which the metal ion-bound peptide exhibits less or no aggregation. In this context, it is important to note that two different laboratories have earlier made contradictory observations on the susceptibility of Aβ peptide toward the Zn2+-induced aggregation (23Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 25Esler W.P.

Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) clarified that the susceptibility of the Aβ peptide to the Zn2+-induced aggregation is sensitive to “complex factors in buffer milieu that impact upon the peptide's conformation and polymerization state.” Therefore, interestingly, our observation that metal ion-induced aggregation is less pronounced in buffer A is useful to understand the relative fibrillogenic propensities of the metal-free (apo) and metal-bound (holo) Aβ1–40. Effect of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+on the Fibril Growth of Aβ1–40—The relative fibrillogenic propensities of the apoand holo-forms of Aβ peptides have not been understood so far. Since Cu2+ or Zn2+ does not induce detectable aggregation in buffer A, this system is useful to address the issue. We have investigated the effects of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ on the amyloid fibril growth of Aβ1–40 in buffer A (pH 7.4). Even at substoichiometric concentrations, Cu2+ retarded the fibril growth (Fig. 3A). At a molar ratio less than 0.4 of the metal ion to Aβ1–40, Cu2+ increased the time lag of the onset of the fibril growth (despite providing the fibril seed for nucleation). At the molar ratio more than or equal to 0.4, fibril growth was not observed significantly during the observed time period. However, the fibril growth occurred slowly to the extent of the control (without the metal ion) by 2 days of incubation at the molar ratio less than 0.6 (data not shown). At the molar ratio of 1.0, Cu2+ prevented the fibril growth completely; there was no fibril growth even after 5 days (data not shown). Zn2+ also exhibited a similar effect in preventing the amyloid fibril growth of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, Fe3+ did not prevent the fibril growth of Aβ1–40 at concentrations comparable with those of Cu2+ or Zn2+ (Fig. 3B) as well as at its molar ratio as high as 4.0 (data not shown). We examined by TIRFM the samples of ThT-bound fibril seed, the Aβ amyloid fibrils, and the samples of the Aβ peptide and the seed incubated along with Cu2+ or Fe3+ (Fig. 3C). Fibril growth of Aβ1–40 occurred to the order of a few micrometers in buffer A alone (Fig. 3C, image 2) and even in the presence of 0.2 mm Fe3+ (Fig. 3C, image 3). On the other hand, we could see only fibril seeds in Cu2+-treated (Fig. 3C, image 4) or Zn2+-treated (data not shown) samples. Thus, Cu2+ or Zn2+ but not Fe3+ prevents the fibril growth of Aβ1–40. Cu2+ and Zn2+ Prevent the β-Sheet Formation—Amyloid fibrils exhibit characteristic well ordered cross-β-sheet structure (40Wetzel R. Structure. 2002; 10: 1031-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41Sunde M. Blake C.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Aβ1–40 freshly dissolved in buffer A exhibited random coil conformation as revealed in its far UV-CD spectrum (Fig. 4, curve 1). Incubation of the peptide in the presence of fibril seeds for 80 min generated a characteristic far-UV CD spectrum for β-sheet structure with a minimum around 218 nm (Fig. 4, curve 2). Such an association-induced generation of β-sheet structure also occurred in the presence of Fe3+ (Fig. 4, curve 3). However, induction of β-sheet structure did not occur in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ (Fig. 4, curves 4 and 5). Thus, Cu2+ or Zn2+ but not Fe3+ prevents the generation of β-sheet structure, consistent with the effects on fibril growth monitored by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 3). Copper Binding to Aβ1–40 in Buffer A—Prevention of the fibril growth and the association-induced β-sheet formation shows that the metal ions, Cu2+ and Zn2+, interact with the Aβ peptide in buffer A, where phosphate complexation of the metal ions is also favored. We further investigated the Cu2+ binding by fluorescence spectroscopy. The sequence of Aβ1–40 does not contain any tryptophan residue but a single tyrosine residue at position 10 in addition to two phenylalanine residues at positions 19 and 20. The intrinsic fluorescence of the peptide thus predominantly represents the fluorescence of the sole tyrosine residue upon exciting at 280 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence of Aβ1–28 is known to be quenched upon binding to Cu2+ (20Syme C.D. Nadal R.C. Rigby S.E.J. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of the metal ions on the intrinsic fluorescence of Aβ1–40 peptide. The fluorescence intensity of the peptide progressively decreased upon the addition of the paramagnetic ion, Cu2+ (Fig. 5A). This observed quenching of the fluorescence is not due to the general collisional quenching of the fluorescence by the paramagnetic ion, Cu2+, as the fluorescence of N-acetyl tyrosine amide was not significantly quenched under the concentration range of the metal ion used (Fig. 5B). Thus, the specific quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of Aβ1–40 observed in buffer A is due to the specific binding of Cu2+, leading to proximal interactions between the quencher (Cu2+) and the fluorophore (the tyrosine residue of the peptide). Using the fluorescence quenching data (Fig. 5C), the dissociation constant (Kd) of copper binding to Aβ1–40 was calculated to be ∼8 × 106 m. The addition of the diamagnetic ion, Zn2+, however, did not lead to quenching of the fluorescence of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 5C). Thus, the fluorescence experiment shows that Cu2+ binds to the Aβ peptide in buffer A, under the condition in which the metal ion-induced prevention of fibril growth but not the metal ion-induced aggregation was observed. We presume that Zn2+ also interacts with or binds to Aβ1–40 in buffer A since Zn2+ behaved similarly to Cu2+ on the fibril growth of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 3B) Switching On/Off the Fibril Growth—One of the reasons for our observation that fibril growth is prevented by the metal ions is that the metal ions destabilize the fibrils. However, incubation of the fibrils of the Aβ peptide with the metal ions at 37 °C did not result in significant dissociation of the fibrils as judged by ThT binding (data not shown), thus ruling out the possibility of fibril instability as one of the reasons for the observed metal-induced prevention of the fibril growth. Since Cu2+-treated fibrils are stable but Cu2+ prevents the fibril growth, it was possible to switch on/off the fibril growth by switching Aβ1–40 to its fibrillogenic apo- and non-fibrillogenic holo-forms (Fig. 6). The results show that one of the key factors determining the Aβ fibril growth is the environmental concentrations of metal ions. Metal Ion-dependent Effects of CQ on the Fibril Growth—The antibiotic CQ, which can bind both Cu2+ and Zn2+ with the same stoichiometry but with different coordination geometry (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), has been proposed to serve as a potential drug for AD (8Bush A.I.

It would be pertinent to study the effects of CQ on the Aβ amyloid fibril growth as well as on the metal ion-induced suppression of the fibril growth. CQ alone did not affect the fibril growth of Aβ1–40 significantly (Fig. 7A). The addition of CQ or EDTA to the sample of Cu2+-treated Aβ1–40 led to resumption of the Cu2+-suppresed fibril growth (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the addition of EDTA, but not CQ, led to resumption of the fibril growth suppressed by Zn2+ (Fig. 7C). Since 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives are well known transition metal ion chelators (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 34Lane T.J. Sam C.S.C.A. Kandathil A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4462-4465Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and CQ forms complexes with both Zn2+ and Cu2+ with a similar stoichiometry of 2:1 (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the lack of resumption of the Zn2+-suppressed fibril growth is because CQ does not chelate Zn2+. Since complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives with Zn2+ are relatively less stable when compared with those with Cu2+ (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 34Lane T.J. Sam C.S.C.A. Kandathil A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4462-4465Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a second possibility could be that the possible lesser stability of the Zn2+-CQ complex may lead to shuttling of Zn2+ between CQ and the Aβ peptide, which may transiently increase the population of holo-form of Aβ1–40 that is less competent for fibril growth. The third possibility is that the Zn2+-CQ complex exhibits novel retardation effect on fibril growth. We, therefore, attempted to verify these possibilities as follows. At 10 μm Zn2+, the fibril growth of the peptide was prevented only partially (Fig. 8A). Since CQ itself does not exhibit significant effect on the fibril growth, the addition of CQ to the sample should not have any effect in the presence of Zn2+ if the first possibility of the lack of metal chelation by CQ is valid. If the second possibility is the primary reason, then in the presence of Zn2+ and CQ, the fibril growth profile would be expected to be in between that of the control and that of the sample in the presence of Zn2+ alone. Surprisingly, the addition of CQ led to further retardation of the fibril growth, indicating a synergistic effect of CQ and Zn2+ on the fibril growth of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, we did not observe such synergistic effect of CQ in the presence of Cu2+; CQ completely eliminates the suppressive effect of Cu2+ on fibril growth (Fig. 8B). From the observed synergistic effect of CQ and Zn2+, it appears that the third possibility is responsible for the observed phenomenon of distinct effects of CQ on the Cu2+- and Zn2+-suppressed fibril growth; Zn2+-CQ complex, but not Cu2+-CQ complex, retards the fibril growth. Sedimentation velocity experiments of the Aβ peptide in the absence and presence of metal ions and CQ revealed no significant changes (Fig. 9), suggesting that metal ion-CQ complexes do not promote other non-fibrillar aggregates not detected by ThT fluorescence. Thus, our results demonstrate that the effect of CQ on the fibril growth process is metal ion-dependent. There has been an increasing interest in the role of transition metal ions in AD (8Bush A.I.

Our study provides two important findings toward the understanding of the role of metal ions and metal ion chelators in AD. Firstly, our study demonstrates that the soluble holo-forms (Cu2+- or Zn2+-bound) of Aβ1–40 are less fibrillogenic or nonfibrillogenic in nature, which was not understood earlier. Although Fe3+ is also found at high concentration in AD brain (12Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), it does not exhibit a significant effect on the fibrillogenic propensity of Aβ1–40. It appears that high affinity binding of Cu2+ and Zn2+ may actually be beneficial as it does not favor fibril formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of metal ion under certain buffer conditions, as shown in Fig. 1, lead to aggregation and precipitation of the peptide, which may be toxic (29Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3379) Google Scholar, 30Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The second important finding is that CQ exhibits unique metal ion-dependent effects on the fibril growth of the Aβ1–40. Chelation of the metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+ by EDTA leads to conditions favorable for amyloid fibril growth. Animal experiments with CQ have provided encouraging results as a potential drug (8Bush A.I.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Our in vitro study shows that the addition of CQ leads to resumption of Cu2+-suppressed but not Zn2+-suppressed amyloid fibril growth of Aβ1–40. CQ and Zn2+ together exhibit synergistic retardation of the fibril growth, suggesting that retardation of fibril growth by the Zn2+-CQ complex is responsible for the observed distinct effects of CQ on the Cu2+- and Zn2+-suppressed fibril growth. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of shuttling of Zn2+ between CQ and Aβ1–40 due to the possible lesser stability of Zn2+ complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 34Lane T.J. Sam C.S.C.A. Kandathil A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4462-4465Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), leading to the transient formation of the less fibrillogenic holo-form. Both of these mechanisms should prove advantageous for the therapeutic use of CQ in AD. Monomeric Aβ is not toxic to the cells (29Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3379) Google Scholar, 30Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toxicity has been reported to be associated with β-sheet generation and fibril formation (35Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, granular aggregates, formed before fibril formation, were found be more toxic than the fibrils, although the toxicity depends on the size of the aggregates (29Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3379) Google Scholar, 30Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this respect, CQ can disaggregate the metal-induced aggregates of Aβ1–40 under certain buffer conditions (Fig. 1) and, along with Zn2+, it can retard fibril growth (Figs. 5 and 6). Although our results suggest that the Zn2+-complex, but not the Cu2+-complex of CQ, retards the fibril growth of Aβ1–40, how the complexes distinctly affect fibril propagation is not clear. We consider that the difference in the observed coordination geometry of the complexes of Cu2+ and Zn2+ (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) may have some role to play. The planar nature of the complex of Cu2+ may lead to stacking of the aromatic ring, promoting self-association of the complex. Such stacking is not favorable due to the fifth coordination involving a water molecule as well as due to puckered configuration of the Zn2+ complex of CQ (33Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which can increase the availability of the complex molecule to interact or interfere in the amyloid fibril growth of the Aβ peptide, probably through hydrophobic interactions. We conclude that Cu2+ and Zn2+, but not Fe3+, significantly prevent the amyloid fibril growth of Aβ1–40. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the soluble holo-form of the peptide is non-fibrillogenic in nature and that the fibril growth of the peptide can be switched on/off by switching the molecule between its apo- and holo-forms. CQ exhibits distinct effects on the Cu2+- and Zn2+-induced suppression of the fibril growth. Particularly, complexation of Zn2+ with CQ may have dual beneficial effects in not only disaggregating the metal ioninduced aggregates but also in retarding the fibril growth of Aβ1–40. Our study should prove useful in understanding the role of the transition metal ions in amyloid fibril propagation of Aβ peptides in AD and provide information concerning the use of metal chelators, particularly CQ, as potential drugs for AD.

A phenotypic series of transgenic plants was recovered that expressed high, intermediate, and low amounts of these two manganese-stabilizing proteins.

An analysis of the decay of the variable fluorescence in the presence of dichlorophenyldimethylurea indicated that charge recombination between Q A– and the S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex was seriously retarded in the plants that expressed low amounts of the manganesestabilizing proteins.

In higher plants and cyanobacteria, at least six intrinsic proteins appear to be required for oxygen evolution by photosystem II (PS II) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; chl, chlorophyll; DCMU, dichlorophenyldimethylurea; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MSP, manganese-stabilizing protein; MS medium, Murashige and Skoog medium; RNAi, interfering RNA; LHC, light-harvesting chlorophyll.

These are CP 47, CP 43, the D1 and D2 proteins, and the α and β subunits of cytochrome b559. Insertional inactivation or deletion of the genes for these components results in the complete loss of oxygen evolution activity. Additionally, a number of low molecular mass, intrinsic membrane protein components are associated with PS II (4Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D. Yocum C.F. Ort D.R. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar), although the functions of many of these proteins remain obscure. Although PS II complexes containing only these intrinsic components can evolve oxygen, they do so at low rates (about 25–40% of control), are extremely susceptible to photoinactivation, and require high, non-physiological levels of calcium and chloride for maximal activity (1Murata N. Miyao M. Omata T. Matsunami H. Kuwabara T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 363-369Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In higher plants, three extrinsic proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 33, 24, and 17 kDa, are required for high rates of oxygen evolution at physiological inorganic cofactor concentrations (7Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T. Satoh K. Photosystem II: The Water/Plastoquinone Oxido-Reductase of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar). The 33-kDa component has been termed the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) due to its stabilization of the manganese cluster during exposure to low chloride concentrations or to exogenous reductants. The 24- and 17-kDa proteins appear to modulate the calcium and chloride requirements for efficient oxygen evolution. These three extrinsic components interact with intrinsic membrane proteins and possibly with each other to yield fully functional oxygen-evolving complexes. The MSP is encoded by the psbO gene. The mature MSP protein is highly conserved (7Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T. Satoh K. Photosystem II: The Water/Plastoquinone Oxido-Reductase of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar), particularly among higher plant species. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, mutants in which the psbO gene was deleted exhibited photoautotrophic growth, and their PS II reaction centers were present in near normal amounts (∼75%) (2Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Chu H-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6137-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas, however, a mutant that did not accumulate the MSP was also deficient in the assembly of the PS II reaction centers and could not grow photoautotrophically (9Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis contains two genes for the MSP, psbO-1 (At5g66570) and psbO-2 (At3g50820), which encode MSP-1 and MSP-2, respectively (10Schubert M. Petersson U-A. Hass B.J. Funk C. Schroder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8354-8365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11Peltier J-B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. Van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Both of these genes are normally expressed, with about 70% of the MSP complement being MSP-1. A point mutation in the psbO-1 gene was recovered that led to the introduction of a premature stop codon and the loss of the MSP-1 protein (12Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibited slow growth, aberrant fluorescence induction characteristics, and an increased expression of MSP-2. RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene-silencing process in which double-stranded RNA induces the degradation of homologous mRNA sequences (13Hailton A.J. Baulcombe D.C. Science. 1999; 286: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). RNAi has been successfully applied as a powerful gene-silencing tool in a variety of organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and in mouse oocytes. It has also become a popular research methodology for investigating the physiological functions of target genes in plants (14Waterhouse P.M. Helliwell C.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the use of RNAi technology to suppress the expression of both the psbO-1 and the psbO-2 genes. Fluorescence yield, immunological data, and growth characteristics support the hypothesis that the MSP is required for PS II assembly/stability and autotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. RNA Interference Construct and Transformation—The pHANNIBAL vector (15Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M-B. Rouse D.T. Liu Q. Gooding P.S. Singh S.P. Abbott D. Sytoutjesdijk P.A. Robinson S.P. Gleave A.P. Green A.G. Waterhouse P.M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) was used to construct an intron-spliced hairpin RNA (RNAi construct). Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the psbO-1 and psbO-2 genes allowed the identification of one region (+227 to +530 in the psbO-2 coding sequence) that exhibited high nucleotide identity. This region was chosen to silence both the psbO-1 and the psbO-2 genes simultaneously via the RNAi construct RNAi-1. The primers for RNAi-1 were 5′-CCTCGAGCGACGAGATACAGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCGAAGGGTCCTTCGATCTCA-3′ for the sense fragment and 5′-TTCTAGACGACGAGATACAGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTCGAAGGGTCCTTCGATCTCA-3′ for the antisense fragment of psbO-2. PCR was performed on Rapidcycler (Idaho Technology, Inc.) in thin-walled microcentrifuge tubes in 50-μl reactions containing 5 μl of 10× PCR reaction buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP mixture, 3 μl of 10 pm/μl primer mixture, 0.25 μl of 5 units/μl Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 25 ng of Arabidopsis genomic DNA in purified water. Cycling parameters were a predenaturation step at 96 °C for 2 min followed by 30 amplification cycles (denature at 95 °C for 20 s, anneal at 53 °C for 20 s, extend at 72 °C for 40 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified sequence was cloned into both forward and reverse orientations flanking the Pdk intron of the pHANNIBAL vector (15Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M-B. Rouse D.T. Liu Q. Gooding P.S. Singh S.P. Abbott D. Sytoutjesdijk P.A. Robinson S.P. Gleave A.P. Green A.G. Waterhouse P.M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). After construction and verification by sequencing, the expression region was excised from pHANNIBAL with NotI and then subcloned into pART27 for transformation of the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 by the freeze-thaw method (16Holsters M. de Waele D. Messens E. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were transformed by the floral dip method as described previously (17Clough S.J. Bent A. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Harvested seeds were surface-sterilized with 50% ethyl alcohol and 0.5% Tween 20 for 3 min and then 70% ethyl alcohol for 3 min followed by washing three times with sterile water. Seeds were spread on solid MS medium containing 0.7% agar, 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin and then incubated for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark. Germination and the first 10 days of growth occurred under lighted conditions at 28 °C in Petri dishes, and then the plants were transplanted to culture boxes containing solid MS medium with 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin. To test for photoautotrophic growth, plants were transplanted onto medium from which the sucrose was omitted. Screening—The presence of the RNAi construct in the kanamycinresistant plant lines was confirmed by PCR with primers designed to amplify the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter region of the introduced DNA. All of the plants that exhibited the kanamycin-resistant phenotype also exhibited the presence of the 1.0-kbp cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter region, which was absent in the wild type plants (data not shown). Individual kanamycin-resistant plants were screened for the presence of the MSPs by “Western” blotting. One leaf was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and ground to a powder in the presence of liquid nitrogen. After evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, a protein isolation buffer (20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4, 10 mm EDTA, 450 mm sorbitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added followed by the addition of LiDS-PAGE solubilization buffer, and the samples were incubated on ice for at least 15 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min before loading onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel. PAGE, gel blotting, blocking, primary and secondary antibody probing, and 4-chloro-1-napthol development were performed as described previously (3Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of the mature spinach MSP (19Frankel L.K. Cruz J.A. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14275-14278Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was found to cross-react with both the MSP-1 and the MSP-2 proteins from Arabidopsis and was used in these studies. Immunological Characterization of Thylakoid Proteins—For a more in-depth analysis of the protein complement of the thylakoid membranes, chloroplasts were isolated from wild type and three mutant plant lines that expressed different levels of the MSPs. These lines, designated RNAi-1A, RNAi-1B, and RNAi-1C, expressed high, intermediate, and low amounts of the MSPs, respectively. Leaves were ground in a glass homogenizer with a chloroplast isolation buffer (100 mm sucrose, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.), the homogenate was then passed through two layers of Miracloth® (Calbiochem), and the chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min. The chloroplasts were then resuspended in a small amount of 300 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, and the chlorophyll concentration was determined by the method of Arnon (20Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LiDS-PAGE was performed on a 12.5–20% gradient gel with 3 μg of chlorophyll loaded/lane. Western blotting, blocking, and probing with primary and secondary antibodies were as described above. For detection of the immobilized antibodies, a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce) was used, and the blots were exposed to x-ray film. After development, the x-ray films were scanned with a UMax PowerLook III scanner at 300-dpi resolution and an 8-bit color depth. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Characterization and Analysis—The fluorescence characteristics of wild type and the three RNAi-1-containing plant lines (A–C) were examined on a Walz 101/103 pulsed-amplitude fluorimeter. Single leaves were excised from the plants and darkincubated for 5 min before illumination with the weak measuring beam. After 1.3 s, the leaves were illuminated for 4.7 s with strong actinic illumination. The decay of the variable fluorescence was followed for an additional 34 s and analyzed using Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp.). In some experiments, the leaves were treated with 40 mm DCMU, 0.1% Tween 20 in water for 30 min prior to performing the fluorescence experiments. Screening and PCR Confirmation of Transgenic Plants— Seeds from wild type and from plants transformed with the RNAi-1 construct were distributed on agar plates containing either MS medium or MS medium supplemented with 50 mg of kanamycin/liter. Although wild type seeds could not germinate successfully on medium containing kanamycin, a few kanamycin-resistant seedlings were recovered from plants transformed with the RNAi construct. If, however, seeds from the treated plants were sown onto agar plates containing MS medium + kanamycin + sucrose, many more kanamycin-resistant seedlings were recovered (data not shown). This indicated that many of the kanamycin-resistant plants required sucrose for successful germination and growth. The presence of the RNAi construct in the 35 kanamycin-resistant plants that germinated and grew on the sucrose-containing medium was confirmed by PCR amplification of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter region. All of the plants that exhibited kanamycin resistance also exhibited the 1.0-kbp PCR amplification product, indicating the presence of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter region of the RNAi construct (data not shown). To screen individual transgenic plants for the presence of the two MSPs, Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both MSP-1 and MSP-2 was performed. The results from a typical screening experiment are shown in Fig. 1. Individual transgenic plants exhibited different degrees of suppression of the expression of the two MSPs. The results showed that 11% of the plants had expression levels similar to wild type for MSP-1 and MSP-2, 49% of the transgenic plants expressed only MSP-1, and 14% of the transgenic plants showed differential suppression of MSP-1 and MSP-2. About 26% of the transgenic plants exhibited the almost complete loss of MSP-1 and MSP-2 (4-chloro-1-napthol was used as a detection reagent in this screen). These results are consistent with the results obtained in other RNAi studies that target other proteins. In almost all instances, different RNAi-containing plant lines exhibit different degrees of suppression of the protein targets (21Chuang C-F. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. (U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 22Zhao D. Ni W. Feng B. Han T. Petrasek M.G. Ma H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar), often allowing the isolation of a graded phenotypic series of mutants deficient in the targeted component. Plants That Express Low Levels of the MSPs Cannot Grow Photoautotrophically—RNAi-1-containing plants that were germinated on MS medium + kanamycin + sucrose were transplanted onto MS medium + kanamycin. Prior to transplanting, all of the plants appeared green and healthy. After transplanting, the RNAi-1-U plant, which expressed low amounts of the MSPs, yellowed and died, whereas the RNAi-1-S plant, which expressed intermediate amounts of MSPs, grew more slowly than wild type and was a paler shade of green (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained if intermediate and low expressing plants were transplanted onto a soilless potting mixture. All of the plants that expressed low amounts of the MSPs died (data not shown) when not supplied with sucrose. These results indicated that the MSPs were required for photoautotrophic growth in Arabidopsis. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, deletion mutants that lack the single MSP found in this organism grow photoautotrophically under the normal calcium and chloride conditions of BG-11 medium (2Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Philbrick J.B. Diner B.A. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13370-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under calcium- or chloride-depleted conditions, however, these strains cannot grow photoautotrophically (23Philbrick J.B. Diner B.A. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13370-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Engels D.H. Lott A. Schmid G.H. Pistorious E.K. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 42: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, however, the loss of the single MSP found in this organism in the FuD44 mutant led to a loss of photoautotrophy (9Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the higher plant requirement for MSP, as expected, is similar to that observed for Chlamydomonas. Low Levels of MSP Expression Lead to Decreased Levels of Functional PS II—To assess the effect of the loss of the expression of MSPs on the functional competence of PS II, chlorophyll fluorescence induction and decay were examined in wild type and the transgenic plants. Fig. 3 illustrates fluorescence induction and decay curves for wild type and for the transgenic plants RNAi-1A, RNAi-1B, and RNAi-1C either in the absence (Fig. 3A) or in the presence (Fig. 3B) of DCMU. These fluorescence curves were normalized to the Fo fluorescence level and were then offset for clarity. A numerical analysis of these fluorescence curves is shown in Table I. The dominating feature of these data is the loss of the absolute amount of variable fluorescence observed as one progresses through the phenotypic series. This is also reflected in the marked decrease in the quantum yield for variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) in both the presence and the absence of DCMU.Table IFluorescence characteristics of wild type and RNAi-1-containing ArabidopsisPlant typeFoFmFxFx/FmFluorescence decayaFit to a single exponential decay curve.k-1 s- DCMUWild type0.54bErrors for this fluorescence data were ± 10%.1.911.370.72NDcND, not determined.RNAi-1A0.341.411.070.76NDcND, not determined.RNAi-1B0.991.280.290.23NDcND, not determined.RNAi-1C0.670.800.130.16NDcND, not determined.+ DCMUWild type0.871.580.700.440.89 ± 0.04RNAi-1A0.771.400.660.470.82 ± 0.03RNAi-1B1.732.090.350.171.46 ± 0.08RNAi-1C0.850.880.030.048.96 ± 1.89a Fit to a single exponential decay curve.b Errors for this fluorescence data were ± 10%.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In Synechocystis 6803, a strong correlation exists (r = 0.94) between the total yield of variable fluorescence (Fm–Fo) and the PS II content (25Chu H-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6137-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) of wild type and mutant strains. Since such a correlation has never been established in either green algae or higher plants, we view such an analysis as being only semiquantitative when applied to the higher plant system. With this caveat in mind, our results indicated that there appeared to be a dramatic decrease in the quantity of fully functional PS II reaction centers as the amounts of the MSPs in the transgenic plants decreased. The rate constant (k–1) for the fluorescence decay in the presence of DCMU also increased through the phenotypic series. In the presence of DCMU, the fluorescence decay from Fm is dominated by charge recombination between Q –A and the S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex. The increased rate constants observed for the RNAi-1B and RNAi-1C indicated that this charge recombination was markedly slowed in these plants. This may have indicated an increased stability of the S2 state. It should be noted that we consider the fluorescence decay time of the RNAi-1C plant as only approximate. The very small Fv observed in this plant made the estimation of its decay time difficult and problematic. Nevertheless, multiple fluorescence decay measurements on this plant (and others with the low expressing phenotype) yielded consistently slow apparent rates of fluorescence decay. In Synechocystis 6803, a similar slowing of the decay of variable fluorescence was observed in mutants lacking the MSP (25Chu H-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6137-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These authors observed a 2–3-fold increase in the rate constants for fluorescence decay. No similar in vivo data are available for the Chlamydomonas Fud44 mutant or for higher plant mutants. However, higher plant PS II membranes that have been depleted of the extrinsic proteins by salt-washing exhibit a similar alteration in their fluorescence decay kinetics (26Miyao M. Murata M. Lavorel J. Maison-Petri B. Boussac A. Etienne A-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 151-159Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lowered Expression of the MSPs Leads to Loss of Other PS II Components—To determine whether decreased expression of the MSPs led to a loss of other PS II components, immunological analysis using chemiluminescent detection was performed. It should be noted that chemiluminescent detection is significantly more sensitive than the colorimetric reagents used during screening (Fig. 1) of the RNAi-1 transgenic plants. The relative amounts of some selected PS II and control proteins present were analyzed in chloroplast preparations of wild type Arabidopsis and the transgenic plants in the phenotypic series (Fig. 4). Three proteins that are present in the intrinsic core of PS II, CP47, CP43, and D1 were examined. The amount of CP47, CP43, and the D1 protein all decreased in the phenotypic series, with RNAi-1A being the least affected and RNAi-1C being the most affected. LHC II, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein antenna of PS II, was also examined. No change in the amount of LHC II present was observed in the RNAi-1-containing plants. These results indicated that the loss of the MSPs led to a decrease in the accumulation of PS II reaction center components and that the expression of LHC II was not related to the presence or absence of PS II. In the Chlamydomonas FuD44 mutant, the loss of the MSP led to a concomitant loss of other PS II core polypeptides including CP47, CP43, D1, and D2 (9Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The amount of LHC II, however, was not affected. The results obtained for these proteins in Chlamydomonas were essentially identical to those that we observed in the higher plant system. It should be noted that in the Chlamydomonas study, the complete absence of the MSP led to nearly the full loss of the examined PS II core components. The effects of intermediate levels of the MSP could not be examined in that system. In our study, we demonstrated that even at intermediate MSP expression levels (i.e. in the RNAi-1B plant), the amounts of a number of the examined core PS II components, including CP43 and CP47, were substantially reduced. This may have indicated a rather tight coupling of the expression of these components to the expression level of the MSPs that was not detected in the Chlamydomonas system. Alternatively, decreased levels of expression of the MSPs may have led to enhanced rates of degradation of the PS II core components, which then led to decreases in their steady state levels. Interestingly, Hashimoto et al. (27Hashimoto A. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated that there was a large pool of unassembled PS II extrinsic proteins comprising 20–50% of the total extrinsic proteins present in the thylakoid lumen and that these proteins were competent in binding to the photosystem. They suggested that this unbound pool participated in the maintenance of homeostasis with respect to turnover and assembly of PS II. Our observation that a lower level of the MSPs in the RNAi-1B mutant led to the loss of PS II reaction centers suggested that maintenance of this unassembled pool was essential for normal expression levels of PS II reaction centers, supporting the hypothesis of Hashimoto et al. (27Hashimoto A. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to the intrinsic PS II core components, the expression of the extrinsic 24- and 17-kDa extrinsic proteins was also assessed. In wild type and the RNAi-1A and RNAi-1B transgenic plants, two immunoreactive bands were observed that bound the anti-24-kDa antibody. The nature of the minor band is unclear at this time, although it may represent a migrational variant of the 24-kDa protein. This 24-kDa component was only modestly affected by the loss of the MSPs. Only in the RNAi-1C plant was a reduction in the amount of the 24-kDa protein evident, with the major immunoreactive band being reduced in intensity and the minor band disappearing. A markedly different pattern was observed for the 17-kDa protein. Chloroplasts from the RNAi-1B plant exhibited a modest reduction of the 17-kDa protein, whereas the RNAi-1C plant exhibited a complete loss of this extrinsic component. Although a similar result was obtained in Chlamydomonas for the 24-kDa protein, the 17-kDa result was quite different (9Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas, the complete loss of MSP did not lead to any observable change in the expression of the 17-kDa protein. It is unclear at this time whether the loss of the 17-kDa protein in Avabidopsis was due to decreased synthesis or increased degradation of this component. It should be noted, however, that large pools of unassembled mature 17-kDa protein can exist in the thylakoid lumen without being degraded either in the presence (27Hashimoto A. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or in the absence (8Hashimoto A. Akasaka T. Yamamoto Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 397-407Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.A. J.

Biol. 1989; 12: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of assembled and functional PS II reaction centers. Consequently, the loss of the 17-kDa component must have been the direct result of the loss of expression of the MSPs and not a consequence of the reduced levels of PS II observed as a result of decreased expression of the MSPs. This unexpected result indicated that decreased expression of the MSPs in Arabidopsis led to a loss of PS II reaction centers and decreased amounts of the extrinsic proteins associated with the oxygen-evolving complex, with the 17-kDa protein being dramatically affected. In addition to these PS II proteins, three control proteins were also examined. As expected, the amounts of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and cytochrome f, a component of the cytochrome b6/f complex, were not affected by decreased expression of the MSPs. Interestingly, the amount of the PsaB protein, a core component of photosystem I, was markedly decreased in the RNAi-1C plant. It should be noted that this could not be the result of a general loss of thylakoid membranes since such a situation would also lead to a loss of the cytochrome b6/f complex. Similar results were obtained for the nuclear mutant hcf136, which is deficient in the HCF136 protein and does not assemble PS II reaction centers (18Meurer J. Plucken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The loss of PS II reaction centers apparently led to a loss in the accumulation of PS I but not the cytochrome b6/f complex. The mechanism for this phenomenon has not been established and is being investigated. Conclusions—The use of RNAi methodology has proved a useful tool in probing the effects of a reduction of the MSPs in Arabidopsis. Decreased amounts of the MSPs led to a loss of photoautotrophy, decreased variable fluorescence yield, and a loss of PS II reaction center components. Although overall the effects were similar to those observed in the Chlamydomonas system (9Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our results seem to have indicated a tight coupling of the amount of the MSPs that accumulated with the amount of PS II reaction centers assembled. Additionally, in contrast to the Chlamydomonas system, the accumulation of the 17-kDa protein seemed to be very dependant on the amount of the MSPs present."

Whether the Olmec style arose in just one area or emerged from interactions among scattered contemporaneous societies remains controversial. Using elemental analysis, we determined the regional clay sources of 725 archaeological ceramic samples from across Mesoamerica. Exported Olmec-style ceramics originated from the San Lorenzo region of the Gulf Coast, supporting Olmec priority in the creation and spread of the first unified style and iconographic system in Mesoamerica."
https://openalex.org/W1965425684,"2-Aminoethyl diphenylborinate was recently identified as a chemical activator of TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3, three heat-gated members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) ion channel subfamily. Here we demonstrated that two structurally related compounds, diphenylboronic anhydride (DPBA) and diphenyltetrahydrofuran (DPTHF), can also modulate the activity of these channels. DPBA acted as a TRPV3 agonist, whereas DPTHF exhibited prominent antagonistic activity. However, all three diphenyl-containing compounds promoted some degree of channel activation or potentiation, followed by channel block. Strong TRPV3 activation by DPBA often leads to the appearance of a secondary, enhanced, current phase. A similar biphasic response was observed during TRPV3 heat stimulation; an initial, gradually sensitizing phase (I1) was followed by an abrupt transition to a secondary phase (I2). I2 was characterized by larger current amplitude, loss of outward rectification, and alterations in the following properties: permeability among cations; ruthenium red and DPTHF sensitivity; temperature dependence; and voltage-dependent gating. The I1 to I2 transition depended strongly on TRPV3 current density. Removal of extracellular divalent cations resulted in heat-evoked currents resembling I2, whereas mutation of a putative Ca2+-binding residue in the pore loop domain, aspartate 641, facilitated detection of the I1 to I2 transition, suggesting that the conversion to I2 resulted from the agonist- and time-dependent loss of divalent cationic inhibition. Primary keratinocytes overexpressing exogenous TRPV3 also exhibited biphasic agonist-evoked currents. Thus, strong activation by either chemical or thermal stimuli led to biphasic TRPV3 signaling behavior that may be associated with changes in the channel pore. 2-Aminoethyl diphenylborinate was recently identified as a chemical activator of TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3, three heat-gated members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) ion channel subfamily.

TRPV1 and TRPV2 are activated by noxious heat at temperatures above ∼42 and 52 °C, respectively (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are both responsive to temperature changes in the warm range (>32 °C). These two channels differ, however, in that TRPV3-mediated responses gradually sensitize during constant or repetitive stimulation (3Xu H. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S.A. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Lawson D.

The mechanism(s) by which heat activates these channels is not understood. However, recent findings suggest that, in the case of TRPV1, gating is a thermodynamic process, closely linked to the voltage dependence of this channel (9Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In addition to heat, all four of these channels can alternatively be activated by synthetic or naturally occurring chemical stimuli. TRPV1, for example, can be activated by pungent vanilloid compounds (e.g. capsaicin and resiniferatoxin), protons, or certain endocannabinoid lipids (10Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). TRPV4, in contrast, can be activated by the synthetic phorbol ester, 4α-phorbol didecanoate, or by 5′,6′-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, a cytochrome P450 metabolite of arachidonic acid (11Nilius B. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recently, another small organic molecule, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), was shown to activate TRPV3, both in heterologous expression systems and in keratinocytes expressing this channel endogenously (12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, this same compound can activate TRPV1 and TRPV2 but not TRPV4 (13Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). 2-APB was initially demonstrated to act as an inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (14Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that this compound could also block store-operated calcium entry, which is believed by some investigators to be mediated by TRP channels (15Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, and that under certain circumstances, it could paradoxically potentiate both of these activities (16Braun F.J.

In addition, 2-APB has been reported to activate an unidentified nonselective cation channel in RBL-2H3 m1 rat basophilic leukemia cells (23Braun F.J. Aziz O. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to inhibit volume-regulated anion channels (24Lemonnier L. Prevarskaya N. Mazurier J. Shuba Y. Skryma R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two structural analogs of 2-APB, diphenylboronic anhydride (DPBA) and 2,2-diphenyltetrahydrofuran (DPTHF), have also been reported to inhibit store-operated calcium entry (18Dobrydneva Y. Blackmore P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 541-552PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activity profiles of these compounds are not identical. For example, although 2-APB inhibits volume-regulated anion channels, DPTHF apparently does not (24Lemonnier L. Prevarskaya N. Mazurier J. Shuba Y. Skryma R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given these findings, we sought to determine whether and how DPBA and DPTHF might modulate the TRPV3 activity. Here we report that, like 2-APB, DPBA activates recombinant TRPV3. In contrast, DPTHF inhibits TRPV3 activation by either of these compounds. We also find that repetitive or prolonged activation of TRPV3 with either DPBA or heat evokes not only an initial phase, consisting of gradually sensitizing, outwardly rectifying currents, but also a subsequent phase, characterized by a much higher current amplitude and absence of outward rectification. Further analysis reveals that changes in both voltage-dependent gating and divalent cation block may contribute to these time-dependent changes in heat-evoked TRPV3 currents. DNA Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Unless otherwise noted, molecular biology and cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and chemicals were from Sigma. Cell culture and transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were performed as described previously (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A TRPV3-YFP cDNA encoding mouse TRPV3 (25Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused onto its C terminus was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (gift of J. Nathans, The Johns Hopkins University). A single G418 (500 μg/ml)-resistant clone exhibiting a high level of YFP fluorescence and TRPV3 immunoreactivity was used for Ca2+ imaging studies. Stable transfectants of rat TRPV1, rat TRPV4, and pcDNA3 alone have been described previously (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing SV40 large T-antigen were transiently co-transfected with cDNA encoding mouse TRPV2 (25Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or pcDNA3 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). For whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, HEK 293/T-antigen cells were transiently transfected with the mammalian expression vector, pTracer (Invitrogen), or pcDNA3 containing mouse TRPV3 cDNA. In TRPV3-pTracer, TRPV3 expression is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and GFP-Zeocin expression by an EM-7 promoter. pTracer without TRPV3 was used for vector control experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis of TRPV3 was performed by PCR using complementary synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the mutation of interest and Proofstart high fidelity polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The resulting cDNA, subcloned into pcDNA3, was co-transfected with GFP. Cells were replated 15–18 h post-transfection on polyornithine-coated glass coverslips and subjected to patch clamp recording 2 h later. Transiently transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. For most experiments, primary keratinocytes were cultured from newborn mice (postnatal day 1–3) as described previously (12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), plated at 105/cm2 on uncoated glass coverslips, and assayed after 40–80 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In several cases, we used an alternative protocol incorporating 2.5% dispase instead of trypsin in an effort to increase the expression level of native TRPV3. In this protocol, cells collected after proteolysis were centrifuged through a bovine serum albumin column (3 g/20 ml of media) and then resuspended and cultured in Serum-free Keratinocyte Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.05 mm CaCl2. The cells were plated on polyornithine/laminin/collagen IV-coated coverslips and recorded after 40–60 h. Keratinocyte transfection was performed 24 h after cell plating using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and voltage clamp was performed after an additional 18 h. Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ imaging bath solution contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.6 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1.2 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.45 with NaOH. Cells were loaded with fura 2-AM as described previously (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY), excitation filter changer (Ludl, Hawthorne, NY), and charge-coupled device camera (Coolsnap ES, Roper, Tucson, AZ). Pairwise images (340 and 380 nm excitation, 510 nm emission) were collected at 2–10-s intervals, and the data were analyzed using Ratio Tool software (Isee Imaging, Raleigh, NC) as described previously (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 50 cells from each coverslip, fura ratios (emission at 340 nm excitation/emission at 380 nm excitation) were calculated, base line-subtracted, and averaged. Data from ≥4 independent coverslips were used to calculate mean ± S.E. for each experimental group. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Unless otherwise indicated, in whole-cell voltage clamp experiments using 2-APB, DPBA or DPTHF, recording pipettes were filled with “low Cl– pipette solution” containing (in mm) 120 cesium aspartate, 10 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Cells were superfused with “low Cl– bath solution” containing (in mm) 130 sodium aspartate, 6 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Standard bath solution for recording heat-evoked currents contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 10 glucose, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Standard pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In the experiment evaluating the voltage dependence of heat-evoked currents, NaCl in the bath and pipette solutions was reduced from 140 to 40 mm with equimolar substitution of N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) to minimize the series resistance error derived from the large current amplitudes. To evaluate the relative permeabilities of NMDG and Ca2+ to Na+, we first measured the reversal potential (Erev) using a bath solution containing 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH) combined with the standard pipette solution. Then we measured the Erev change using a solution containing 140 NMDG-Cl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with HCl) for NMDG permeability, or 140 NaCl, 5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH) for Ca2+ permeability. Unless otherwise indicated, keratinocytes were recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp mode using pipette solution containing (in mm) 140 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA (pH 7.4 with CsOH) and the standard bath solution. An Axopatch 200B or Multiclamp 700A amplifier was used with pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Borosilicate glass electrodes had tip resistances of 2–4 megohms. The series resistance was usually in the range of 4–7 megohms, which was not compensated. Recording was aborted if this value exceeded 10 megohms. In the experiment evaluating voltage dependence, series resistance compensation was performed to ∼75%. A 3 m KCl agar salt bridge was used throughout the experiments. Bath temperature was controlled by using an in-line heater, alone or together with an in-line heater/cooler (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and monitored continuously with a thermistor (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ). The bath was perfused throughout the experiment and drug and temperature stimulus application was performed using an automated valve manifold (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, or Automate Scientific Inc, San Francisco). Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t test. Concentration-response relations were fitted using Prism software (Graphpad, San Diego) with the following equations: y = Emax/(1 + (EC50/x)H) for 2-APB and DPBA or y = Imax/(1 + (IC50/x)H) for DPTHF, where Emax or Imax is maximal agonistic or inhibitory effect, respectively; x is agonist or antagonist concentration; H is the Hill coefficient; and EC50 or IC50 is half-maximal effective concentration for activation or inhibition, respectively. In the case of DPTHF, separate fits were conducted from 1 to 32 μm and from 32 μm to 1 mm. Linear regression fits (y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the intercept) were achieved with Clampfit 9 (Axon Instruments) or Prism software. Curves plotting the relationship between voltage and tail current amplitude were fitted using the Boltzmann equation: I = Imin + (Imax – Imin)/(1 + exp((V½ – V)/k)), where Imin is the minimum current amplitude; Imax is the maximum current amplitude; V½ is the potential at which I is halfway between Imin and Imax; and k is the slope. To calculate cationic permeabilities relative to Na+, we used the following equations: PNMDG/PNa = exp((F/RT)(ENMDG – ENa)), and PCa/PNa = {[Na+]/4[Ca2+]} {exp((F/RT)(ECa – ENa))–1} {1 + exp(ECa(F/RT))}, where P is the permeability of the indicated ion; F is Faraday's constant; R is the gas constant; T is absolute temperature; and E is the reversal potential for the ion indicated by the subscript, corrected for liquid junction potential calculated in pClamp 9. To explore the effects of 2-APB structural analogs on TRPV3, we performed fura 2 microscopic fluorescent Ca2+ imaging on HEK 293 cells stably expressing mouse TRPV3 bearing a C-terminal yellow fluorescent protein tag (TRPV3-YFP). DPBA (100 μm, Fig. 1, A and C), like 2-APB (100 μm, Fig. 1, A and B), evoked robust free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases in these cells at room temperature that reversed upon washout (mean change in fura 340 nm/380 nm excitation ratio, 0.73 ± 0.07 units, n = 7 coverslips). No such responses were observed in cells stably transfected with the control vector pcDNA3 (0.02 ± 0.01 fura ratio units, n = 4 coverslips, p < 10–4 versus TRPV3-YFP, unpaired Student's t test) or in TRPV3-YFP cells treated with vehicle alone (0.1% Me2SO, not shown). In contrast to the other two compounds, DPTHF (100 μm) failed to evoke a detectable increase in [Ca2+]i in cells expressing TRPV3-YFP. However, in the presence of DPTHF, responses to 100 μm 2-APB were reduced by 73.2% (0.18 ± 0.01 ratio units, n = 4, versus 0.65 ± 0.13 ratio units, n = 8, in the absence of DPTHF, p < 0.01, Fig. 1, A and B). DPTHF also produced a robust (93.2%) inhibition of 100 μm DPBA-induced responses (0.05 ± 0.02 ratio units, n = 6, p < 10–5 versus DPBA alone, Fig. 1, A and C). Reportedly, TRPV1 and TRPV2 can also be activated by higher concentrations of 2-APB, whereas TRPV4 cannot (12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Confirming these results, upon stimulation with 320 μm of 2-APB, we observed a strong rise in [Ca2+]i in HEK 293 cells stably expressing rat TRPV1 (1.36 ± 0.10 ratio units, p < 0.001 versus pcDNA3 control, n = 4) or transiently expressing rat TRPV2 (0.58 ± 0.04 ratio units, p < 0.01 versus pcDNA3 control, n = 4) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we tested whether DPBA or DPTHF could activate or inhibit these other channels. DPBA (100 μm) evoked a robust rise in [Ca2+]i in TRPV1-expressing cells (0.77 ± 0.06 ratio units, n = 8, p < 10–6 versus pcDNA3 control, n = 4) or TRPV2-expressing cells (0.99 ± 0.03, n = 4, p < 10–4 versus pcDNA3 control, n = 4) (Fig. 1, A and C). In HEK 293 cells stably expressing rat TRPV4, even at 500 μm, DPBA failed to evoke [Ca2+]i increases distinguishable from the small background responses of stable pcDNA3 transfectants (Fig. 1, A and C). When DPTHF (100 μm) was included in the bath solution during DPBA stimulation of TRPV1- or TRPV2-expressing cells, the sizes of the responses were not altered significantly (data not shown). However, at a higher concentration (500 μm) DPTHF produced a modest inhibition of these channels (TRPV1, 25.2% inhibition, n = 4, p < 0.05; TRPV2, 33.2% inhibition, n = 4, p < 0.001), (Fig. 1, A and C). Given the relatively limited DPTHF activity at these two channels, we focused our subsequent analyses on TRPV3. In order to confirm that TRPV3 can be activated by DPBA and that this activity is inhibited by DPTHF, we performed whole-cell voltage clamp experiments on wild-type mouse TRPV3 transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells. In these cells, both 2-APB and DPBA evoked robust currents with Erev near 0 mV in current-voltage (I-V) traces (Fig. 2, A, B, F, and G). In both cases, response amplitudes increased, and outwardly rectifying initial responses became dually rectifying with successive drug applications. No such current responses were observed in cells transiently transfected with the control vector, pTracer (–3.7 ± 1.4 pA/pF at +80 mV and 0.2 ± 0.2 pA/pF at –80 mV, n = 5 versus TRPV3-expressing cells 247.2 ± 33.7 pA/pF at +80 mV and –59.1 ± 8.9 pA/pF at –80 mV, n = 23, p < 10–5). Likewise, inclusion of DPBA (100 μm) in the pipette resulted in no detectable current increase in cells expressing TRPV3 (data not shown), suggesting an extracellular site of action for this drug, as reported previously for 2-APB (13Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). As in the Ca2+-imaging assay, both 2-APB- and DPBA-evoked currents were reversibly inhibited by DPTHF (2-APB, 50.7 and 81.4% inhibition; DPBA, 58.9 and 90.8% inhibition at +80 and –80 mV, respectively, n = 6 to 11) (Fig. 2, C, D, F, and G). The DPBA-evoked inward current response was also robustly inhibited by 10 μm ruthenium red (RR; 99% less than control at –80 mV, p < 0.0001, n = 6), an organic cation known to block influx through many cation channels, including most TRPV subtypes (Fig. 2, E and G). However, as reported previously (12Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), RR alone evoked outward currents in TRPV3-expressing cells. Moreover, DPBA-evoked outward currents were inhibited only slightly by the presence of this compound (24.5% less than control at +80 mV, p < 0.05, n = 6). To characterize DPBA-evoked TRPV3 responses more quantitatively, we applied varying concentrations of 2-APB or DPBA for 2 min to cells transiently expressing TRPV3, and we plotted the maximal current amplitude during the stimulus at ±80 mV (Fig. 3A). Responses to each compound were evident at concentrations as low as 10 μm. With increasing concentration, the rising phase of these responses became steeper and the plateau higher. Careful inspection of the resulting concentration-response profiles (Fig. 3B) revealed that, at low concentrations, currents evoked by 2-APB and DPBA were similar in amplitude. However, at 100 μm, responses to DPBA (336.1 ± 29.1 pA/pF at +80 mV and –188.9 ± 24.7 pA/pF at –80 mV) were significantly larger than those to 2-APB (166.0 ± 58.7 pA/pF at +80 mV and –67.5 ± 35.7 pA/pF at –80 mV, n = 9, p < 0.05). Above 100 μm, DPBA-evoked responses tended to reach an apex and then decline in mid-response (Fig. 3A). This effect became more evident with increasing concentrations of DPBA and led to an apparent decline in maximal current amplitude at 1 mm. This decline in response amplitude was also observed in 2-APB-treated cells, but only at 1 mm. To minimize the impact of this phenomenon on our estimate of drug potency, we excluded the 1 mm DPBA data point during curve-fitting. The resulting concentration-response profiles yielded EC50 values for DPBA (64.1 μm at +80 mV, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 43.7 to 94.1 μm; and 85.1 μm at –80 mV, 95% CI 61.1 to 118.6 μm) that were comparable with those for 2-APB (90.6 μm at +80 mV, 95% CI 52.0 to 157.9 μm; and 165.8 μm at –80 mV, 95% CI 71.3 to 386.0 μm), with similar Hill coefficients (DPBA, 2.46 and 2.75 at +80 and –80 mV, respectively; 2-APB, 1.69 and 1.68). Whereas the calculated values for maximal DPBA responses (Emax, 448 pA/pF at +80 mV, –310 pA/pF at –80 mV) were slightly greater than those for responses evoked by 2-APB (321 pA/pF at +80 mV, –232 pA/pF at –80 mV), 95% CI for these two values overlapped. To investigate further the inhibition of TRPV3 by DPTHF, we applied 100 μm DPBA to cells expressing TRPV3, allowed responses to reach steady state, then superimposed varying concentrations of DPTHF (Fig. 3C). Under these conditions, DPTHF concentration-dependently inhibited DPBA-evoked currents. However, this concentration dependence extended over several orders of magnitude, with two apparent kinetic components (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, we fitted the response profiles at +80 mV and –80mV with two separate curves each, using 32 μm (10–4.5 in Fig. 3D) as the boundary between the two components. At –80 mV, this fit yielded IC50 values of 6.0 μm for the initial component and 151.5 μm for the secondary component, with Hill coefficients of 2.40 and 2.26, respectively. At +80 mV, IC50 values were 10.0 μm for the initial component and 226.7 μm for the secondary component with Hill coefficients of 1.17 and 1.34, respectively (Fig. 3D). This kinetic pattern suggests that DPTHF has two or more sites and/or mechanisms of action on TRPV3. To analyze further DPBA-evoked TRPV3 responses, we applied sequentially increasing concentrations of DPBA to a given TRPV3-expressing cell (Fig. 4, A–C). DPBA evoked currents in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 38.8 μm at +80 mV, 95% CI 18.4 to 82.0 μm; and EC50 = 38.7 μm at –80 mV, 95% CI 24.7 to 60.6 μm; Hill coefficients, 2.13 at +80 mV and 1.93 at –80 mV). These values are similar to those obtained in the single concentration protocol, with a slight difference in EC50 only at –80 mV. Using the increasing concentration protocol, a mid-stimulus current decline again became apparent at around 320 μm (20 ± 4% inhibition at +80 mV and 42 ± 6% inhibition at –80 mV, n = 8 cells, Fig. 4D). After the current reached a plateau, a further increase in DPBA concentration to 1 mm caused a further reduction in current amplitude. Upon drug washout, current a"

It has been reported that statins reduce the risk of developing the disorder, and a link between cholesterol and Alzheimer disease pathophysiology has been proposed. Moreover, experimental studies focusing on the cholesterol-dependent effects of statins have demonstrated a close association between cellular cholesterol levels and amyloid production. However, evidence suggests that statins are pleiotropic, and the potential cholesterol-independent effects of statins on amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) genesis are unknown. In this study, we developed a novel in vitro system that enabled the discrete analysis of cholesterol-dependent and -independent (i.e. isoprenoid-dependent) statin effects on APP cleavage and Aβ formation. Given the recent interest in the role that intracellular Aβ may play in Alzheimer disease, we analyzed statin effects on both secreted and cell-associated Aβ. As reported previously, low cellular cholesterol levels favored the α-secretase pathway and decreased Aβ secretion presumably within the endocytic pathway. In contrast, low isoprenoid levels resulted in the accumulation of APP, amyloidogenic fragments, and Aβ likely within biosynthetic compartments. Importantly, low cholesterol and low isoprenoid levels appeared to have completely independent effects on APP metabolism and Aβ formation. Although the implications of these effects for Alzheimer disease pathophysiology have yet to be investigated, to our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that isoprenylation is involved in determining levels of intracellular Aβ.

Thus, much research has been devoted to understanding the role of Aβ in AD and to developing therapeutic strategies for reducing Aβ levels or toxicity. Aβ is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases, the β- and γ-secretases (reviewed in Refs. 4Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar, 16Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, and 17Sisodia S.S. Kim S.H. Thinakaran G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Initially, β-secretase (also known as BACE1) cuts APP at the N terminus of the Aβ domain to produce the membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment (CTF) C99 and the secreted APP ectodomain APPsβ. C99 is the substrate of γ-secretase, which cleaves to generate the C terminus of Aβ. γ-Secretase cleavage is heterogeneous and produces Aβ peptides of different lengths (∼38–43 amino acids). An alternative non-amyloidogenic pathway also occurs in which a third protease, α-secretase, cuts APP within the Aβ domain, thus precluding Aβ formation. α-Secretase cleavage produces the membrane-bound APP CTF C83 and the secreted APP ectodomain APPsα. Like C99, C83 is a substrate of γ-secretase, which cleaves to generate the non-amyloidogenic p3 fragment. Previous studies indicate that the α- and β-secretase pathways may compete for APP substrate under certain conditions such that increased activity of one pathway leads to decreased APP processing in the other (18Vassar R.

Although Aβ42 is implicated as a causative factor for early onset familial AD, the link between Aβ and the pathogenesis of late onset sporadic AD is less firmly established. Factors that increase the risk of late onset AD have been identified, but their relationship to Aβ is unclear. Of particular interest are genetic and environmental factors that affect cholesterol metabolism and that associate with AD. For example, the apoE4 isoform is a risk factor for AD and is linked to increased serum cholesterol levels (20Jarvik G.P. Wijsman E.M. Kukull W.A. Schellenberg G.D. Yu C. Larson E.B.

Atherosclerosis and stroke, conditions that share hypercholesterolemia as a risk factor, appear to be associated with AD as well (23Hofman A. Ott A. Breteler M.M. Bots M.L.

Stroke. 2002; 33: 2351-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Indeed, epidemiological studies indicate that high serum cholesterol levels increase the risk of AD, and it has been proposed that the homeostatic regulation of cholesterol metabolism may be altered in AD (27Knebl J. DeFazio P. Clearfield M.B. Little L. McConathy W.J. McPherson R. Lacko A.G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 73: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent reports show a significant reduction in AD risk for patients treated with statins, a group of cholesterol-lowering drugs (28Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G. Siegel G. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 29Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that reduction of cholesterol levels may inhibit AD pathogenesis. Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis (reviewed in Refs. 30Werner N. Nickenig G. Laufs U. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar and 31Mason J.C. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 105: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HMG-CoA reductase converts HMG-CoA into mevalonate (see Fig. 1A), and inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase reduces the synthesis of all mevalonate pathway products. Indeed, mevalonate is a precursor of not only cholesterol, but also of many nonsteroidal isoprenoids, including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (see Fig. 1A). Isoprenylation is a functionally important post-translational modification of a variety of proteins, including small GTPases (e.g. Ras, Rab, and Rho), and plays a crucial role in protein trafficking and signaling, cytoskeletal structure, cell motility, and membrane transport (32Bi X.

Thus, it has been postulated that statins may have significant cholesterol-independent effects that result from inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway. Recent work has suggested that the AD risk reduction associated with statin treatment may be the result of decreased amyloidogenic APP processing caused by low cellular cholesterol levels. Treatment with statins or depletion of cholesterol with MβCD appears to increase α-secretase cleavage of APP in cells, whereas β-secretase cleavage and secreted Aβ levels are decreased (34Simons M.

Although these results suggest that cellular cholesterol levels modulate APP processing, other reports indicate that cholesterol esters (rather than free cholesterol) affect the activities of the secretases such that low cholesterol ester levels decrease Aβ formation (43Puglielli L. Konopka G. Pack-Chung E. Ingano L.A. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. Chang T.Y. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In addition, the subcellular distribution of cholesterol may also influence APP cleavage because mutations and pharmacological inhibitors of the Niemann-Pick complex cholesterol transport pathway alter the localization of presenilin/γ-secretase and lead to greater Aβ production (44Runz H.

Thus, the form, level, and distribution of cholesterol in cells may modulate APP processing in a complex fashion. Statins inhibit both cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis, and therefore, it was important to determine their individual effects on APP processing because previous studies had not done so. To this end, in this work we investigated the cholesterol-dependent versus isoprenoid-dependent effects of statin treatment on APP cleavage and Aβ formation in cells. By independently manipulating total cellular cholesterol and isoprenoid levels during exposure to statins, we found that cholesterol and isoprenoids have differential effects on the secretion and intracellular accumulation of FL-APP, APP fragments, and Aβ. As expected from previous studies, low cellular cholesterol levels favor the α-secretase pathway and decrease Aβ secretion. However, we also obtained the novel result that low isoprenoid levels cause cell-associated accumulation of FL-APP, APP fragments, and intracellular Aβ, and these effects were reversed by supplementation with a low concentration of mevalonate or GGPP. Interestingly, low isoprenoid and cholesterol levels appear to act through unrelated mechanisms. In particular, the secreted and intracellular pools of Aβ behave independently of one another. Understanding both the cholesterol-dependent and isoprenoid-dependent statin effects on APP processing may shed light on the mechanisms involved in statin-mediated AD risk reduction and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ, which may play a role in AD pathophysiology. Materials—The following reagents were used: lovastatin (LV) and simvastatin (SV) sodium salts (active forms; Calbiochem), lipoprotein-deficient fetal bovine serum (LDFBS) (Intracel), human Aβ40 and Aβ42 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (BIOSOURCE International), ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences), protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem), and BCA protein assay (Pierce). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Rabbit antisera against APP amino acids 676–695 and APPsβ with the Swedish mutation (APPsβsw) were generated as described (18Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P.

Other antibodies used were anti-APP antibody 22C11 (Chemicon International, Inc.), anti-Aβ-(1–17) antibody 6E10 (Signet Laboratories, Inc.), anti-BACE1 antibody PA1-757 (Affinity Bioreagents), anti-β-tubulin III antibody TUJ1 (Covance), antiglial fibrillary acidic protein antibody G-A-5 (Sigma), anti-actin antibody AC-15 (Sigma), peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). Cell Line Culture and Adenovirus Infection—HEK293 cells expressing human APP695 containing the Swedish mutation (APPsw-293 cells) were generated as described (48Ross S.L. Martin F. Simonet L.

Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Recombinant adenovirus encoding human APP695sw was prepared as described previously (49He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Prior to drug treatment, SH-SY5Y cells were infected for 48 h with APP695sw adenovirus. Neuron Culture—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from day 15–16 Tg2576 mouse embryos as described (50Goslin K. Banker G.A. Rat Hippocampal Neurons in Low Density Culture. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). Briefly, embryo cortices were dissected, and meninges were removed. Tissue was digested with 0.25% trypsin, mechanically dissociated, suspended in neurobasal medium (supplemented with 10% horse serum, B27 supplement, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 25 μm glutamate), and plated densely onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates. Neurons were maintained under serum-free conditions in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement prior to drug treatment. The neuronal population was determined to be >95% pure by immunofluorescence microscopy using β-tubulin III immunoreactivity as a neuronal marker. Astrocyte Culture—Primary mouse astrocytes were prepared from Tg2576 P1 pups. Briefly, P1 cerebral cortices were dissected, and the meninges were removed. Tissue was digested with 0.25% trypsin; gently dissociated; suspended in low glucose DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin; and either plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates for experimentation after 5 days in vitro (primary astrocytes) or seeded into T75 flasks (secondary astrocytes). To establish a pure astrocyte culture, microglia were removed by shaking at 275 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. At confluence, astrocytes were split and seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/well (secondary astrocytes). The astrocyte population was determined to be >95% pure by immunofluorescence microscopy using glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity as an astrocyte marker. Experiments were performed using both primary and secondary astrocyte cultures, and similar effects on APP metabolism were observed in both cases. For neuronal and astrocyte cultures, genotype analysis was performed with a REDExtract-N-Amp™ tissue PCR kit (Sigma) using Tg2576 transgene primers as described (51Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecole C. Clark H.B. Carlson G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1203-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Statin and MβCD Treatments—24 h prior to treatment, APPsw-293, SH-SY5Y, and astrocyte cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density to obtain subconfluent cell monolayers at the time of drug treatment. For Aβ ELISAs, cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes. Cultures were then treated with LV or SV (see “Results” for details on concentrations and treatment times) in the presence or absence of 0.25 mm mevalonate (34Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B.

Neurosci. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Drug treatments were performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated four times. Cell viability (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) remained above ∼95% following drug exposure. Statins were applied to APPsw-293, SH-SY5Y, and astrocyte cultures in DMEM containing either 10% FBS or 10% LDFBS. For treatment of primary cortical neurons, statins were applied under serum-free conditions in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement. As an alternative method to lower cellular cholesterol levels, APPsw-293 cells were treated with 10 mm MβCD in either FBS- or LDFBS-containing DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The MβCD-containing medium was then removed, and cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3.5 h before harvest. MβCD treatments were performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated three times. Immunoblot Analysis—Following treatment, the conditioned media were harvested, and cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% sodium azide) with protease inhibitor cocktail, and the protein concentration was measured with using the BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/lane for detection of APP CTFs and 10 μg/lane for all other proteins) were boiled under reducing conditions, loaded onto either NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels or 18% Tris/glycine gels (Novex and Invitrogen), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For FL-APP, C99, and C83 detection, blots were probed with anti-APP-(676–695) antiserum (1:5000). In addition, FL-APP was also detected by immunoblot analysis using either antibody 22C11 (1:10,000) or 6E10 (1: 10,000; which predominantly detects FL-APP in cell lysates). For detection of APPsα and APPsβsw, blots were probed with antibody 6E10 (1:10,000) and anti-APPsβsw antiserum (1:5000), respectively. For BACE1 detection, antibody PA1-757 (1:1000) was used. Blots were co-incubated with anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000) to control for loading. Following application of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, immunoblot signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Plus and quantified using a Kodak Image Analyzer (440 CF). All drug treatments were carried out in triplicate, and signals are expressed as a percentage of the control ± S.E. following signal normalization relative to the β-actin signal of each sample. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—APPsw-293 cells were exposed to either vehicle (untreated control) or 1–10 μm LV for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated (SV total RNA isolation kit, Promega), and cDNA was generated (Advantage RT-for-PCR kit, Clontech). Quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 sequence analyzer using LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) with 0.3 μm each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 ng of cDNA. PCR cycle parameters were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Following the final cycle, melt curve analysis confirmed the specificity and purity of each PCR product. Primer sequences were as follows: human β-actin forward primer, TCC CTG GAG AAG AGC TAC GA; actin reverse primer, AGC ACT GTG TTG GCG TAC AG; human APP695 forward primer, TGG CCC TGG AGA ACT ACA TC; and APP reverse primer, AAT CAC ACG GAG GTG TGT CA. Samples were run in triplicate; data were analyzed using a relative quantification method (Applied Biosystems); and β-actin values were used for signal normalization. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (18Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-APP-(676–695) antiserum (1:100), anti-APPsβsw antiserum (1:750), anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:250), and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (1:400), and the secondary antibody used was fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (1:400). Total Cholesterol Level Determination—Total lipids were extracted from cells according to established procedures (53Heider J.G. Boyett R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 514-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, APPsw-293 cells (∼5 × 106 cells) were scraped from 10-cm dishes, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol, sonicated for 2.5 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were decanted; the isopropyl alcohol was evaporated; pellets were resuspended in ∼50 μl of isopropyl alcohol; and aliquots were taken for cholesterol analysis. The cholesterol level was measured using a total cholesterol determination kit (Sigma) with cholesterol standards used for calibration according to the manufacturer's directions. Results were normalized to the total protein concentration of each sample. Treatments were performed in triplicate; the experiment was repeated three times; and the results are reported as a percentage of the control ± S.E.

However, there are few molecules available that can selectively bind to a single Eph receptor and not other members of this large receptor family. Here we report the identification by phage display of peptides that bind selectively to different receptors of the EphB class, including EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4. Peptides with the same EphB receptor specificity compete with each other for binding, suggesting that they have partially overlapping binding sites. In addition, several of the peptides contain amino acid motifs found in the G-H loop of the ephrin-B ligands, which is the region that mediates high-affinity interaction with the EphB receptors. Consistent with targeting the ephrin-binding site, the higher affinity peptides antagonize ephrin binding to the EphB receptors. We also designed an optimized EphB4-binding peptide with affinity comparable with that of the natural ligand, ephrin-B2. These peptides should be useful as selective inhibitors of the pathological activities of EphB receptors and as targeting agents for imaging probes and therapeutic drugs.

The Eph receptors are a large family of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate a multitude of biological processes in developing as well as adult tissues by binding a family of ligands called ephrins (1Murai K.K.

Clearly, the ability to perturb Eph receptor-ephrin interactions could have a number of important medical applications, in addition to allowing a better understanding of the biological activities of these proteins. Therefore, it would be desirable to inhibit the pathological function of an Eph receptor without affecting other related Eph receptors required for normal physiological processes.The ephrin ligands can discriminate between the EphA and EphB classes of receptors. Ephrin-A ligands bind to EphA receptors, with the exception of ephrin-A5, which at high concentrations can also bind to EphB2 (16Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J. Lackmann M. Li C. Barton W.A. Jeffrey P.D.

Ephrin-B ligands bind to EphB receptors as well as EphA4 (17Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S.

Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). However, interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins belonging to the same class are highly promiscuous (1Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Nevertheless, several 12-amino acid long peptides identified by phage display bind selectively to one or few Eph receptors of the A class (20Koolpe M. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46974-46979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These peptides have some sequence similarity with the 15-amino acid long G-H loop of the ephrins, which is the main region mediating high affinity binding of the ephrins to the Eph receptors (22Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In particular, several of the EphA receptor-binding peptides contain the motif ΩXXΩ (where “X” is a non-conserved amino acid and Ω is an aromatic amino acid (23Aasland R. Abrams C. Ampe C. Ball L.J. Bedford M.T. Cesareni G. Gimona M. Hurley J.H. Jarchau T. Lehto V.P. Lemmon M.A. Linding R. Mayer B.J. Nagai M. Sudol M. Walter U. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)), which is also found in the G-H loop of A-class ephrins. These peptides have additional distinctive sequence features that presumably confer their binding selectivity for specific EphA receptors. Importantly, micromolar concentrations of peptides that bind to EphA2 and EphA4 inhibit ephrin binding to these receptors (20Koolpe M. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46974-46979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the EphA4-binding peptides are antagonists that inhibit receptor activation by ephrins (21Murai K.K. Nguyen L.N. Koolpe M. McLennan R. Krull C.E. Pasquale E.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1000-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas the EphA2-binding peptides behave as ephrin mimics and promote EphA2 activation and downstream signaling (20Koolpe M. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46974-46979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 1M. Koolpe and E. B. Pasquale, unpublished data. 1M. Koolpe and E. B. Pasquale, unpublished data. The antagonistic peptides likely function by preventing ephrin-dependent Eph receptor clustering and transphosphorylation, which are necessary steps to activate downstream signaling pathways (1Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the cell surface-anchored ephrins promote the formation of Eph receptor dimers as well as larger clusters in which the receptors become activated (22Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but soluble monomeric forms of the ephrins act as antagonists (24Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is currently unclear how the EphA2-binding peptides can activate EphA2.Here we report the identification of antagonistic peptides that selectively bind to Eph receptors of the B class, including EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4. Furthermore, sequence optimization of one of the EphB4-binding peptides yielded a remarkably potent antagonist with affinity comparable with that of an ephrin ligand.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhage Display—An M13 phage library (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) displaying random 12-mer peptides was used for panning with EphB receptors. Histidine-tagged EphB ectodomain Fc fusion proteins (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) 2The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. -coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wells at concentrations of 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), except for EphB2 and EphB4 rounds 3.2 and 4, which were with 1 μg/ml. Wells were blocked for 1 h with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, and rinsed with binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20 or 0.5% Tween 20 for EphB2 and EphB4 rounds 3.2 and 4). In round 1 of panning, 2 × 1011 plaque-forming units of the phage library in 100 μl of binding buffer were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the EphB receptor-coated wells. After washing, remaining bound phage were eluted for 10 min with 100 μl of 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, and neutralized with 15 μlof1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9. The entire eluate was used to infect early log phase ER2738 host bacteria and amplified for 4.5 h at 37 °C. The phage were concentrated and stored according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In following rounds 2 × 1011 plaque-forming units of the amplified phage pool from the previous round were added to an EphB Fc-coated well and a bovine serum albumin-coated well. The phage were panned as described for round 1, except eluted phage were titered prior to amplification to assess enrichment.Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Biotinylated peptides were synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal GSGSK linker with biotin attached to the lysine side chain or with a carboxyl-terminal GSGS sequence linked to a carboxyl-terminal N-biotinyl-N′-Fmoc-ethylenediamine (Novabiochem). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to verify proper peptide synthesis, and purity. Stock solutions of the peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Irvine Scientific) and the pH was verified to be ∼6.5. The WHWT peptide had low solubility in aqueous buffers and was therefore solubilized in 15% Me2SO in PBS. Peptide concentrations were calculated based on A280.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Phage binding to Ni-NTA wells coated with 1 μg/ml Eph receptor Fc fusion proteins was quantified using an anti-phage antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (M13 phage detection kit, Amersham Biosciences) with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as a substrate. The background that was subtracted from the measurements was determined without EphB4 Fc.To measure peptide competition of phage binding to EphB receptors, Ni-NTA wells coated with Eph ectodomain Fc were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with various peptide concentrations in binding buffer (100 μl/well). Concentrated stocks of phage clones diluted between 1:500 and 1:10,000 in binding buffer were then added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed and bound phage were detected using the anti-M13 antibody. A biotinylated control peptide with sequence unrelated to the sequences of the Eph-binding peptides (RTVAHHGGLYHTNAEVK) was used as a negative control in some of the experiments, as indicated in the figure legends.To measure the specificity of peptide binding to Eph receptors, biotinylated peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates (Pierce) at 10 μm and incubated for 1 h with different Eph ectodomain Fc fusion proteins at 2.5 μg/ml in binding buffer. Bound receptor was detected using an anti-Fc antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Pierce). The background that was subtracted from the measurements was determined by omitting the Eph ectodomain.For competition assays between peptides and ephrin-B2 alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (ephrin-B2 AP), the concentration of ephrin-B2 AP used was adjusted to obtain similar signals with different EphB receptors (0.135–1.45 OD min–1 ml–1). Ephrin-B2 AP was co-incubated for 1 h with different peptide concentrations in Ni-NTA wells coated with 1 μg/ml Eph receptor Fc. After several washes, the amount of ephrin-B2-AP bound was quantified using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Alkaline phosphatase activity from wells without EphB Fc was subtracted as background.Immunoprecipitation, Peptide Pull-down, and Immunoblotting— MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which endogenously express EphB4, were grown in minimum essential Eagle's medium (ATCC) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin, and penicillin/streptomycin. COS cells, which endogenously express EphB2, and 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Irvine Scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Ten-cm plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with 9 μg of EphB4 cDNA in pcDNA3, and 1 μg of an enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid (Clontech) to verify transfection efficiency, using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were passaged 1 day after transfection and used for pull-down experiments 2 days after transfection.For peptide pull-down experiments, cells in 60-cm plates at 70% confluence or adult mouse brain tissue were solubilized in pull-down buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Three μg of biotinylated peptide were incubated for 45–90 min with 5–10 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), unbound peptide was washed away, and the beads were incubated with the cell lysates for 45–90 min. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed by immunoblotting with EphB1, EphB2, or EphB4 antibodies. The EphB1 antibody (Santa Cruz) was detected with a secondary anti-goat IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad). The EphB2 and EphB4 antibodies were affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing ∼100 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tails of the EphB2 or EphB4 receptors (8Noren N.K. Lu M. Freeman A.L. Koolpe M. Pasquale E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5583-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Holash J.A. Pasquale E.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and were detected with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences).For EphB2 immunoprecipitations, COS cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/high glucose medium for 3 h prior to stimulation with 1 μg/ml ephrin-B1 Fc or Fc protein in the presence or absence of EphB2-binding peptides or a control peptide. For EphB4 immunoprecipitations, MCF-7 cells were stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml ephrin-B2 Fc or Fc protein in the presence or absence of the TNYL-RAW peptide. After ephrin stimulation, the cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with either 5 μg of EphB2 antibodies or 10 μg of EphB4 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and probed by immunoblotting with peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). The immunoblots were then stripped and reprobed with either EphB2 antibody or a monoclonal EphB4 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by a secondary anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody.Cell Morphology—COS cells were plated onto glass coverslips and 16 h later were starved for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated for 20 min with 400 μm SNEW or control peptide in PBS, or an equal volume of PBS as a control, and then either left untreated or stimulated for 10 min with 1.5 μg/ml ephrin-B1 Fc (R&D Systems, Inc.). The cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, stained with Alexa 594-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and mounted on glass slides.Quantum Dot Labeling—For labeling of cells expressing transfected EphB4, COS cells in 6-cm plates were transfected with 3 μg of a plasmid encoding the EphB4 extracellular and transmembrane domains fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (26Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), or 3 μg of a vector encoding farnesylated EGFP (pEGFP-F) (Clontech) as control, using SuperFect transfection reagent. The cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day after transfection and labeled 2 days after transfection. For labeling experiments, 20 nm streptavidin-conjugated Qdot 655 quantum dots (Quantum Dot Corp.) were preincubated with 500 nm biotinylated TNYL peptide for 20 min on ice in quantum-dot binding buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The cells were incubated with quantum dots containing bound TNYL peptide, or quantum dots without peptide as a control, for 20 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold 1 mm CaCl2 in PBS. For labeling of cells endogenously expressing EphB4, MCF-7 cells plated on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) were incubated with 100 μm biotinylated TNYL peptide diluted in quantum-dot binding buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with ice-cold 1 mm CaCl2 in PBS, followed by incubation with 20 nm streptavidin quantum dots for 20 min at 4 °C. After labeling, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 4% sucrose for 10 min and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and the coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold mounting media (Molecular Probes) onto glass slides and imaged under a fluorescence microscope.RESULTSIdentification of Peptides That Bind to Different EphB Receptors—To identify EphB receptor-binding peptides, an M13 phage library displaying random 12-amino acid long peptides was panned on the ectodomains of EphB1, EphB2, or EphB4 fused to human Fc and immobilized on nickel-coated wells through a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1). Two panning experiments were performed with EphB4 because the first panning (Fig. 1, bottom left) yielded receptor-binding phage clones displaying only three different sequences (Table I). In some rounds of panning, we used less receptor for coating the wells in the attempt to isolate phage clones with higher binding affinity (Fig. 1, legend).Table IEphB receptor-binding peptidesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a The round of panning is indicated as a superscript, 1st is the first panning on EphB4.b The name of the peptides that were synthesized are underlined.c The alignment was by eye, residues found at a given position in 4 or more sequences are highlighted in color, and the G–H loop of the human ephrins are underlined.d Values >25 are indicated in bold.e Concentration of peptide required to inhibit ephrin-B2 AP binding by 50%.f Biotinylated and non-biotinylated peptides gave the same result.g Limited by solubility.h This value was obtained with the biotinylated peptide, although the IC50 for the non-biotinylated peptide is ∼150 μm; nd, not determined. Open table in a new tab Individual phage clones from different rounds of panning were confirmed to bind to the EphB receptor used for their isolation, sequenced to identify the displayed peptides, and named based on the initial 4 or 5 amino acids in their sequence (Table I). The binding selectivity of the phage clones for the different mammalian EphB receptors was also determined (Table I). Interestingly, many of the clones identified by panning on EphB1 or EphB2 bind to both receptors, whereas the clones isolated by panning on EphB4 all bind to this receptor with high selectivity. Consistent with this, an alignment of the peptide sequences (Table I) shows similarities between the EphB1- and EphB2-binding peptides, whereas the EphB4-binding peptides have more divergent sequences. For example, the THWK phage clone identified by panning on EphB1 and all but one of the clones isolated by panning on EphB2 display related peptides that contain the motif HW (Table I). This motif is not present in any of the EphB4-binding phage clones. Interestingly, the EWLS EphB1-specific clone contains the sequence SPNL, which is found in the G-H loop of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, and the EphB4-binding TNYL and FSPQ peptides contain the sequences FSPN and FSP, respectively, which are found in the G-H loop of ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2. Two other EphB4-binding clones (DALN and DHNH) contain the sequence NXWXL (where X is a non-conserved amino acid), which is present in the G-H loop of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. Other EphB4-binding clones were aligned in correspondence of only the carboxyl-terminal half of the ephrin G-H loop. Binding curves obtained using different phage concentrations suggest that these clones have lower binding avidity for EphB4 (data not shown).Different Peptides Compete with Each Other for Binding to the EphB Receptor Used for Their Isolation—To determine whether different phage clones target overlapping Eph receptor binding sites, we chemically synthesized the EWLS EphB1-binding peptide and the TNYL EphB4-binding peptide. We chose these peptides because they contain sequence motifs found in the ephrins and they bind specifically to EphB1 or EphB4, respectively, when displayed on phage (Table I). We also synthesized the SNEW EphB2-binding peptide, which is one of the few peptides identified that binds with high selectivity to EphB2 and was displayed on multiple phage clones (Table I). Several other peptides were also synthesized. We chose them based on a combination of criteria, including: (i) the sequence similarity of the peptide to the ephrin-B G-H loop; (ii) the number of phage clones isolated displaying that peptide; and (iii) representation of different sequence motifs (Table I).As expected, the EWLS, SNEW, and TNYL peptides efficiently inhibit binding of the corresponding phage clone to the appropriate immobilized EphB receptor (Fig. 2, top panels). Each peptide also inhibits binding of all the other phage clones that were isolated using the same EphB receptor (Fig. 2, middle panels and EphB2 bottom panel). The only exception is the DALN phage clone, whose binding to EphB4 is not inhibited by the TNYL peptide and several other EphB4-binding peptides (Fig. 2, EphB4 bottom panel). Conversely the synthetic DALN peptide fails to inhibit binding of TNYL phage and several other phage clones to EphB4, even though it effectively inhibits binding of DALN phage (Fig. 3, EphB4 bottom panel and data not shown).Fig. 2Competition between peptides for binding to EphB receptors.EphB1, top panel, the EWLS peptide inhibits binding of EWLS phage to the immobilized EphB1 ectodomain in a concentration-dependent manner. Bottom panel, the EWLS peptide at 5 μm inhibits EphB1 binding of the phage clones isolated by panning on EphB1. SNEW was used as the control peptide in both panels. EphB2, top panel, the SNEW peptide inhibits binding of SNEW phage to the immobilized EphB2 ectodomain in a concentration-dependent manner. RTVA (see “Materials and Methods”) was used as the control peptide. Middle and bottom panels, the SNEW peptide at 25 μm inhibits EphB2 binding of most phage clones isolated by panning on EphB2. The only exceptions are the IHWP, DHRWV, and WHWT clones. However, binding of these clones is inhibited by 50 μm SNEW peptide, particularly when the phage concentration is halved. RTVA was used as the control peptide with SNEW phage in the middle panel and SNEW was used as a control with the TNYL EphB4-binding phage in the bottom panel. EphB4, top panel, the TNYL peptide inhibits binding of TNYL phage to the immobilized EphB4 ectodomain in a concentration-dependent manner. Middle panel, the TNYL peptide at 25 μm inhibits binding to EphB4 of the phage clones that were isolated by panning on EphB4, except for the DALN clone. The SWL EphA2-binding peptide (20Koolpe M. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46974-46979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was used as the control peptide in both top and middle panels. Bottom panel, the DALN peptide (but not the DHNH and NPVI peptides) inhibits binding of DALN phage to the immobilized EphB4 ectodomain in a concentration-dependent manner. Bound phage were detected using anti-M13 phage antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and phage binding in the presence of peptide was normalized to phage binding in the absence of peptide.

Ephrin-B2 AP binding in the presence of peptide was normalized to binding in the absence of peptide. All peptides were biotinylated except for FSPQ and EWYM. Error bars indicate S.D. from duplicate measurements, and were calculated taking into account propagation of errors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest that all but one of the peptides identified by panning on an EphB receptor bind to the same region of that receptor. Based on the sequence similarity of some of the peptides with the ephrin G-H loop, the common binding site presumably corresponds to the ephrin high-affinity binding interface of the Eph receptors. It will be interesting to determine the mode of binding of the DALN peptide, which does not compete with other EphB4-binding peptides despite an apparent sequence similarity with the ephrin G-H loop.Peptides That Selectively Antagonize Ephrin Binding to the EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 Recepto"

Unlike α-synuclein, for which no precise biochemical function has been elucidated, Parkin functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and UCH-L1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme. The E3 ligase activity of Parkin in Parkinson disease is poorly understood and is further obscured by the fact that multiubiquitin chains can be formed through distinct types of linkages that regulate diverse cellular processes. For instance, ubiquitin lysine 48-linked multiubiquitin chains target substrates to the proteasome, whereas ubiquitin lysine 63-linked chains control ribosome function, protein sorting and trafficking, and endocytosis of membrane proteins. It is notable in this regard that ubiquitin lysine 63-linked chains promote the degradation of membrane proteins by the lysosome. Because both Parkin and α-synuclein can regulate the activity of the dopamine transporter, we investigated whether they influenced ubiquitin lysine 63-linked chain assembly. These studies revealed novel biochemical activities for both Parkin and α-synuclein. We determined that Parkin functions with UbcH13/Uev1a, a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to assemble ubiquitin lysine 63-linked chains. Our results and the results of others indicate that Parkin can promote both lysine 48- and lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. α-Synuclein also stimulated the assembly of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. Because UCH-L1, a ubiquitin hydrolase, was recently reported to form lysine 63-linked conjugates, it is evident that three proteins that are genetically linked to Parkinson disease can contribute to lysine 63 multiubiquitin chain formation.

Proteins can be modified by a single Ub moiety or by a multiubiquitin (multi-Ub) chain. The ligation of Ub to a substrate occurs through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue in Ub (G76) and the ϵ-amino group of a lysine side chain in the substrate (1Hershko A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is first activated by a Ub-activating (E1) enzyme and transferred to Ub-carrier/conjugating protein (E2) and Ub-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) enzymes (2Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). A multi-Ub chain is assembled through isopeptide bonds involving specific lysine residues in Ub. Substrates with four or more Ub moieties, linked via Lys-48 or Lys-29 (of Ub), are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conjugation of a single Ub moiety or the ligation of a Ub-Lys-63 chain can signal endocytosis of membrane proteins (4Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P.

A regulatory role has been proposed for the reversible ligation of Ub-Lys-63-linked chains on L28, a component of the large ribosomal subunit. However, this modification does not target L28 for degradation by the proteasome (11Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). E2 enzymes can assemble distinct types of multi-Ub chains. The only E2 enzyme that has been reported to assemble Ub-Lys-63 chains is unusual because it is a heterodimer composed of UbcH13 and Uev1a (12McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although both subunits resemble E2 enzymes, only UbcH13 is catalytically active in forming a thioester bond with Ub. Ub-E2 variant (UEV) proteins lack the active site cysteine residue, indicating that they perform a different role than that usually performed by E2 enzymes (14Sancho E. Vila M.R. Sanchez-Pulido L.

Both subunits, however, are essential for E2 activity (16Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The UbcH13/Uev1a heterodimer interacts with RING domain-containing proteins, including TRAF6 (17Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar), an Ub (E3) ligase that assembles Ub-Lys-63 chains, to activate the Iκ kinase (IKK). It was determined that Parkin is a Ub (E3) ligase that requires E1 and E2 enzymes (18Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 19Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). E3 enzymes play a central role in the recognition and ubiquitination of substrates. E3 proteins are highly diverse, and most, if not all, fall into two distinct categories: those that contain RING domains and those that contain HECT domains. Some RING E3s may function as monomeric proteins, whereas others are components of high molecular weight complexes, such as Skip/Cullin/F-box and anaphase-promoting complex. Previous studies showed that Parkin could interact with UbcH7 and UbcH8 E2 enzymes, which are presumed to assemble Ub-Lys-48 chains that target substrates to the proteasome (18Imai Y. Soda M.

Despite the many successes in characterizing the biochemical basis of Parkinson disease (PD), there remain notable gaps in our knowledge of the link between Parkin and α-Syn. It is significant in this regard that α-Syn interacts with vesicles (20Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol.

Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and has been reported to bind a modified form of α-Syn (19Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Parkin can ubiquitinate and promote the degradation of CDCrel-1 (26Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that α-Syn and Parkin may regulate the stability of membrane-associated proteins. An important regulatory mechanism for signal attenuation and recovery involves the trafficking and turnover of cell surface proteins. Ubiquitination of integral plasma membrane proteins, ion channels, transporters, receptors, and associated proteins can function to promote internalization by endocytosis and is a signal for sorting into vesicles for recycling, intracellular transport, or degradation by the lysosome (9Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 27Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since ubiquitination can promote endocytosis, it is possible that signaling molecules, such as receptors or transporters at the synapse, can be internalized and either recycled or degraded by the lysosome following monoubiquitination or ligation to a short Ub-Lys-63 chain. A Ub-Lys-63 chain differs from the typical Ub-Lys-48 chain that targets many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to the proteasome (30Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 31Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar, 32Chau V. Tobias J.W.

The ubiquitination of glycine and glutamate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors has been linked with cell surface receptor activity and lysosomal degradation (33Buttner C. Sadtler S.

Similarly, the turnover of hDAT from the synaptic terminal, following signal transmission, could represent a crucial aspect of dopaminergic signaling in PD. We report that both α-Syn and Parkin stimulate the formation of Ub-Lys-63 chains. We propose that an altered assembly or recognition of Lys-63 chains could result in errors in the turnover of neuronal cell surface proteins through the endocytic pathway and could underlie an important biochemical defect in PD. Chemicals, Proteins, and Antibodies—All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma. UbcH13-His6, Uev1a-His6, dimeric Uev1a-His6/UbcH13-His6, recombinant E1, Ub mutants that contained only a single lysine residue (Ub-Lys-63, Ub-Lys-48, Ub-Lys-29), and Fraction II were purchased from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA). DNA encoding wild-type α-Syn and mutant derivatives that contained clinically relevant single amino acid substitutions (A30P, E46K, and A53T) was cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli cells with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). α-Syn was released following cleavage with thrombin, and the purified protein was stable for 1–2 weeks, although breakdown products and higher molecular weight aggregates were detected after prolonged storage. Frequent inspection by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis allowed characterization of the quality of the α-Syn preparation. Conjugation experiments were typically performed within 2–3 days following purification to minimize the heterogeneity of the α-Syn preparation. Parkin was cloned into pGEX-2TK and purified in a manner similar to that described for α-Syn. Because we were unable to isolate the individual domains of Parkin from E. coli, we cloned Parkin, RING1, and RING2 into pCBGST1 for expression in yeast cells (36Baniahmad C. Baniahmad A. O'Malley B.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 194-196PubMed Google Scholar) to generate GST-Parkin, GST-RING1, and GST-RING2. This vector makes use of the metallothionein promoter CUP1 that is inducible by the presence of copper ions. Yeast strains expressing GST-Parkin, GST-RING1, or GST-RING2 were grown in synthetic medium in the presence of 0.2 mm ZnCl2, pelleted, and frozen at –70 °C. Yeast cells were suspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm ZnCl2 with the addition of protease inhibitors and lysed by glass bead disruption. Extracts were then applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. We confirmed that endogenous (yeast) E2 enzymes, and Ub, were not co-purified with the affinity-purified GST-Parkin constructs. Antibodies against Parkin and α-Syn were obtained from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ), and His6 antibody was obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Purified histone H2B, wild-type Ub, and Ub-specific polyclonal and GST-specific monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Ub Conjugation Reactions—One μg of α-Syn was added to reactions containing 1.6 μg of Fraction IIA in Ub conjugation buffer (36 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm ATP, 8 μm ZnCl2, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol) and 5 μg of wild-type Ub, Ub-Lys-29, Ub-Lys-48, or Ub-Lys-63, and then the sample was incubated at 37 °C. Control reactions that lacked α-Syn were treated similarly. Together, Fraction II represents the full complement of acidic Ub/proteasome pathway enzymes but lacks proteasomes and Ub. Fraction IIA is enriched in E1 and E2 enzymes, whereas Fraction IIB primarily contains E3 and Ub C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) enzymes (as described by Boston Biochem). Conjugation experiments were also performed with the addition of 1 μg of Parkin to reactions with conditions identical to those above containing Fraction IIA. The conjugation reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis in an SDS-(10%) polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and examined with antibodies against Ub. Quantitation of the autoradiographic films was performed using Kodak 1D software. Parkin Interaction with the Heterodimer, UbcH13/Uev1a—GST, GST-RING1, and GST-RING2 were purified from yeast using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with 1 μg of UbcH13/Uev1a for 5 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm ZnCl2. GST and GST-Parkin were purified from bacteria and incubated with 1 μg of UbcH13/Uev1a for 5 h at 4°C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm ZnCl2. Following incubation, the affinity beads were washed extensively in the same buffer and resolved in an SDS-(12%) polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with antibodies against the His6 epitope tag present on both subunits of the dimeric E2 enzyme or monomeric UbcH13 or Uev1a. Assembly of Unanchored Multi-Ub Chains—A control conjugation reaction, lacking GST-Parkin and α-Syn, contained 0.5 μg of E1, 0.32 μg of UbcH13/Uev1a, Ub conjugation buffer, and 5 μg of Ub-Lys-63. Other reactions were supplemented with 1 μg of either GST-Parkin or α-Syn. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer. The reaction products, representing free (unanchored) chains, were examined following immunoblotting with anti-Ub antibodies. α-Syn Can Stimulate Ub-Lys-63 Chain Formation in Fraction II—α-Syn was purified from E. coli and combined with rabbit reticulocyte Fraction IIA, which is depleted of Ub and proteasomes (31Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). Because Fraction IIA contains Ub-conjugating E1 and E2 enzymes (in contrast to Fraction IIB, which contains primarily E3 and UCH enzymes), we investigated the effect of α-Syn on the assembly of distinct types of multi-Ub chains (Ub-Lys-29, Ub-Lys-48, and Ub-Lys-63) in Fraction IIA. Both Ub-K29 and Ub-K48 chains target substrates to the proteasome (37Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ub-Lys-63 chains perform regulatory functions that include improving ribosome function (11Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D.

Ub conjugation reactions were initiated by adding ATP and terminated in SDS-containing buffer following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The reaction products were resolved in an SDS-(10%) polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and examined by immunoblotting with anti-Ub antibodies. We detected low levels of Ub-Lys-29 and Ub-Lys-48 conjugation and moderate levels of Ub-Lys-63 conjugation in the absence of α-Syn (Fig. 1a, lanes 5–7). The addition of α-Syn significantly increased the levels of Ub-Lys-63 chains (lane 4) but had only a minor effect on Ub-Lys-29 and Ub-Lys-48 conjugation (lanes 2 and 3). As a control, we used wild-type Ub in the reaction, and as expected, observed an increase in conjugation with the addition of α-Syn (Fig. 1b, lane 1). These results suggested that α-Syn either promoted an endogenous Ub-Lys-63-conjugating activity in Fraction II or was itself efficiently ligated to Ub. However, when the same filter was incubated with antibodies against α-Syn, we detected no evidence that it was conjugated to Ub (Fig. 1c). As observed previously (2Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), proteins in Fraction II can be efficiently conjugated to Ub. α-Syn Can Stimulate Ub-Lys-63 Chain Formation in a Reconstituted Reaction—To further investigate the ability of α-Syn to stimulate Ub-Lys-63 chain assembly, we reconstituted the conjugation reaction with purified E1 and the dimeric E2 enzyme UbcH13/Uev1a. The E2 dimer, UbcH13/Uev1a, is capable of forming free Ub-Lys-63 chains (which are not linked to a substrate). Although both subunits resemble E2 enzymes, only UbcH13 contains a catalytic cysteine residue, which mediates thioester-mediated transfer of Ub. Low levels of Ub-Lys-63 chains were detected in a reaction that contained only E1, UbcH13/Uev1a, and Ub-Lys-63 (Fig. 2a, lane 2). Significantly, the addition ofα-Syn resulted in dramatic, concentration-dependent increase in the levels of high molecular weight Ub cross-reacting material (lanes 3–5). Quantitation revealed at least 7-fold stimulation of Ub-conjugating activity. However, Ub was not conjugated to α-Syn since immunoblotting of the same reactions with α-Syn antibody did not reveal high molecular weight derivatives of α-Syn (Fig. 2b). Although the ligation of multiple Ub moieties to α-Syn would generate a strong signal against Ub antibodies, but not α-syn antibodies, we believe this is highly unlikely since Ub cross-reacting bands detected in Fig. 2a (lanes 3–5) were also observed in the absence of α-Syn (lane 2), demonstrating that they are not ubiquitinated derivatives of α-Syn. In Fig. 2, a and b, lane 1 contains representative samples of the recombinant α-Syn protein. The degree of stimulation of Ub-Lys-63 chain assembly by α-Syn was observed over a wide concentration range of UbcH13/Uev1a (Fig. 2c). In the presence of low amounts of dimer (0.04–0.32 μg, ∼30–240 nm, final concentration in reaction), the degree of stimulation of Ub chain assembly was significant. However, a further 5-fold increase in the amount of dimer obscured the stimulation by α-Syn since the reaction even in the absence of α-Syn was highly robust (data not shown). Parkin Can Bind UbcH13/Uev1a—The dimeric UbcH13/Uev1a enzyme has been demonstrated to bind proteins that contain RING motifs. The E3 activity of Parkin was previously characterized using UbcH7 and UbcH8 E2 enzymes. Intriguingly, Parkin contains two RING domains that can bind E2 enzymes (18Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 19Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y.

A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for two RING domains in Parkin is unclear since a single RING motif is sufficient for activity in other E3 enzymes. We speculated, therefore, that Parkin might bind the UbcH13/Uev1a E2 enzyme because both subunits of this dimer resemble Ub-conjugating enzymes, although only UbcH13 has a catalytic active site (Fig. 3a). Recombinant His6-tagged UbcH13 was added to affinity beads that contained GST, GST-RING1, and GST-RING2, and 5-fold increased binding to GST-RING2 was observed (Fig. 3b, upper panel). The weak interaction between UbcH13 and GST and UbcH13 and RING1 represents nonspecific binding. Similarly, we added the preassembled UbcH13/Uev1a dimer to affinity beads that contained GST, GST-RING1, and GST-RING2 (Fig. 3b, middle panel) and detected an interaction with both RING domains but not GST. However, we were unable to demonstrate convincingly that Uev1a (which was not present in a preassembled dimer) could bind RING1. It is possible that the dimerization of UbcH13/Uev1a stabilizes an interaction between Uev1a and RING1 since Uev1a could be purified with both RING1 and RING2 when it was associated with UbcH13. We also observed binding of the UbcH13/Uev1a dimer in a pull-down experiment with full-length GST-Parkin immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and incubated with recombinant UbcH13/Uev1a for 5 h at 4 °C (data not shown). Parkin Stimulates Ub-Lys-63 Chain Formation—To determine whether the binding of UbcH13/Uev1a to Parkin was biochemically significant, we examined its ability to stimulate the assembly of Ub-Lys-63 chains. GST-Parkin was purified and added to Fraction IIA, and ∼7-fold increased conjugation of Ub-Lys-63 was detected (Fig. 3c, lane 7) when compared with the levels observed for a reaction containing Fraction IIA but lacking Parkin (lane 6). GST-Parkin was also added to Fraction IIA in the presence of Ub-Lys-48 (Fig. 3c, lane 3), and consistent with previous results, we determined that Parkin could stimulate Ub-Lys-48-linked multi-Ub chain assembly. We believe this may be the first report of an E3 that can assemble both Ub-Lys-48- and Ub-Lys-63-linked chains. The increased multiubiquitination was not due to autoubiquitination of Parkin as determined by probing the same blot with GST- and Parkin-specific antibodies. No cross-reacting material was observed with either antibody (data not shown). For Ub-Lys-48-linked chains, high molecular weight Ub cross-reacting material is detected with Western blotting, whereas lower molecular weight Ub cross-reacting bands are observed for Ub-Lys-63-linked chains. The addition of GST-Parkin to a reconstituted reaction containing purified E1, UbcH13/Uev1a, and Ub-Lys-63 resulted in 8-fold increased ubiquitination (Fig. 3d, compare lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that both Parkin and α-Syn can stimulate the assembly of Ub-Lys-63 multi-Ub chains. The Ub cross-reacting bands (lanes 2 and 3) do not represent conjugates to Parkin because low levels of the same species were detected in reactions that lacked Parkin (lane 2). In addition, similar to the results obtained for α-Syn, the degree of stimulation of Ub-Lys-63 chain assembly by Parkin was observed over a wide concentration range of dimer added (Fig. 3e). α-Syn Mutants and Ub-Lys-63 Chain Formation—We also compared the effects of wild-type α-Syn and the clinically relevant α-Syn mutant proteins, α-SynA30P, α-SynE46K, and α-SynA53T on Ub-Lys-63 chain formation in a reconstituted reaction. Missense mutations (A30P, E46K, and A53T) in α-Syn and the overproduction of the wild-type protein cause familial forms of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, consistent with a “gain-of-function” effect (42Kruger R.

Sulfur (S) is an essential macro-nutrient for microorganism, animal, and plant growth. In plants sulfate is the main sulfur source acquired from the soil solution. After being absorbed through the plasma membrane of epidermis and cortical root cells, sulfate is transported within the plant through numerous cell membranes under the control of a surfeit of sulfate transporters (1Yoshimoto N. Inoue E. Saito K. Yamaya T. Takahashi H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The variety of locations and sensitivities to sulfate availability of the latter contribute to the plant sulfur homeostasis. Animal cells also transport sulfate through their membranes, and in mammals some diseases or developmental abnormalities were shown to be caused by defective sulfate transports (2Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For example, mutations of the diastrophic dysplasia gene induce deficient intracellular sulfate pools in chondrocytes, leading to the production of undersulfated proteoglycans, which impair the synthesis of cartilage (3Hastbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve-Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I. Lander E.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Sulfate transport in plants has been shown to be a H+-dependent co-transport process (4Hawkesford M.J.

Plant J. 1997; 12: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, animal sulfate transport systems are described and characterized as being either Na+-dependent or Na+-independent transporters (7Markovich D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 4: 1499-1533Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). When Na+ is not required, as for transporters belonging to the SLC4 and SLC26 families, sulfate uptake is mediated by a sulfate-anion antiporter system using bicarbonate, chloride, organic acids, or esterified bile acids as the counter-anion. The protein structure of the animal Na+-independent sulfate transporters is quite similar to that of the plant sulfate transporters. These transporters generally have 9–11 predicted membrane-spanning helixes and possess a long hydrophilic region downstream the last transmembrane helix. This C-terminal region shows an unexpected sequence similarity with a family of bacterial proteins called SpoIIAA and known as anti-sigma factor antagonists. Because of this sequence similarity, the C-terminal region of the sulfate transporters has been defined as a STAS 1The abbreviations used are: STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma antagonist; DRA, down-regulated in adenoma; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane. domain (for sulfate transporters anti-sigma antagonist domain) (8Aravind L.

In normal growing conditions, SpoIIAA is phosphorylated on its serine 58, and SpoIIAB is complexed with a sporulation-inducing sigma factor, which is thus inactive. Under nutrient deficiency SpoIIE, a specific phosphatase for SpoIIAA phosphate, becomes active; the dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA allows it to interact with SpoIIAB. As a result, the sigma factor is released from SpoIIAB and induces sporulation (9Diederich B. Wilkinson J.F. Magnin T. Najafi M. Erringston J. Yudkin M.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2653-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Clarkson J. Campbell I.D. Yudkin M.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 113-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional role of the STAS domain with respect to sulfate transport is completely unknown. Up to now structure-function studies of plant and animal sulfate transporters have mainly focused on the transmembrane domain regions (12Karniski L.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Shelden M.C. Loughlin P. Tierney M.L. Howitt S.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 589-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in animal cells it has been recently reported that the STAS domain of the human chloride-bicarbonate exchanger DRA is involved in protein-protein interaction with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), thus resulting in the mutual activation of both DRA and CFTR (14Ko S.B. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Luo X. Kim K.H. Millen L. Goto H. Naruse S. Soyombo A. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the STAS domain of transporters from eukaryotes may play a regulatory role through protein-protein interactions, as SpoIIAA does in Bacillus subtilis. Recently, a study demonstrated the importance of the STAS domain as a whole for the function of Arabidopsis thaliana sulfate transporters and showed that the STAS domain is not interchangeable between 3 of the 12 A. thaliana sulfate transporters that possess a STAS domain (15Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We performed a structure-function analysis of the STAS domain of the Arabidopsis high affinity sulfate transporter SULTR1.2, which is believed to be responsible for ∼70% of sulfate uptake by roots (16Maruyama-Nakashita A. Inoue E. Watanabe-Takahashi A. Yamaya T. Takahashi H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 17Fizames C. Munos S. Cazettes C. Nacry P. Boucherez J. Gaymard F. Piquemal D. Delorme V. Commes T. Doumas P. Cooke R. Marti J. Sentenac H. Gojon A. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We first propose a three-dimensional modeling of the SULTR1.2 STAS domain that highlights its structural similarity with the well characterized SpoIIAA protein structure, particularly at the putative phosphorylation site. Then, using a yeast mutant defective in its sulfate transport capacity as a functional expression system, we identified by serial deletions and mutagenesis some key amino acids of the STAS domain that are essential for the sulfate transport function of SULTR1.2. Computational Sequence Analysis—Structural predictions, fold recognition, and sequence threading onto three-dimensional structures were carried out using 3D-PSSM, FUGUE, and GenTHREADER through the @TOME meta-server available at bioserv.cbs.cnrs.fr (18Douguet D. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 752-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TITO (Tool for Incremental Threading Optimization) was applied automatically to evaluate the sequence-structure alignment provided by the meta-server. Edition and optimization of the alignment was performed using the program ViTO. 2V. Catherinot and G. Labesse, unpublished results. Promising sequence-structure alignments were further submitted to MODELLER 6.2 for comparative protein modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints (19Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). Resulting models were evaluated using the programs Verify3D (20Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar) and PROSA (21Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All the constructs were performed by PCR amplification with the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) using the Arabidopsis full-length SULTR1.2 cDNA as template. The amplification products corresponding to the wild-type SULTR1.2 transporter, to the mutant SULTR1.2 transporters harboring deletions of the last 4, 7, 8, 12, or 131 amino acids, or to the mutant SULTR1.2 transporters harboring the simple C645S, C646S, or double C645S/C646S substitutions were obtained using the same forward primer, 5′-ATgTCgTCAAgAgCTCACCCTgTggAC-3′, and the following reverse primers, 5′-TCAgACCTCgTTggAgAgTTTTggACAg-3′, 5′-TCATCAgAgTTTTggACAgCAAgCCTCgACg-3′, 5′-CTATCAACAgCAAgCCTCgACggCATCA-3′, 5′-TCATCAgCAAgCCTCgACggCATCAgCCACCg-3′, 5′-CTACTAggCATCAgCCACCgTTAgATAgAT-3′, 5′-TCATCACTgTTgAATATTTCTgTAAAC-3′, 5′-TCAgACCTCgTTggAgAgTTTTggAgAgCAAgCC-3′, 5′-TCAgACCTCgTTggAgAgTTTTggACAggAAgCC-3′, and 5′-TCAgACCTCgTTggAgAgTTTTggAgAggAAgCC-3′, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Script SK+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the SrfI restriction site in the appropriate orientation. The site-directed mutageneses corresponding to the deletion of threonine 587 (T587ΔT) and to the T587S, T587A, or T587D substitutions were performed in two steps. In the first step and for every mutagenesis experiment, two PCR products were generated using the full-length SULTR1.2 cDNA as template; one of the PCR constructs consisted of the beginning of the SULTR1.2 coding sequence, from the start codon to the mutagenized threonine 587 codon, and the other consisted of the end of the SULTR1.2 coding sequence, from the mutagenized threonine 587 codon to the stop codon. Both PCR products were separately cloned in the pCR-Script SK+ vector at the SrfI restriction site and in the appropriate orientation. In the second step the whole mutagenized coding sequence was reassembled by in-frame subcloning of the 3′ end of the coding sequence downstream of the 5′ end. For every site-directed mutagenesis, this two-step cloning procedure required the use of appropriate PCR primers, which harbored the desired mutation of the threonine 587 codon and which were partially overlapping and contained a common restriction site enabling the inframe assembly of the whole coding sequence. For the different site-directed mutageneses, the 5′-gCTCCggAATCgATgTCCgTAACAggTgAC-3′ (T587ΔT-rev), 5′-ACgTCTAgAATCgATgTCCgTAACAggTgA-3′ (T587S-rev), 5′-CTAgCTAgCATCgATgTCCgTAACAggTgA-3′ (T587A-rev), 5′-gCTCCggAgTCATCgATgTCCgTAACAggT-3′ (T587D-rev), reverse primers were used in combination with the forward 5′-ATgTCgTCAAgAgCTCACCCTgTggAC-3′ primer to amplify the beginning of the SULTR1.2 coding sequence. The 5′-gCTCCggAATTCACgCATTAgAAgACTTAT-3′ (T587ΔT-fw), 5′-TTAgCTAgCggTATTCACgCATTAgAAgAC-3′ (T587S-fw), 5′-TTAgCTAgCggTATTCACgCATTAgAAgAC-3′ (T587A-fw), or 5′-gCTCCggAATTCACgCATTAgAAgACTTAT-3′ (T587D-fw) forward primers were used in combination with the 5′-TCAgACCTCgTTgtgAgAgTTTTggACAg-3′ reverse primer to amplify the end of the SULTR1.2 coding sequence. The restriction sites used for the reassembly of the whole coding sequence corresponding to the deletion of threonine 587 and to the T587S, T587A, or T587D substitutions were BseA1, XbaI/NheI, NheI, and BseA1, respectively (underlined in the primer sequences). The DNA sequences of the constructs were checked (GenomeExpress, Grenoble, France). Then, for every construct a HindIII-NotI fragment comprising the whole coding sequence was subcloned at the corresponding sites into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible GALI promoter. Construction of Wild-type and Mutant SULTR1.2::FLAG Protein Fusions—In a first step the wild-type coding sequence of SULTR1.2 was fused at its 3′ end to the DNA sequence encoding the FLAG® epitope tag DYKDDDDK in the yeast expression vector pESC-URA (Stratagene). For that, PCR amplification was performed with the high fidelity Pfu DNA Polymerase (Promega) using the Arabidopsis full-length SULTR1.2 cDNA as template and the forward 5′-AtgTCgTCAAgAgCTCACCCTgTggAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTggACTAgTCCgACCTCgTTggAggAgTTTTgg-3′ primers. The latter primer was designed so that it enabled the replacement of the SULTR1.2 stop codon by a new SpeI restriction site (underlined in the primer sequence) allowing in-frame fusion with the FLAG® sequence. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR-Script SK+ vector (Stratagene) at the SrfI site and in the appropriate orientation. The EcoRI-SpeI fragment comprising the whole SULTR1.2 coding sequence was then subcloned into pESC-URA at the EcoRI/SpeI sites, giving the pESC-SULTR1.2::FLAG vector. The SULTR1.2::FLAG fusion was under the control of the inducible yeast GAL10 promoter. The mutant SULTR1.2::FLAG fusions were constructed in a second step. The mutant SULTR1.2 clones described above were used as template for PCR amplification using the high fidelity Pfu DNA Polymerase (Promega). Only the STAS region of the mutant SULTR1.2 was amplified. The forward 5′-CCAAgAACTTCggTTTACAgAAATATTC-3′ primer was used in combination with the reverse 5′-CCTggACTAgTCCgACCTCgTTggAgAgTTTTgg-3′ primer for all the constructs except for the SULTR1.2 Δ12 construct for which the reverse primer was 5′-CCggACTAgTCCggCATCAgCCACCgTTAgATA-3′. The PCR products were digested with both the AvrII and SpeI restriction enzymes, and the resulting fragments were introduced in pESC-URA SULTR1.2::FLAG at the corresponding sites, replacing the wild-type fragment by the mutated ones. All the constructions were verified by sequencing. Yeast Transformation and Growth—The pYES2 plasmids harboring the wild-type and mutant SULTR1.2 transporters were introduced in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YSD1 (MATα, his3, leu2, ura3, sul1) (22Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Prosser I.M. Clarkson D.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which is unable to grow when sulfate is the sole sulfur source in the medium but grows on medium supplied with a reduced sulfur source such as homocysteine. Genetic transformation was performed using the S.c. Easy Comp™ system (Invitrogen). YSD1 transformed with the empty expression vector pYES2 was used as a negative control. Recombinant yeast cells were grown for at least 6 generations to ∼1 A600 nm unit in a rich but uracil-free medium containing 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.1% (w/v) casamino acids (Difco), 5% (w/v) glucose, 0.75 mm leucine, and 1 mm histidine. Yeast cells were then washed once with sterile deionized water and resuspended to a final absorbance of 1 A600 nm unit in a selective synthetic minimal medium called B medium containing 15 mm NH4Cl, 6.6 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm K2HPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.7 mm NaCl, 0.68 mm CaCl2, 80 μm H3BO3, 6 μm KI, 4 μm ZnCl2, 2 μm CuCl2, 1.8 μm FeCl3, 1% (w/v) galactose, 0.75 mm leucine, and 1 mm histidine (23Cherest H. Davidian J.C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the drop tests 30 μl of the final suspension and of 10 and 100 times dilutions of the final suspension were dropped on the selective synthetic B medium containing either 0.1 mm Na2SO4 or 0.1 mm homocysteine as the sole sources of sulfur solidified with 1% (w/v) low sulfate containing agarose (Invitrogen). Yeast cells were grown for 3 days at 30 °C. For growth analyses in liquid cultures, YSD1 cells expressing the various pYES2::SULTR1.2 constructs were grown in synthetic selective B medium containing 0.1 mm Na2SO4 under vigorous shaking (200 rpm) at 30 °C. The doubling times were calculated from linear regression of the log2 values of the A600 per time in the exponential phase growth. Sulfate Uptake Assays—Sulfate uptake assays were performed as already described (24Vidmar J.J. Tagmount A. Cathala N. Touraine B. Davidian J.C.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For the sulfate influx measurement, yeast cells were rinsed and resuspended in a sulfate-free solution (1% (w/v) galactose, 0.1 mm homocysteine, 0.75 mm leucine, and 1 mm histidine), the pH of which was adjusted to 5.0 by the addition of MES. Every sulfate uptake measurement was started by adding simultaneously K2SO4 at the final concentration of 0.1 mm and 3.7 × 104 Bq of [35S]sulfate (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Extraction and Analysis—Yeast cells were grown up to 0.2–0.4 A600 unit in synthetic selective B medium supplemented with 0.1 mm homocysteine, washed once in cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in cold extraction buffer containing 50 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.6, 0.3 m mannitol, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% (v/v) of a yeast protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Yeast cells were disrupted at 120 megapascals at 4 °C using the Z PLUS 1.1 KW Benchtop Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble proteins present in the supernatant were precipitated in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, kept on ice overnight, pelleted at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in a storage TE buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2% (v/v) of the yeast protease inhibitor mixture. The 80,000 × g pellet containing the crude membrane fraction was resuspended in cold storage TE buffer containing 10% (w/w) sucrose and deposited on a discontinuous 25–37-53% (w/w) sucrose gradient prepared in a TE buffer. After centrifugation in the SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 150,000 × g for 19 h at 4 °C, the plasma membrane-enriched fraction corresponding to the 37–53% interface (25Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was collected, diluted 10 times in cold storage buffer, pelleted at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and resuspended in cold storage buffer. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Schaffner procedure (26Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For electrophoresis, 10 μg of proteins were mixed with ⅓ volume of 4× loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 8% (w/v) SDS, 8% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 40% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.04% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and heated at 37 °C for 20 min. Protein samples were resolved on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred (100 V, 1 h) onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blotted membrane was treated with methanol 95% (v/v) for 15 s, dried at 37 °C for 15 min, incubated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and the appropriate antibody for 1 h, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween for 30 min. A 1:30,000 dilution of the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal anti-FLAG® antibody (Sigma) was used to immuno-detect the SULTR1.2::FLAG fusion proteins. A 1:100,000 dilution of the polyclonal antibody raised against the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia H+-ATPase PMA2 (27Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used to reveal the yeast H+-ATPase, a marker of the plasma membrane. This antibody was detected by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Promega). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the CDP Star enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Applied Science). Three-dimensional Modeling of the STAS Domain of the Arabidopsis Sulfate Transporter SULTR1.2—The sequences of the C-terminal regions of a set of sulfate transporters from plant, animal, and yeast were compared with the prokaryotic sequences of the anti-anti-sigma factors SpoIIAA of B. subtilis (1AUZ) and Bacillus sphaericus (1H4Z) (Fig. 1A). Significant sequence similarities (35–80% of amino acid identity were found in the C-terminal regions of the plant sulfate transporters (SULTR1.1, SULTR1.2, SULTR2.1, and SULTR2.2 from Arabidopsis and ShST1 from Stylosanthes hamata). In contrast, the sequence similarities between the plant sulfate transporter C-terminal regions and the human diastrophic displasia sulfate transporter, the S. cerevisiae sulfate transporter SUL1, or the Bacillus anti-anti-sigma factors SpoIIAA were weaker (15–20% of amino acid identity. However, these low sequence similarities occurred at very specific positions (Fig. 1A), which had already been shown to define the so-called STAS domain. We further characterized the Arabidopsis sulfate transporter STAS domains at the secondary and tertiary structure levels by comparing these domains with the available NMR structure of B. subtilis SpoIIAA (28Kovacs H. Comfort D. Lord M. Campbell I.D. Yudkin M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of B. sphaericus SpoIIAA (29Seavers P.R. Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Verschueren K.H. Murshudov G.N. Wilkinson A.J. Structure. 2001; 9: 605-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The dedicated meta-server @TOME available at bioserv.cbs.cnrs.fr (18Douguet D. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 752-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used for the fold compatibility analyses. With most queries (including those in Fig. 1A), mGenTHREADER, 3D-PSSM, and FUGUE showed highly significant threading scores (e values of 0.008, 3e–5, and Z-score of 15.9, respectively) with SpoIIAA structures. The structural analysis was further developed for the SULTR1.2 STAS domain. Various models were built using the programs TITO and MODELLER (19Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). Assessment of these computed three-dimensional models by molecular structure and amino acid environment evaluation tools such as Verify3D, ERRAT, and PROSA, showed that the models were very good (scoring above 0.3 with Verify3D and above 70% with ERRAT; pseudo-energy was below –1.2 as computed by PROSA). These results validated the structural alignment of the SULTR1.2 STAS domain with the NMR and crystal structures of SpoIIAA, and thus, the resulting three-dimensional model specifically built for SULTR1.2 (Fig. 1). The structural analysis revealed a compact hydrophobic core at the interface of the α-helices and the β-sheets. This hydrophobic core appeared very well conserved between the SULTR1.2 STAS domains and SpoIIAA (Fig. 1B). The structural analysis also revealed that the phosphorylation site, which is critical for SpoIIAA function (9Diederich B. Wilkinson J.F. Magnin T. Najafi M. Erringston J. Yudkin M.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2653-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is conserved in the SULTR1.2 STAS domain and more generally in almost all the other sulfate transporter STAS domains. This phosphorylation site consists of an aspartate (strictly conserved in all the sulfate transporter STAS domains and in SpoIIAA) followed by one or two hydroxyl-containing amino acids and a structurally preferred glycine (motif D(S/T)(2)G) (Fig. 1A). Conservation of this phosphorylation site suggests that phosphorylation is a key determinant of SULTR1.2 activity as it is for SpoIIAA. The major difference between the modeled STAS domain and the SpoIIAA structure lies at the connection between the SULTR1.2 α1-helix and β3-sheet (Fig. 1A). At this position all the sulfate transporter STAS domains display variable lengths of amino acid insertions. This variable region lies at the periphery of the domain and is far away from the common phosphorylation region (Fig. 1B). The modeled STAS domain also differed from the SpoIIAA structure at the very C terminus. This region is highly variable in length and sequence even between the various sulfate transporters. At the end of the C-terminal α4-helix of its STAS domain, SULTR1.2 possesses a pair of cysteines (Cys-645, Cys-646) that is not strictly conserved in the paralogs and which is not present in SpoIIAA (Fig. 1A). The first cysteine (Cys-645) is fairly conserved between the Arabidopsis sulfate transporters, and it is substituted by a hydrophobic residue in the other sulfate transporters. The second cysteine (Cys-646) is specific for SULTR1.2, and it is substituted by polar amino acids in the other sulfate transporters. The putative role of these cysteines was analyzed in view of the current three-dimensional model. In conclusion, the structural analysis and modeling strongly suggest that the SULTR1.2 C-terminal STAS domain shares the SpoIIAA fold, although it shows low overall sequence identity with SpoIIAA (∼17% over 130 residues). The structural similarity is particularly high in the vicinity of the phosphorylation site despite the change from a conserved serine in SpoIIAA to the similar amino acid threonine in SULTR1.2. The STAS Domain Is Necessary for Sulfate Transport by SULTR1.2 in Yeast—The functional importance of the STAS domain for sulfate transport by SULTR1.2 was first checked. A SULTR1.2 mutant transporter with a large deletion of the last 131 amino acids of the protein corresponding to the entire STAS domain was constructed. This mutant transporter was expressed in the S. cerevisiae YSD1 mutant (19Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar), which is defective in its sulfate transport capacity and, thus, unable to grow in the presence of 100 μm sulfate as the sole sulfur source. Although expressing the SULTR1.2 wild-type transporter in YSD1 restored growth of YSD1 in the presence of 100 μm sulfate as the sole sulfur source, expressing the mutant transporter in YSD1 did not induce any visible growth of YSD1 (Fig. 2A). Measurements of [35S]sulfate influx showed that the mutant transporter was also unable to transport sulfate (Fig. 2B). These data show that the STAS domain is necessary for sulfate uptake by SULTR1.2 in yeast. Functional Importance of the Very C Terminus of the SULTR1.2 STAS Domain—Sequence comparison of the STAS domains of the A. thaliana sulfate transporters showed that 9 (of 12) of the STAS domains possess one cysteine residue at the position corresponding to SULTR1.2 Cys-645 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Depending on the transporter considered, the common cysteine residue is located 6–49 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the protein. The sequ"
https://openalex.org/W2007221979,"The sex pheromone of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, has been characterized as gentisyl quinone isovalerate. This cockroach is a major cause of allergic disease and serves as a mechanical vector of pathogens, making it one of the most important residential and food-associated pests worldwide. The sex pheromone-producing gland in adult females was identified in 1993, but thermal instability of the pheromone made characterization difficult. Now, using a new preparative gas chromatography approach coupled with electroantennographic detection, we have isolated and characterized the pheromone, which we term blattellaquinone, and confirmed the identification by chemical synthesis. The synthetic pheromone was active in behavioral assays and highly effective in field trapping tests, which suggest that it may provide a new tool in cockroach population detection, monitoring, and control."
https://openalex.org/W2086435366,"We aimed at understanding molecular events involved in the activation of a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, the thyrotropin receptor. We have focused on the transmembrane region and in particular on a network of polar interactions between highly conserved residues. Using molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis techniques we have identified residue Asn-7.49, of the NPxxY motif of TM 7, as a molecular switch in the mechanism of thyrotropin receptor (TSHr) activation. Asn-7.49 appears to adopt two different conformations in the inactive and active states. These two states are characterized by specific interactions between this Asn and polar residues in the transmembrane domain. The inactive gauche+ conformation is maintained by interactions with residues Thr-6.43 and Asp-6.44. Mutation of these residues into Ala increases the constitutive activity of the receptor by factors of ∼14 and ∼10 relative to wild type TSHr, respectively. Upon receptor activation Asn-7.49 adopts the trans conformation to interact with Asp-2.50 and a putatively charged residue that remains to be identified. In addition, the conserved Leu-2.46 of the (N/S)LxxxD motif also plays a significant role in restraining the receptor in the inactive state because the L2.46A mutation increases constitutive activity by a factor of ∼13 relative to wild type TSHr.

The incoming signal may arrive in the form of neurotransmitters, peptides, divalent cations, proteases, hormones, and sensory stimuli such as photons and gustatory or odorant molecules (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 3Kristiansen K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 21-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Atomic level details of a three-dimensional structure of a GPCR are only known for the inactive form of rhodopsin, the light photoreceptor protein of rod cells (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T.

Rhodopsin is formed by an extracellular N terminus, seven α-helices, which cross the cellular membrane (TM 1–TM 7) connected by hydrophilic loops, and a cytoplasmic C terminus containing an α-helix (HX 8) parallel to the cell membrane. The overall structure of the helical bundle seems common in the rhodopsin-like GPCR family because of the large number of conserved sequence patterns in these 7 TM segments (6Mirzadegan T. Benko G.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2003; 42: 2759-2767Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar): GN in TM 1, (N/S)LxxxD in TM 2, (D/E)RY in TM 3, CWxP in TM 6, and NPxxY(x)5,6F in TM 7 and HX 8, among others. Activation of GPCRs is commonly discussed in terms of the extended ternary complex model, which proposes an equilibrium between inactive and active states (7Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T.

Recent advances in the β2-adrenergic receptor have shown that agonist binding, leading to the active form of the receptor, is a multistep process (8Liapakis G. Chan W.C. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A.

Agonist binding or constitutively active mutations disrupt a series of constraining intramolecular interactions that keep the receptor in the inactive conformation. Recently identified constraints within the transmembrane domain are i) the conformational transition of Trp of the CWxP motif in TM 6 (11Shi L. Liapakis G. Xu R. Guarnieri F. Ballesteros J.A.

Release of these constraints induce rigid body motions of several if not all transmembrane helices (18Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

The thyrotropin receptor (TSHr), together with the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors, is a member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family of GPCRs. These receptors are characterized by a large N-terminal ectodomain, responsible for high affinity binding of the hormone and by a rhodopsin-like helical bundle, responsible for signal transduction (20Smits G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V. Richter C. Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2692-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). An interesting peculiarity of the TSHr is the wide spectrum of mutations capable of increasing its constitutive activity (22Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Hermans J. Rocmans P. Van Vliet G. Costagliola S. Rodien P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), offering a valuable tool to study molecular mechanisms of GPCR activation. We have shown that in the glycoprotein hormone receptor family an Asp residue in TM 6, maintains the highly conserved Asn (in the NPxxY motif in TM 7) in the inactive state through a complex hydrogen bond network (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar constraining interactions have been reported for the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (23Angelova K. Narayan P. Simon J.P. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Angelova K. Fanelli F. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32202-32213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, this Asn residue is crucial in the activation mechanism by both the natural agonist (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and activating mutations, including those affecting the (E/D)RY motif that release the ionic lock between TM 3 and 6 (25Claeysen S. Govaerts C. Lefort A. Van S e J. Costagliola S. Pardo L. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of this Asn to Ala in the C5a receptor abrogates receptor signaling (26Whistler J.L. Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Baranski T.J. von Zastrow M. Bourne H.R. Traffic. 2002; 3: 866-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, Asn of the NPxxY motif seems to be a key residue in the stabilization of both the inactive and active states of other receptors as well. We aim in this work to study the interactions of the Asn side chain in the inactive and active state of the TSHr by a combination of molecular modeling, functional assays, and site-directed mutagenesis. A model of the transmembrane domain of the TSHr plus helix 8 that expands parallel to the membrane was constructed by homology modeling using the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (PDB code 1L9H) as a template (14Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The molecular models for the mutant receptors containing the single D2.50N (standardized nomenclature 2Each residue is numbered according to the helix (1 through 7) in which it is located and to the position relative to the most conserved residue in that helix, arbitrarily assigned to 50. This allows easy comparison among residues in the transmembrane segments of different receptors. (27Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar)) or double D2.50N/N7.49D substitutions were built from the derived model of WT TSHr, by changing the atoms implicated in the amino acid substitutions by interactive computer graphics. These structures were placed in a rectangular box (∼60 × 72 × 70 Å in size) containing a lipid bilayer (60 molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and ∼7650 molecules of water in addition to the receptor structure), resulting in a final density of ∼1.0 g cm–3. The receptor-lipid bilayer systems were subjected to 500 iterations of energy minimization and then heated to 300 K in 15 ps. This was followed by an equilibration period (15–250 ps) and a production run (250–500 ps) at constant pressure with anisotropic scaling, using the particle mesh Ewald method to evaluate electrostatic interaction. During the processes of minimization, heating, and equilibration a positional restraint of 10 kcal mole–1Å–2 was applied to the Cα atoms of the receptor structure. This simulation protocol seems adequate to adapt the rhodopsin template to the structural requirements of the wild type and mutants receptor side chains, with the aim of understanding the local helix-helix interactions that keep the receptor in the inactive state. Structures were collected for analysis every 10 ps during the production run (25 structures/simulation). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run with the Sander module of AMBER 8 (28Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. II I Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Merz K.M. Wang B. Pearlman D.A.

The molecular electrostatic potentials were calculated with GRASP (30Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript SK+ was from Stratagene, plasmid pSVL was from Amersham Biosciences, restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Pfu Turbo polymerase from Stratagene. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) BA8, obtained by genetic immunization (31Costagliola S. Rodien P. Many M.C. Ludgate M. Vassart G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1458-1465PubMed Google Scholar), was directed against a conformational epitope on the TSHr ectodomain. Bovine TSH (bTSH) was from Sigma. Mutations were introduced in the hTSHr by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (32Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The primers are available upon request. Amplified fragments of SK+ hTSHr containing the appropriate mutations were subcloned in pSVL hTSHr cDNA (between XhoI and XbaI restriction sites). All constructs were amplified in DH5αF′-electrocompetent cells, and recombinant DNA from selected clones was purified and sequenced for confirmation of PCR-generated fragments. COS-7 cells were used for all transient expression experiments, which were performed according to two different protocols (20Smits G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V. Richter C. Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2692-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300,000 or 2 million cells were seeded in 3.5- or 10-cm Petri dishes, respectively, at day 1 and transfected based on the DEAE-dextran transfection method (32Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) at day 2. For the 3.5 dishes protocol, 2 days later cells were used for flow immunofluorometry and cAMP determinations; whereas for the 10-cm dishes at day 3, cells were detached by trypsinization, centrifuged, resuspended in 16 ml of culture medium and seeded in 24-well plates (1 ml/well). At day 5, cells were used for flow immunofluorometry and cAMP determinations. Duplicate dishes were used for each assay. Cells transfected with pSVL alone were always run as negative controls. Expression of wt and diverse hTSHr mutants was quantified by flow immunofluorometry with the mAb BA8 exactly as described preciously (31Costagliola S. Rodien P. Many M.C. Ludgate M. Vassart G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1458-1465PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence of 10,000 cells/tube was assayed by FACScan FLOW cytofluorometer (BD Biosciences). Cells transfected with pSVL alone and pSVL hTSHr were always run as negative and positive controls, respectively. For cAMP determinations, culture medium was removed 48 h after transfection and replaced by Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer for 30 min. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 60 min in fresh Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer supplemented with 25 μm phosphodiesterase inhibitor Rolipram (Laboratoire Logeais, Paris, France) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of bTSH (Sigma). The medium was discarded, replaced with 0.1 m HCl, and the extracts were dried under vacuum, resuspended in water, and diluted appropriately for cAMP measurements. Duplicate samples were assayed in all experiments; results are expressed in pmol/ml. Because of the linear relationship existing between basal cAMP accumulation and receptor cell surface expression (32Vlaeminck-Guillem V. Ho S.C. Rodien P. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), basal cAMP was normalized to cell surface expression for each of the constructs. To this end, specific cAMP accumulation (equal to cAMP of receptor-transfected cells–cAMP of the pSVL-transfected cells) is divided by the specific FACS value (equal to fluorescence of receptor-transfected cells–fluorescence of pSVL-transfected cells). Specific basal activity was defined as = (cAMP(receptor)–cAMP(pSVL))/(FACS(receptor)–FACS(pSVL)). The values were then normalized to the basal activity of the WT TSHr, arbitrarily set to 1. Concentration-effect curves were fitted with Prism v3.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Fig. 1a shows a detailed view of the Asp-2.50/Asn-7.49/Asp-6.44 environment of the molecular model of the TSHr in the inactive conformation obtained by unrestrained MD simulations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Importantly, the Wat1 set of water molecules found in the most recent structure of rhodopsin (1L9H) are included in the model (14Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). These structural waters mediate a number of interhelical interactions through the highly conserved Asp-2.50 and Asn-7.49 amino acids. The lack of coordination of the polar Asp-2.50 in both rhodopsin and the TSHr leads us to suggest that this set of water molecules is also present in the TSHr and is putatively involved in maintaining the inactive form of the receptor. Wat1a links TM 2, TM 3, and TM 7, acting as a hydrogen bond donor in the interaction between the side chain of Asp-2.50 and the backbone carbonyl of Ala-3.35 and as a hydrogen bond acceptor in the interaction with the side chain of Asn-7.45. Wat1b is located between TM 2 and TM 7, linking the backbone carbonyl of Asn-7.45, the backbone N–H amide of Asn-7.49, the side chain of Asp-2.50, and the side chain of Asn-7.49. As shown in Fig. 1a, a network of hydrogen bond interactions restrains the side chain of Asn-7.49 in the χ1 = gauche+ rotamer conformation, pointing toward TM 6. In particular, both Thr-6.43 and Asp-6.44 interact with Asn-7.49 through a water molecule (Wat1c). Wat1c is also bridging the side chain of Asn-7.49 and the backbone carbonyl of Leu-6.40. It is important to note that Wat1c is very mobile during the simulation and can also achieve, in other snapshots, interactions with other residues like Thr-6.43 or Ser-3.39. These proposed networks of interactions partly diverge from the previously described model (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) because of the presence of these functional water molecules. Finally, Asn-7.45 is interacting with Asp-6.44, Cys-6.47, and Wat1a, whereas Tyr-7.42 is hydrogen bonding, via the OH group, one of the Oδ atoms of Asp-6.44 and the OγH group of Ser-3.36 (not depicted for clarity). A detailed description of the role of these side chains in maintaining the inactive conformation of the homologous follicle-stimulating hormone receptor has recently been published (33Montanelli L. Van Durme J.J. Smits G. Bonomi M. Rodien P. Devor E.J. Moffat-Wilson K. Pardo L. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2061-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that upon receptor activation the side chain of Asn-7.49 undergoes a conformational transition from gauche+ to trans (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 1b shows the computer model of the TSHr where the side chain conformation of Asn-7.49 has been initially modified from its inactive gauche+ conformation to a trans conformation. The recently obtained structure of metarhodopsin I has revealed that early stages of activation does not involve large rigid body movements of helices but local side chain relocations (12Ruprecht J.J. Mielke T. Vogel R. Villa C. Schertler G.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, this modeling exercise only aims at exploring the possible interactions of Asn-7.49 in the active state of the receptor, which could correspond to early stages of the activation process when side chain relocations have not yet been translated into major structural changes. Regardless of these limitations, it seems clear that the conformational transition of Asn-7.49 allows for a direct interaction with Asp-2.50. As a consequence the polar Oδ atom of Asn-7.49 reorients toward the intracellular side and becomes accessible. During the simulations the positively charged side chain of Arg-6.36, highly conserved within the glycoprotein hormone receptor family, hydrogen bonds the Oδ atom of Asn-7.49 (not shown). Fig. 1, a–d, also shows the position of the highly conserved side chain of Leu-2.46. The role of the residues theoretically predicted to interact with Asn-7.49 in its “inactive” or “active” rotamer conformation was experimentally tested by site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). The following mutants were engineered.Table IFunctional properties of WT TSH and mutant receptorsFACSBasal cAMP accumulationEmaxEC50% Expression of WTRaw valuesSCA10 mIU/ml or plateaumIU/mlMeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.MeanS.E.TSHr WT10027.903.241.00196.8124.450.190.10L2.46A121.3315.991.4813.060.8682.9710.240.120.0012L2.46I355.738.220.780.780.01115.5125.990.22—L2.46W181.973.271.740.100.069.551.306.91—D2.50N1156.965.650.970.180.0973.5315.380.850.12D2.50A250.947.601.130.280.1638.8414.06NDNDR6.36A91—9.45—0.11—150.23—0.21—T6.43A403.96116.8617.299.711.15285.4878.640.510.21D6.44A26—125.84—13.58—246.70—NDNDD6.44N96—44.33—1.10—328.74—NDNDN7.49D24—97.37—11.32—333.59—NDNDD2.50N/D6.44N11915.158.402.170.110.0369.029.33NDNDD2.50N/D6.44A749.4458.281.632.260.0397.9822.68NDNDD2.50A/D6.44A155.1618.771.855.391.4938.114.28NDNDD2.50N/N7.49D497.475.371.360.110.03112.7650.46NDNDD2.50N/D6.44A/N7.49D283.6939.756.264.620.4272.008.10NDNDD6.44A/N7.49D204.4878.5516.3215.903.05179.0332.87NDNDT6.43A/D6.44N69—78.53—2.84—282.55—NDND Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Concentration-response curves.A, level of cell surface expression of the receptors in transfected COS cells determined by FACS.

Thus, we engineered the D6.44A, D6.44N, T6.43A, and the double T6.43A/D6.44N mutant receptors (Figs. 2 and 3). These mutants are expressed at the 26–96% range (Table I and Figs. 2A and 3A). D6.44N functions as WT TSHr in terms of constitutive activity, whereas D6.44A increases basal activity by a factor of ∼14 (Table I) as was previously shown (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Notably, T6.43A also increases basal activity by a factor of ∼10 relative to WT receptor that is comparable in magnitude to the D6.44A mutant receptor (Table I). Strikingly, with a specific constitutive activity (or SCA) of ∼3 (see Table I) the double T6.43A/D6.44N mutant is less constitutive than T6.43A (SCA of ∼10) but higher than the WT-like D6.44N mutant (SCA of 1.1). This suggests that Thr-6.43 has a more significant role in constraining the side chain conformation of Asn-7.49 in the presence of Asp-6.44 than Asn-6.44. All the mutants are able to respond to bTSH. Asp-2.50 and Asn-7.49 Mutants—The process of TSHr activation appears to require the release of Asn-7.49, from the interactions with the residues in TM 6, toward Asp-2.50 (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, single D2.50A, D2.50N, and N7.49D, and double D2.50N/N7.49D mutant receptors were engineered (Table I and Figs. 2 and 3) to explore the hypothesis of a direct Asp-2.50**Asn-7.49 interaction in the active state of the TSHr. These mutants are expressed at the 24–115% range (Table I and Fig. 2A). D2.50A and D2.50N show a loss in basal activity (Table I and Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the typical concentration-response curve illustrated in Fig. 3C for the D2.50N construct shows higher EC50 and lower Emax values than WT receptor. Thus, Asp-2.50 seems crucial to stabilize the active state of the receptor. On the other side N7.49D shows a significant increase in constitutive activity, reaching more than 11 times that of wild type TSHr (Table I and Fig. 2C) as was previously shown (13Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S. Ballesteros J.A. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Notably, addition of the D2.50N mutation on the N7.49D background, making the D2.50N/N7.49D double mutant, reverses completely the phenotype to levels of constitutive activity even below wild type-like behavior (Table I and Fig. 2C). Moreover, these mutants efficiently respond to bTSH (Fig. 2B). Adding D6.44A to the mutant receptors already containing Asp at the 7.49 position (N7.49D versus N7.49D/D6.44A, D2.50N/N7.49D versus D2.50N/N7.49D/D6.44A) increases constitutive activity (SCA of ∼11 versus ∼16 and ∼0 versus ∼5; Table I and Fig. 2C). This suggests an additional role for Asp-6.44 than solely maintaining Asn-7.49 in an inactive state. The charged Asp-6.44 could also modulate the conformation of other polar side chains with possible involvement in the activation mechanism. Putative candidates are Ser-3.39, Asn-7.45, or/and Tyr-7.42. The Arg-6.36 Mutant—Arg-6.36 was replaced by Ala to explore the possibility of a direct interaction between the Asp-2.50**Asn-7.49 pair and Arg-6.36 in the active state of the receptor as suggested during MD simulations. The R6.36A mutant exhibits reduced constitutive activity relative to wild type TSHr (Fig. 2C), but the receptor can be activated by the extracellular ligand (Fig. 2B). This data disregards the possibility of Arg-6.36 as the counterpart to the Asp-2.50**Asn-7.49 pair in the active state of the receptor. Leu-2.46 Mutants—We also performed the L2.46A, L2.46I, and L2.46W mutations to investigate the role of this highly conserved Leu residue, which belongs to a conserved hydrophobic layer (34Okada T. Palczewski K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it is located in the proximity of Asn-7.49 in the TSHr molecular model. The cell surface expression of the L2.46A mutant is only 12% of WT receptor (Table I and Fig. 3A). L2.46A shows a significant increase in basal activity when normalized to surface expression (Fig. 3B). The concentration-response curve illustrated in Fig. 3D shows that L2.46A is activated efficiently by"

An attractive mechanism for expression of long term depression is the loss of surface AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazale-4-propionate) receptors at synapses. Here we show that a threshold level of NMDA receptor activation must be exceeded to trigger a stable loss of AMPA receptors from the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons. NMDA also causes displacement of protein kinase A from the synapse, and inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) activity mimics the NMDA-induced loss of surface AMPA receptors. PKA is targeted to the synapse by an interaction with the A kinase-anchoring protein, AKAP79/150. Disruption of the PKA-AKAP interaction is sufficient to cause a long-lasting reduction in synaptic AMPA receptors in cultured neurons. In addition, we demonstrate in hippocampal slices that displacement of PKA from AKADs occludes synaptically induced long term depression. These data indicate that synaptic anchoring of PKA through association with AKAPs plays an important role in the regulation of AMPA receptor surface expression and synaptic plasticity.

Kauer J.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of postsynaptic protein kinase A (PKA) substrates appears to be both necessary and sufficient for expression of LTD in area CA1 of the hippocampus. For example, postsynaptic inhibition of PKA depresses synaptic transmission and occludes LTD (3Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and reversal of LTD with high frequency synaptic stimulation (dedepression) is selectively blocked by PKA inhibitors (4Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In addition, LTD correlates with the persistent (>1 h) dephosphorylation of a PKA site on AMPA receptors, Ser845 of the GluR1 subunit (4Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 5Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F.

Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to contribute directly to LTD expression.It is now clear that another consequence of NMDA receptor activation is clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors (8Beattie E.C.

Although these data strongly suggest that AMPA receptor internalization also contributes to the expression of LTD, several questions remain. First, it is surprising to note that NMDA receptor activation has not yet been shown to cause a stable long term reduction in surface-expressed AMPA receptors. In fact, the work from Ehlers (10Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) shows that NMDA receptor activation causes only a transient internalization of AMPA receptors (10Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). For LTD to be expressed by a reduction in the number of AMPA receptors, it must be possible for NMDA receptor activation to trigger a persistent change. Second, it is not clear what role dephosphorylation of PKA substrates plays in this process. Several findings suggest that the state of phosphorylation of Ser845 of GluR1 may regulate its surface expression. Recent work shows that PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 is necessary for synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors (12Esteban J.A. Shi S-H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), whereas AMPA receptors internalized in response to NMDA have been shown to be dephosphorylated at GluR1 Ser845 (10Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice with targeted serine to alanine mutations at Ser845 and Ser831 of GluR1 are deficient in AMPA receptor endocytosis (13Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Gallagher M. Huganir R.L. Cell. 2003; 112: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether dephosphorylation of PKA substrates is sufficient for decreased AMPA receptor surface expression (as it is for LTD), and if so, what mechanisms account for such dephosphorylation. One of the goals of the current study was to address these questions.Specificity in PKA signaling arises in part from the association of the enzyme with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which function to target PKA to specific substrates at precise subcellular locations (14Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 15Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E203-E206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At the postsynaptic density, PKA is tethered to the neuronal anchoring protein, AKAP79/150 (human/rodent) (16Carr D.W.

Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Through association with the synaptic scaffolding MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins, AKAP79/150 and its associated enzymes (PKA, protein kinase C, and PP2B) are directed to both NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors (17Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AKAP79/150 has been shown to regulate AMPA receptor phosphorylation and function (17Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 18Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L.

Recent experiments have shown that the synaptic localization of AKAP79/150 itself can be altered by NMDA receptor activation and PP2B signaling cascades, suggesting that AKAP79/150 may play an important role in synaptic plasticity (21Gomez L.L. Alam S. Smith K.E. Horne E. Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7027-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another aim of this study was to test whether PKA-AKAP interactions are important in regulating AMPA receptor surface expression, synaptic transmission, and LTD.Here we show that an NMDA treatment known to cause LTD in hippocampal slices (“chemLTD”) causes a long term reduction in surface AMPA receptor expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, the chemLTD treatment also causes displacement of PKA from the synaptic compartment. We find that inhibiting PKA or disrupting anchoring of PKA to AKAPs is sufficient to reduce surface expression of AMPA receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that the disruption of PKA-AKAP interactions in hippocampal slices leads to a depression of synaptic transmission that occludes synaptically evoked LTD. These data demonstrate a critical role for PKA and AKAPs in the regulation of surface expression of AMPA receptors and LTD.MATERIALS AND METHODSDissociated Hippocampal Cell Culture—All of the rats were housed either in the Brown University Animal Care Facility or Vollum Institute Animal Care Facility, and all of the procedures were approved by institutional animal care and use committees. The hippocampus was removed from P0-P2 Long-Evans rats, exposed to papain (20 units/ml) at 37 °C for 60 min, and dissociated by trituration. Cells were plated onto polylysine-coated (1 mg/ml) dishes. For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated at 75,000 cells/ml (1.5 ml/dish). For biochemistry, cells were plated at 500,000 cells/ml. Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, B-27 nutrient supplement, and penicillin-streptomycin.Immunocytochemistry—Following experimental treatment, low density cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose for 5 min. Cultures were then rinsed 2 × 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 60 min. Cultures were labeled with antibodies against synapsin 1 (1:1000, Chemicon AB1543), synaptophysin (1:500, Chemicon MAB368), GluR2 (1:300 MAB397, Chemicon), and GluR1 (1:300, Upstate Biotechnology, 06-306) overnight at 4 °C. Cultures were then washed 2 × 20 min and exposed to the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:300, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Cultures were washed 2 × 20 min and coverslipped in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).Image Analysis—All of the analysis was performed blind to history of the culture. Cultures were visualized using a Olympus Fluo-view Confocal microscope equipped with a ×60 objective. Images were analyzed in NIH Image 1.63. Puncta were defined as regions of staining with greater than 2-fold intensity relative to background staining on neurons. Synaptic GluR2 or GluR1 puncta were defined as puncta with overlapping synaptophysin or synapsin 1 staining.Biochemical Measurements of Surface Receptor Levels—Detailed methods for biotinylation experiments were described previously (22Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Following treatment, 7–14-day-old high density cultured hippocampal neurons were placed on ice to inhibit receptor trafficking and washed twice with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm): 124 NaCl; 5 KCl; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 26 NaHCO3; 0.8 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2; and 10 dextrose saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Cultures were then incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamide)hexanoate) (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. Cultures were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotin reaction. Cultures were lysed in 300 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (200 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of 50% NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. NeutrAvidin-bound proteins were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled. Quantitative Western blots were performed on biotinylated (surface) proteins using anti-GluR1 C-terminal antibodies (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology) and transferrin receptor antibodies (1:1000; monoclonal clone H68.4 Zymed Laboratories Inc. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences or Pierce), captured on autoradiography film (Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL or Kodak Biomax film). Digital images produced by densitometric scans of autoradiographs on a ScanJet IIcx (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) with DeskScan II software (Hewlett Packard) were quantified using NIH Image 1.61 or 1.63 software. Previous control experiments confirmed that the intracellular protein actin was not biotinylated in this assay (n = 3). Care was always taken to work within the linear range of this assay.Synaptosomal Membrane Preparation—Homogenate and P3 synaptosomal membrane fractions were prepared from cortical neuron cultures to increase the yield of protein (10Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Occipital cortices of P0-P2 Long-Evans rat pups were rapidly dissected in ice-cold Neurobasal A media (Invitrogen) containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml kynurenic acid to prevent excitotoxicity. Neurons were plated at high density (530 cells/mm2) in polylysine-coated dishes. Cells were fractionated at 16–20 days in vitro. Neurons were pelleted and homogenized in HEPES-buffered sucrose (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1:100 phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I & II, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem)) in a glass-glass homogenizer using 50 even strokes and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and large debris (P1). The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the synaptosome fraction (P2). The P2 pellet was washed in HEPES-buffered sucrose and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the washed synaptosome fraction (P2′). P2′ pellets were lysed in 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the synaptosomal membrane fraction (P3). Homogenate and P3 fractions were solubilized in 1% SDS, the protein concentration was determined, and the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting.Electrophysiology—Long-Evans rats aged P14-P20 (Charles River) were deeply anesthetized with an injection of Beuthanasia-D. Following the disappearance of corneal reflexes and a tail pinch response, the rat was decapitated according to U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and Brown University animal care guidelines. The brain was rapidly removed and placed into ice-cold dissection buffer consisting of the following: 212 mm sucrose; 10 mm glucose; 2.6 mm KCl; 1.23 mm NaH2PO4; 26 mm NaHCO3; 9 mm MgCl2; and 1 mm CaCl2. Slices of hippocampus (350 μm) were prepared using a vibrating microtome, and connections from CA3 and subiculum were severed to prevent epileptiform activity. Slices were transferred to a chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid that consisted of the following: 124 mm NaCl; 2.5 mm KCl; 1.23 mm NaH2PO4; 26 mm NaHCO3; 1 mm MgCl2; 2.2 mm CaCl2; and 10 mm dextrose. Slices were allowed to recover at room temperature for a minimum of 1 h prior to recording.For recordings, a slice was transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber and perfused with room temperature (25 °C) or warmed (30 °C) oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid that also contained 50 μm picrotoxin to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid, type A responses. Temperature differences did not affect results, so the data from the two temperatures were pooled. Individual CA1 pyramidal neurons were visualized using an inverted microscope (Nikon) outfitted with a ×40 and 0.8 numerical aperture objective and IR-DIC optics. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed using patch pipettes made of thick walled glass (Sutter, 1.5 mm outer density and 0.86 mm inner density) and filled with internal solution containing the following: 107 mm d-gluconic acid; 107 mm CsOH; 5 mm QX-314 chloride; 0.2 mm EGTA; 20 mm HEPES; 3.7 mm NaCl; 4 mm Mg-ATP; 0.3 mm sodium-GTP; and 10 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.2. Pipette resistances were 3–5 (Fig. 7A) or 7–10 megohms for recordings that required a smaller tip diameter (Fig. 7B). Experiments were performed using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B), and data were acquired and analyzed using a system from DataWave Technologies (Boulder, CO). Experiments were included in the data set if the base-line period was stable, series resistance was stable (<±20%) for the duration of a recording, and monosynaptic EPSCs were evoked. Experiments were also rejected if Rs > 35 megohms. EPSCs were elicited by delivering a 100-μs current pulse with a 2-contact cluster electrode (FHC, 2 × 25-μm Pt/Ir) placed in stratum radiatum. Test stimuli were delivered at 0.05 Hz, and stimulation intensity was titrated to elicit reliably a monosynaptic EPSC with few failures. The test potential for all of the recordings was –70 mV. LTD was induced by pairing a 1-Hz stimulation with membrane depolarization to –40 mV for 5 min (23Selig D.K. Hjelmstad G.O. Herron C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). EPSCs were analyzed by measuring the peak amplitude of the response. For statistical comparisons of LTD, data were normalized to the average of a base-line period at 15 min prior to the onset of the pairing protocol and then compared with responses 25–30 min following the completion of the pairing protocol. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Stearated Ht31 and Ht31p were used at 1 μm and were interleaved with no peptide controls. Ht31 and Ht31p were purchased from Promega. All of the other reagents were from Sigma.Statistical Analysis—Statistics were computed using Prism 3.0. Unless otherwise noted, statistical differences were detected by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferoni comparisons between groups.RESULTSPrevious experiments have shown that brief application of NMDA (20 μm, 3 min) initiates LTD in hippocampal slices that persists for at least 1 h (5Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Using a biotinylation assay, we tested whether this protocol could cause a long term reduction in surface levels of AMPA receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. Following NMDA treatment (20 μm, 3 min), cultures were incubated at 37 °C for various times (5, 30, or 60 min) to allow for receptor trafficking. Trafficking was halted by placing cells on ice, and the surface receptors were labeled with biotin (22Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 24Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared, and biotinylated surface proteins were isolated by NeutrAvidin precipitation. Western blots of surface GluR1 showed that NMDA application caused a rapid reduction in surface AMPA receptors, which was stable for at least 60 min (Fig. 1, A, top panel, S, and B). Total cellular levels of GluR1 were unchanged (Fig. 1A, top panel, T). NMDA did not affect the surface levels of the transferrin receptor, a protein known to be continually recycled, demonstrating a relatively specific action on AMPA receptors (Fig. 1A, lower panel, TfR). Surface GluR1 levels were reduced to 48 ± 6% control levels (untreated) 60 min following NMDA treatment (Fig. 1B; p < 0.01; n = 12). We found qualitatively similar results with cortical neuron cultures (surface GluR1 levels were reduced to 57 ± 4% control levels; n = 5).Fig. 1ChemLTD NMDA treatment causes a rapid and long-lasting decrease in surface GluR1.A, cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with NMDA (20 μm, 3 min), and surface receptors were biotinylated 5, 30, or 60 min later. NMDA causes a rapid loss of surface (S) GluR1 but no change in total (T) receptor levels. Levels of the transferrin receptor (TfR) were not affected. B, NMDA reduced surface/total GluR1 ratio to 63 ± 7% control levels within 5 min (n = 5), to 53 ± 6% at 30 min (n = 5), and to 48 ± 6% by 60 min (n = 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported that a very similar NMDA treatment (20 μm, 1–2 min) causes only a transient internalization of AMPA receptors in cultured cortical neurons, lasting <30 min. Therefore, we wondered whether a threshold level of NMDA receptor activation must be exceeded to induce a stable loss of surface receptors. Consistent with this notion, we found that shortening the duration of NMDA treatment from 3 to 1 min (Fig. 2, A and B) or decreasing the concentration of NMDA from 20 to 10 μm failed to induce a significant loss of surface AMPA receptors measured at 60 min (Fig. 2B). This dose dependence is reminiscent of previous findings that chemLTD in hippocampal slices could not be induced by lower NMDA concentrations (5Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar).Fig. 2A high threshold of NMDA receptor activation is required to induce a long term reduction in surface GluR1.A, total (T) and surface (S) GluR1 levels were measured 60 min following NMDA (20 μm). A 1-min NMDA treatment induces little or no change, whereas a 3-min treatment greatly reduces surface GluR1. B, surface GluR1 was decreased 60 min following the chemLTD NMDA treatment (20 μm, 3 min; 45 ± 11% controls; n = 4; *, p < 0.04 versus control, Student's t test). In contrast, GluR1 levels were unaffected following a more brief (20 μm, 1 min) NMDA treatment (92 ± 8% controls; n = 4) or treatment with lower concentration of NMDA (10 μm, 3 min; 88 ± 11% control; n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LTD can be blocked by the application of adenylyl cyclase activators, such as forskolin, or the cell-soluble cAMP analogue, Sp-cAMPS (3Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). LTD is also reversed by introducing these compounds postsynaptically, indicating that sustained dephosphorylation of postsynaptic PKA substrates is necessary for LTD expression. If NMDA-induced reduction of surface AMPA receptors similarly requires persistent dephosphorylation of PKA substrates, the effects of NMDA on surface expression should be reversed by activating PKA. To test this hypothesis, we treated cultures with NMDA (20 μm, 3 min), waited 30 min to allow for the net loss of surface AMPA receptors, and then treated the cultures with forskolin (Fig. 3A, forsk; 50 μm, 30 min). Following this treatment protocol, cultures were immediately biotinylated and surface GluR1 levels were quantified. As shown in Fig. 3, chasing NMDA with forskolin restored surface AMPA receptor expression nearly to control levels (Fig. 3, B and C; 83 ± 8% control; n = 8) compared with NMDA treatment alone (48 ± 7% control). However, NMDA + forskolin still causes a significant loss of surface AMPA receptors compared with forskolin alone (reduced to 76 ± 5% forskolin alone control; p < 0.04). This percent reduction is less than but not significantly different from what is observed with NMDA alone.Fig. 3PKA regulates surface AMPA receptor levels.A, schematic of the experimental protocol. Cultures were treated with NMDA for 3 min, returned to the incubator for 27 min, and then treated with forskolin (forsk) to activate PKA. B, representative immunoblot for surface GluR1 showing that forskolin reverses the NMDA-induced loss of surface GluR1. C, NMDA reduces surface GluR1 to 48 ± 7% controls. Forskolin significantly reverses this effect (83 ± 8%; n = 8; *, p < 0.05 versus NMDA alone, Student's t test). D, blocking PKA activity with Rp-cAMPS (Rp) causes a reduction in surface GluR1. E, Rp-cAMPs significantly reduces surface GluR1 to 82 ± 6% control levels. (n = 6; *, p < 0.05 versus control, Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since postsynaptic inhibition of PKA has been shown to depress synaptic transmission and occlude LTD (3Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we next examined whether inhibiting PKA activity might be sufficient to reduce expression of surface AMPA receptors. We treated cultures with Rp-cAMPS (100 μm), an analogue of cAMP that inhibits PKA, and found a significant reduction in surface GluR1 levels to 82 ± 6% controls (p < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 3, D and E). These data are consistent with the idea that persistent dephosphorylation of PKA substrates causes a stable reduction in AMPA receptor surface expression.We hypothesized that displacement of PKA from the synapse might be one mechanism to account for such persistent dephosphorylation. To test this theory, we subjected cultured cortical neurons to the chemLTD treatment, biochemically fractionated the extracts to isolate total homogenate and synaptosomal membrane fractions, and assessed the fractions for changes in the levels of PKA (Fig. 4). In total homogenates, NMDA caused no change in the levels of the PKA regulatory subunit (Fig. 4A, PKA-RIIβ; control 100 ± 11%; NMDA 93 ± 18%; p > 0.7; n = 8) or catalytic subunit (Fig. 4C, PKA-cat, control 100 ± 13%; NMDA 94 ± 14%; p = 0.7; n = 6). However, in synaptic fractions, NMDA treatment caused significant reductions in both PKA regulatory subunit IIβ (Fig. 4B) and catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 4D). Following NMDA treatment, synaptic PKA regulatory subunit IIβ levels were reduced to 72 ± 5% control levels (Fig. 4B; control 100 ± 3%; p < 0.01; n = 10). Similarly, synaptic PKA catalytic subunit levels were reduced to 71 ± 9% control levels (Fig. 4D; control 100 ± 5%; p < 0.01; n = 7). These data indicate that the chemLTD NMDA treatment causes a displacement of the PKA holoenzyme from synaptic sites, providing a potential mechanism for maintained dephosphorylation of its substrates.Fig. 4ChemLTD NMDA treatment causes displacement of PKA from synaptosomal membrane fractions.A, NMDA treatment causes no change in total levels of PKA regulatory subunit IIβ (PKA-RIIβ) in neuronal homogenates (93 ± 18% control, cont). B, in contrast, NMDA causes a significant reduction in levels of PKA-RIIβ in synaptic (P3) fractions (72 ± 5% control; *, p < 0.01 versus control, Student's t test). C, similarly, NMDA treatment causes no change in levels of catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-cat) in total homogenates (94 ± 14% control). D, in synaptic fractions, however, NMDA reduces PKA-cat to 71 ± 9% control levels (*,"

Dl plays a central role in the establishment of dorsoventral polarity during early embryogenesis, whereas Dif mediates the Toll receptor-dependent antifungal immune response in adult Drosophila. The absence of a Dif ortholog in mosquito genomes suggests that Dl may play its functional role in the mosquito Toll-mediated innate immune responses. We have cloned and molecularly characterized the gene homologous to Drosophila Dl and to Anopheles gambiae REL1 (Gambif1) from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, named AaREL1. AaREL1 alternative transcripts encode two isoforms, AaREL1-A and AaREL1-B. Both transcripts are enriched during embryogenesis and are inducible by septic injury in larval and female mosquitoes. AaREL1 and AaREL2 (Aedes Relish) selectively bind to different κB motifs from insect immune gene promoters. Ectopic expression of AaREL1-A in both Drosophila mbn-2 cells and transgenic flies specifically activates Drosomycin and results in increased resistance against the fungus Beauveria bassiana. AaREL1-B acted cooperatively with AaREL1-A to enhance the immune gene activation in Aag-2 cells. The RNA interference knock-outs revealed that AaREL1 affected the expression of Aedes homologue of Drosophila Serpin-27A and mediated specific antifungal immune response against B. bassiana. These results indicate that the homologue of Dl, but not that of Dif, is a key regulator of the Toll antifungal immune pathway in A. aegypti female mosquitoes.

Mosquitoes transmit many diseases, including malaria, which is a particularly threatening disease that is responsible for over two million deaths each year (1Beier J.C. Annu. Rev.

Diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses, most importantly Dengue fever, are reaching disastrous levels in Central and South America and Southeast Asia (3Beaty B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lymphatic filariasis, a nematode-based disease transmitted by mosquitoes, affects millions of people in tropical regions of the world (5Wattam A.R. Christensen B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The major reasons for this tragic situation are the unavailability of effective vaccines for malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases and the lack of insecticides and drug resistance to vectors and pathogens, respectively (6Curtis C.F.

Many genes and their products involved in mosquito innate immunity have been identified and characterized either independently or on the basis of their relationships to known immune genes of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. The genomic DNA sequences of Anopheles gambiae, a major disease vector involved in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa, have been revealed, and they encompass more than 278 million base pairs, which suggests the presence of ∼14,000 protein-encoding genes (8Holt R.A.

Science. 2002; 298: 129-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Of these, 242 A. gambiae genes from 18 gene families have been implicated in innate immunity by comparative genomic analysis to the Drosophila immune systems (9Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G.

The mosquito immune genes involved in recognition, signal modulation, and effector systems diverge widely from those in Drosophila. In addition, these families of immune factors have undergone significant expansion during the evolution of mosquitoes, which possibly reflects different selection pressures to a variety of pathogens encountered in the distinct lifestyles of these insects. However, the components of two principal immune transduction pathways, the Toll and IMD, have principally been conserved between these two insects. This points to the evolutionary requirement of preserving the integrity of key factors in intracellular immune signal transduction and gene activation pathways (9Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G.

In Drosophila, three Rel/NF-κB molecules, Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif), 1The abbreviations used are: Dif, Dorsal-related immunity factor; AMP, antimicrobial peptide; RNAi, RNA interference; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; UTR, untranslated region; CTD, C-terminal domain; NLS, nucleus localization signal; RHD, Rel homology domain. 1The abbreviations used are: Dif, Dorsal-related immunity factor; AMP, antimicrobial peptide; RNAi, RNA interference; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; UTR, untranslated region; CTD, C-terminal domain; NLS, nucleus localization signal; RHD, Rel homology domain. Dorsal (Dl), and Relish, affect the expression of numerous immune genes, including those encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (for review, see Refs. 10Hultmark D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar and 11Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). These Rel/NF-κB molecules are involved in two distinct innate immune pathways, the Toll pathway, which is mediated by Dl and Dif and responds primarily to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections, and the IMD pathway, which is regulated by Relish and is predominantly directed against Gram-negative bacteria. In the Toll-signaling pathway, Dif stimulates the production of the antifungal factor Drosomycin (12Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In loss-of-function mutants affecting the Toll signaling pathway, the inducibility of Drosomycin in immune-challenged adults is severely compromised, whereas those of Defensin, Cecropin, and Attacin are reduced to a lesser extent. In contrast, the expression of Diptericin, Drosocin, and Metchnikowin are completely unaffected (13Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffman J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, 14Levashina E.A. Ohresser D. Lemaitre B. Imler J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In Drosophila relish mutants, the induction of immune defense is severely reduced, and insects become extremely sensitive to bacterial and fungal infection (15Hedengren M. Asling B. Dushay M.S. Ando I. Ekengren S. Wihlborg M. Hultmark D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Immune effector genes under the regulation of Relish include Cecropin, Diptericin, Attacin, Defensin, and Metchnikowin (15Hedengren M. Asling B. Dushay M.S. Ando I. Ekengren S. Wihlborg M. Hultmark D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Leulier F. Rodriguez A. Khush R.S. Chen P. Abrams J.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Recent microarray studies have shown that in addition to AMP genes many other immune genes are regulated cooperatively or independently by the Toll and IMD pathways (17De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). These genes include recognition molecules like peptidoglycan recognition proteins and Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein, which are components involved in both the IMD and Toll pathways; the protease cascade proteins; and putative components of the phenoloxidase or blood clotting pathways. Dl, the first insect member of NF-κB family, was identified in a screen for genes required for Drosophila embryonic development. Dl is a key regulator in determining dorsoventral polarity (18Drier E.A. Steward R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A gradient of nuclear Dl spatially restricts the expression of zygotic genes along the dorsoventral axis and functions both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor (19Pan D. Courey A.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The remarkable structural and functional similarities between the mechanisms of activation of Dl during Drosophila morphogenesis and NF-κB during the mammalian acute phase response have implicated Dl and Dif in the host defense of Drosophila (20Reichhart J.M. Georgel P. Meister M. Lemaitre B. Kappler C. Hoffmann J.A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1218-1224PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ip Y.T. Reach M. Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Cai H. Gonzales-Crespo S. Tatei K. Levine M. Cell. 1993; 75: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, two independent studies clearly show that Dif, the possible duplicator of the Dl gene during Drosophila evolution, is the essential regulator of the Drosophila immune Toll pathway. The rescue experiments of Drosophila Dl and Dif double mutants have shown that the ectopic expression of Dif without Dl is sufficient to mediate the induction of Drosomycin (22Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic epistasis studies with Dif mutant flies have demonstrated that Dif mediates the Toll-dependent control of the inducibility of the Drosomycin gene (23Rutschmann S. Jung A.C. Hetru C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Toll pathway regulates many aspects of the immune response (for review, see Ref. 24Brennan C.A. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 457-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition to activating antifungal defenses, this pathway is also required for resistance against Gram-positive bacteria, for regulation of the melanization cascade and blood cell proliferation. Drosophila mutants that constitutively activate Toll pathway, such as necrotic, Toll10b, and cactus, all show hemocyte phenotype with overreactive blood cells that form melanotic masses (25Qiu P. Pan P.C. Govind S. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the cellular response to parasites (26Canton Y. Nappi A.J. Immunogenetics. 2001; 52: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the A. gambiae genome sequence harbors only two NF-κB genes, REL1 (gambif1) and REL2, which are homologues of Drosophila Dl and Relish, respectively (9Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G.

Biol. 2004; 207: 2551-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The A. gambiae Dl homologue Gambif1 (now called REL1) can bind to κB motifs on the promoters of Drosophila, Diptericin, and Cecropin and activate transcription of a reporter gene under the control of the Diptericin κB motif in cell culture studies (28Brillas-Mury C. Charlesworth A. Gross I. Richamn A. Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4691-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lack of a Dif ortholog in mosquitoes raises a question about the difference between their immune responses and those of adult Drosophila and about the immune function of mosquito homologue of Dl (REL1). In particular, it has not been demonstrated in vivo whether mosquito REL1 serves as a functional Dif analog in adult mosquitoes. In this report, we have cloned and characterized a homologue to Drosophila Dl from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, which we named AaREL1. In vitro comparative binding studies, transfection assays in both Drosophila mbn-2 cells and mosquito A. aegypti Aag-2 cells, the transgenic overexpression in flies, and in vivo studies by the RNAi knock-outs in mosquitoes provide conclusive evidence to implicate AaREL1 as the key activator of the Toll-mediated antifungal immune pathway in adult female mosquitoes. Isolation of cDNA and Genomic DNA Clones and RACE—A PCR product was obtained from genomic DNA by degenerate primers based on the conserved region of the Rel homology domain (RHD) from Drosophila Dl and Anopheles REL1 (gambif1). The following primers were used, AaREL1-R2 (5′-CAGTG(T/C)GCCAA(A/G)AAGAAGGA-3′) and AaREL1-R-A (5′-GGCAATCTTCTCGCACAGCA-3′). This PCR fragment was subcloned using a TA cloning kit (Novagen) and was then utilized as a probe to screen the Lambda ZAPII cDNA library prepared from previtellogenic female A. aegypti mosquitoes. Six clones were isolated and sequenced from both the 5′- and 3′-ends. Based on sequencing and restriction mapping analyses, the six clones were subdivided into two groups. The longest representative of each cDNA group, the D4 and D6 cDNA clones, were fully sequenced from both strands. The 5′- and 3′-ends of D4 and D6 cDNA clones were identified by the RACE system (Invitrogen). Two overlapping PCR products spanning 13,355 bp in length were isolated using the expand long template PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). These PCR fragments were subcloned using a TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then sequenced. The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base (accession numbers AY748242 for AaREL1-A cDNA, AY748243 for AaREL1-B cDNA, and AY748244 for genomic DNA). Northern Hybridization and RT-PCR—Adult 2- or 3-day-old A. aegypti females were injected with a stationary phase culture of Enterobacter cloacae and/or Micrococcus cloacae. For the stage-specific study, adult males, females, and fourth instar larvae were collected with or without bacterial challenge. The vitellogenic mosquitoes were collected 1 and 2 days after blood feeding. The unfertilized eggs were obtained by dissecting ovaries from mosquitoes 3 days after blood feeding, whereas fertilized eggs were collected 1 day after egg laying. Total RNA was prepared by the TRIzol technique (Invitrogen). Samples of 5 μg of total RNA were separated on a formaldehyde gel, blotted, and hybridized with a corresponding DNA probe. RT-PCR was performed by using the Titan one-step RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) with samples of 0.2 μg of total RNA as templates. Tubes containing RNA and RNase inhibitor (1 u/μl, Roche Applied Science) were incubated for 30 min at 50 °C for RT-reaction. Amplification conditions included rapid heating to 94 °C for 2 min followed by 25–30 cycles of 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and 94 °C for 45 s. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Each protein was synthesized by a coupled in vitro transcription-translation (TnT) system (Promega). The corresponding cDNA clones were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) (Invitrogen). The in vitro transcription-translation reactions programmed by the circular plasmid DNA utilized the T7 promoter. To confirm the synthesis of proteins with expected size, the control TnT reactions of each protein were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the resulting reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The annealed deoxyoligonucleotide of μB motifs were purified from 15% TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) criterion precast gel (Bio-Rad) and labeling of double-stranded oligonucleotides, and EMSA was performed with a gel-shift assay system (Promega). The protein-DNA complex was separated on 5% TBE criterion precast gel and visualized by autoradiography.

They were used for making transformation vectors for each NF-κB protein. Drosophila mbn-2 cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 35-mm plates of Drosophila Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1× Gluta Max-1 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of expression plasmid. The cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free Schneider's medium, which was then removed and replaced with complete medium. Overexpression was induced by 48 h of incubation with the addition of 500 μm CuSO4. The immune response was activated by the addition of heat-inactivated Escherichia coli for 4 h. Transfection Assay in Aag-2 Cell Line—Cell line Aag-2 from A. aegypti was maintained in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Aedes REL2+, AaREL1-A, and AaREL1-B were inserted into the pAc5.1/V5/HisA (Invitrogen) vector. Cells were incubated at 26 °C for 36 h prior to transfection. After transfection, the cells were incubated at 26 °C until they reached at least 70% confluency (∼24 h). Following transfection, for the bacterial challenge, heat-inactivated E. coli was added to the well and incubated for an additional 4 h, then cells were harvested for RNA extraction. Generation of Transgenic Flies—AaREL1-A cDNA (D4) was subcloned downstream of the upstream activating sequence in piggyBac 3xP3-EGFP-based vector. Transformants were established by microinjection of wild-type Canton-S strain homozygous for white mutation. Two independent Drosophila lines were examined, and both produced similar results in overexpression of AaREL1-A transgene driven by Hsp70-GAL4 control element-using driver line P{GAL4-Hsp70.PB}2, which was kindly provided by the Indiana University Drosophila stock center (Bloomington, IN). Synthesis and Microinjection of dsRNA—The synthesis of dsRNA was accomplished by simultaneous transcription of both strands of template DNA with a HiScribe RNAi Transcription Kit (New England Biolabs). The plasmid LITMUS 28iMal containing a nonfunctional portion of the E. coli malE gene that encodes a maltose-binding protein was used to generate control dsRNA. After RNA synthesis, the samples were treated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dsRNA was then suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water with a final concentration of 5 μg/μl. The formation of dsRNA was confirmed by running 0.2 μl of these reactions in a 1.0% agarose gel in TBE. A Picospritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) was used to introduce 200 nl of dsRNA into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized mosquito females, at 2–3 days post-eclosion. Septic Injury and Survival Experiments—Septic injuries were performed by pricking the flies or mosquitoes in the rear part of the abdomen with a Hamilton 31S needle dipped into bacterial culture or a fungal spore suspension. Survival experiments were carried out under the same conditions. Groups of 20 female Drosophila or A. aegypti female mosquitoes after 2 days of recovery following AaREL1 dsRNA injection were challenged by bacteria culture or a spore suspension (∼5 × 107 viable spores/ml) of B. bassiana strain GHA. The viable spore number was calculated by spreading the suspension onto Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Cloning of Two REL1 Isoform cDNAs from A. aegypti—A 376-bp DNA fragment was obtained using a set of sense and antisense primers (AaREL1-R2 and AaREL1-R-A) and was used as a probe to screen the cDNA library prepared from previtellogenic A. aegypti female mosquitoes. The nucleotide sequence of the longest 2,250-bp D4 clone out of a total of 6 clones contained a full open reading frame that was conceptually translated into a 579-amino acid-long polypeptide. Additional 5′-untranslated region (UTR, 41-bp) and 3′-UTR (11-bp) sequences that were followed by poly(A) sequence were identified by RACE PCR. The sequence and overall structure of the conceptual protein from D4 was highly similar to Drosophila Dl and A. gambiae REL1 (AgREL1), and thus the A. aegypti homologue was named AaREL1-A (Fig. 1A). A phylogenetic analysis using Rel-homology domains demonstrated that AaREL1 and AgREL1 clustered with Drosophila Dl. This Dl/REL1 subgroup, together with Drosophila Dif, formed a separate cluster that was different from the group of mammalian Rel proteins (Fig. 1B). Sequencing of another cDNA clone, D6, indicated differences in the 5′-UTR sequence that contained an alternative start codon. Both D4 and D6 cDNA clones shared identical sequences only in the RHD region, but the C-terminal domains (CTDs), including the nucleus localization signal (NLS), were completely divergent. An additional 5′-UTR sequence of 263 bp of D6 cDNA was obtained by 5′-RACE PCR. Two major PCR products, short and long form, obtained by 3′-RACE PCR, added the 3′-truncated region of the D6 cDNA. Both short and long RT-PCR products were subcloned and additional transcript sequences of 1,290 and 1,967 bp were obtained. The complete short and long form transcripts were 3,433 and 4,110 bp in size, which encoded the same protein. The additional 3′-UTR of 4,110-bp transcript was identical to the 3′-region of D4 cDNA clone, indicating that long form transcript might be the precursor mRNA of the D4-type transcript. The 844-residue protein encoded by these transcripts lacked N-terminal 39 residues that were encoded by the AaREL1-A transcript, which indicated the presence of an alternative transcription start site. We were able to isolate 2,894-bp (844 residues) and 2,968-bp (883 residues) cDNA fragments by RT-PCR that yielded polypeptides with or without N-terminal 39 residues. Northern blot analysis clearly showed that all A. aegypti REL1 transcripts used both start sites, which resulted in doublet bands for each alternate transcript (Fig. 2A). The CTD of the second A. aegypti REL1 form (named AaREL1-B) was highly conserved with the rear portion of Drosophila Dl-B CTD, which possessed trans-activating properties (Fig. 1A). A crucial region for the transactivation properties of Drosophila Dl-B, located between amino acids 576 and 683, contains two putative acidic activation modules (30Gross I. Georgel P. Oertel-Buchheit P. Schnarr M. Reichhart J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These two modules and a bipartite NLS were highly conserved in the CTDs of Drosophila and AaREL1-B. A Q-rich region, present in the CTD of Drosophila Dl-B, was absent in AaREL1-B. The Rel domains of Dl-B and AaREL1-B lacked an NLS at their ends. Instead, both Dl-B and AaREL1-B had a bipartite NLS in their CTDs. This was a common variant for NLS in which a small cluster of basic residues positioned 10–12 residues at the N-terminal of a monopartite-like NLS sequence. The additional binding energy contributed by the upstream cluster of basic residues relaxes the requirements for the downstream monopartite-like sequences (31Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the monopartite NLS sequence of AaREL1-A consisted of all basic residues, KRKKRK, whereas the monopartite-like sequence of AaREL1-B was SRKKSK and included an upstream cluster of basic residues, KNKK. Two overlapping PCR products spanning 13,355 bp in length were isolated and sequenced. This genomic region did not contain a 5′-UTR, N-terminal region (M1-C150), and short 3′-UTR as shown in the D4-type transcript. The sequence result, however, gave us sufficient information about how the RNA was processed in generating the different types of AaREL1 transcripts (Fig. 1C). These exon-intron structures and the alternative splicing of the AaREL1 gene were very similar to the Drosophila Dl gene (30Gross I. Georgel P. Oertel-Buchheit P. Schnarr M. Reichhart J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), showing that both insect genes originated from a common ancestor gene. The Inducible AaREL1 Isoform Transcripts Are Expressed in Adult A. aegypti Females—Northern blot analyses were performed to examine the expression of AaREL1 transcripts. Utilization of the total RNA revealed three transcript bands of ∼2.5, ∼3.5, and ∼4.3 kb in size that were constitutively expressed during the normal unchallenged state of the naïve larvae in adult males and females (Fig. 2A). The probe from the AaREL1-B-specific CTD region (F400-L568 of AaREL1-B) did not hybridize to the ∼2.5-kb band, suggesting that it represented the AaREL1-A transcript (Fig. 2A). According to the sizes of the transcripts, the ∼3.5- and ∼4.3-kb bands corresponded to the short and long AaREL1-B transcripts, resp"

Their involvement in down-regulation of gene expression is termed RNA interference (RNAi). It is widely believed that RNAi predominates in the cytoplasm. We report here the co-existence of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAi phenomena in primary human myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) cells by targeting myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) mRNAs.

We demonstrate here for the first time down-regulation of the endogenous nuclear retained mutant DMPK mRNAs targeted with lentivirus-delivered short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).

Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). siRNAs are RNA duplexes of 21–23 nucleotides with ∼2 nucleotide 3′-overhangs that can induce degradation of their homologous target mRNAs without eliciting interferon responses in mammalian cells. The degradation of the target mRNAs occurs at the post-transcriptional level and is termed post-transcriptional gene silencing, one of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. RNAi requires incorporation of one of the short RNA strands into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), wherein the sequence serves as a guide for identification of the targeted RNAs through base pairing. Argonaute 2 (Ago2) in RISC cleaves the target at a single site within the target mRNA through the PIWI domain (2Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L.

Because most protein components of RNAi, including Ago2 and Dicer, assemble and function in the cytoplasm (5Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J.

Several lines of evidence have indicated that RNAi(-like) phenomena may also occur in the nucleus in addition to the well characterized cytoplasmic mechanism. siRNAs have been shown to initiate transcriptional gene silencing by targeting DNA sequences in the nucleus of fission yeast (9Verdel A. Jia S. Gerber S. Sugiyama T. Gygi S. Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), flies (10Pal-Bhadra M. Leibovitch B.A. Gandhi S.G. Rao M. Bhadra U.

Moreover, in Caenorhabditis elegans, nuclear proteins are reportedly required for RNAi (13Dudley N.R. Labbe J.C. Goldstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4191-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also indirectly indicated nuclear RNAi(-like) pathways in animals (4Meister G. Landthaler M. Patkaniowska A.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and a recent study demonstrated that the nuclear 7SK RNA can be degraded by siRNAs (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a large unstable CTG expansion in the 3′-UTR of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene (17Brook J.D. McCurrach M.E. Harley H.G. Buckler A.J. Church D. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Stanton V.P. Thirion J.P. Hudson T. et al.Cell. 1992; 69: 385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutant (mt) transcripts harboring the large CUG repeats are fully transcribed and polyadenylated, but remain trapped in the nucleus (18Davis B.M. McCurrach M.E. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Complete nuclear retention of mt DMPK mRNAs with large CUG repeats is believed to be one of the most important pathological features of DM1 (19Mankodi A. Thornton C.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 15: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because DM1 cells express both a normal cytoplasmically localized DMPK mRNA and a mt nuclear retained version of this mRNA, this transcript represents a good target to determine whether or not the same siRNAs can target both transcripts for degradation. Using heterozygous DM1 myoblasts, we show reduction of both nuclear retained mt DMPK mRNAs containing long CUG repeats and cytoplasmic wt DMPK mRNAs that do not have long CUG repeats. The co-existence of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAi in humans suggests that components of the RNAi machinery exist in both compartments. Finally, we demonstrate here that the same short hairpin RNA transcripts can function in both compartments, suggesting either nuclear Dicing or import of Diced siRNAs into the nucleus. These findings have important implications for applications of siRNAs in mammalian gene regulation. Primary Human Muscle Cell Cultures—DM1 and normal control myoblasts were obtained from the quadriceps of 15-week-old aborted fetuses. Skeletal muscle biopsies were approved by Laval University and the CHUL ethical committees. Myoblasts were grown and differentiation was carried out as described previously (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization and Confocal Microscopy—Myoblasts grown on glass coverslips were hybridized with a PNA Cy3-(CAG)5 probe to detect mt DMPK mRNAs as described in the Singer laboratory protocols (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nuclei were visualized by inclusion of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in the mounting solution. Samples were observed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510), and optical sections were obtained at optical Z resolution. Amira software was used to process images and construct three-dimensional surface models of the confocal image data stacks. Cloning of shRNAs into pHIV7, Their Transduction, and siRNA Transfection to DM1 Cells—shRNAs DM10, DM130, and DM1892 are directed to nucleotides 10–30, 130–150, and 1,892–1,912, respectively, of the human skeletal muscle DMPK mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_004409) (see Fig. 2A). shRNAs were cloned just downstream of a human U6 promoter using the following method. pTZ U6+1 was used as a template for PCR (21Lee N.S. Dohjima T. Bauer G. Li H. Li M.J. Ehsani A. Salvaterra P. Rossi J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 5′-PCR primer contains the sequences of the 5′-end of the U6 promoter (20-mer), and the 3′-primer contains the complementary sequences of the 3′-end of the U6 promoter (25-mer) and shRNA (21-nucleotide sense, 4-nucleotide loop (TGCG), and 21-nucleotide antisense sequences; 46-mer) and six adenines (i.e. a total of 77-mer). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase according to manufacturer specifications (Invitrogen). PCR products containing 3′-A overhangs were directly ligated into the linearized pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) with 3′-T overhangs. The shRNA clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. shRNA constructs in pCR2.1 vectors were digested with BamHI-EcoRV and subcloned into the BamHI-SmaI site of the pHIV7 vector (22Yam P.Y. Li S. Wu J. Hu J. Zaia J.A. Yee J.K. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 293T cells were co-transfected with the pHIV7, pCMV-Rev, pGP (coding for gag and pol), and pCMV-G (coding VSV-G). Infectious lentivirus particles pseudotyped with VSV-G were collected after 48 h and incubated for 30 min with DM1 myoblasts of low passage (P < 6). Transduced cells expressing eGFP encoded in pHIV7 were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting 3 days later. For transfection of synthetic siRNAs, normal culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium, and transfection with siRNAs (25 nm) was performed using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications, or MPG peptide at a 3:1 charge ratio (12Morris K.V. Chan S.W. Jacobsen S.E. Looney D.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, differentiation was carried out (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection of GFP plasmids with the shRNA constructs. DMPK mRNA Extraction—RNA extraction was performed using either proteinase K digestion (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or PARIS™ (Ambion). After digestion or PARIS treatment, total RNAs and DNAs were recovered in 10–100 μl of water by LiCl or standard acid phenol-chloroform extraction. One ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) was then added to the samples, and RNA was extracted according to manufacturer specifications. Northern Blotting—For detection of target DMPK transcripts, 10 μg of total RNA was loaded in a 1.0% agarose gel and Northern hybridization was carried out as previously described (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sample normalization was based on cyclophilin expression levels within each cell type using the level of normal transcripts in the control cells without shRNA treatment as the base line. For detection of shRNAs, Northern hybridization was performed as described previously (21Lee N.S. Dohjima T. Bauer G. Li H. Li M.J. Ehsani A. Salvaterra P. Rossi J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—DM1 cells were grown to confluence in a 100-mm dish and scraped into differentiation medium after 48 h of growth. The cell pellet was washed twice in Hanks' buffered salt solution, and the protein content was quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Forty micrograms of protein were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a nylon membrane. Anti-DMPK polyclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Lubov Timchenko, Baylor College) was used as a probe (23Furling D. Lemieux D. Taneja K. Puymirat J. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 728-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DMPK protein levels were normalized to the total proteins transferred to the nylon membrane. Cell Fractions—Differentiated myoblasts were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by centrifugation following lysis in digitonin buffer (24Lee Y. Jeon K. Lee J.T. Kim S. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4663-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from the nuclear pellets and the cytoplasmic fractions were extracted with 2 ml of proteinase K buffer as described earlier. Five micrograms of RNA from each fraction were formaldehyde and 1× MOPS. Equivalent amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs were loaded in the gels. DMPK mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs on the same membrane. Slot Blots and Nuclear Run-on Assays—Three microliters of 5 m NaOH and water were added to each probe to be 50 μl; 125 ng of CTG-80 probe (240 bp), 727 ng of the DMPK probe (1,454 bp), 5 μg of pBluescript KS+ vector, or 350 ng of cyclophilin probe (700 bp). The probes were then boiled for 5 min and cooled on ice. After adding 50 μl of 4 m ammonium acetate, each probe was applied to a nylon filter inserted in a slot-blot apparatus. After gentle suction, slots were washed twice with 2× SSC. The nylon filter was removed and UV light cross-linked for 3 min in preparation for nuclear run-on assays. For nuclear run-on assays, isolation of nuclei and synthesis of radiolabeled nascent RNAs were performed as follows. Transcriptions were carried out for 50 min in the presence of 200 μCi of [α-32P]ATP/sample to maintain similar specific activities between wt and mt DMPK transcripts. Total labeled RNAs were extracted from the samples described above. Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same Northern blot hybridization buffer as described previously (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), except for replacement of the salmon sperm DNA with 200 μg/ml of Escherichia coli tRNA. The CTG-80 probe specifically binds to mt DMPK mRNA but not to wt transcripts, as verified by Northern blotting (data not shown). All assays were performed in duplicate and carried out simultaneously with or without 400 μg/ml α-amanitin, which blocked transcription in all samples (data not shown). DMPK mRNAs were normalized with cyclophilin transcripts in each sample. Heterozygous DM1 myoblasts have ∼3,200 CTG repeats in one allele of the DMPK gene and 18 CTG repeats in the other (Fig. 1A). The size differences of the transcripts were verified by Northern (Fig. 1B) and Southern hybridization (data not shown). The DM1 myoblasts were isolated from the quadriceps of a 15-week-old aborted, congenitally affected DM1 fetus (see “Materials and Methods”). Culturing of the myoblasts for 48 h in differentiation medium allowed DMPK expression but did not result in myoblast fusion (Fig. 1C). Fluorescent in situ hybridization using a Cy3-labeled DNA probe to the region upstream of the repeats shows that mt DMPK mRNAs are localized in the nucleus of DM1 myoblasts and normal (wt) transcripts are visible in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, right), whereas they are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of normal myoblasts, as demonstrated previously by several groups (18Davis B.M. McCurrach M.E. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Taneja K.L. McCurrach M. Schalling M. Housman D.

Larkin K. Brook J.D. Hamshere M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To investigate the subnuclear localization of mt DMPK transcripts, confocal microscope imaging was performed following fluorescent in situ hybridization on the differentiated DM1 cells. DMPK mRNAs were localized inside the nucleus distal to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1D). The localization of mt and wt DMPK mRNAs cannot be distinguished using fluorescent in situ hybridization, because they have the same base composition, but only DMPK mRNAs in the differentiated DM1 cells show nuclear signals. Therefore, DMPK mRNAs in the DM1 cells following differentiation represent an excellent model system to study nuclear RNAi A lentivirus-based vector (pHIV7) was used to deliver shRNAs targeting DMPK mRNAs under control of the human U6 Pol III promoter into the DM1 myoblasts (22Yam P.Y. Li S. Wu J. Hu J. Zaia J.A. Yee J.K. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An eGFP gene driven by a CMV promoter was also incorporated as a selection marker (Fig. 2A). Four shRNAs were designed. Two are complementary to the coding sequences of the DMPK mRNA (DM10 and DM130), one is targeted to a site in the 3′-UTR previously shown to be accessible to ribozyme cleavage (DM1892) (20Langlois M.A. Lee N.S. Rossi J.J. Puymirat J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 670-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and one is directed to an irrelevant sequence (Fig. 2A, CTRL IR). shRNA constructs were efficiently transduced into cultured DM1 myoblasts (Fig. 2B). High levels of transgene expression could be obtained throughout myoblast differentiation following their genome integration (28Waddington S.N. Mitrophanous K.A. Ellard F.M. Buckley S.M. Nivsarkar M. Lawrence L. Cook H.T. Al-Allaf F. Bigger B. Kingsman S.M. Coutelle C. Themis M. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cells expressing eGFP were then sorted by flow cytometry. The expression of shRNAs was assessed by Northern hybridization using the total RNAs isolated from sorted cells with sense probes that hybridize to the antisense strands but not to targets. All shRNAs were expressed from the lentiviral vectors, and they were processed into ∼21-nucleotide siRNAs as expected (Fig. 2B). To investigate the function of shRNA constructs in DM1 myoblasts, the total RNA was extracted from transduced primary myoblast cultures, and the level of DMPK mRNA was determined by Northern hybridization using a DMPK cDNA probe (Fig. 3A). Normal DMPK mRNA contains between 5 and 37 CUG repeats and is easily distinguished from the mt DMPK transcripts containing long CUG repeats (Fig. 1B). Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate in the absence of growth factors for 48 h prior to RNA extraction to induce the expression of DMPK mRNA (29Furling D. Lam le T. Agbulut O. Butler-Browne G.S. Morris G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of mt transcripts were elevated in congenital DM1 cells, because mt DMPK transcripts with large CUG repeat expansions are more stable than the normal transcripts (data not shown). shRNAs DM10 and DM130 showed the most effective down-regulation of normal (wt) DMPK mRNAs (64.2 ± 3.5 and 74.5 ± 2.3% decreases in expression, respectively, relative to control expression) (Fig. 3, A and B). Unexpectedly, they also effectively down-regulated mt DMPK transcripts that are localized exclusively in the nucleus (46.6 ± 2.4 and 57.6 ± 6.4%) (Fig. 3, A and B). The shRNA directed against the 3′-UTR (DM1892) showed only a moderate decrease in expression of both wt and mt DMPK transcripts (26.5 ± 2.4 and 15.1 ± 3.3%). The irrelevant shRNA control did not elicit any significant change in total DMPK mRNA levels. Taken together our data suggest that an RNAi-like phenomenon occurs not only with cytoplasmic transcripts but also with nuclear transcripts. To confirm that nuclear transcripts are affected by shRNAs, we performed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of differentiated DM1 cells stably expressing the shRNAs (Fig. 3, C–E). The mt DMPK mRNAs were observed exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Nuclear retained mt mRNAs were reduced effectively by both shRNAs DM10 and DM130 (51.5 ± 6.6 and 48.8 ± 3.9%) (Fig. 3). In addition, the normal transcripts remaining in the nuclear fraction were also reduced by these shRNAs (47.2 ± 5.7 and 46.2 ± 4.0%). As expected, shRNAs DM10 and DM130 down-regulated the normal transcripts found in the cytoplasm (77.8 ± 1.3 and 73.6 ± 1.5%). We could not detect any intermediate size cleavage products from the nuclear targeted transcripts, suggesting that the RNAs are rapidly degraded following cleavage. The changes in DMPK levels obtained from this fractionation experiment showed a similar trend as that seen with the Northern blot in (Fig. 3, A and B). The shRNAs DM10 and DM130 were the most effective and DM1892 had a weak but significant effect. These results show that shRNAs reduce both nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts, demonstrating the existence of an RNAi(-like) process in both compartments of human cells. Because only the normal DMPK transcripts can be translated in the cytoplasm of DM1 myoblasts, we performed a Western blot to measure the levels of DMPK protein translated from these normal transcripts. shRNAs DM10 and DM130 reduced DMPK protein levels by 55.9 ± 3.2 and 73.2 ± 3.0%, respectively, relative to the control (Fig. 3, F–H). The levels of DMPK protein were lowered by 30.8 ± 4.7% in DM1 cells expressing shRNA DM1892. These results are consistent with the reduction in mRNA levels determined with Northern blotting (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm nuclear RNAi(-like) pathway of shRNAs against mt DMPK mRNAs, we transfected DM1 cells with synthetic siRNA DM10 (ssiDM10) using two different methods. The first methodology relied on MPG, a fusion peptide derived from the HIV type-1 gp41 transmembrane protein and the SV40 nuclear localization peptide, which has previously been reported to facilitate the nuclear import of siRNAs (12Morris K.V. Chan S.W. Jacobsen S.E. Looney D.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 30Simeoni F. Morris M.C. Heitz F. Divita G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), whereas the second method relied on conventional Lipofectamine 2000, which lacks nuclear specificity and has been reported to generally deliver siRNAs to target cells (31Astriab-Fisher A. Fisher M.H. Juliano R. Herdewijn P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm delivery of ssiDM10 into the nucleus or cytoplasm using MPG or Lipofectamine 2000, we used Cy3-labeled ssiDM10. After transfection and differentiation, we performed confocal microscopy and then processed the image stacks to construct three-dimensional models using Amira software (Fig. 4, B and C). Lipofectamine delivered ssiDM10 mainly to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B), whereas MPG delivered siRNAs into both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 4C). To examine whether nuclear down-regulation of mt DMPK transcripts were affected by different delivery methods, we performed Northern hybridization analyses on RNAs from the DM1 cells transfected by MPG or Lipofectamine. Using a modified Lipofectamine 2000 to increase the transfection efficiency to DM1 cells (∼65%), ssiDM10 effectively diminished the level of wt DMPK mRNAs (∼70%) but not mt DMPK transcripts (Fig. 4A). However, ssiDM10 effectively diminished the level of mt DMPK mRNAs (∼75%) (as well as wt DMPK mRNAs) in the DM1 cells transfected via MPG (Fig. 4A). A mutant form of ssiDM10 (mt ssiDM10), which contains four mismatches in the middle of the antisense strand, showed no down-regulation of wt or mt transcripts when either MPG or Lipofectamine was used, demonstrating sequence specificity for both the nuclear and cytoplasmic mechanisms. Using a mixture of MPG and Lipofectamine, in which the efficiency for ssiRNA delivery was made really poor by disrupting membrane organization (32Deshayes S. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Morris M.C. Aldrian-Herrada G. Charnet P. Divita G. Heitz F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1667: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we did not detect the knockdown of either transcript (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). These data suggest that the initial nuclear expression of shRNAs produce an interference-like effect in the nucleus of primary human cells when the target message is generally retained in the nucleus. An alternative explanation for the observed reduction in steady-state mRNA levels could be a decrease in transcription, because transcriptional gene silencing can be initiated by double-stranded RNAs (33Dudley N.R. Goldstein B. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2003; 5: 113-117PubMed Google Scholar), and it has recently been reported that transcriptional gene silencing can be induced by siRNAs and shRNAs in human cells (11Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2004; 431: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12Morris K.V. Chan S.W. Jacobsen S.E. Looney D.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out nuclear run-on experiments using nuclei isolated from transduced DM1 myoblasts expressing the shRNAs (Fig. 5). Cells expressing shRNAs DM10 and DM130 show reduced amounts of wt and mt DMPK transcripts (Fig. 5A), but transcriptional initiation appears normal for both mt and wt DMPK (Fig. 5, B and C). The reduced mRNA levels seen in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of DM1 cells is thus not a result of altered transcription but is due to post-transcriptional gene silencing. Taken together our data strongly support RNAi mechanisms in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. We were surprised to find a significant reduction in the nuclear retained mt DMPK mRNAs in DM1 cells, because existing evidence indicates that RNAi pathways operate primarily in the cytoplasm. Most protein components of the RISC are cytoplasmic (5Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 6Tabara H. Yigit E.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 8Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, a separate study concluded that only cytoplasmic transcripts could be targeted by RNAi (8Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), although some reduction in nuclear transcripts was apparent, this was attributed to RNAi acting on transcripts in the process of being exported. The mt DMPK transcripts targeted in this study are located exclusively in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1D and Ref. 18Davis B.M. McCurrach M.E. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and are clearly down-regulated by the appropriate shRNAs. Given our observations of the intracellular compartmentalization of the mt DMPK RNAs, we believe that the observed down-regulation is occurring in the nucleus and is not associated with transport of the mt DMPK through the nuclear pores. During the course of our work another study also demonstrated direct targeting of 7SK small nuclear RNA in human cells by siRNAs, and other siRNAs could also trigger RNAi on endogenous, nuclear retained U6snRNA (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Moreover some RISC components could be found in the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic compartments (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Taken together with our results, a nuclear RNAi(-like) pathway appears to operate in human cells. A number of indirect studies have also indicated that RNAi-(-like) phenomena may occur in the nucleus of human cells in addition to the well characterized cytoplasmic mechanism. A nuclear RNAi pathway was predicted by a study demonstrating that shRNAs under the control of the U6+27 promoter, although exclusively nuclear, are functionally active in silencing targeted transcripts (34Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the intron containing pre-mRNAs can be targeted by RNAi (14Bosher J.M. Dufourcq P. Sookhareea S. Labouesse M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). siRNAs have been shown to initiate transcriptional gene silencing by targeting DNA sequences in the nucleus of fission yeast (9Verdel A. Jia S. Gerber S. Sugiyama T. Gygi S. Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), flies (10Pal-Bhadra M. Leibovitch B.A. Gandhi S.G. Rao M. Bhadra U. Birchler J.A. Elgin S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and human cells (11Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2004; 431: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12Morris K.V. Chan S.W. Jacobsen S.E. Looney D.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Moreover, in C. elegans, nuclear proteins are reportedly required for RNAi (13Dudley N.R. Labbe J.C. Goldstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4191-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also indirectly indicated nuclear RNAi(-like) pathways in animals (4Meister G. Landthaler M. Patkaniowska A. Dorsett Y. Teng G. Tuschl T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 10Pal-Bhadra M. Leibovitch B.A. Gandhi S.G. Rao M. Bhadra U.

Genetics. 1999; 153: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shinagawa T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that nuclear RNAi(-like) phenomena occur in a variety of animals. There are some notable differences between our results and the Rana and co-workers (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) demonstration of nuclear RNAi, even though both used in human cells. The mt DMPK transcripts we targeted with shRNAs are large nuclear retained mRNAs (∼12.4 kb) transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), whereas the 7SK or U6 RNAs targeted by Rana and co-workers (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) are non-coding small nuclear RNAs transcribed by Pol III. We demonstrated that the same shRNAs expressed from lentiviral vectors can simultaneously target both nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts, whereas they observed knockdown of exclusive nuclear targets using synthetic siRNA. In addition, our observation used differentiated primary human cells rather than human cell lines. Taken together, our study along with their results (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) suggest that nuclear RNAi(-like) mechanism can target a variety of different transcripts in several types of human cells and may thus be a general phenomenon. The demonstration that shRNAs can direct nuclear RNA destruction raises the question of whether the shRNAs are processed into siRNAs directly in the nucleus or are processed in the cytoplasm and transported back into the nucleus. The processing of the shRNAs could take place via a Dicer cleavage mechanism or via endonucleolytic processing of the loop. At this time we have not been able to distinguish differences between these possibilities. Because siRNAs delivered to the nucleus by the MPG peptide can also trigger nuclear RNAi, they can apparently function in the nucleus as suggested by other studies (4Meister G. Landthaler M. Patkaniowska A. Dorsett Y. Teng G. Tuschl T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A major component of cytoplasmic RNAi is Ago2. Humans have seven additional Argonaute (Ago) protein family members all containing the common architecture of a central PAZ domain and C-terminal PIWI motif (35Sasaki T. Shiohama A. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Genomics. 2003; 82: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Two of the eight human Ago proteins have been shown to be both nuclear and cytoplasmic (Ago1 and Ago 2) (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); therefore, a major component of RISC is in the nucleus. It remains to be determined what other components of the RNAi machinery exist in both cellular compartments. One possible mechanism for nuclear RNAi-related phenomenon would be to propose redistribution of cytoplasmic components of RISC containing siRNAs during mitosis when the nuclear membrane is disrupted. In our study such a mechanism is unlikely, because our differentiated cells are not dividing during the course of our experiments. In addition we observed targeting of mt DMPK transcripts with lentivirus-delivered shRNAs or MPG-delivered synthetic siRNAs but not with cationic lipid-delivered synthetic siRNAs. This last result is in contrast to Ref. 16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar where cationic lipid delivery of synthetic siRNAs resulted in nuclear RNAi. The difference in our result and that of Rana and co-workers (16Robb G.B. Brown K.M. Khurana J. Rana T.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) is not known; however, it is possible that mitotic activity could be a requirement for redistribution of cytoplasmic siRNAs as has been proposed for conflicting results of siRNA induced transcriptional gene silencing (11Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2004; 431: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12Morris K.V. Chan S.W. Jacobsen S.E. Looney D.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Finally, nuclear RNAi(-like) pathways in human primary cells using shRNAs can target nuclear retained mt DMPK RNAs containing long CUG repeats that is believed to be one of the most important pathological features of DM1. This has important implications for future myotonic dystrophy treatment or other nuclear diseases. We thank Caroline Haineault and Haitang Li for their excellent technical assistance.

We found that in REK cells EGF and all-trans-RA up-regulated hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) gene expression within 2 h 4-fold each and in HaCaT human immortal keratinocytes 8- and 33-fold, respectively. The first 10 kb of the human Has2 promoter were scanned in silico and in vitro for potential response elements of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or RA receptor (RAR) proteins. We identified a STAT-response element in the proximal promoter region and confirmed its functionality in response to EGF by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Direct in vitro binding of RARs to four RARE candidates within the Has2 promoter could not be observed at stringent gel shift conditions, but reporter gene assays demonstrated functionality of a complex of two of these RAREs located ∼1200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Moreover, ChIP assays using antibodies against nine nuclear proteins monitored all-trans-RA-dependent binding of RAR, retinoid X receptor, mediator protein, and RNA polymerase II and also histone 4 acetylation to a promoter region containing the complex RARE.

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is a high molecular mass polysaccharide that is a key component of the vertebrate extracellular matrix and is involved in a wide range of cellular functions including migration, adhesion, and proliferation by its unique physicochemical properties and interactions with specific cell surface receptors (1Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan is synthesized by the Has enzymes Has1, Has2, and Has3 at the plasma membrane (2Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In skin epidermis, the narrow extracellular space surrounding keratinocytes contains a high concentration of hyaluronan, but it is found mainly between the basal and spinous cell layers of normal human epidermis and much less in terminally differentiated layers (3Tammi R. Ripellino J.A. Margolis R.U. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 326-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both in normal and diseased epidermis, keratinocyte growth and differentiation are regulated by paracrine and endocrine signaling molecules, such as EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; ARP0, acidic riboprotein P0; CBP, CREB-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DR5, direct repeat spaced by 5 nucleotides; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HABC, hyaluronan binding complex; Has, hyaluronan synthase; MED, mediator; RE, response element; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; pPol II, phosphorylated RNA polymerase II; pSTAT, phosphorylated STAT; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RARE, retinoic acid response element; REK, rat epidermal keratinocyte; RXR, retinoid X receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TSS, transcription start site; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; ARP0, acidic riboprotein P0; CBP, CREB-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DR5, direct repeat spaced by 5 nucleotides; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HABC, hyaluronan binding complex; Has, hyaluronan synthase; MED, mediator; RE, response element; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; pPol II, phosphorylated RNA polymerase II; pSTAT, phosphorylated STAT; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RARE, retinoic acid response element; REK, rat epidermal keratinocyte; RXR, retinoid X receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TSS, transcription start site; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and the nuclear hormone all-trans-RA. Interestingly, hyaluronan synthesis rate is stimulated by EGF in epidermal keratinocytes in monolayer (4Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fulop C. Sironen R.K. Karvinen S. Pasonen S. Lammi M.J. Tammi R.

Törrönen K. Hyttinen J.M. Jokela T. Lammi M.J. Tammi M.I. Tammi R. J. Investig.

Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 326-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the biological role of hyaluronan in epidermal keratinocytes emerged by the finding that Has2-mediated hyaluronan synthesis controls the migration rate of keratinocytes in scratch-wounded monolayer cultures (6Rilla K. Lammi M.J. Sironen R. Törrönen K. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Hyttinen M. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan concentration is closely correlated with the proliferative activity and volume of the vital part of the epidermis and inversely related with the markers of differentiation, suggesting that hyaluronan synthesis regulated by Has2 and Has3 is an important component in the proliferative reactions of the epidermis and is also involved in the epidermal differentiation process (5Pasonen-Seppänen S. Karvinen S. Törrönen K. Hyttinen J.M. Jokela T. Lammi M.J. Tammi M.I. Tammi R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 1038-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). EGF is one of the most powerful molecules influencing the behavior of keratinocytes (7Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The growth factor binds to the EGF receptor (EGFR), which belongs to the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family (8Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Activated EGFRs dimerize, which promotes autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines located in their cytoplasmic domain. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules, whose recruitment finally stimulates numerous transcription factors including members of the STAT protein family (9Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Chakraborty A. Zhou M.Y. Zeng Q. Pitt A.S. Tweardy D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, activated EGFRs induce via the tyrosine kinase Src the phosphorylation of STAT proteins 1, 3, and 5 (10Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which then translocate to the nucleus. STAT homodimers recognize REs within promoter regions of EGF-responding genes of the sequence TTCN2–4GAA with a preference for three spacing nucleotides (11Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Like most members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the three RAR subtypes (α, β, and γ) contain two zinc finger motifs that form a characteristic DNA-binding domain (12Shaffer P.L. Gewirth D.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2242-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain (13Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Ligand binding causes a conformational change within the ligand-binding domain leading to interactions with coactivator and mediator (MED) proteins (14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coactivators link the ligand-activated RARs to enzymes displaying histone acetyltransferase activity, such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), that cause chromatin relaxation. In a subsequent step, RARs interact with a MED complex that acts as a bridge to the basal transcription machinery having RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as its core (15Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In this way ligand-activated RARs fulfill two tasks, remodeling chromatin and activating transcription. RARs bind to hexameric DNA motifs with the consensus sequence RGKTCA (R = A or G, K = G or T). The three RAR subtypes have a very similar functional profile, but the predominant subtype in epidermis is RARγ (16Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). RARs form preferentially heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), another nuclear receptor family member, which also contacts DNA (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Simple RAREs are often formed by a direct repeat of two hexameric DNA motifs spaced by five nucleotides (DR5). Every transcriptionally responsive primary RA target gene should contain at least one functional RARE in its promoter region and these RAREs are assumed to be located relatively close to the transcription start site (TSS) of these genes (18de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The major protein constituents of chromatin are the histones. Discrete covalent modifications of these nucleosome components, in particular acetylation and methylation at lysine residues of their tails, neutralize the positive charge of the lysines, and thus reduce their attraction for the negatively charged DNA. Histones in the active promoter regions have a high degree of acetylation, the chromatin is loosely packed, and the associated DNA is available for interaction with protein complexes involved in gene regulation. Therefore, the combined effect of these covalent modifications has a large impact on chromatin organization and accessibility of transcription factor binding sites (19Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). An essential prerequisite for the direct modulation of transcription via EGF or all-trans-RA is the location of activated STAT proteins or RARs, respectively, close to the basal transcriptional machinery. Therefore, STAT-REs or RAREs should be located within activated chromatin regions in the promoter of EGF and RA target genes. The proximal promoter region of all three Has genes show constitutive activity, of which Has2 has the lowest basal level (20Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N. Spicer A.P. Buckland P.R. Davies M. Bowen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20576-20581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), i.e. the Has2 gene seems to be the main candidate for modulating the hyaluronan synthesis rate. In this study, we observed that all-trans-RA up-regulated hyaluronan content almost as efficiently as EGF in long term organotypic cultures originated from REK cells and that Has2 gene expression was rapidly increased in monolayer culture. Has2 mRNA and hyaluronan production were up-regulated even more prominently in HaCaT human immortal keratinocytes. In silico screening of the first 1000 bp of the human Has2 promoter revealed the presence of putative binding sites of transcription factors Sp1, NF-Y, and NF-κB (20Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N. Spicer A.P. Buckland P.R. Davies M. Bowen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20576-20581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but no further information about the promoter is yet available. Therefore, we performed in this study a combined in silico/in vitro scanning of the first 10 kb of the human Has2 promoter and identified an active STAT-RE in the proximal region. ChIP assays on a number of RE-containing promoter regions of the human Has2 promoter showed all-trans-RA-dependent histone 4 acetylation and binding of RAR, RXR, MED protein, and Pol II to a promoter region containing a complex RARE. The human Has2 gene is thus a potent primary EGF and RA responding gene with a complex regulation. Cell Culture—The REK cell line (derived from the epidermis of newborn rat skin) was cultured in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 4 mm l-glutamine (21Pasonen-Seppänen S.

Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine. For organotypic cultures, REK cells were cultured at the air-liquid interface on type I collagen support (from rat tail) as described previously (21Pasonen-Seppänen S. Suhonen T.M. Kirjavainen M. Miettinen M. Urtti A. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1322-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organotypic REK cell cultures were grown for 2 weeks, with the medium changed daily for the first week and every 2 days thereafter. The treatment of the cultures with the test substances started 1 day after the cells were raised to the air-liquid interface and was continued for 10 days. Then the cultures were fixed overnight in Histochoice® (Amresco, Solon, OH), embedded in paraffin, cut into 3-μm thick vertical sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Prior to mRNA extraction or ChIP, REK and HaCaT cells were treated at a density of 50–60% confluence for 0–240 min with solvent, 0.1 μm all-trans-RA (Sigma), 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), and 0.1 μm AG1478 (the EGFR kinase inhibitor 4-(3′-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) alone or in combination. Hyaluronan Assay—Hyaluronan content was measured from culture medium of the keratinocyte cultures with a sandwich-type ELISA (23Hiltunen E.L. Anttila M. Kultti A. Ropponen K. Penttinen J. Yliskoski M. Kuronen A.T. Juhola M. Tammi R. Tammi M. Kosma V.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6410-6413PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue samples were extracted with acetone, digested with papain, and diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS before the assay as described previously (5Pasonen-Seppänen S. Karvinen S.

ELISA plates were created by coating 96-well Maxisorp Plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) with the hyaluronan binding complex of the cartilage aggrecan G1 domain (HABC, 1 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C, washing with 0.5% Tween in PBS and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. The HABC probe was prepared as described (24Tammi R. Ågren U.M. Tuhkanen A-L. Tammi M.I. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 29: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The dilutions of standard hyaluronan (Provisc, Algon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and the samples were aliquoted to the wells. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, the plates were washed with Tween-PBS, incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated HABC for 1 h, and washed with Tween-PBS. The hyaluronan-bound biotinylated HABC was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin complex in PBS (1:20000, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and 0.5% 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 0.005% H2O2. The absorbance was read at 450 nm after stopping the reaction with 2 m H2SO4. RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Total RNA and mRNA were extracted using Tri-reagent (Sigma) and Oligotex mini mRNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively. One hundred ng of mRNA was used as a template in a cDNA synthesis reaction using 100 pmol of oligo(dT)18 primer in the presence of reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The reaction was performed for 1 h at 37 °C. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an IQ-cycler (Bio-Rad) using the dye SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). -Fold inductions were calculated using the formula 2–(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt is the ΔCt(stimulant) – ΔCt(solvent), ΔCt is Ct(Has2)-Ct(ARP0), and Ct is the cycle at which the detection threshold is crossed. Gene-specific primer pairs, product size, and specific PCR conditions are listed in Table I. PCR product quality was monitored using post-PCR melt curve analysis at the end of the amplification cycles.Table IPrimer sequences and cycling conditions for real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR of human and rat Has gene and the respective ARP0 control geneGene[MgCl2]Cycling conditionsPrimer sequences (5′-3′)Product sizeHuman Has23 mm40 cycles: 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 56 °C, 30 s at 72 °CCAGAATCCAAACAGACAGTTCTAAGGTGTTGTGTGTGACTG186 bpRat Has23 mm40 cycles: 30 s at 95 °C, 25 s at 56 °C, 30 s at 72 °CCATGATGGACATCTTCAGTGAAGGTGTCTGAGTCACACACCTG257 bpHuman ARP03 mm40 cycles: 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 56 °C, 30 s at 72 °CAGATGCAGCAGATCCGCATGTGGTGATACCTAAAGCCTG318 bpRat ARP03 mm40 cycles: 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 56 °C, 30 s at 72 °CAGATGCAGCAGATCCGCATGTGGTGATGCCCAAAGCTTG318 bp Open table in a new tab Gel Shift Analysis—In vitro translated RARγ and RXRα proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using their respective pSG5-based full-length cDNA expression constructs (25Schräder M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein batches were quantified by test translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. The specific concentration of the receptor proteins was adjusted to ∼4 ng/μl (10 ng corresponds to approximately to 0.2 pmol) after taking the individual number of methionine residues per protein into account. Gel shift assays were performed with 10 ng of the appropriate in vitro translated proteins or 750 ng of recombinant STAT1 protein (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA). The proteins were incubated for 15 min in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 5% glycerol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9). Constant amounts (1 ng) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm, for core sequences see Fig. 3A) were then added and incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 5 or 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—HaCaT cells were seeded into 6-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS. Two copies of an idealized RARE (for sequence see Fig. 3C) and the RARE cluster (combination of RAREs 1 and 2, see Fig. 3A) of the Has2 promoter were fused with the thymidine kinase promoter driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Plasmid DNA containing liposomes were formed by incubating these reporter plasmids and an expression vector for human RARγ (25Schräder M. Wyss A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. LeMotte P. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (each 1 μg) with 10 μgof N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 500 μl of 15% charcoal-stripped FBS was added 4 h after transfection. At this time, 0.1 μm all-trans-RA or solvent were also added. The cells were lysed 16 h after onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls. ChIP Assays—Nuclear proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1% for 15 min at 37 °C with rotation. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.15 m and incubating for 5 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. The medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were collected by scraping into ice-cold PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After centrifugation the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and the lysates were sonicated to result in DNA fragments of 300–1000 bp in length. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and the lysates were diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Chromatin solutions were incubated with 5 μl of the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The antibody against acetylated histone 4 was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY), whereas antibodies against RARγ (sc-773), STAT3 (sc-482), phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3, sc-7993), RXRα (sc-553), Pol II (sc-899), phosphorylated Pol II (pPol II, sc-13583), CBP (sc-369), and MED23/TRAP150 (sc-5378) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Heidelberg, Germany). The immune complexes were collected with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C at 100 × g and washed sequentially for 5 min on a rotating platform with 1 ml of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Finally, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of TE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The immunocomplexes were eluted by adding 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) and incubation for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubating overnight at 65 °C (26Orlando V. Trends Biochem. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The remaining proteins were digested by adding proteinase K (final concentration 40 μg/ml) and incubating for 1 h at 45 °C. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extractions and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of ethanol using glycogen as a carrier. Immunoprecipitated DNAs were then used as a template for PCR with the following profile: 5 min preincubation at 94 °C and then 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at primer specific temperatures and 30 s elongation at 72 °C, with one final incubation for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR primers and the location of the investigated chromatin regions are listed in Table II.

Cultures, which were treated for the whole 10-day period with 0.1 μm all-trans-RA, 20 ng/ml EGF, or the combination of both, showed increased numbers of vital cells, often in a bit of disorganized layers (Figs. 1, B–D). In line with previous reports (5Pasonen-Seppänen S. Karvinen S. Törrönen K. Hyttinen J.M. Jokela T. Lammi M.J. Tammi M.I. Tammi R. J. Investig.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 alone had only a minor effect on the thickness of the epidermis (Fig. 1E), although it markedly reduced the all-trans-RA-induced epidermal hypertrophy (Fig. 1F). The effects of AG1478 on hyaluronan content closely corresponded to those on epidermal thickness, i.e. relatively small inhibition on unstimulated cultures and a more substantial decrease of the hyaluronan deposition induced by all-trans-RA (Fig. 1G). Has2 mRNA Expression in REK Cells Is Up-regulated by All-trans-RA and EGF—Because the Has2 enzyme is a major producer of hyaluronan in the epidermis (4Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fulop C. Sironen R.K.

However, because we were interested in characterizing the primary responses of the Has2 gene, the stimulation period was only 2 h and the REK cells were cultured as regular monolayers (Fig. 2A). Despite these significant differences in treatment time and culture conditions, we found that the Has2 mRNA levels in regular REK cell culture (Fig. 2A) roughly correlated with the hyaluronan production in organotypic REK cell culture (Fig. 1G). Normalized to the expression of the reference gene acidic riboprotein P0 (ARP0, also known as 36B4), both all-trans-RA and EGF stimulated the Has2 mRNA level ∼4-fold and the combination of both stimuli resulted in a more than 8-fold induction. AG1478 application resulted in a slight but not significant induction of Has2 expression, whereas the combined treatment with all-trans-RA and AG1478 showed a minor if any reduction of the all-trans-RA response of the gene.

The rapid elevation of intestinal cAMP and cGMP levels by activation of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, respectively, inhibits intestinal NaCl absorption, either moderately as part of normal digestive physiology or excessively in diarrheal diseases. Some details of the mechanisms of acute regulation of intestinal NaCl absorption by cAMP are understood. Hormones such as vasoactive intestinal peptide or secretin and enterotoxins such as cholera toxin activate adenylate cyclase and increase cellular cAMP content.

NHERF1/NHERF2 each contain two homologous PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) and an ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) binding domain, which anchors NHERF and its binding partners to the actin cytoskeleton via NHERF binding to ezrin.

In some cases, cGMP regulates intracellular events by mechanisms analogous to those demonstrated for cAMP. However, the effects of cGMP in the small intestine are not fully elucidated. The intrinsic ileal peptide guanylin and the Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) both bind to the same BB receptor, guanylate cyclase-C, and within minutes increase intracellular cGMP content (8Vaandrager A.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 230: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). STa, guanylin, and cGMP all rapidly inhibit small intestinal NaCl-linked absorption, principally at the level of NHE3, which is an essential component of this Na+-absorptive process (8Vaandrager A.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 230: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The effect on NHE3 is specific to the extent that other BB transporters, such as NHE2 and SGLT1, are not acutely altered.

However, it is not known whether cGKII is part of a signaling complex that includes NHE3, and whether cGKII physically associates with its substrate (e.g. NHE3 or an NHE3 regulatory factor). In addition, there is functional compartmentalization of effects of cGMP on small intestinal NaCl absorption (11Jin X.H. Siragy H.M. Guerrant R.L. Carey R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Separately from the consequences of activating guanylate cyclase-C/cGMP/cGKII from the apical surface, elevating cGMP from the serosal side through the angiotensin-nitric oxide/GC-S signaling pathway stimulated rather than inhibited intestinal NaCl absorption (11Jin X.H. Siragy H.M. Guerrant R.L. Carey R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the cell type initially affected by the latter signaling pathway has not been defined. The current studies further define the downstream events that mediate cGMP inhibition of NHE3. We have demonstrated a requirement for NHERF2 and cGKII, which is specific to the extent that NHERF1 or cGKI cannot be substituted to inhibit NHE3. cGKII must be anchored at two sites to inhibit NHE3, to the plasma membrane and to NHERF2. Thus NHERF2 appears to act as a GKAP, which determines the subcellular targeting of cGKII and thereby its specificity and efficiency. Reagents—8-pCPT-cGMP, a cGK-selective activator, was from Life Science Institute. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences.

The titer of the adenoviral preparations was ∼1 plaque-forming unit per 500 particles. Measurement of Na+/H+Exchange—Cellular Na+/H+ exchange activity in PS120 cells and OK cell lines grown on glass coverslips was determined fluorometrically using the intracellular pH-sensitive dye acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)5–6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM, 5 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously (12Markert T.

Cells were initially perfused with TMA+ solution (130 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), which was then switched to Na+ solution (130 mm NaCl instead of tetramethylammonium chloride) for the Na+-dependent pHi recovery. At the end of each experiment, the fluorescence ratio was calibrated to pHi using the high potassium/nigericin method (13Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

Na+/H+ exchange activity data were calculated as the product of Na+-dependent changes in pHi times the buffering capacity at each pHi, and individual points shown in figures are rates of Na+/H+ exchange calculated at multiple pHi values using at least three coverslips per condition in a single experiment. Kinetics of Na+/H+ exchange were analyzed by Hill plot using Origin (Microcal Software) to estimate Vmax and K′(H+)i in individual experiments. Means ± S.E. were determined from at least three experiments and are also shown in the figures (15Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol.

NHERF2 Fusion Proteins and Overlay Binding Assays—A series of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and hexahistidine fusion proteins were prepared for this study. These included full-length human NHERF1 and NHERF2 and individual domains of NHERF2 (NHERF2 PDZ-1 (aa 12–92), NHERF2 PDZ-2 (aa 155–231), NHERF2 C (aa 231–337), and NHERF2 PDZ-2-C (aa 155–337)) as described previously (6Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A J. Biol.

The GST-tagged fusion proteins were expressed individually in E. coli cells and purified as described previously with glutathione-Sepharose (6Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). His6-tagged fusion proteins made in E. coli were affinity-purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen). His6-NHERF1 and His6-NHERF2 (full-length and fragments NHERF2 PDZ-1, NHERF2 PDZ-2, NHERF2 C, and NHERF2 PDZ-2-C) (3–4 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose blots, and overlaid with cGKII. Prior to overlays, Ponceau S was used to estimate relative protein amounts of transferred protein. cGKII was labeled with [35S]Met using the TnT in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega), and 5 μl of 35S-labeled cGKII in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween was used per overlay for 16–24 h at 4 °C. At the end of the overlay incubation period, nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times with the same buffer, and proteins binding cGKII were visualized by autoradiography. A second overlay (far Western) approach was used to examine the interaction of recombinant cGKIα, -Iβ, and cGKII on blots with His6-tagged NHERF2 (overlay) by subsequent incubation of blots with NHERF2 antibodies. Recombinant cGKIα, -Iβ, and -II (1–3 μg) were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h. The blots were incubated with 10 ml of His6-NHERF2 (4 μg/ml) in 5% milk/PBS for 16–20 h at 4 °C and then gently washed with 0.05% Tween/PBS three times for 5 min each. The blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-NHERF2 antibody (1:5000) for 1 h, washed with 0.05% Tween/PBS three times for 10 min each, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h, and washed again with 0.05% Tween/PBS three times for 10 min each. Labeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to preflashed x-ray film. Pull-down Assays—In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled cGKII was generated as above (Promega). NHERF-GST fusion proteins immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads were incubated with 35S-cGKII in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors (Sigma P8340)) overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by heating in sample buffer for 5 min at 80 °C. Proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunoblotting—IP experiments were performed with anti-NHERF2 or anti-cGKII antibody using lysates from PS120/NHERF2/NHE3 cells infected with adenovirus-cGKII 48 h earlier. Studies were performed after incubating cells with 8-Br-cGMP (10 min) or before lysis. PS120 fibroblasts were lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min as described (6Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Lysates were exposed to antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the blots were probed with a polyclonal anti-NHERF2 or anti-cGKII antibody as the primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit as the secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as above. The densities of NHE3 protein bands were quantitated by scanning densitometry and ImageQuant software. Statistics—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was by analysis of variance or Student's t test. cGMP Inhibits NHE3 in PS120 Cells, an Effect Requiring NHERF2 Plus cGKII—Earlier studies have indicated that NHERF1 or NHERF2 is necessary for second messenger regulation of NHE3 (1Zizak M.

Differential effects and redundancy in function have been identified between the requirements for NHERF1 and NHERF2 in the second messenger regulation of NHE3 involving Ca2+/protein kinase C and cAMP, respectively (6Yun C.H.

PS120 cells stably expressing NHE3 were infected with recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus containing the coding sequence of rat cGKII or empty vector. The amount of cGKII expression was estimated by Western analysis, and infection efficiency was estimated by determining the percent of infected cells displaying immunofluorescence when labeled with anti-cGKII antibody/Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. cGKII was absent from PS120 cells and from cells infected with adenovirus empty vector, but was present in cells infected ∼48 h earlier with adenovirus containing cGKII (Fig. 1A). By immunofluorescence, 80–90% of PS120 cells contained cGKII 48 h after infection (data not shown). PS120/NHERF2/NHE3 cells (infected with adenovirus-empty vector or cGKII) were exposed to 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP for 30 min and then studied for Na+/H+ exchange activity. 8-Br-cGMP did not alter NHE3 activity in empty virus-infected cells but inhibited NHE3 in cGKII-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Similar inhibition of NHE3 occurred when the effect of the more cGK-selective agonist 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm) (10Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G. de Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was studied (20-min pretreatment) in PS120/NHERF2/NHE3 cells infected with cGKII. As shown in Fig. 1C, 8-pCPT-cGMP inhibited NHE3 in PS120/NHERF2/NHE3 cells transiently infected with cGKII by significantly decreasing the Vmax and increasing the K′(H+)i (no cGMP, 0.31 m m± 0.01; cGMP-treated, 0.40 mm ± 0.02, n = 3, p < 0.01). The cGKII-dependent inhibition of NHE3 by cGMP was dependent on the presence of NHERF2. When the effect of 8-pCPT-cGMP on NHE3 activity was determined in PS120/NHE3 cells containing cGKII but expressing neither NHERF1 nor NHERF2 (data not shown) or in PS120/NHE3/cGKII cells stably expressing NHERF1, cGMP did not alter NHE3 activity (Fig. 1D). Thus, cGMP inhibition of NHE3 required both cGKII and NHERF2, and the effect was not reconstituted by NHERF1. cGMP Inhibition of NHE3 Involves cGKII Not PKA and a Mechanism Different from PKA Inhibition of NHE3 That Does Not Require Ezrin Binding—Studies of the mechanism of cGMP/cGKII regulation of NHE3 were undertaken by first determining whether concentrations of cAMP plus cGMP, which maximally inhibited NHE3 at 30 min of exposure, had additive effects. Synergistic or additive effects of saturating concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP plus 8-Br-cGMP would suggest actions via different mechanisms, but lack thereof would indicate that some aspect of the pathways were redundant and had been saturated. NHERF2-expressing PS120/NHE3/cGKII cells were used in these studies because NHERF2 reconstitutes both cAMP and cGMP regulation of NHE3 in PS120 cells. Used independently, 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP and 100 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP (both concentrations have maximal effects on NHE3 activity (data not shown)) each inhibited NHE3 activity in these cells with quantitatively similar effects (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the effects on NHE3 of cAMP plus cGMP were at least additive, indicating that cAMP and cGMP were acting via separate mechanisms. To search for specific differences in cAMP and cGMP inhibition of NHE3, we used the fact that the ERM binding domain of NHERF1 in its C-terminal 30 amino acids was necessary to reconstitute cAMP inhibition of NHE3 (2Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wade J.B. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F374-F380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar truncation of NHERF2, which removed the C-terminal 30 amino acids (NHERF2Δ30), failed to bind N-terminal ezrin in vitro (Fig. 3A) but bound cGKII similarly to full-length NHERF2 (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 2B, in PS120/NHERF2Δ30/NHE3/cGKII cells, cGMP inhibited and cAMP failed to alter NHE3. To demonstrate further that cGMP was acting via cGK, cells were pretreated during BCECF/NH4Cl loading with the cGK inhibitor H8 (70 μm) (18Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Then the effect of 100 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP was determined in PS120/NHERF2/NHE3 cells infected with cGKII 48 h earlier. As shown in Fig. 2C, H8 did not alter basal NHE3 activity but significantly reversed the cGMP inhibition of NHE3. Thus cGMP inhibition of NHE3 in NHERF2/cGKII-containing PS120/NHE3 cells occurred by a mechanism involving cGKII that differed from the mechanism of PKA inhibition of NHE3. NHERF2 but Not NHERF1 Directly Binds cGKII in Vitro— The interaction of NHE3 with binding proteins such as NHERF2 or NHERF1 has been shown to determine the specificity of formation of signaling complexes (13Kim J.H.

Shown in Fig. 4A, overlay, far Western assays were performed in which full-length His6-NHERF1 and NHERF2 were initially separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then overlaid with recombinant GKII. cGKII was then identified by anti-cGKII antibody. cGKII bound to NHERF2 but not NHERF1 in a manner proportional to the amount of NHERF2 transferred. The cGKII-NHERF2 interaction was of low affinity based on plasmon resonance studies with an estimated affinity in the micromolar range. 2H. Hut and H. R. de Jonge, unpublished data. These findings were supported by pull-down assays using 3 μg of GST, GST-NHERF2, or GST-NHERF1 (Fig. 4B). In vitro pull-down of cGKII occurred only with NHERF2 and not with NHERF1 or GST alone. In addition, His6-NHERF1 and NHERF2 overlaid with 35S-cGKII similarly showed binding of cGKII to NHERF2 and not NHERF1 (Fig. 5, left two lanes). Thus, three separate types of in vitro studies demonstrated direct binding of recombinant NHERF2, but not NHERF1,"
https://openalex.org/W1964034007,"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. The procyclic stage of T. brucei expresses a soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (FRDg) in the peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. This enzyme is responsible for the production of about 70% of the excreted succinate, the major end product of glucose metabolism in this form of the parasite. Here we functionally characterize a new gene encoding FRD (FRDm1) expressed in the procyclic stage. FRDm1 is a mitochondrial protein, as evidenced by immunolocalization, fractionation of digitonin-permeabilized cells, and expression of EGFP-tagged FRDm1 in the parasite. RNA interference was used to deplete FRDm1, FRDg, or both together. The analysis of the resulting mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 is responsible for 30% of the cellular NADH-FRD activity, which solves a long standing debate regarding the existence of a mitochondrial FRD in trypanosomatids. FRDg and FRDm1 together account for the total NADH-FRD activity in procyclics, because no activity was measured in the double mutant lacking expression of both proteins. Analysis of the end products of 13C-enriched glucose excreted by these mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 contributes to the production of between 14 and 44% of the succinate excreted by the wild type cells. In addition, depletion of one or both FRD enzymes results in up to 2-fold reduction of the rate of glucose consumption. We propose that FRDm1 is involved in the maintenance of the redox balance in the mitochondrion, as proposed for the ancestral soluble FRD presumably present in primitive anaerobic cells. Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. The procyclic stage of T. brucei expresses a soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (FRDg) in the peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. This enzyme is responsible for the production of about 70% of the excreted succinate, the major end product of glucose metabolism in this form of the parasite. Here we functionally characterize a new gene encoding FRD (FRDm1) expressed in the procyclic stage. FRDm1 is a mitochondrial protein, as evidenced by immunolocalization, fractionation of digitonin-permeabilized cells, and expression of EGFP-tagged FRDm1 in the parasite. RNA interference was used to deplete FRDm1, FRDg, or both together. The analysis of the resulting mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 is responsible for 30% of the cellular NADH-FRD activity, which solves a long standing debate regarding the existence of a mitochondrial FRD in trypanosomatids. FRDg and FRDm1 together account for the total NADH-FRD activity in procyclics, because no activity was measured in the double mutant lacking expression of both proteins. Analysis of the end products of 13C-enriched glucose excreted by these mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 contributes to the production of between 14 and 44% of the succinate excreted by the wild type cells. In addition, depletion of one or both FRD enzymes results in up to 2-fold reduction of the rate of glucose consumption. We propose that FRDm1 is involved in the maintenance of the redox balance in the mitochondrion, as proposed for the ancestral soluble FRD presumably present in primitive anaerobic cells. Fumarate reductases (FRDs) 1The abbreviations used are: FRD, fumarate reductase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; RNAi, RNA interference; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ASCT, acetate: succinate CoA transferase; PPDK, pyruvate phosphate dikinase. catalyze the reduction of fumarate to succinate and can be divided into two classes of enzymes: those belonging to a multimeric complex associated with the respiratory chain and transferring electrons from a quinol to fumarate and the soluble enzymes, which transfer electrons from a noncovalently bound cofactor (NADH or FADH2/FMNH2) to fumarate. Most of the FRDs characterized so far belong to the first class (1Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These FRDs are structurally similar to succinate dehydrogenases (SDH), complex II of the respiratory chain. The Shewanella putrefaciens FRD is functionally equivalent to the membrane-bound enzymes by accepting/transferring electrons from/to the respiratory chain but is a soluble enzyme lacking a membrane anchor (2Pealing S.L. Black A.C. Manson F.D. Ward F.B. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12132-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To date, only two examples of soluble FRDs not linked to the respiratory chain (second class) have been described. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two soluble FRDs (cytosolic and promitochondrial) that use FADH2/FMNH2 as an electron donor (3Arikawa Y. Enomoto K. Muratsubaki H. Okazaki M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 165: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Muratsubaki H. Enomoto K. Ichijoh Y. Tezuka T. Katsume T. Prep. Biochem. 1994; 24: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar), and the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei expresses a soluble NADH-dependent FRD located in the peroxisome-like organelle, called glycosome (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Denicola A. Rubbo H. Haden L. Turrens J.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2002; 133: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic analysis of FRDs and SDHs showed that the membrane-bound enzymes form a monophyletic group distantly related to the soluble enzymes, including the S. putrefaciens FRD (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In 1980, Gest (7Gest H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 73-77Crossref Google Scholar) proposed that the membrane-bound FRDs evolved from an ancestral soluble enzyme and that the new features contributed to improvement of the energy-transducing system. In this model, the primitive organisms used anaerobic lactic fermentation of hexoses to generate energy. The metabolism subsequently evolved to “succinic fermentation” by introducing a couple of new enzymes, including a soluble FRD that was possibly NADH-dependent (7Gest H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 73-77Crossref Google Scholar, 8Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Kinetoplastid. Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Then association of FRD with the electron transfer chain in the membrane of the mitochondrion (first class of FRD) evolved to increase the rate of ATP production. The soluble FRDs of yeast and trypanosomes might therefore be the closest relatives of the ancestral FRD characterized so far. Trypanosomatids are protozoan parasites of major medical and veterinary significance. They cause serious diseases in humans such as sleeping sickness (T. brucei), Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and Leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.) and are important pathogens for domestic animals (Trypanosoma spp.) and for plants (Phytomonas). RNA interference (RNAi), a very powerful reverse genetic tool that allows specific inhibition of the expression of a target gene, has been recently developed in T. brucei (9Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 10Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem.

Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16DaRocha W.D. Otsu K. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, T. brucei has become a favorite model to study metabolism and other processes shared by trypanosomatid species. T. brucei differentiates into several adaptative forms during its life cycle. The bloodstream form in the mammalian host and the procyclic form in the midgut of the tsetse fly vector can be easily kept and genetically manipulated in axenic cell culture. The energy metabolism of the T. brucei bloodstream form is unique among trypanosomatids. This form relies entirely on glycolysis (which takes place in the glycosome) with pyruvate as the main excreted end product, whereas the mitochondrion plays a minor role (17Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the T. brucei procyclic form and the other adaptative forms of trypanosomatids have a more elaborate energy metabolism that is characterized by aerobic fermentation of glucose, with excretion of partially oxidized end products, such as succinate, acetate, and lactate (17Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 18Cazzulo J.J.

Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The original model of the glucose metabolism in the procyclic trypanosomes, established 20 years ago (17Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar), has recently been revised (21Besteiro S. Barrett M.P. Rivière L. Bringaud F. Trends Parasitol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the updated model (Fig. 1, gray arrows), part of the phosphoenolpyruvate produced in the cytosol enters the glycosome to produce succinate, which is excreted (steps 13, 15–17) (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The other part of phosphoenolpyruvate is used to produce pyruvate through pyruvate kinase in the cytosol (step 12) (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

Then pyruvate enters the mitochondrion to produce acetyl-CoA and then acetate (steps 21–24) (23Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Rivière L. van Weelden S.W. Glass P. Vegh P. Coustou V. Biran M. van Hellemond J.J. Bringaud F. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol.

Moreover, it was shown that acetyl-CoA is not metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (25Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that substrate level phosphorylation is essential for ATP production when glucose is the major carbon source (22Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

Succinate is the main end product excreted by procyclic trypanosomes grown in SDM79 medium, which contains both glucose and proline. Proline is stoichiometrically converted to succinate and carbon dioxide in the mitochondrion (25Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Approximately 70% of the excreted end products derived from glucose metabolism is also succinate, most of it being produced by the glycosomal NADH-dependent FRD (FRDg) (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the origin of the remaining glucose-derived succinate is unknown, and we proposed that another NADH-FRD may be involved (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the 1990s the existence of fumarate reductase in trypanosomatids was highly controversial (27Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Turrens J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 346-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 347-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Turrens and co-workers identified a soluble NADH-FRD activity in fractions enriched for mitochondrial markers in T. brucei and T. cruzi (6Denicola A. Rubbo H. Haden L. Turrens J.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2002; 133: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Boveris A. Hertig C.M. Turrens J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 19: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Mracek J. Snyder S.J. Chavez U.B. Turrens J.F. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it was suggested that this activity might correspond to a reversal of the reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial SDH (27Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The involvement of a putative mitochondrial NADH-FRD in the production of succinate is still debated. Here, we describe two new FRD genes (FRDm1 and FRDm2) present in the genome of T. brucei that are similar to the glycosomal FRDg gene. FRDm1 is expressed in the mitochondrion of procyclic trypanosomes, whereas the FRDm2 gene product is not detectable. By using a combination of RNAi and NMR analysis of d-[1-13C]glucose metabolism, we showed that FRDm1 is responsible for ∼30% of the total cellular NADH-FRD activity and for the production of approximately ∼25% (between 14 and 44%) of the excreted succinate from glucose metabolism. The role of FRDm1 in the energy metabolism of the procyclic trypanosomes and the regulation of glucose metabolism will be discussed. Cell Cultures—The procyclic form of T. brucei EATRO1125 and EATRO1125.T7T were cultured at 27 °C in SDM79 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 3.5 mg·ml–1 hemin (SDM79/fetal calf serum) (32Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). The bloodstream form of T. brucei AnTat1 was grown in rats and isolated by DEAE ion exchange chromatography, as described previously (33Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing of the FRD Genes—The FRDg gene, which we previously characterized (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), was used as a α-32P-labeled probe to screen a genomic library of T. brucei AnTat1 constructed in the c2×75 cosmid vector (34Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have selected two clones, called CosFRD4 and CosFRD11, that contained a single (FRDm1) or two (FRDg and FRDm2) FRD gene copies, respectively. Both cosmid clones were mapped, and the CosFRD11 clone DNA was HpaI- or HindIII-digested and subcloned into the HincII- or HindIII-digested pUC18 vector (Appligene), respectively. The resulting recombinant colonies were screened with the α-32P-labeled FRDg probe to identify fragments containing a part or the totality of the FRDg and FRDm2 genes. The FRDm1 gene from the CosFRD4 cosmid clone and the pUC18 clones containing FRDg or FRDm2 gene fragments were sequenced with the Big Dye Terminator v.1.1 cycle sequencing kit (ABI PRISM™; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using specific oligonucleotides as primers, as described by the manufacturer. DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the DNA STRIDER program, and data base searches were done with BLAST. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were obtained using MacVector 6.0.1, and the MITOPROT program (mips.gsf.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter) was used to determine the putative mitochondrial targeting signal. Inhibition of FRDg and/or FRDm1 Genes Expression by RNAi—The inhibition by RNAi of FRDm1 and/or FRDg expression in the procyclic forms (9Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) was performed by expression of stem-loop “sense/antisense” molecules of the targeted sequences (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N.

Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) introduced in the pLew79 expression vector (kindly provided by E. Wirtz and G. Cross) (35Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Construction of the pLew-FRDg-SAS plasmid, which target FRDg expression, was described before (5Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The same approach was used to generate the pLew-FRDm1-SAS plasmid, which target the 5′-end of the FRDm1 gene (bp 1–230) and 242 bp of the untranslated region preceding the gene. Briefly, a PCR-amplified 520-bp fragment containing the antisense sequence (449 bp of targeted sequence plus 50 bp used as a spacer to form the loop between the annealing sense and antisense sequences) and the restriction sites added to the primers were inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew79 plasmid. Then a PCR-amplified 496-bp fragment containing the sense sequence was inserted, upstream of the antisense sequence, in HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (XhoI was introduced at the 3′-extremity of the antisense PCR fragment). To target the FRDg and FRDm1 genes together, we produced by overlapping PCR chimerical sense and antisense molecules composed of the DNA fragments used to target FRDg and FRDm1. For the chimeric sense molecule, we generated by PCR an FRDg-S fragment flanked by HindIII (5′-extremity) and the first 20 bp of the FRDm1-S fragment (3′-extremity) and an FRDm1-S fragment flanked by the first 20 bp of the FRDg-S fragment (5′-extremity) and XhoI (3′-extremity). Then the sense chimeric fragment was produced by overlapping PCR, using as primers the 5′ and 3′ primers used to PCR amplify the FRDg-S and FRDm1-S fragments, respectively, and using as matrix the gel-purified FRDg-S and FRDm1-S fragments. The resulting 926-bp PCR fragment is composed of the FRDg gene/3′-untranslated region fragment (453 bp) followed by the FRDm1 gene/5′-untranslated region fragment (449 bp) and flanked by the HindIII (5′-extremity) and XhoI (3′-extremity) restriction sites. We used the same approach to generate the chimeric antisense molecule, which is composed of the FRDm1-AS fragment containing a 50-bp extension as compared with the FRDm1-S fragment (spacer between the sense and antisense chimeric sequences) followed by the FRDg-AS fragment (453 bp) and flanked by the HindIII and XhoI (5′-extremity) and BamHI (3′-extremity) restriction sites. The HindIII/BamHI-digested chimeric antisense fragment was inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew79 plasmid. Then the HindIII/XhoI-digested chimeric sense fragment was inserted, upstream of the chimeric antisense sequence, in the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the recombinant pLew79 plasmid. The resulting plasmids (pLew-FRDg-SAS, pLew-FRDm1-SAS, and pLew-FRDg/m1-SAS containing the a chimeric construct), each have a sense and antisense version of the targeted gene fragment(s), separated by a 36- or 50-bp fragment, under the control of the PARP promoter linked to a prokaryotic tetracycline operator. The EATRO1125 procyclic form cell line (EATRO1125.T7T), constitutively expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and the tetracycline repressor under the dependence of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for inducible control by tetracycline (10Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was transformed with the plasmids. Trypanosome transfection and selection of phleomycin-resistant clones were performed as previously reported (10Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Expression of EGFP-tagged FRDm1 in Trypanosomes—The pLew79 expression vector was used to produce recombinant FRDm1 proteins tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) optimized for fluorescence and expression in mammalian cells. The EGFP gene, preceded by a multicloning site (HindIII, BclI, XhoI, AgeI, HpaI, MluI, XbaI, and NdeI) was subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI restriction site of the pLew79 vector. Then PCR fragments corresponding to the first 800 amino acids of FRDm1 (pLew-FRDm1–1/800.EGFP) or the same region deleted for the N-terminal 68 residues (pLew-FRDm1–69/800.EGFP) were inserted into the HpaI and XbaI restriction sites of the pLew-EGFP plasmid. Both plasmids were introduced in the EATRO1125.T7T cell line, as described above. Production of FRD Antibodies—To produce antibodies that would recognize all three FRD isoforms, the fumarate reductase domain of FRDm1 (from amino acid positions 459 to 979), which presents 72% identity with the corresponding domain of FRDg and FRDm2, was PCR-amplified (1572 bp DNA fragments) and cloned into the pET23a expression vector (Novagen). To raise anti-FRDm1 specific antibodies, a PCR-amplified DNA fragment (1362 bp) corresponding to the N-terminal domain of FRDm1 (from amino acid positions 1 to 450) was cloned in the same expression vector. This was also done for the equivalent domain of FRDg (from amino acid positions 1 to 355) to be used for immunoadsorption (see below). The pET23a vector, which contains six histidine codons between the multicloning site and a stop codon, is designed to express C-terminal histidine-tagged recombinant proteins, such as FRD-his (pET23a-FRD; FRD domain of FRDm1), FRDm1-his (pET23a-FRDm1; N-terminal domain of FRDm1), or FRDg-his (pET23a-FRDg; N-terminal domain of FRDg). Induction of Escherichia coli BL21 cells, transformed with pET23a recombinant plasmids, was performed for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the recombinant proteins were purified by nickel chelation chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisera were raised in rabbits by three injections at 15-day intervals of 200 μg of FRD-his or FRDm1-his recombinant nickel-purified proteins, electroeluted after separation on SDS-PAGE, and emulsified with complete (first injection) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The specificity of the produced immune sera was assayed against the different FRD recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli, by Western blot analysis. Because the anti-FRDm1 immune serum cross-reacted with FRDg, immunoadsorptions were performed by incubating 1:5 PBS diluted rabbit anti-FRDm1 for 2 h at room temperature with the FRDg-his recombinant protein linked onto nickel beads. FRDm1-specific antibodies depleted from FRDg-cross-reacting epitope reactivity were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation. The anti-FRDg immune serum previously produced against a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the 23 C-terminal amino acids of FRDg, recognizes a single 120-kDa band and is considered to be specific to FRDg (5Besteiro S.

Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts of the wild type or mutant procyclic form or bloodstream form of T. brucei (107 cells) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and immunoblotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed as described (37Harlow E. Lane D.

https://openalex.org/W1987420197,"Reelin is a huge secreted protein that controls proper laminar formation in the developing brain. It is generally believed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled1 (Dab1) by Src family tyrosine kinases is the most critical downstream event in Reelin signaling. The receptors for Reelin belong to the low density lipoprotein receptor family, most of whose members undergo regulated intracellular trafficking. In this study, we propose novel roles for Dab1 in Reelin signaling. We first demonstrated that cell surface expression of Reelin receptors was decreased in Dab1-deficient neurons. In heterologous cells, Dab1 enhanced cell surface expression of Reelin receptors, and this effect was mediated by direct interaction with the receptors. Moreover, Dab1 did not stably associate with the receptors at the plasma membrane in the resting state. When Reelin was added to primary cortical neurons, Dab1 was recruited to the receptors, and its tyrosine residues were phosphorylated. Although Reelin and Dab1 colocalized well shortly after the addition of Reelin, Dab1 was no longer associated with internalized Reelin. When Src family tyrosine kinases were inhibited, internalization of Reelin was severely abrogated, and Reelin colocalized with Dab1 near the plasma membrane for a prolonged period. Taken together, these results indicate that Dab1 regulates both cell surface expression and internalization of Reelin receptors, and these regulations may play a role in correct laminar formation in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W1965667290,"Pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts (FBPA) may play a central role in lung vascular remodeling under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation, the result being pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. In cultured human FBPA, both angiotensin II (Ang II) and hypoxia promoted cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. These effects were further enhanced when both stimuli were applied simultaneously. Hypoxia elevated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and increased the expression of genes regulated by the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). Up-regulation of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1) was also observed. Exogenous Ang II further increased HIF/HRE-dependent signaling in FBPA, whereas suppression of the autocrine ACE-Ang II-AT1 loop with inhibitors of ACE, AT1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) reduced the proliferative response to both hypoxia and exogenous Ang II. Overexpression of HIF-1alpha by transient transfection caused the same proliferative effect and up-regulation of AT1 expression that were observed under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, small interfering RNA targeting HIF-1alpha inhibited hypoxia-induced ACE and AT1 expression. Our studies indicate that the ACE-Ang II-AT1 system serves as a positive feedback loop and fosters FBPA proliferation under hypoxic conditions, with the PI3K-HIF-HRE axis as the central effector pathway. This pathway may thus facilitate vascular remodeling under hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2017606019,"The Link module from human TSG-6, a hyaladherin with roles in ovulation and inflammation, has a hyaluronan (HA)-binding groove containing two adjacent tyrosine residues that are likely to form CH-pi stacking interactions with sequential rings in the sugar. We have used this observation to construct a model of a protein.HA complex, which was then tested against existing experimental information and by acquisition of new NMR data sets of [(13)C, (15)N]HA (8-mer) complexed with unlabeled protein. A major finding of this analysis was that acetamido side chains of two GlcNAc rings fit into hydrophobic pockets on either side of the adjacent tyrosines, providing a selectivity mechanism of HA over other polysaccharides. Furthermore, two basic residues have a separation that matches that of glucuronic acids in the sugar, consistent with the formation of salt bridges; NMR experiments at a range of pH values identified protein groups that titrate due to their proximity to a free carboxylate in HA. Sequence alignment and construction of homology models for all human Link modules in their HA-bound states revealed that many of these features are conserved across the superfamily, thus allowing the prediction of functionally important residues. In the case of cartilage link protein, its two Link modules were docked together (using bound HA as a guide), identifying hydrophobic residues likely to form an intra-Link module interface as well as amino acids that could be involved in supporting intermolecular interactions between link proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Here, we propose a mechanism for ternary complex formation that generates higher order helical structures, as may exist in cartilage aggregates."

The cell wall envelope of staphylococci and other Grampositive bacteria functions as a surface organelle for microbial interaction with host tissues during infection. Many pathogenic strategies of staphylococci require the function of surface proteins that interact with extracellular matrices, specific host molecules, or target cells, thereby enabling bacterial adherence to tissues, target cell invasion, or evasion of immune responses (1Foster T.J.

Cells were suspended in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for mutanolysin digestion or 1 ml of equilibration buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) for lysostaphin, Φ11 hydrolase, and Φ11Δ digestions. Cell wall components were solubilized with 700 units/ml mutanolysin (Sigma) and 70 μg/ml lysostaphin, Φ11 hydrolase, or Φ11Δ. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by addition of 1 ml of 1:5 chloroform/methanol solution (46Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar), washed with 1 ml of methanol, and suspended in 100 μlof loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.5 m β-mercpatoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromophenol blue). Five μl of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. IsdC was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit antiIsdC polyclonal serum. The membrane was blocked in the presence of human IgG (12.5 μg/ml; Sigma) to prevent the non-immune binding of protein A. Proteinase K Digestion of Surface Proteins—S. aureus RN4220 (pHTT4, encoding SEB-MH6-CWSSpa) and SKM15 (pAMP2, encoding SEB-MH6-CWSIsdC) cultures were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol to A600 ∼ 1.0. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 6000 × g, washed twice with TSM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m sucrose), and suspended in the same buffer. Three 1-ml aliquots of staphylococcal suspensions were dispensed into reaction vials. One sample was treated with 150 μg of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science), and the three samples were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with mild shaking. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min; the supernatant removed; and staphylococci were suspended in 1 ml of TSM buffer containing 20 μgof lysostaphin (Ambi) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Staphylococcal protoplasts were sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min, and 1-ml supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and either treated with 150 μg of proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C or left untreated. Proteins in all samples were precipitated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and suspended in 100 μl of loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE; transferred to a PVDF membrane; and analyzed by staining with nickel-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce), followed by chemiluminescence development. Purification of Cell Wall-anchored SEB-MH6-CWSIsdC—Cell walls isolated from 2 liters of S. aureus SKM15 (pAMP2) culture were washed with 100 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and suspended in 30 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for mutanolysin digestion or in 30 ml of equilibration buffer for lysostaphin, Φ11 hydrolase, and Φ11Δ digestions. To each cell wall suspension were added 20,000 units of mutanolysin, 2 mg of lysostaphin, 2 mg of Φ11 hydrolase, or 2 mg of Φ11Δ. Digestion proceeded for 16 h at 37 °C with mild agitation. Solubilized cell wall fragments and surface proteins were separated from undigested insoluble cell walls by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 15 min. SEB-MH6-CWSIsdC was purified from the lysate supernatant by affinity chromatography using 1 ml of Ni-NTA pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of equilibration buffer. The column was successively washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, 10 ml of wash buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, and 10 ml of wash buffer. Finally, proteins were eluted by a step gradient of imidazole from 50 to 500 mm. Preparation of C-terminal Anchor Peptides—Purified SEB-MH6-CW-SIsdC was methanol/chloroform-precipitated, dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant), and suspended in 3 ml of 70% formic acid. One g of cyanogen bromide was added, and cleavage reactions were incubated for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. The cleaved peptides were dried under vacuum, washed twice with water, and suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 8.0). Samples were loaded onto a column packed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml each of buffer A, buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), and buffer B at pH 6.3. Elution was carried out with 2 ml of buffer A at pH 4.3. When peptides were derived from mutanolysin-solubilized SEB-MH6-CWSIsdC, N-acetylmuramic acid residues were reduced with sodium borohydride to generate N-acetylmuramitol, thereby facilitating HPLC separation and mass spectrometric analysis (47Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, peptides were subjected to RP-HPLC on a Hypersil C18 column (2 × 250 mm; Keystone Scientific Inc.). Separation was carried out at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient starting 10 min after injection from 99% H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 99% CH3CN (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 100 min. Elution of peptides was monitored at 215 nm, and 1-min fractions were collected. MALDI Mass Spectrometry—Dried HPLC fractions containing peptides of interest were suspended in 15 μl of CH3CN/water/trifluoroacetic acid (30:70:0.1). MALDI mass spectra were obtained on a Reflectron time-of-flight instrument (ABI Biosystems) in the reflection mode. Samples (0.5 μl) were co-spotted with 0.5 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) in CH3CN/water/trifluoroacetic acid (70:30:0.1)). All samples were externally calibrated to a standard of bovine insulin. Solublization of IsdC from the Staphylococcal Cell Wall with Murein Hydrolases—IsdC is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a 227-amino acid precursor with an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal NPQTN-type sorting signal (38Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Using signal peptide algorithms and canonical sorting signal cleavage site predictions, Ala29 was identified as the N-terminal residue and Thr192 as the C-terminal residue of mature IsdC. The calculated molecular mass of predicted mature IsdC is 18,140 Da. To analyze the cell wall anchor structure of IsdC, we sought to solubilize the polypeptide from the staphylococcal peptidoglycan with murein hydrolases. Staphylococci were grown in tryptic soy broth with or without 2,2′-dipyridyl, an iron-chelating reagent, thereby activating isd expression (38Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Staphylococci were harvested by centrifugation, and their peptidoglycan was digested with murein hydrolases. Proteins in cell wall lysates were precipitated with chloroform/methanol and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and IsdC revealed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Mock treatment of staphylococci without murein hydrolase did not release IsdC from the cell wall envelope (data not shown). Lysostaphin, a glycylglycine endopeptidase that cleaves pentaglycine cross-bridges of staphylococcal cell walls (Fig. 1A) (48Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), solubilized IsdC as a single species of 19 kDa (Fig. 1B). Φ11 hydrolase cleaves the amide bond of MurNAc– l-Ala as well as the d-Ala–Gly peptide bond of the S. aureus peptidoglycan (45Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15847-15856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and released IsdC as a species with a uniform mass, migrating somewhat more slowly upon SDS-PAGE than the lysostaphin-solubilized counterpart. These observations suggest that IsdC must be linked to the staphylococcal cell wall, as murein hydrolase treatment was required to release IsdC. Cell wall digestion with mutanolysin, a muramidase that cuts the repeating disaccharide MurNAc-GlcNAc (49Calandra G.B. Cole R. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Yokogawa K. Kawata S. Nishimura S. Ikeda Y. Yoshimura Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 6: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), solubilized IsdC as a spectrum of seven fragments with different masses. The fastest migrating species displayed a mass similar to that of Φ11 hydrolase-released IsdC, whereas the other six muramidase-released species migrated more slowly and with decreasing intensity upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). In a previous report, mutanolysin treatment of staphylococci pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine was used to release SEB-CWSIsdC, a hybrid containing the IsdC sorting signal (CWSIsdC) fused to the SEB polypeptide. The solubilized fusion proteins were captured by immunoprecipitation and detected by autoradiography (40Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachimiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In contrast to our observations reported here, a single mutanolysin-released SEB-CWSIsdC species was found (40Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachimiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy appears to be due to the pulse-labeling technique, as immunoprecipitation and autoradiography detected only the most abundant SEB-CWSIsdC species (40Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachimiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The Φ11Δ enzyme cleaves the peptide bond of d-Ala–Gly, but not the amide bond of MurNAc–l-Ala (45Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15847-15856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Treatment with Φ11Δ released three IsdC fragments from the cell wall, all of which migrated more slowly than the Φ11 hydrolase- and lysostaphin-released counterparts. Thus, it appears that IsdC is linked to the pentaglycine cross-bridges of the staphylococcal cell wall, as only treatment with lysostaphin and Φ11 hydrolase, i.e. enzymes that directly cut cross-bridges or excise cross-bridges with wall peptides, released IsdC with a uniform mass. Cleavage of only glycan strands (mutanolysin) or cross-bridges (Φ11Δ) each released distinct spectra of IsdC fragments, consistent with the hypothesis that the polypeptides must be linked to polymerized MurNAc-GlcNAc chains as well as wall peptides with some degree of cross-linking. Surface Display of SEB-MH6-CWSIsdC and SEB-MH6-CWSSpa—Fusion of sorting signal sequences to the C-terminal end of SEB, a highly expressed exoprotein, generates cell wall-anchored hybrids (14Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We wondered whether SEB hybrids anchored via NPQTN sorting signals display similar properties as wild-type IsdC. Previous work showed that IsdC is sequestered in the staphylococcal envelope and protected from extracellular protease, whereas sortase A-anchored surface proteins (IsdA and IsdB) are not (40Mazmanian S.K.

https://openalex.org/W1975091138,"The protein kinase GCN2 mediates translational control of gene expression in amino acid-starved cells by phosphorylating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of GCN2 by uncharged tRNAs in starved cells requires its direct interaction with both the GCN1·GCN20 regulatory complex and ribosomes. GCN1 also interacts with ribosomes in cell extracts, but it was unknown whether this activity is crucial for its ability to stimulate GCN2 function in starved cells. We describe point mutations in two conserved, noncontiguous segments of GCN1 that lead to reduced polyribosome association by GCN1·GCN20 in living cells without reducing GCN1 expression or its interaction with GCN20. Mutating both segments simultaneously produced a greater reduction in polyribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20 and a stronger decrease in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α phosphorylation than did mutating in one segment alone. These findings provide strong evidence that ribosome binding by GCN1 is required for its role as a positive regulator of GCN2. A particular mutation in the GCN1 domain, related in sequence to translation elongation factor 3 (eEF3), decreased GCN2 activation much more than it reduced ribosome binding by GCN1. Hence, the eEF3-like domain appears to have an effector function in GCN2 activation. This conclusion supports the model that an eEF3-related activity of GCN1 influences occupancy of the ribosomal decoding site by uncharged tRNA in starved cells.

This conclusion supports the model that an eEF3-related activity of GCN1 influences occupancy of the ribosomal decoding site by uncharged tRNA in starved cells. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; GAAC, general amino acid control; HisRS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; eEF3, eukaryotic elongation factor 3; A-site, acceptor site; WCE, whole cell extract; 3AT, 3-amino-2,4-triazole; SC, synthetic complete. provides a key mechanism for down-regulating protein synthesis in response to nutrient starvation or stress in mammalian and yeast cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). In its GTP-bound state, the heterotrimeric eIF2 complex delivers initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosome at an early stage of the initiation pathway. The eIF2 is ultimately released from the ribosome in an inactive GDP-bound state and must be recycled to eIF2·GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B for a new round of initiation to occur. Phosphorylation of eIF2α converts eIF2·GDP to an inhibitor of eIF2B, interfering with eIF2 recycling and decreasing the rate of translation initiation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF2α phosphorylation also increases the translation of GCN4 mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes subject to general amino acid control (GAAC). Thus, the rate of amino acid biosynthesis is stimulated by GCN4 in parallel with the reduction in general protein synthesis as a dual mechanism for replenishing amino acids in starved yeast cells. The diminished initiator methionyl-tRNA recruitment produced by eIF2α phosphorylation allows ribosomes to overcome the inhibitory function of four upstream open reading frames present in the GCN4 mRNA leader and initiate at the GCN4 start codon instead (reviewed in Ref. 1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, expression of transcription factor ATF4 is stimulated at the translational level in response to eIF2α phosphorylation by a mechanism involving upstream open reading frames very similar to that elucidated for GCN4 mRNA in yeast (2Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 3Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Mammals contain four eIF2α kinases (PKR, PERK, HRI, and GCN2) activated in response to different kinds of stress or starvation, whereas GCN2 is the sole member of this kinase subfamily in S. cerevisiae. GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid-starved cells and bind to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS)-like domain located C-terminal to the kinase domain (1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). We showed previously that GCN2 activation in starved cells additionally requires interaction of the GCN2 N-terminal domain with the GCN1·GCN20 regulatory complex through a C-terminal segment of GCN1 (residues 2052–2428 within area D shown in Fig. 1A) (4Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). GCN1 is a large, 296-kDa protein containing a central domain with strong sequence similarity to the N-terminal portion of fungal translation elongation factor 3 (eEF3) (6Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). eEF3 promotes release of deacylated tRNAs from the ribosomal exit site and thereby stimulates delivery of charged tRNAs to the acceptor site (A-site) by eEF1A·GTP (7Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The eEF3-like domain in GCN1 contains the binding domain for the N-terminal portion of GCN20 (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the remainder of GCN20 is related to the C terminus of eEF3, including the two ATP-binding cassettes (9Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, formation of the GCN1·GCN20 complex juxtaposes the domains in these two proteins that are related to different segments of eEF3 (Fig. 1). GCN1 associates with elongating ribosomes (polyribosomes) in cell extracts, and this interaction is stimulated by ATP in a manner dependent on the ATP-binding cassettes in GCN20 (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GCN2 also has ribosome binding activity that appears to be critical for its function in vivo (10Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GCN1 and GCN2 both bind to polyribosomes in cell extracts independent of the respective domains required for their interaction with one another (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Likewise, complex formation between GCN1 and GCN2 can occur in the absence of their ribosome binding domains (4Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that GCN1 and GCN2 independently contact one another and the 80 S ribosome to promote assembly of a GCN1·GCN20·GCN2 regulatory complex on polyribosomes. As gcn1Δ mutants are more resistant than wild type to the drug paromomycin (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which binds to the A-site of small ribosomal subunits in bacteria (12Schroeder R. Waldsich C. Wank H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), GCN1 binding to the ribosome apparently alters A-site function. Together, these findings led us to propose that GCN1·GCN20 functions on translating ribosomes to promote binding of uncharged tRNA to the A-site or in the transfer of uncharged tRNA from the A-site to the HisRS-like domain in GCN2 for kinase activation (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proposed mechanism resembles that demonstrated in Escherichia coli for activation of RelA protein by uncharged tRNA bound to the A-site, which mediates the stringent response to amino acid starvation in bacteria (13Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Magasanik B. Low K.B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1410-1438Google Scholar, 14Goldman E. Jakubowski H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2035-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We showed previously that deletions of regions A, B, or C in GCN1, encompassing the N-terminal 77% of the protein (see Fig. 1A), destroys GCN1 regulatory function and impairs ATP-dependent polyribosome binding by GCN1 in cell extracts (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This result suggested that GCN1 has multiple points of contact with the ribosome. Although the deletions of regions A, B, or C did not destabilize the remainder of GCN1 protein or impair its interaction with GCN2, it is possible that these large deletions destroy another function of GCN1 other than ribosome binding. Hence, it was uncertain whether stable ribosome association by the GCN1·GCN20 complex is crucial for its function in activating GCN2. To validate this important aspect of our model, we set out to isolate point mutations in GCN1 that would impair polyribosome binding by GCN1 without affecting GCN1 expression or complex formation with GCN2 or GCN20. We also wanted to determine the effects of these mutations on activation of GCN2 and the GAAC response. From analysis of such mutations in conserved residues found in regions B and C, we have obtained strong evidence that GCN1-ribosome interaction is essential for GCN2 activation. Our results further demonstrate that specific residues in the eEF3-related domain of GCN1 function in signal transduction beyond their role in promoting ribosome binding by the GCN1·GCN20 complex.

In a subsequent PCR reaction, the two PCR amplifications were fused together using primers ES900-7 and ES900-8. The NheI-MluI-digested PCR fragment was ligated into the similarly digested plasmid p2367, yielding pES182-8. The low copy plasmid pES257-12-2, containing gcn1-M7D, was constructed similarly to plasmid pES182-8, using primers ES900-11 and ES900-12 instead of primers ES900-9 and ES900-10. For the construction of the low copy plasmid pES263-34-1, containing gcn1-M1A/M7A, the MluI-SalI fragment of pES182-8 was replaced by the MluI-SalI insert yielded from pES176-4. Polyribosome Analysis of Cell Extracts from Cross-linked Cells—In vivo association of proteins with polyribosomes was determined as described previously with a few modifications (16Nielsen K.H. Szamecz B. Valasek L. Jivotovskaya A. Shin B.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1166-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to exponential phase in 300 ml of SC medium to an A600 of ∼1 in 1-liter baffled flasks. Cells were poured into a 400-ml centrifuge bottle containing 75 g of ice chips and 8.1 ml of formaldehyde (1% final concentration). Cells were then mixed and incubated on ice for 1 h with gentle mixing every 15 min. Cells were pelleted for 3 min at 4000 rpm (model J6 centrifuge, Beckman), washed with 6 ml of breaking buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 Complete protease inhibitor tablet without EDTA (Roche Applied Science) per 25 ml, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, and 0.1 mg/ml each of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin), and resuspended in 400 μl of breaking buffer. Cells were broken with a volume of glass beads equivalent to the volume of packed cells by vortexing eight times for 30-s with 30 s intervals on ice water. Cell debris was removed via centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf) for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and 20 A260 units of extract were resolved on a 4.5–45% sucrose density gradient by centrifugation for 2 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C using the SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). 700-μl fractions were collected whereas scanning continuously for A254 units using the Brandel density gradient fractionator, model BR-184. Protein Techniques—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using gradient gels (4–12% Tris/glycine gels, Invitrogen; 4–20% criterion gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen or Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using antibodies against GCN20 (CV1317, 1:2000 (9Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)), eIF2α (1:2000 (17Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar)), eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser-51 (1:5000, Bio-Source International, Inc.), actin (1:5000 (18Mulholland J. Preuss D. Moon A. Wong A. Drubin D. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar)), RPL39 (1:5000, from Dr. Maurice Swanson), or c-myc (1:1000, Roche Applied Science). Immune complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to donkey anti-rabbit antibodies, to sheep anti-mouse antibodies (for detection of c-myc antibodies), or to protein A (for detection of actin antibodies) (Amersham Biosciences). Basic Residues in Area B of GCN1 Are Required for Optimal Polyribosome Binding in Vivo—We showed previously that ribosome binding by GCN1 was impaired by deletions of areas A, B, or C, which together comprise 2052 amino acids or roughly two-thirds of the protein (Fig. 1A) (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that GCN1 has multiple ribosome contact points. In an effort to identify specific amino acids involved in ribosome binding, we performed sequence alignments of GCN1 proteins from different eukaryotic species and identified a region that is rich in basic amino acids and is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 1C). To test the importance of this conserved region for ribosome binding by S. cerevisiae GCN1, we substituted the 12 basic amino acids in this conserved motif with either uncharged Ala residues (the M7A mutation) or negatively charged Asp residues (M7D) and tested the full-length mutant GCN1 proteins for ribosome binding in yeast strains lacking chromosomal GCN1. Cells expressing the mutant GCN1 proteins from alleles carried on low copy plasmids under the native GCN1 promoter were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link GCN1 to ribosomes in vivo prior to preparing whole cell extracts (WCEs). The WCEs were resolved by velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients, and the distributions of GCN1, GCN20, and the 60 S ribosomal subunit protein RPL39 across the fractions were determined by Western analysis. In the wild-type GCN1 strain, GCN1 displayed a bimodal distribution. The majority of the protein and the largest polyribosomes were between fractions 13–15, and species sedimenting more slowly than 40 S subunits were contained in fractions 1–3 (Fig. 2A). GCN20 showed a similar distribution across the gradient, consistent with the idea that these two proteins bind to ribosomes as a complex (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that the fractions of GCN1 and GCN20 co-sedimenting with polyribosomes can be shifted to 80 S fractions by a light treatment of the WCE with micrococcal nuclease, which converts the polyribosomes to 80 S subunits, thus proving that GCN1 and GCN20 are associated with the polyribosomes (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of the M7A and M7D substitutions on polyribosome binding by GCN1 and GCN20, we quantified the Western signals in fractions 14 and 15 for each mutant, normalized them for the RPL39 signals in the same fractions, and expressed the normalized values as a fraction of the corresponding values measured for wild-type GCN1 (Fig. 2, B and C). (All GCN1 proteins showed a similar distribution in our sedimentation assays, with most of the polyribosomes and polyribosome-associated GCN1 and GCN20 in fraction 14 and 15.) From the results of two replicate experiments, we found that the M7A and M7D mutations reduced polyribosome binding by GCN1 to ∼75 and ∼40% of wild type, respectively, and had similar effects on polyribosome binding by GCN20 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the basic residues in the conserved motif in area B of GCN1 are required for optimal ribosome binding by the GCN1·GCN20 complex in vivo. Residues Conserved between GCN1 and eEF3 in Area C Cooperate with Basic Residues in Area B to Promote Ribosome binding by GCN1 in Vivo—GCN1 has homology to the N terminus of eEF3, and the eEF3 N terminus (amino acids 98–388) interacts with 18 S rRNA in vitro (19Gontarek R.R. Li H. Nurse K. Presscott C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10249-10252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that the eEF3-like region is involved in ribosome binding. In a past screen we attempted to identify amino acids in the eEF3-like region that are essential for GCN1 function. Sets of 5–10 amino acids conserved among the eEF3-like regions in GCN1 proteins were substituted by Ala in full-length GCN1, and gcn1Δ strains harboring the corresponding mutant gcn1 alleles were scored for growth on the amino acid analog 3-amino-2,4-triazole (3AT). 3AT causes histidine starvation, and only strains able to activate GCN2 can overcome histidine starvation and grow on medium containing 3AT. In this screen (data not shown), we found that one of our gcn1 mutations rendered GCN1 non-functional in activating GCN2. This mutation contained six Ala substitutions in a block of conserved residues that were, in part, also conserved in eEF3 (the M1A allele, Fig. 1B). In this study, we asked whether these amino acids are involved in ribosome binding. We found that the M1 mutation led to reductions of 20–30% in polyribosome association of GCN1 and GCN20 (Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, the M1A mutations exacerbated the polyribosome-binding defects of GCN1 and GCN20 produced by the M7A substitutions described above, with the M1A/M7A double mutant showing substantially less GCN1·GCN20 binding to polyribosomes (∼40% of wild type) than did the single mutants (70–80% of wild type) (Fig. 2C). These last findings suggest that the M1 and M7 residues function additively in promoting ribosome binding by GCN1. Reduced Ribosome Binding of Mutant GCN1 Proteins Does Not Result from Defects in GCN1 Expression or GCN20 Interaction—We ruled out the possibility that the reduced ribosome binding of GCN1·GCN20 produced by the M1 and M7 mutations results from decreased expression of the mutant proteins by conducting Western blot analysis of WCEs prepared from the appropriate wild-type and gcn1 mutant strains (Fig. 3). Previously, we presented evidence that ribosome binding by GCN1 is regulated by its interaction with GCN20 (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence, it was important to determine whether the M1 and M7 mutations impair the GCN1-GCN20 interaction in vivo. This issue is particularly relevant for the M1 mutation because it alters residues in proximity to Gly-1444, shown previously to be required for interaction of GCN1 with GCN20. By conducting co-immunoprecipitation analysis of GCN1-GCN20 association in WCEs using anti-GCN1 antibodies, we found that all of the mutant GCN1 proteins were associated with GCN20 to the same degree as seen for wild-type GCN1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Additional evidence that the GCN1 mutations do not disrupt the GCN1·GCN20 complex is that they do not reduce the steady-state expression of GCN20 (Fig. 4A). We showed previously that substituting GCN1 residue Gly-1444 with Asp (the gcn1-D1444G allele) reduces GCN1-GCN20 interaction and greatly reduces the steady-state level of GCN20 (as does deletion of GCN1), presumably because GCN20 is more prone to degradation outside of the GCN1·GCN20 complex (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that the M1 and M7 substitutions do not reduce GCN20 levels further supports that GCN1-GCN20 interaction is unaffected by these GCN1 mutations. We performed a final in vivo test to confirm that mutating the M1 residues does not impair GCN1-GCN20 interaction. The disruption of GCN1-GCN20 interaction by the gcn1-D1444G mutation impairs the GAAC response to histidine starvation (8Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A defect in activation of GCN2 kinase function by GCN1·GCN20, with consequent failure to induce GCN4 and amino acid biosynthetic genes under its control, reduces cell growth on medium containing the inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, 3AT. Interestingly, we found that the 3AT-sensitive phenotype of the gcn1-D1444G mutant, but not that of the gcn1Δ strain, is partially suppressed by GCN20 overexpression (Fig. 4C, cf. rows 1 and 4, upper panels). This suppression of gcn1-D1444G can be explained by proposing a partial restoration of complex formation between GCN20 and the gcn1-D1444G product by mass action at elevated concentrations of GCN20. Importantly, the 3AT-sensitive phenotype of the gcn1-M1A strain was not suppressed by GCN20 overexpression, supporting our conclusion that substituting the M1 residues does not affect GCN20 binding activity. Reduced GCN1 Ribosome Interaction in gcn1 Mutants Correlates with Reductions in GCN2 Activation and the GAAC Response—We have proposed that the GCN1·GCN20 complex must bind to the ribosome to facilitate activation of GCN2 by uncharged tRNAs bound to the ribosomal A-site of elongating ribosomes (5Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, then the mutations in the M1 and M7 residues, which reduce GCN1 binding to ribosomes, should decrease phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 and impair the GAAC response. To test this prediction, we compared the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in WCEs of the mutant and wild-type strains by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser-51. We also measured the levels of total eIF2α using antibodies that recognize the protein regardless of its phosphorylation status (Fig. 5A). The amounts of eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser-51 were normalized for the corresponding amounts of total eIF2α and expressed relative to the normalized value measured for the GCN1 strain (Fig. 5B). In parallel, we compared the 3AT sensitivities of the same strains (Fig. 5C). The M7A and M7D mutations in GCN1 produced reductions in eIF2α phosphorylation of ∼20% (not statistically significant) and ∼40%, respectively, in cells starved for histidine by 3AT treatment (Fig. 5B, cf. columns 2–4). The severity of these defects correlated well with the degrees of 3AT sensitivity exhibited by these two mutants (Fig. 5C, rows 1–3) and also with the relative defects in polyribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20 (Fig. 2C). These findings support the idea that polyribosome binding by GCN1 is critical for its ability to activate GCN2 and elicit the GAAC response. The M1A mutation had a stronger effect than either M7A or M7D on eIF2α phosphorylation and sensitivity to 3AT (Fig. 5, B and C), even though it closely resembled M7A with respect to the defect in polyribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20 (Fig. 2C). This last comparison suggests that the M1A mutation has a compound effect on GCN2 activation, impairing the ability of GCN1 to mediate GCN2 activation by uncharged tRNA in addition to reducing ribosome association by GCN1·GCN20. By contrast, the M7 mutations may impair only ribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20. Combining the M7A and M1A mutations produced a more severe reduction in eIF2α phosphorylation than did either single mutation, eliminating detectable amounts of eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser-51 (Fig. 5, A and B). This reduction is consonant with the additive reductions in GCN1 polyribosome association produced by combining these two mutations (Fig. 2D). The M1A/M7A double mutation did not confer greater sensitivity to 3AT than did the single M1A mutation, presumably because the latter is already indistinguishable from the gcn1Δ-null allele for this phenotype (Fig. 5C). In this study, we characterized clustered substitutions in phylogenetically conserved residues located in two separate segments of GCN1 that lead to reductions in polyribosome association by the GCN1·GCN20 complex in vivo. Replacing the basic residues in the segment located in area B with Asp residues (mutation M7D) led to a greater reduction in polyribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20 than did alanine substitutions at the same residues (M7A), and it produced a correspondingly greater defect in both eIF2α phosphorylation by GCN2 and the GAAC response. In addition, combining Ala substitutions in the segment located in area C (M1A) with those in area B (M7A) led to additive reductions in polyribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20, in eIF2α phosphorylation, and in the GAAC response. None of these mutations produced significant reductions in the steady-state levels of GCN1 or GCN20, nor did they impair GCN1·GCN20 or GCN1·GCN2 complex formation (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Together, these findings provide strong support for the proposition that binding of GCN1·GCN20 to polyribosomes is required for activation of GCN2 and the attendant induction of GCN4 translation in amino acid-starved cells. The fact that multiple, independent contacts seem to exist between GCN1 and the ribosome may reflect an interaction of GCN1 with distinct sites of the ribosome, e.g. on both 40 S and 60 S subunits, that contribute to stable association of the GCN1·GCN20 complex with the 80 S ribosome. M1A and M7A mutations led to similar reductions in GCN1·GCN20 association with polyribosomes, but M1A produced a much greater defect in eIF2α phosphorylation than did M7A, which implies that the residues mutated by M1A in area C play an important role in signal transduction in addition to ribosome binding by GCN1·GCN20. Interestingly, these residues are located within a region of similarity between GCN1 and the N-terminal domain of eEF3. In view of existing evidence that eEF3 stimulates release of deacylated tRNA from the exit site and the binding of aminoacylated tRNA to the A-site (7Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it is tempting to propose that interaction of the eEF3-related region in GCN1 (region C) with the ribosome produces a conformational change in the A-site. This alteration could be instrumental in binding of uncharged tRNA to the A-site, or it could stimulate the transfer of uncharged tRNA from the A-site to the HisRS-like domain in GCN2 for kinase activation. Previously, we found that significant binding of GCN1 and GCN20 to polyribosomes in WCEs was dependent on the addition of ATP to the extracts. In the current experiments, we measured GCN1·GCN20 binding to polyribosomes in WCEs lacking exogenous ATP that were prepared from cells treated with formaldehyde immediately before lysing the cells. Recently, we employed this cross-linking technique to preserve the labile association of translation initiation factors with ribosomal subunits during sedimentation through sucrose gradients, allowing us to assay translation initiation complex assembly in living yeast cells (16Nielsen K.H. Szamecz B. Valasek L. Jivotovskaya A. Shin B.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1166-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our finding of polyribosome association of GCN1·GCN20 in WCEs from cross-linked cells allows us to state unequivocally that these proteins are associated with translating ribosomes in vivo during steady-state growth in amino acid-replete cells. In addition, we can be certain that the M1A and M7A mutations reduce polyribosome association by GCN1·GCN20 in vivo by similar amounts, so the much stronger effect of M1A on GCN2 activation reflects a defect in signal transduction versus ribosome association of the regulatory complex. The use of formaldehyde cross-linking of living cells will be an indispensable tool for assigning specific residues in the eEF3-related domain to critical functions in ribosome binding versus GCN2 activation.

Endo-GHs cleave glycosidic bonds randomly in the interior of the polysaccharide chain, whereas exo-GHs cleave mono-, di-, or oligosaccharide units from one end of the chain. Branched polysaccharides have more nonreducing ends than reducing ends, and most currently identified exo-GHs are ones acting on the nonreducing ends of polysaccharides.Rex (reducing end xylose-releasing exo-oligoxylanase) from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (gene product of BH2105) is one of the few exo-type enzymes that act on the reducing end (1Honda Y.

Wilson D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), Rex recognizes the xylose unit of the reducing end in a highly strict manner, even discriminating the β-anomeric hydroxyl configuration from the α-anomer or 1-deoxyxylose. To our knowledge, therefore, Rex is the only complete exo-GH that releases a monosaccharide from the reducing end. The enzyme is thought to play a key role in the intracellular xylan metabolism of B. halodurans by cleaving xylooligosaccharides. Considering the substrate specificity for xylooligosaccharides of various lengths, the enzyme is presumed to have three subsites (–2, –1, and +1). Because Rex is an inverting enzyme that produces the α-anomer at the reducing end, spontaneous mutarotation of the substrate is required for subsequent processing in vitro. It remains unclear whether there are any factors supporting the mutarotation of xylooligosaccharides in vivo or if there are any biological reasons for such an inefficient processing mechanism.Rex belongs to the GH-8 family according to the CAZy classification (available on the World Wide Web at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) (6Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). GH-8 and GH-48 are grouped to form clan GH-M, sharing similar (α/α)6 barrel fold (7Guimarães B.G. Souchon H. Lytle B.L.

Within the GH-8 family, the crystal structures of three extracellular endo-GHs, CelA (endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum) (8Alzari P.M. Souchon H. Dominguez R.

In particular, the subsites of CelA (–3 to +3) have definitely been determined with the complex structure with cellopentaose at atomic resolution (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H.

CelA, pXyl, and Rex are grouped into the GH-8a subfamily, and ChoK is grouped into GH-8b. GH-8a enzymes have proton donor and catalytic base residues at the N termini of the α4 and α8 helices within the (α/α)6 barrel, respectively. The two catalytic residues of Rex (Glu70 as a proton donor and Asp263 as a catalytic base) have already been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (1Honda Y. Kitaoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55097-55103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic base of GH-8a enzymes (Asp) is replaced by Asn (or Ser) in the GH-8b and -8c enzymes. The crystal structure of ChoK revealed that the catalytic base of GH-8b is located in the long loop inserted between α7 and α8 (10Adachi W. Sakihama Y. Shimizu S. Sunami T. Fukazawa T. Suzuki M. Yatsunami R. Nakamura S. Takénaka A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We describe here crystal structures of Rex and show the structural basis for its strict substrate specificity, especially for a xylose unit at the reducing end.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallography—Expression and purification of the wild-type and E70A mutant enzymes were previously reported (1Honda Y. Kitaoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55097-55103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both types of enzyme were crystallized under the conditions described elsewhere (12Honda Y. Fushinobu S. Hidaka M. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Kitaoka M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The xylose complex (WT-xylose) was prepared by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 10 mm xylose. The xylobiose complex of the E70A mutant enzyme (E70A-xylobiose) was prepared by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 10 mm xylotriose, and the crystals that grew in 6 days were used for data collection. Diffraction data were collected using a charge-coupled device camera on the BL-5A station at the Photon Factory and the NW-12 station at the Photon Factory AR, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. The crystals were flash-cooled in a stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38355) Google Scholar). Initial phases of the native structure were obtained by the molecular replacement method, using the structure of psychrophilic endo-β-1,4-xylanase from P. haloplanktis (Protein Data Bank code 1H14) as a search model. Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis and Enzyme Assay—Site-directed mutagenesis for H319A was performed using the PCR overlap extension method (22Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The following mutagenic oligonucleotide primer was used (the mismatched bases are underlined): 5′-GAG AAA TCA TTG GCC CCT GTC GGA CTG AT-3′. Preparation, purification, and activity measurement of the mutant enzyme were carried out as described previously (1Honda Y. Kitaoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55097-55103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As to the HPLC analysis of the anomeric form of the products, the concentrations of the substrate (X3) and the enzyme (H319A mutant) were 50 mm and 19.3 μm, respectively.RESULTSCrystallography—The unliganded crystal structure of the wild-type Rex (WT-native) was solved by means of molecular replacement, using the crystal structure of pXyl. The complex structure of the wild-type Rex with xylose (WT-xylose) was determined by a co-crystallization method. In the WT-xylose structure, the electron density of a xylose molecule was found at subsite +1, following the definition of the subsites of CelA (Fig. 1a). Although the density peaks were relatively low and the temperature factors were relatively high (Table I), the density was clear in shape, so we could confidently determine the orientation and conformation of the xylose molecule. Further attempts to obtain other types of complex structures (i.e. co-crystallization of the wild-type Rex in 10 mm xylobiose or a mixture of 5 mm xylose and 5 mm xylobiose) resulted in a similar density to that in the case of WT-xylose (a xylose molecule was bound at subsite +1; data not shown). When the wild-type Rex crystals were soaked in 10 mm xylotriose for a short time (10 s), density peaks for sugar units ranging from subsite –2 to +1 were observed. However, the density at subsite –1 was ambiguous and appeared to reflect a mixture of several conformations, probably involving a fraction of the cleaved substrate. The second type of complex structure was obtained by co-crystallizing the inactive E70A mutant with xylotriose (E70A-xylobiose). In the substrate binding cleft of E70A-xylobiose, the clear density of a xylobiose unit at subsites –2 and –1, as well as a glycerol at subsite +1, was observed (Fig. 1b). There are two possibilities that explain the discrepancy between the co-crystallized reagent (xylotriose) and the density observed for xylobiose: (a) xylotriose had been cleaved during the crystal formation (6 days), although the hydrolytic activity of the E70A mutant is 10–4 orders lower that of the wild-type; and (b) xylotriose is bound at subsites –3 to –1, but a xylose moiety at the nonreducing end could not be detected due to high mobility or disorder.All three structures contain a metal ion and a glycerol, both of which bind at a crystal packing interface far from the active site (Fig. 2b). The metal ion was assigned as a nickel ion (Ni2+) because a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column was used for purification, and no other candidate was included in the reservoir solution. Refined temperature factors of the nickel ion in the three structures were within 8.9–17.6 Å2 (Table I), and the refined Fo – Fc maps were almost flat (data not shown). The nickel ion was tetrahedrally coordinated by Gln27, Gln30, Asp253′, and His259′ (symmetry-related residues are indicated by primes). The glycerol molecule was held by the main-chain atoms of Gln192, Tyr247, and Asp248 and the side chain of Trp123′. Glycerol was absolutely required for crystallization (12Honda Y. Fushinobu S. Hidaka M. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Kitaoka M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A polypeptide chain extending from Glu6 and Pro381 was modeled in WT-xylose and E70A-xylobiose, whereas Glu45 and Thr46 were not included in WT-native because of local disorder.Fig. 2Ribbon diagrams of the GH-8a enzymes. The catalytic residues, ligand molecules, and metal ions are shown as black sticks, a ball-and-stick model, and spheres, respectively. a, side view of the (α/α)6 barrel of Rex. b, top view of the barrel in a. The position of the α10 helix is indicated. c, top view of the barrel of the wild-type pXyl complexed with a xylose at subsite +4.

The root mean square deviations as to pXyl and CelA are 1.8 Å for 357 residues and 2.3 Å for 335 residues, respectively. There are four free cysteine residues located inside the molecule. This characteristic is usual for intracellular enzymes. On the other hand, two cysteine residues of pXyl, which is an extracellular enzyme, form a disulfide bond (9Van Petegem F. Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Gerday C. Feller G. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7531-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The molecular surfaces of the three GH-8a enzymes are shown in Fig. 3. The substrate-binding cleft of CelA is clearly larger than those of the other two enzymes. Interestingly, subsite +2 of Rex is blocked by a barrier at the upper side of the cleft (described below). In contrast, the other two endo-GHs have a long cleft spanning the molecule, which can accommodate a long polysaccharide chain.Fig. 3Molecular surfaces of Rex (a), pXyl (b), and CelA (c), showing the substrate binding cleft. Positive and negative potentials are shown in blue and red, respectively. Ligand oligosaccharides are shown as a ball-and-stick model. c, a part of the cellopentaose molecule (subsites –3 to –1 of –3 to +2) and the cellotriose molecule (subsites +1 to +3) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Complex Structures—WT-native and the two complex structures (WT-xylose and E70A-xylobiose) of Rex were almost identical (root mean square deviation for Cα atoms <0.26 Å and for all atoms <0.44 Å between all pairs of the three Rex structures). There was no large conformational change on substrate binding like on other GH-8a enzymes. For example, substrate binding on CelA induces only small structural changes in the protein, mostly slight reorientations of aromatic and polar side chains in contact with the substrate (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, substrate binding on Rex induced slight movements in two regions (Thr62–Asn64 and Gly355–Arg357) around subsite +1 (Fig. 4a). The main chain moves toward the substrate in both of the complex structures. In the WT-xylose structure, the side chain of Arg357 swings to form a specific interaction with the xylose at subsite +1, accompanied by movement of the adjacent Asn356 residue. The side chain of Arg357 was ordered in WT-xylose, whereas it was disordered in the other two structures.Fig. 4The subsites of Rex and GH-8a enzymes.a, stereoview of superimposition of the three structures of Rex around the substrate-binding site. The WT-native, WT-xylose, and E70A-xylobiose structures are shown in yellow, gray, and green, respectively. b, stereoview of superimpositioning of Rex (gray), pXyl (green), and CelA (yellow). The structures were superimposed using the atoms of the two catalytic residues and the third catalytically important residue (Asp128/Asp144/Asp152 in Rex/pXyl/CelA). The xylobiose (–2 to –1) and xylose (+1) in Rex, the xylose in pXyl (+4), and the cellopentaose in CelA (subsites –3 to +2) are shown as a ball-and-stick model. The partially bound product molecule in CelA (cellotriose at subsites +1to +3) is shown as thin sticks. Residue names and numbers are labeled in the order of Rex/pXyl/CelA with each color.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The xylose molecule in WT-xylose takes on the 4C1 conformation, and all of the oxygen atoms (O-1 to O-5) form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with protein atoms (Fig. 5a). His319 forms one of the two direct hydrogen bonds present between xylose and the Rex protein, which recognizes the β-hydroxyl group at the O-1 position. A stacking interaction of Tyr360 with the β-face of the xylose also occurs. This residue can sterically interfere binding of an α-anomer. When an α-glucose molecule was superimposed onto the β-xylose, the α-anomeric hydroxyl oxygen atom was located at distances of 2.7 and 2.5 Å from the Oβ and Oγ atoms of Tyr360, respectively (see Supplemental Material). Actually, electron density for only the β-anomer was observed, probably because of these interactions.Fig. 5Schematic drawing of the active sites in the WT-xylose (a) and E70A-xylobiose (b) structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the E70A-xylobiose complex, the xylobiose molecule takes on the 4C1 conformation at both of the two sugar rings and the β-anomeric configuration at the reducing end. The glycerol molecule is located at almost the same position as subsite +1 and forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the xylobiose (Fig. 5b). Although the positions of the three hydroxyl oxygen atoms of the glycerol are slightly different from those of xylose at subsite +1, they interact with several residues at subsite +1 and cause movement of the main chain in the two regions described above. All of the oxygen atoms form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the protein, and the xylose ring at subsite –2 of the xylobiose is stacked with Trp112 at the β-face.Subsites—Fig. 4b shows composite superimpositioning of the subsites of the three GH-8a enzymes: the WT-xylose structure of Rex combined with xylobiose in the E70A-xylobiose structure (gray), the pXyl D144N mutant structure (Protein Data Bank code 1H14) combined with a xylose molecule at subsite +4 in the complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 1H12) (green), and the CelA E95Q mutant structure complexed with cellopentaose (Protein Data Bank code 1KWF) (yellow). Both the cellopentaose molecule (subsites –3 to +2; ball-and-stick model) and the partially bound product molecule (cellotriose at subsites +1to +3) are shown. Xylose and xylobiose in Rex approximately overlap with the glucose units at subsites –2 to +1 in CelA.At subsite –3 of CelA, Trp205 forms a stacking interaction, and the side chain of Arg204 forms a hydrogen bond with the O-3 atom. However, there is no subsite here in pXyl and Rex. In Rex, the Trp is substituted by Ile188, and there is no corresponding residue with the Arg, losing specific interactions to a sugar moiety at this site. Rex exhibits significantly higher Km for xylooligasaccharides of longer than xylotetraose (1Honda Y. Kitaoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55097-55103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is, however, no steric hindrance at subsite –3, and the subsite is highly accessible to solvent. We could not find any convincing structural factor that can make the binding effect on this subsite negative. Perhaps the side chain of Glu190, which is solvent-exposed and somewhat disordered in the crystal structure, may interfere with the sugar binding in an extended conformation (Fig. 4b). At subsite –2, the bound xylose/glucose groups of Rex and CelA almost completely overlap. The stacking Trp residue (Trp112/Trp124/Trp132 in Rex, pXyl, and CelA) is conserved in GH-8a enzymes. The O-2, O-3, and O-5 atoms at subsite –2 form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Tyr244 and Tyr198 (Fig. 5b).A significant kink is observed between sugar rings at subsites –1 and +1, the two sugar rings being twisted to become almost perpendicular to each other. Catalytically important residues are rather concentrated around this region. Glu70 (Glu78/Glu94 in pXyl and CelA) has been identified as the proton donor (1Honda Y. Kitaoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55097-55103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The catalytic base residue (Asp263/Asp281/Asp278 in Rex, pXyl, and CelA) holds a water molecule through hydrogen bonds together with a conserved Tyr residue (Tyr198/Tyr203/Tyr215). The water is thought to correspond to the nucleophilic water, which is activated by the catalytic base residue (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the CelA-cellopentaose complex structure, the third catalytically important residue (Asp128/Asp144/Asp152) forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the O-2 and O-3 atoms of the glucose unit at subsite –1 with the 2,5B conformation (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The interaction is critical to stabilize the sugar ring in a strained boat conformation, which is thought to be a prerequisite for the inverting hydrolytic mechanism through a transition state with the oxocarbenium ion, the planarity of the atoms C-5, O-5, C-1, and C-2 facilitating the formation of a partial double bond between O-5 and C-1 (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the E70A-xylobiose structure, Asp128 does not form any interaction with the ligand. However, the side chain of Asp128 is positioned similarly with that of Asp152 of CelA, and it would also stabilize the xylose ring at subsite –1 if the ring takes on a boat conformation. In summary, the catalytic mechanism of Rex seems to be basically conserved with other GH-8a enzymes.At subsite +1, the xylose molecule in Rex overlaps better with a glucose unit of the product cellotriose molecule in CelA, rather than that of the uncleaved cellopentaose molecule. For CelA, the product molecule at subsites +1 to +3 is thought to represent a possible first step during which the leaving group rotates slightly and shifts away from the reaction center, the stacking interactions being preserved (11Guérin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Béguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The xylose molecule in WT-xylose of Rex also seems to correspond to a product molecule being released. Subsite +1 of Rex is unique compared with that of other GH-8a enzymes, because the residues at this subsite (Asp61, Asn64, Arg68, Ser262, His319, and Arg357) are not conserved in CelA and pXyl. However, the stacking Tyr residue (Tyr360/Tyr381/ Tyr372 in Rex, pXyl, and CelA) is conserved and fixes the sugar unit at an approximate position.The most notable difference between Rex and the other two GH-8a enzymes is the blockage of subsite +2 by the kink in the loop before α10 at Ser317-Pro320 (Fig. 4b). His319 is directly hydrogen-bonded with the β-hydroxyl of the xylose at subsite +1, contributing to the discrimination of the anomers at the reducing end. Leu318 blocks subsite +2 with its long side chain together with His319. A proline residue (Pro320) is present only in Rex, and the main chain trace bends at an almost right angle at this position. The bent loop structure seems to be intrinsically stable, because there is no conformational difference between the unliganded and liganded structures. On the other hand, in pXyl and CelA, this loop is located away from the substrate. Instead, a Tyr residue in the loop before α12 (Tyr378/Tyr369 in pXyl and CelA) forms subsite +3.Specificity for Xylosides—The order of preference of Rex for xylo-/glucooligosaccharides is XXX ≫ GXX > XXG ≫ GXG (where G represents glucose and X is xylose), and no detectable activity is observed for XGG, GGX, and XGX (1Honda Y.

https://openalex.org/W2096517282,"We examined molecular and electrophysiological properties of the electroneutral sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCn1) that is present in rat hippocampal neurons. By PCR, a deletion variant (NBCn1-E) that lacks 123 amino acids in the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain was found in adult neurons. The previously characterized NBCn1-B, which does not have the deletion, was detected in embryonic neurons. In Xenopus oocytes, NBCn1-E raised the intracellular pH in the presence of HCO3 without significantly affecting the membrane potential. Despite this electroneutral cotransport activity, the transporter mediated a steady-state current that positively shifted the resting potential by almost 30 mV. The mean reversal potential of the steady-state current was –21.2 mV, close to the resting potential of –21.4 mV. The reversal potential shifted 26 mV in response to a 10-fold increase of external Na+ for concentrations above 10 mm. The current activity mediated by the transporter was unaffected by K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or Cl–. Stable expression of NBCn1-E in human embryonic kidney cells also evoked an inward current that shifted the resting potentials more positive compared with the sham-transfected controls. In primary cultures of embryonic hippocampal neurons, the NBCn1 protein was localized in somatodendrites and synapses. NBCn1 protein was partially colocalized with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95. Single-cell PCR showed that NBCn1 mRNA expression was present in both γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and non-GABAergic neurons. We propose that NBCn1 in hippocampal neurons may affect neuronal activity by regulating local pH as well as steady-state inward currents at synapses.

We propose that NBCn1 in hippocampal neurons may affect neuronal activity by regulating local pH as well as steady-state inward currents at synapses. The steady-state intracellular pH in a typical neuron in situ is 7.0–7.4, which is about 1 unit higher than the pH expected from the electrochemical equilibrium of hydrogen ions (for review see Ref. 1Bevensee M.O. Boron W.F. Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998: 211-232Google Scholar). Small changes in pH modulate the activity of many enzymes, ion channels and receptors and, therefore, can significantly influence neuronal function (2Traynelis S.F. Cull-Candy S.G. J.

An abrupt change in the intracellular pH (pHi) 1The abbreviations used are: pHi, intracellular pH; pHo, extracellular pH; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-2,2′-disulfonate stilbene; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; NGS, normal goat serum; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; NBCn1, electroneutral sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter. or extracellular pH (pHo) can be neurotoxic. Acidosis can lead to coma, whereas severe alkalosis can induce seizures (for review see Ref. 6Katsura K. Siesjo B.K. Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998: 563-582Google Scholar). Therefore, neurons must have precise regulatory mechanisms to respond to changes in pHi and/or pHo. The sodium/bicarbonate transporters are a subset of acid-base transporters specialized to move Na+ and HCO–3. Except for the one present in the proximal tubules of the kidney, most sodium/bicarbonate transporters move Na+ and HCO–3 into cells and raise the pHi as HCO–3 titrates H+. The principal function of these transporters is to extrude acid equivalents from cells, balance acid loads, and maintain the pHi within a physiological range. In hippocampal neurons, HCO–3-dependent acid extrusion is thought to be governed by a Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchanger (7Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol. 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Baxter K.A. Church J. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transporter moves Na+ and HCO–3 into cells in exchange for internal Cl–. In CA1 pyramidal neurons acutely isolated from 4- to 14-day-old rats, the Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchanger dominates the recovery of pHi from an acid load and can be inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-2,2′-disulfonate stilbene (DIDS) (7Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol. 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In embryonic hippocampal neurons, acid extrusion is mediated by the Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchanger and the amiloride-insensitive Na/H exchanger (8Baxter K.A. Church J. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, nearly 80% of the HCO–3-dependent pH recovery can be insensitive to DIDS in these embryonic neurons (9Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest the presence of an additional acid extruder. To date, five types of sodium/bicarbonate transporters have been cloned in mammals: NBCn1, NBCe1, NBCe2, NDCBE1, and NCBE (10Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Boron W.F. JOP. 2001; 2: 176-181PubMed Google Scholar, 12Romero M.F. Fulton C.M. Boron W.F. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). NBCn1 is an electroneutral Na/HCO3 cotransporter. NBCe1 and NBCe2 are electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporters with the stoichiometry of 1 Na+ and no less than 2 HCO–3. NDCBE1 and NCBE are electroneutral Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchangers. The genes for these transporters comprise the bicarbonate transporter superfamily SLC4A, which also contains three Cl/HCO3 exchangers AE1–3, the functionally controversial AE4, and the uncharacterized BTR1 (13Parker M.D. Ourmozdi E.P. Tanner M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). NCBE and NBCe1 are known to be expressed in pyramidal neurons in adult rat hippocampus (14Schmitt B.M. Berger U.V. Douglas R.M. Bevensee M.O. Hediger M.A. Haddad G.G. Boron W.F. J.

Knowledge of the exact localization and expression of these Na/HCO3 transporters in primary cultures of embryonic or adult hippocampal neurons is presently incomplete. Among the sodium/bicarbonate transporters, NBCn1 (SLC4A7) is of particular interest and has been studied for its molecular and cellular properties in many tissues (17Cooper D.S. Cucoranu D. Choi I. Society for Neuroscience 2004 Abstracts. Society for Neuroscience, Bethesda, MD2004Google Scholar, 18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F.

Physiol. 2000; 279: F901-F909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transporter has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other transporters. NBCn1 is largely insensitive to DIDS. In Xenopus oocytes expressing NBCn1 (18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing NBC3 (human homolog of rat NBCn1) (19Park M. Ko S.B.H. Davidson N. Muallem G. Thomas P.J. Pushkin A. Lee K. Kim J.Y. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50503-50509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), less than 25% of the pHi recovery is reduced by 500 μm DIDS. Furthermore, NBCn1 has an associated ionic conductance. The transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes not only carries Na+ and HCO–3 electroneutrally, but it also apparently induces a steady-state current that does not require HCO–3 (18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This transporter-dependent current is sensitive to external Na+ and is inwardly directed at the resting membrane potential of oocytes. The transporter-dependent inward current positively shifts the membrane potential and raises the intracellular Na+ by nearly 6-fold. Thus, in addition to its ability to regulate pH via the electroneutral cotransport activity, NBCn1 may also affect the membrane potential via its ionic conductance. This dual function would be important particularly in neurons where changes in pHi, membrane potentials, and Na+ play important roles in cellular activities. Rat NBCn1 was initially reported to exist as multiple splice variants depending upon the amino acid cassettes in the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains of the transporter (18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One N-terminal cassette containing 14 amino acids and one C-terminal cassette containing 36 amino acids are identified to produce at least three splice variants in rats. In addition, the first 10 amino acids in the N-terminal end are different in the human clone. Functional characterization of NBCn1 has been done with either NBCn1-B or NBC3. Recently, Odgaard et al. (23Odgaard E. Jakobsen J.K. Frische S. Praetorius J. Nielsen S. Aalkjaer C. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has reported another cassette containing 123 amino acids in the N-terminal domain of the transporter in the thick ascending limb of rat kidney. We have also shown in an abstract that the transporter in adult rat neurons lacks this N-terminal cassette (17Cooper D.S. Cucoranu D. Choi I. Society for Neuroscience 2004 Abstracts. Society for Neuroscience, Bethesda, MD2004Google Scholar). The role of the 123 amino acids in the cassette remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the molecular and electrophysiological properties of NBCn1 variants that are expressed in rat hippocampal neurons. We identified two variants from embryonic hippocampal cultures and adult neurons, examined the expression and localization of the one in primary cultures, and characterized the function of a previously unexamined variant by expressing it in Xenopus oocytes and HEK cells. Identification of NBCn1 Variants—Total RNA was extracted from adult rat (Sprague-Dawley) hippocampal slices or embryonic hippocampal neurons (E19) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In vitro transcription was made using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed with random hexamers, and assessed for PCR with primers designed to amplify rat NBCn1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_058211). Primers for the N-terminal domain are GACTCCATAAGGGAGAATGTTCGAGAAGCT (819–846, forward primer) and ACTGGTTCTTAATGATAGATAGGATAGGTG (2266–2295, reverse primer), and primers for the entire coding region of NBCn1 are TCTCAGAGCTCCCAGGCGGGCCATGGAGGC (178–204, forward primer) and GGTTTGACTTTACAATGAAGTTTCAGCATC (3835–3864, reverse primer). PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced at the Emory DNA Core Facility. Hippocampal Neuronal Culture and Immunocytochemistry—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared according to a protocol modified from previously published methods (24Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). The hippocampus was dissected from embryonic day 18–19 rat pups and dissociated by papain treatment and trituration. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips at a density of 4 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. After 2–3 weeks in culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, for 20 min, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.1% Triton X-100. All antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 2.5% NGS and 0.025% Triton X-100, and cells were rinsed twice for 20 min following each antibody incubation period. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the following antibodies: anti-NBCn1 (1:250; generously provided by Soren Nielsen, Aarhus University, Denmark) and anti-MAP2 (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich) or with anti-PSD-95 (1:50; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). After rinsing in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were then incubated for 30 min in an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG 1:400; Amersham Biosciences) for NBCn1 or biotinylated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for MAP-2 or PSD-95. Cells were subsequently incubated in tyramide signal amplification plus tetramethylrhodamine (1:300; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The double-labeled coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for viewing under a Zeiss (Oberkochem, Germany) LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. Single Cell PCR—A glass capillary patch pipette was filled with a 10 × PCR buffer (Roche Applied Science) containing RNase inhibitor (20 units/ml), and the cytoplasm was aspirated into the patch pipette by applying backpressure and then expelled into a microcentrifuge tube containing the reaction mixture for reverse transcription (100 ng of random hexamer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42 °C in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. After reverse transcription, PCR was performed with the following primers: NBCn1 primers CACATTCCCCACGACCTCTTCACGGAGATG (532–561, forward) and CATTCAGACTCTACTTTTAAGCTGTTGAC (3159–3188, reverse); GAD65 primers (GenBank™ accession number M72422) TGAGAACCCGGGAACAGCGAGAGC (134–157, forward) and AGCCGAACATTGCAAGGGGACACC (1269–1292, reverse); and GAD67 primers (GenBank™ accession number NM_017007) AGACGTTTGATCGCTCCAC (570–588, forward) and TCTATGCCGCTGAGTTTGTG (1343–1362, reverse). The PCR products were then diluted 100-fold and used as a template for PCR with the internal primers to nest amplification. The following primers were used for the nested PCR: NBCn1 primers used for distinguishing the presence of the cassette II (described above); GAD65 primers GCCCAGGCTCATCGCATTCACGTC (884–907, forward) and CCTCCACCCCAAGCAGCATCCACA (1160–1183, reverse); GAD67 primers GCTGACATCAACTGCCAATACC (793–814, forward) and ACGCTCCATAAACAGTCGTGC (1218–1238, reverse). Expression of NBCn1 in Xenopus Oocytes—A full-length cDNA encoding the deletion variant of rat NBCn1 (NBCn1-E) was constructed into the oocyte expression vector pGH19 (25Choi I. Chiu S.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The DNA was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes (Stages V–VI) were injected with 20 ng of NBCn1 cRNA (0.4 μg/μl) or 50 nl of water and incubated in OR3 media (50% Leibovitz L-15 media with l-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin for 3–7 days at 18 °C before use. Voltage and pH microelectrodes were prepared as described previously (26Choi I. Romero M.F. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C576-C584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH electrode tip was filled with proton ionophore 1 mixture B (Sigma-Aldrich) and back-filled with a pH-7 phosphate buffer. Electrodes were connected to the high impedance electrometer FD-223 (WPI, Sarasota, FL), and were connected to the analogue-to-digital converter of an IBM computer. In electrophysiological experiments, the CO2/HCO–3-free ND96 solution contained (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4); osmolality was adjusted to 196–200 mosmol/kg. In solutions equilibrated with 5% CO2, 25 mm NaHCO3 replaced an equivalent molarity of NaCl. In Na+-free solution, N-methyl-d-glucamine replaced Na+. All experiments were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 1–2 ΩM. The current recordings were done with an OC-725A voltage clamp (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT), which was connected to the Digidata1322 interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). For measurements of the steady-state current, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of –60 mV and then stepped from –120 to +40 mV with 20-mV increments for 100 ms in ND96. The sensitivity of the current to external Na+ was examined by current-voltage recordings in solutions containing (in mm) 5, 10, 50, and 100, Na+ plus 1 MgCl2, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, and sufficient mannitol to maintain the osmolality. In other experiments, the concentration of KCl, MgCl2, or CaCl2 was doubled in the Na+-free ND96. For Cl– substitution, gluconate was used. All voltage clamp experiments were performed in the nominal absence of HCO–3. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments). Stable Transfection of HEK293 Cells—Flp-In 293 cells (Invitrogen, catalog number R750-07) containing a single FRT site were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at 70–80% confluency. Cells were cotransfected with a 3:1 ratio of pOG44 plasmid and NBCn1/pcDNA/FRT using CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) to allow expression of Flp recombinase and integration of the NBCn1/pcDNA/FRT into the genome via the FRT site. Fours hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the culture medium was replaced. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into fresh medium such that they were no more than 25% confluent. After additional 2–3 h of incubation, the medium was changed with the one containing hygromycin. The cells were fed every 3–4 days with selective medium containing hygromycin (10–400 μg/ml) until foci were identified. After 1–2 weeks of selection, surviving cells were single colonized in a well and replated into 25-cm2 flasks. Electrophysiological Recordings of Transfected HEK293 Cells— Whole cell patch-clamp recording was performed using a List L/M EPC-7 amplifier (List Medical Systems, NY). The patch pipette solution contained (in mm) 90 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). The external solution contained 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature at a holding voltage of –30 mV, in response to voltage steps from –100 mV to +40 mV, in increments of 20 mV. Patch pipettes were fabricated from TW 150 glass (World Precision, Hamden, CT) and fire-polished to produce tips with an internal diameter of 1 μm or less. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted microscope equipped with Hoffman Modulation Contrast. Whole cell currents were recorded using Clampex on an IBM-compatible personal computer for later computer analysis. The recordings were low-pass filtered (3 db at 2 kHz, 8-pole Bessel filter) before recording on Clampex. The current amplitude at the end of the pulse was measured using Clampfit. Statistical Analysis—Data were reported as means ± S.E. Levels of significance were assessed using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. The p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Rates of pHi change (dpH/dt) were fitted by a line using a least-squares method. Two NBCn1 Variants Exist in Embryonic and Adult Hippocampal Neuron—Alternative splicing results in at least three variants of rat NBCn1 (NBCn1-B/C/D), which have different combinations of amino acid cassettes in the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains of the protein (Fig. 1A) (18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NBCn1-B lacks cassette III (36 amino acids), NBCn1-C lacks cassette I (14 amino acids), and NBCn1-D has no deletion. Human homolog NBC3 (i.e. NBCn1-A) is similar to NBCn1-B with the exception of the first 10 amino acids at the N-terminal domain (20Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16569-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, two other variants without cassette II (123 amino acids) were identified in rat kidney (23Odgaard E. Jakobsen J.K. Frische S. Praetorius J. Nielsen S. Aalkjaer C. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Those renal variants vary with or without cassette I. We performed RT-PCR to determine which variants exist in rat hippocampal neurons. The primers corresponding to the flanking region of cassettes I and II were used so that they would amplify either ∼1.5 kb products for variants containing these two cassettes or a ∼1.1 kb products for variants lacking them. We found that PCR generated a 1.5-kb product in hippocampal neurons isolated from embryonic (E19) rats and a 1.1-kb fragment in adult hippocampal slices (Fig. 1B). Sequencing these PCR products revealed that cassettes II was present in embryonic neurons but absent from adult neurons. Both samples had cassette I, thus indicating that the difference between two PCR products is due to the splicing event of cassette II. To identify the full-length variant(s) in hippocampal neurons, another set of primers was used to amplify the entire coding region of the NBCn1 sequence. A PCR product with 3.2 kb in size was amplified in adults (Fig. 1B, far right lane). Sequencing this product confirmed the absence of both N-terminal cassette II and C-terminal cassette III. Thus, the splice variant of NBCn1 in adult hippocampal neurons is identical to the previously characterized NBCn1-B except for the deletion of cassette II (hereafter, this variant is NBCn1-E). NBCn1-E is also different from the variants in the medullary thick ascending limb (23Odgaard E. Jakobsen J.K. Frische S. Praetorius J. Nielsen S. Aalkjaer C. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The variant in embryonic neurons is NBCn1-B (data not shown). NBCn1-E Is an Electroneutral Na/HCO3 Cotransporter with an Ionic Conductance—Because the function of NBCn1-B has been previously reported (18Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we focused our study on characterizing the functional significance of the 123 amino acids in cassette II that are deleted in NBCn1-E. NBCn1-E was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and its electrophysiological properties were examined using ion-selective microelectrodes. We measured the cotransport activity by examining pHi recovery under acidic conditions and effects on membrane potential (Vm) during the pHi recovery. Fig. 2A shows typical pH and Vm traces in oocytes expressing the transporter. Applying 1.5% CO2/10 mm HCO–3 to oocytes caused the pHi to slowly rise after an initial rapid acidification by CO2. This rise is due to HCO–3 entry via the transporter. Water-injected control oocytes showed no pHi recovery (Fig. 2B). Applying CO2/HCO–3 to oocytes expressing NBCn1-E did not affect the Vm as would have been expected if the transporter mediated an unequal ratio of Na+ and HCO–3 transport. A slow depolarization is likely due to nonspecific CO2 effect, because it also occurred in controls. These results indicate that the pHi recovery by NBCn1-E is electroneutral. Removing Na+ from the bath (N-methyl-d-glucamine substitution) in the continued presence of CO2/HCO3 blunted the pHi change. Na+ removal also caused a hyperpolarization, which implies an associated ionic conductance of the transporter as discussed below. The pHi recovery rate presented by the pH change per second (dpH/dt) was 19 ± 2 × 10–5 (n = 4) in the forward direction (i.e. Na+ and HCO–3 moving into cells), significantly higher than 0.9 ± 0.6 × 10–5 (n = 10) in controls (Fig. 2C). The dpH/dt in the reverse direction (i.e. Na+ and HCO–3 moving out of cells) was –3 ± 1 × 10–5 in NBCn1-E oocytes and –1.8 ± 0.7 × 10–5 in controls. Upon Na+ removal, oocyte membranes hyperpolarized. The change in Vm in oocytes expressing NBCn1-E (27.7 ± 2.7 mV) was significantly greater than that in control oocytes (5.9 ± 1.0 mV, p < 0.01). The robust hyperpolarization in NBCn1-E oocytes suggests that the transporter has a Na+-sensitive ionic conductance. We measured the ionic current corresponding to this conductance in oocytes expressing the transporter in two-electrode voltage clamp. In current-voltage (I-V) recordings (Fig. 3A), the reversal potential of the steady-state current was –21.2 ± 1.2 mV (n = 6), close to the resting Vm of –21.4 ± 1.5 mV. A significant amount of inward current (∼400 nA) was generated at –51 mV, which corresponds to the average resting potential of control oocytes. The slope conductance between –80 to +20 mV was 13.9 ± 3.2 μS (n = 6), which was significantly greater than 1.3 ± 0.1 μS (n = 7, p < 0.01) in controls. In I-V recordings from oocytes expressing the previously characterized NBCn1-B, the conductance was 16.1 ± 3.3 μS (n = 5) measured on the same recording day (∼3 days after RNA injection) (Fig. 3B). The magnitude of the conductance in NBCn1-E was not significantly different from that in NBCn1-B (p > 0.05). Although the NBCn1-E-mediated conductance was Na+-dependent, it was not affected by HCO–3 in the bath (Fig. 3C). The Associated Conductance Is Mostly Na+-dependent—To analyze the contribution of Na+ to the NBCn1-mediated current, we recorded the currents in normal ND96 solution containing 96 mm Na+ and then in Na+-free solution (Fig. 4A). We then subtracted the amplitudes of the currents measured in Na+-free solution from those in ND96. The resulting difference in current was inwardly directed and did not reverse up to +40 mV (Fig. 4B). The Na+ sensitivity of the current was examined by plotting the logarithmic change of the reversal potential as a function of extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]o). In the range of 10–100 mm [Na+]o, the slope was 26 mV per decade change in [Na+]o. This represents 45% of the expected potential change based on the Nernst equation (Fig. 4C). The reversal potential was unchanged below 10 mm [Na+]o. The lack of changes in the reversal potential at low [Na+]o may be due to other ions passing through the conductive pathway in NBCn1-E protein when Na+ is not available. To determine if other ions contribute to the NBCn1-E-mediated current, we measured the effect of K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in the bath solution on the reversal potential. Removing these cations from ND96 (with Na+ substitution) did not affect the reversal potential of the NBCn1-E current or sl"
https://openalex.org/W2113980731,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2A (eIF2A) has been shown to direct binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in a codon-dependent manner, in contrast to eIF2, which requires GTP but not the AUG codon to bind initiator tRNA to 40 S subunits. We show here that yeast eIF2A genetically interacts with initiation factor eIF4E, suggesting that both proteins function in the same pathway. The double eIF2A/eIF4E-ts mutant strain displays a severe slow growth phenotype, which correlated with the accumulation of 85% of the double mutant cells arrested at the G2/M border. These cells also exhibited a disorganized actin cytoskeleton and elevated actin levels, suggesting that eIF2A might be involved in controlling the expression of genes involved in morphogenic processes. Further insights into eIF2A function were gained from the studies of eIF2A distribution in ribosomal fractions obtained from either an eIF5BΔ (fun12Δ) strain or a eIF3b-ts (prt1-1) strain. It was found that the binding of eIF2A to 40 and 80 S ribosomes was not impaired in either strain. We also found that eIF2A functions as a suppressor of Ure2p internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation in yeast cells. The regulation of expression from the URE2 internal ribosome entry site appears to be through the levels of eIF2A protein, which has been found to be inherently unstable with a half-life of ∼17 min. It was hypothesized that this instability allows for translational control through the level of eIF2A protein in yeast cells.

Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is a complex process requiring numerous accessory proteins called initiation factors. At least 12 different initiation factors have been identified, comprising over 30 polypeptide chains (1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-38Google Scholar). The function of many of these factors have been established in detail (1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-38Google Scholar, 2Sonenberg N. Dever T.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar); however, the precise role of some of them, their mechanism of action, and the particular step in the initiation process at which these factors function still remains obscure. It should be noted that recent studies have pointed to the key role of translational control (which is mainly exerted at the initiation step of protein synthesis) in regulating gene expression during development, differentiation, cell cycle progression, cell growth, apoptosis, and stress (3Mathews M.B.

Studies of the responses of a large variety of cell systems to different physiological stimuli have shown that protein synthesis can be modulated by both changes in the state of phosphorylation of initiation factors and changes in the levels of these factors in the cell. These effects allow rapid modification of the overall rate of translation as well as post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression due to changes in the relative selection of different mRNA species utilizing different mechanisms of translation initiation. In view of these observations, it is of importance to establish the molecular mechanisms by which changes in the levels or activities of various initiation factors could affect cell fate. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2A (eIF2A) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2A, -3b, and -5B, eukaryotic initiation factor 2A, 3b, and 5B, respectively; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; ts, temperature-sensitive; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IRES, internal ribosome entry site. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2A, -3b, and -5B, eukaryotic initiation factor 2A, 3b, and 5B, respectively; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; ts, temperature-sensitive; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IRES, internal ribosome entry site. is a 65-kDa protein that was first identified in the early 1970s on the basis of its stimulation of initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits, its participation in methionyl puromycin synthesis, and its ability to stimulate poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis at low [Mg2+]. eIF2A was initially believed to be the functional homologue of prokaryotic IF2, since IF2 catalyzes biochemically similar reactions (6Merrick W.C. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Adams S.L. Safer B. Anderson W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Whereas both eIF2 and eIF2A function similarly in model assays, the order of events differs between the two (Fig. 1). eIF2A binds Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a codon-dependent manner, whereas eIF2 binds Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a GTP-dependent manner (7Adams S.L.

Recently, the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF2A was identified, and yeast strains were obtained that lacked the gene for eIF2A (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The eIF2AΔ strains were viable and showed no apparent phenotype (although this strain sporulated with about one-third the efficiency of the wild type (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), suggesting that the eIF2A does not function in major (key) steps in the initiation process but, perhaps, could act at some late steps or be involved in minor alternative initiation events such as reinitiation, internal initiation, or non-AUG initiation. Of these alternatives, it does not appear that eIF2A influences reinitiation, at least as tested using the GCN4 reporter system in yeast cells (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genetic interaction of the eIF2A and eIF5B was also observed, suggesting that both proteins function in the same pathway (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have further characterized the yeast eIF2A using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We show here that eIF2A genetically interacts with eIF4E, suggesting that both proteins function in the same pathway. The double eIF2A/eIF4E-ts mutant strain displayed a severe slow growth phenotype. This synthetic slow growth correlated with the accumulation of the double mutant cells arrested at the G2/M border. Furthermore, disruption of the eIF2A gene in the eIF4E-ts strain 4-2 caused a strong disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and accumulation of actin protein at elevated levels. We also show that eIF2A acts as a suppressor of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element found in the URE2 mRNA. Analysis of eIF2A distribution in ribosomal fractions of various yeast mutants suggests that this inhibition occurs at the level of 40 S/80 S ribosomes. We also found that eIF2A is an inherently unstable protein with a half-life of ∼17 min. We hypothesize that this instability allows for translational control through the level of eIF2A protein in yeast cells.

Transformation was performed using the lithium acetate method (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 53: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). For the polysome expression analysis of HA-tagged eIF2A, yeast were grown in complete medium with 2% galactose. Plasmids—The pTB328_y_2A shuttle vector bearing yeast eIF2A (fused to an HA epitope) under control of the GAL promoter has been previously described (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O.

The YCplac111 (CEN, LEU2) vector bearing yeast eIF2A under its own promoter was produced by BamHI-PstI subcloning of the PCR-amplified (3339 bp) yeast genomic DNA fragment (with 5′-AACGCGGATCCCTATTATCTATGAATATAAACTGTCTATCTTTCC-3′ as the upstream and 5′-AAAACTGCAGCCATGGTGTGCAATAACTGCGAAGGTAGCACCGC-3′ as the downstream primer) into the YCplac111 vector. This fragment contains 843 bp upstream of the eIF2A AUG start codon. The pRS316_y_2A (CEN, URA3) plasmid was constructed as follows. Yeast eIF2A genomic DNA fragment (3809 bp) was PCR-amplified with 5′-TTGGTTCAAATTATTGGCTGTAGG-3′ as an upstream primer and 5′-TTGTATGGATGGATCCGTTTCTTCTAGTTTATTC-3′ as downstream digested with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into KpnI-SalI-digested pRS316 vector.

The p281-4-URE2 and p281-4-URE2_CTT vectors have also been previously described (20Komar A.A. Lesnik T. Cullin C. Merrick W.C. Trachsel H. Altmann M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed generally as described (21Alwine J.C. Kemp D.J. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl.

For detection of Ure2_lacZ mRNAs, the PCR-amplified 3-kb lacZ fragment (with 5′-CGCCTTGCAGCACATCC-3′ as the upstream and 5′-GGTAGCGACCGGCGC-3′ as the downstream primer) was random prime-labeled using the Ambion Random Primed Strip Able DNA probe synthesis and removal kit. RNA electrophoresis was accomplished using the Glyoxal-based system (Ambion). Ambion RNA Millennium Markers™ were used as molecular size standards. Yeast total RNA was prepared using the RNAqueous™ kit from Ambion. The 5′-end 32P-labeled anti-HA primers (5′-GCCCGCATAGTCAGGAACATCGTATGGGTA-3′ for HA-eIF2A and 5′-AGAAGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTA-3′ for HA-eIF4E) were used to probe for eIF2A and eIF4E mRNAs expressed from the GAL promoter. Note that the nucleotide (but not the amino acid) sequence of HA tag attached to eIF2A and eIF4E open reading frames differs slightly, and this is why two different primers were used. Fractionation of Ribosomes—Fractionation of ribosomes was performed essentially as described before (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C except where indicated. Yeast cells from 50 ml of log phase culture were pelleted, treated for 1 min with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem), and repelleted. Lysates were made by glass bead cell disruption (3–5 cycles, 1 min each), with intermittent cooling on ice, in buffer that contained 100 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 7.4, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 8 min. Ribosomes were resolved in 10–25% sucrose gradients containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES·KOH, pH 7.4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (Beckman SW28 rotor, 20,000 rpm, 19.5 h). Gradients were collected with continuous monitoring at 254 nm using an ISCO UA-5 absorbance detector and 1640 gradient collector. Proteins collected from sucrose gradient fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and resolved in 10% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore Corp.) membranes. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed following standard procedures (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). For studying eIF2A time course degradation experiments, yeast extracts were obtained by glass beads disruption of the yeast cells mixed with protein loading buffer. After vigorous vortexing, the beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and Western blots were decorated with either mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibodies (Cell Signaling, Inc.) or with custom made rabbit anti-eIF2A antibodies followed by incubation with either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. The antibodies for actin and phosphoglycerate kinase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were then detected with an ECL™ kit (Amersham Biosciences).

The plasmid was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, harvested by centrifugation after 3 h of induction, and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, buffer, containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The recombinant protein was found to be insoluble and was further purified from the inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads following standard procedures described elsewhere. After the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column purification, the protein was found to be 95–97% pure and was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and concentrated using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.) and further used for immunization of rabbits. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were produced by United States Biological, Inc. Actin Phalloidin Staining—Yeast strains were grown in YEPD medium for 16 h in log phase by continual dilution at 30 °C. Fixation was performed by adding formaldehyde and Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 4 and 0.5%, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Yeast pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer plus 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 4% formaldehyde for further fixation for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS prior to phalloidin addition to a final concentration of 0.6 μm in PBS and incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Yeast samples were subsequently washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 1× mounting medium (90% glycerol, 0.1% PBS, 92 mmp-phenylenediamine). Images were captured with an IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a HiQ fluorescein filter set (excitation wavelength: 450–492 nm); a Planapochromatic 100× oil immersion objective lens; and a 100-watt mercury lamp. Images were collected and analyzed with a Princeton Instruments 5-MHz MicroMax cooled CCD camera, a shutter and controller unit, and IPLab software (version 3.5; Scanalytics). Flow Cytometry—Yeast strains were grown in YEPD medium for 16 h in log phase by continual dilution at 30 °C. Fixation was performed by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 70% and incubation overnight at 4 °C. Yeast pellets were resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and digested with RNase I (0.25 mg/ml) for 1.5 h at 50 °C. Samples were washed three times with 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0) before suspension in this buffer with 16 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed on a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer. Miscellaneous—Molecular cloning was performed following the general procedures described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J Fritsch FF. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was accomplished by the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University. Sequencing was performed with custom synthesized oligonucleotides using the fluorescently labeled dideoxyterminator methodology. SDS-PAGE was performed according to either the Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or Schagger and von Jagow (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) procedures. Yeast genomic DNA was isolated using the DNA-Pure™ Yeast Genomic Kit from CPG, Inc., following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase activity was measured following the protocol described by Clontech (59Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar) with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Cell extracts were prepared by subsequent cycles of cell freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. The eIF2A null mutant has been shown to have no apparent phenotype in a variety of systematic tests assaying growth, metabolism, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton and mitochondrial morphology, mating, stability of an artificial minichromosome, rate of spontaneous mutation, etc. (14Zoll W.L.

Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have, however, previously shown that the double 2AΔ/5BΔ mutant is “synthetically sick.” This suggested a genetic interaction between eIF2A and eIF5B (14Zoll W.L. Horton L.E. Komar A.A. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37079-37087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To further investigate the cellular functions of eIF2A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we decided to look for other initiation factors that could possibly genetically interact with eIF2A. Such genetic relationships, if they exist, suggest a functional interaction between the corresponding gene products. However, disruption of the vast majority of the initiation factors in yeast is known to be lethal. Thus, we decided to take advantage of combining the eIF2A mutation with some of the yeast temperature-sensitive mutants carrying ts mutations in the respective initiation factors. As a first step in this line of reasoning, the eIF2A gene (open reading frame YGR054W) was disrupted in the eIF4E-ts strain 4-2 using the kanMX disruption module and the resulting eIF4E-ts strain 4-2/2A (MATa, ade2-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, trp1-1, ura3, ygr054w::KanMX, cdc33::LEU2 <cdc33-4-2; TRP1, ARSCEN>) was obtained. The eIF4E-ts Strain with a Disrupted Copy of the eIF2A Gene Is Synthetically Sick and Displays an Altered Phenotype—eIF4E-ts strain 4-2 has two point mutations in the eIF4E gene, which confer a temperature-sensitive phenotype, resulting in a rapid shutoff of protein synthesis and cell growth at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) (15Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 10: 4467-4472Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, at permissive temperatures (28–30 °C), this strain displays growth rates that are only slightly reduced (15Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 10: 4467-4472Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the double eIF4E-ts and eIF2A mutant strain revealed a severe slow growth phenotype (Fig. 2A) when compared with the parental strains. The doubling time for this strain at 28 °C in liquid YPD glucose medium was found to be ∼4–4.2 h, whereas for the eIF4E-ts strain, it is about 2.5 h. This severe slow growth phenotype can be reverted by reintroducing the eIF2A gene on a CEN plasmid (Fig. 2A). Mutations in the eIF4E (CDC33) gene are known to arrest yeast cells at random points in the cell cycle (30Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Danaie P. Altmann M. Hall M.N. Trachsel H. Helliwell S.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether the eIF4E-ts/eIF2AΔ null mutant also presents a defect in cell cycle progression, we analyzed all strains by flow cytometry. At 30 °C, the eIF4E-ts 4-2 strain showed an increased cell population in G2 (73% total) (Fig. 2B). This effect was further exaggerated to more than 82% in eIF4E-ts/eIF2AΔ null mutant cells (Fig. 2B)"
https://openalex.org/W2046749164,"The translocase of the inner membrane 17 (AtTIM17-2) protein from Arabidopsis has been shown to link the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. This was demonstrated by several approaches: (i) In vitro organelle import assays indicated the imported AtTIM17-2 protein remained protease accessible in the outer membrane when inserted into the inner membrane. (ii) N-terminal and C-terminal tagging indicated that it was the C-terminal region that was located in the outer membrane. (iii) Antibodies raised to the C-terminal 100 amino acids recognize a 31-kDa protein from purified mitochondria, but cross-reactivity was abolished when mitochondria were protease-treated to remove outer membrane-exposed proteins. Antibodies to AtTIM17-2 inhibited import of proteins via the general import pathway into outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria, but did not inhibit protein import via the carrier import pathway. Together these results indicate that the C-terminal region of AtTIM17-2 is exposed on the outer surface of the outer membrane, and the C-terminal region is essential for protein import into mitochondria.

Together these results indicate that the C-terminal region of AtTIM17-2 is exposed on the outer surface of the outer membrane, and the C-terminal region is essential for protein import into mitochondria. Mitochondria were derived from a single endosymbiotic event that occurred approximately one billion years ago (1Lang B.F. Gray M.W. Burger G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 351-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2McFadden G.I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The loss of genes from the mitochondrial progenitor and transfer of genes to the host nucleus require that mitochondria rely on the import of nuclear-encoded cytosolic-synthesized proteins (3Adams K.L. Palmer J.D. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2003; 29: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This necessitated the development of specific targeting signals to direct proteins to the mitochondrion and an import apparatus to recognize and translocate the mitochondrial subset of proteins from all cytosolic-synthesized proteins (4Herrmann J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 74-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Dyall S.D. Brown M.T. Johnson P.J.

The completion of several genome sequencing projects allows a comparative genomic approach to be taken to identify and characterize the import apparatus of various organisms using the extensively studied yeast system as a template (7Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 8Hoogenraad N.J. Ward L.A. Ryan M.T.

Biol. 2004; 5: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).The import of proteins into mitochondria is achieved by a number of oligomeric protein complexes on the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. A single translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; AOX, alternative oxidase; ANT, adenine nucleotide transporter; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; FAd, FAd subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase; Pic, phosphate translocator; PRAT, preprotein and amino acid transporter; PK, proteinase K; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; UCP, uncoupler protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; AOX, alternative oxidase; ANT, adenine nucleotide transporter; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; FAd, FAd subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase; Pic, phosphate translocator; PRAT, preprotein and amino acid transporter; PK, proteinase K; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; UCP, uncoupler protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. recognizes all proteins destined for mitochondria, mediates their passage through the outer membrane, and subsequently passes them to other proteins complexes (11Pfanner N.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). β-Barrel proteins destined for the outer membrane are passed to the sorting and assembly machinery of the outer membrane (SAM) (13Paschen S.A.

Signal anchored proteins in the outer membrane are imported via a distinct pathway (17Ahting U. Waizenegger T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The general import pathways describes the import of proteins targeted to the translocase of the inner membrane 17:23 (TIM17: 23) complex that is responsible for the import of proteins that contain N-terminal, generally cleavable, targeting sequences termed presequences. Proteins can be sorted to the inner membrane by this pathway via conservative or stop-transfer mechanisms (7Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 11Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The carrier import pathway describes the insertion of inner membrane proteins that contain internal targeting signals and that contain multiple transmembrane regions. These proteins are passed from TOM to small intermembrane space proteins, which act as chaperones to mediate transfer to the TIM22 complex on the inner membrane (18Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 309-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). TIM22 and TIM23 are voltage-activated channels on the inner membrane that are activated by internal and N-terminal targeting signals respectively (10Rehling P. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Pfanner N. Chacinska A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Comparison of the protein import apparatus of yeast with that in mammals and plants indicated that the basic machinery is generally well conserved between diverse eukaryotic lineages (8Hoogenraad N.J. Ward L.A. Ryan M.T. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002; 1592: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Lister R. Murcha M.W. Whelan J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However differences do exist in specific components. Notably, orthologs for TOM70, TIM12, -18, -54, and TOB38 have not been identified in the Arabidopsis genome (22Lister R. Hulett J. Lithgow T. Whelan J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, even when components appear shared at a functional level between organisms, they can be unrelated at a sequence level e.g. TOM20 from plants is not orthologous to yeast TOM20 as it displays low significant sequence similarity and significant structural differences (23Werhahn W. Jansch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 41: 407-416Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, plant TOM22 lacks the cis-receptor domain that in yeast is a binding point for precursor proteins that have been recognized by TOM20. This modification may have been necessary to ensure the specificity of targeting to mitochondria and plastids in plant cells (24Macasev D. Newbigin E. Whelan J. Lithgow T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Macasev D. Whelan J. Newbigin E. Silva-Filho M.C. Mulhern T.D. Lithgow T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After initial recognition of precursor proteins by TOM20 in yeast they are proposed to be passed onto a series of binding sites located in the TOM and TIM17:23 complexes. This model was initially called the acid chain hypothesis but subsequently modified to the binding chain hypothesis to account for the important role of hydrophobic as well as ionic interactions (26Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K.

Biol. 2001; 36: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Characterization of TIM17 and TIM23 from Arabidopsis indicated that although they are clearly orthologous to yeast import components they appear to be quite distinct. Structurally Arabidopsis TIM23 lacks a complete preprotein and amino acids transporter (PRAT) domain and does not contain the heptad leucine repeat domain (20Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIM17 contains a significant extension at the C-terminal end not present in fungi and mammals, but genome sequence information indicates this extension is present in other plant TIM17. The Arabidopsis orthologs can only complement yeast mutants when these differences are changed to resemble the yeast structure (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that these components play different or additional roles in plants.Here we characterize the topology of TIM17 from plants in particular reference to the large C-terminal extension that is absent in yeast and mammalian TIM17. We show that this extension is located in the outer membrane and is essential for import of proteins via the general import pathway in plants.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Mitochondria and in Vitro Import of Radiolabeled Precursor Proteins—Precursor proteins for the alternative oxidase (AOX) (31Whelan J. Hugosson M. Glaser E. Day D.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the FAd subunit of ATP synthase (FAd) (32Dessi P. Smith M.K. Day D.A. Whelan J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), phosphate translocator (Pic) (33Murcha M.W. Elhafez D. Millar A.H. Whelan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and translocase of the inner membrane 17 (AtTIM17-2) (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were produced in a coupled TnT transcription-translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).Percoll-purified Arabidopsis mitochondria were isolated according to Millar et al. (34Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria (Mit*OM) were prepared for two purposes: (i) to carry out in vitro imports to test for insertion into or across the inner membrane, and (ii) after the import assay to test for the intraorganelle location of imported protein. Rupture of the outer membrane allowed access of added protease to intermembrane space components or inner membrane proteins exposed to the intermembrane space. Mit*OM were prepared by resuspending 100 μg of mitochondrial protein in 10 μl of SEH buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then adding 155 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 and incubating on ice for 20 min. To restore osmolarity, 25 μl of 2 m sucrose and 10 μl of 3 m KCl were added and mixed, re-pelleted, and washed in import buffer. This procedure removes cytochrome c but not outer membrane components as determined by blotting with outer membrane markers (35Lister R. Mowday B. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria were either used in in vitro import assays or were subjected to protease treatment.Import assays into mitochondria were carried out with 200 μg of mitochondrial protein in each import assay. Import assays were carried out at 26 °C for 20 min unless otherwise stated. Import assays were carried out in 15-ml polypropylene tubes in a volume of 200 μl in 0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm methionine, 0.2 mm ADP, 0.75 mm ATP, 5 mm succinate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were stopped by placing on ice for 3 min, dividing samples into two 100-μl aliquots, and adding proteinase K (PK) to one aliquot to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. PK digestion was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm after 15 min. Mitochondria were diluted into 1 ml of ice-cold import buffer and pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min in a microcentrifuge. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, gels were dried, and products were visualized by exposing to a BAS TR2040 plate for 24 h and reading in a BAS 2500 Bio imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo). A similar procedure was utilized for import into outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria except that the mitochondrial outer membrane was ruptured as outlined above before adding to the assay mixture. Likewise these assays were similarly treated with PK unless otherwise stated. Import assays in the presence of difference amounts of malonate, a competitive inhibitor to complex II, were carried out by first adding the desired amount of malonate to mitochondria and then the import buffer and equilibrated for 3 min on ice prior to addition of precursor protein and commencement of import assay (32Dessi P. Smith M.K. Day D.A. Whelan J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For chase experiments import assays were kept on ice with added precursor, washed in ice-cold import buffer without precursor protein, and resuspended in 200 μl of import buffer without precursor. These mitochondria were incubated at 26 °C for 20 min as for a standard import assay.Tagging of AtTIM17-2 and TIM23 with c-Myc and His6 and in Vitro Import—The Rapid Translation System RTS-500 (Roche Applied Science) was used for in vitro production of epitope-tagged AtTIM17-2. The coding region was cloned into PIVEX2.3-MCS (Roche Applied Science) ensuring that the C-terminal His6 tag was in the correct reading frame. Addition of the N-terminal c-Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL) was carried out using PCR with the N-terminal primer containing the coding sequence for the c-Myc tag. The resulting product was cloned into PIVEX2.3-MCS and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proteins were synthesized in the RTS-500 system according to the manufacturer's instructions for 24 h at 30 °C; the reaction vessel was mixed with magnetic agitation at 120 rpm. The synthesized protein was purified via two rounds of nickel affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The final elution buffer was 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 4.3. The protein was stored at -80 °C until use. Import assays using this precursor protein were carried out by thawing the purified protein followed by sonication for 10 s for three times on a microtip setting of 4 (Branson sonifier B-12). This protein was immediately added to the in vitro import assay; 4 μl was added to a 400-μl assay to dilute the urea to below 100 mm so as not to inhibit the import assay. The import assays were treated as outlined above except that after SDS-PAGE, the products were detected by Western blot analysis using antibodies to c-Myc and His6 (Roche Applied Science).Production of Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Immunodetection of various proteins was carried out by transferring proteins separated by SDS-PAGE to supported nitrocellulose using a semidry blotter (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were probed with a variety of antibodies and visualized and quantitated using chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science) using a LAS 1000 (Fuji, Tokyo). Antibodies to Arabidopsis TOM20 (36Chew O. Lister R. Qbadou S. Heazlewood J.L. Soll J. Schleiff E. Millar A.H. Whelan J.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1619-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen), and AtTIM17-2 were used to probe membranes. Inoculating rabbits with the C-terminal 100 amino acids of TIM17 as antigen produced the AtTIM17-2 antibodies (38Harlow D.L. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The C-terminal extension of AtTIM17-2 (amino acids 143–243) was cloned into pDest15 (Invitrogen) protein expression vector using the Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen). A PreScisson protease cleavage site (LEVLFQGP) was introduced inbetween the N-terminal GST tag and TIM17. Recombinant GST-LEVLFQGP-TIM17 expression was induced in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys5 via isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified using glutathione-Sepharose. TIM17 was released from the GST tag by digestion with PreScisson protease (Amersham Biosciences), as the recombinant protein remained bound to glutathione-Sepharose. The 15-kDa protein was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline and sequenced by mass spectrometry to confirm identity prior to inoculation of rabbits.RESULTSIn Vitro Imported TIM17 Remains Sensitive to Externally Added Protease—TIM17 is encoded by three genes in Arabidopsis, designated AtTIM17-1 (At1g20350), AtTIM17-2 (At2g37410), and AtTIM17-3 (At5g11690) (9Lister R. Murcha M.W. Whelan J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although all predicted proteins display 50% sequence similarity with yeast TIM17 (158 amino acids in length) the predicted proteins differ in length; AtTIM17-1 is 218 amino acids, AtTIM17-2 is 243 amino acids, and AtTIM17-3 is 133 amino acids. Sequence alignments show AtTIM17-1 and AtTIM17-2 both contain long C-terminal extensions not present in AtTIM17-3 or the yeast TIM17. The AtTIM17-2 transcript was expressed at 10-fold higher levels than the other two genes in all Arabidopsis tissues examined and its product, AtTIM17-2, was the only TIM17 paralog identified in isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria by tandem mass spectrometry (39Lister R. Chew O. Lee M.N. Heazlewood J.L. Clifton R. Parker K.L. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the intraorganelle location and function of AtTIM17-2 with particular reference to its C-terminal extension that appears to be plant specific. In vitro mitochondrial uptake of radiolabeled AtTIM17-2 resulted in a protease-protected product with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa. An additional band of 28 kDa was generated on protease treatment of mitochondria compared with the precursor alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). The generation of this 28-kDa product required an inner membrane potential as increasing malonate concentration to 50 mm, to dissipate the membrane potential (ΔΨ), resulted in no protease generated product (Fig. 1, lane 9). Notably, the protease-protected product of 31 kDa was still evident in the absence of a ΔΨ (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 9). We also tested the import of a protein imported via the carrier import pathway, ANT. The N-terminal extension of the plant ANT was cleaved generating a mature form of 31 kDa from a 39-kDa precursor (33Murcha M.W. Elhafez D. Millar A.H. Whelan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Lister R. Mowday B. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 30: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At 50 mm malonate, no processing of ANT to the mature form was detected suggesting ΔΨ dependence. AOX, a protein imported via the general import pathway, was imported and processed as previously documented except at 50 mm malonate, where no import occurred because of the lack of ΔΨ (Fig. 1A) (31Whelan J. Hugosson M. Glaser E. Day D.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus we concluded that all precursors tested were imported in a membrane potential-dependent manner. The protease-protected forms of AtTIM17-2 and ANT at 50 mm malonate likely represent stage III import intermediates (see below). Translocation of proteins via the carrier pathway to a protease insensitive location in the absence of a membrane potential has been shown in mitochondria (40Zara V. Palmisano I. Rassow J. Palmieri F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7818-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and a reconstituted vesicle system (42Vasiljev A. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Go N.E. Habib S.J. Kozany C. Panneels V. Sinning I. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Nussberger S. Rapaport D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1445-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). From these observations it appeared that a portion of AtTIM17-2 remained protease accessible when imported into the inner mitochondrial membrane.To further characterize the location of imported AtTIM17-2 we increased the amount of added protease and also ruptured the outer membrane after the import assay but prior to protease treatment (Fig. 1B). Increasing of protease to four times the amount normally used to remove unimported precursor proteins did not further convert the 31-kDa AtTIM17-2 precursor form to the 28-kDa form. Confirmation that the imported At-TIM17-2 was located in the inner membrane was demonstrated by the fact that upon rupture of the outer membrane a 16-kDa inner membrane protease protected form was evident as previously reported (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AOX was used as a control because it is located on the inner surface of the inner membrane, and mature imported protein was protected from increasing protease concentration in both intact and outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria (Fig. 1B). In addition to the 28 kDa protein generated by externally added protease, a product with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa was generated during incubation of AtTIM17-2 with mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lane 2, marked with an asterisk). This product was partially sensitive to protease treatment and is probably attributed to translation initiation at internal methionines. Previously we have demonstrated that the four radiolabeled bands with apparent molecular masses of 31, 27.5, 24.5, and 23 kDa, which are present in the translation mixture of AtTIM17-2, represent translations commencing at methionine residues 1, 25, 57, and 80, respectively. Additionally the 18-kDa product represents translation commencing at methionine residue 143 (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The translation products of 27.5, 24.5, and 23 kDa still contain transmembrane regions 3 and 4, which contain the mitochondrial targeting activity of At-TIM17-2 (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus the 21-kDa product generated upon incubation with mitochondria likely represents these imported products that have been subjected to endogenous proteolysis. Like the full-length translation product of 31 kDa, the 21-kDa product is only partially sensitive to externally added protease in intact mitochondria. The 18-kDa translation product beginning at methionine 143 has no mitochondrial targeting activity (30Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In combination, these data suggested the undigested 31-kDa form of AtTIM17-2 could represent one of two forms, either it is an imported product located in the inner membrane with a fraction also in the outer membrane, or the protease-protected 31-kDa form is a stage III import intermediate of the carrier import pathway not yet inserted into the inner membrane, as suggested by the fact it is imported into a protease-insensitive location in the absence of a ΔΨ (Fig. 1) (40Zara V. Palmisano I. Rassow J. Palmieri F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell.

Rapaport D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1445-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To confirm the latter we bound AtTIM17-2 to mitochondria and then chased it into the inner membrane (Fig. 1C). Incubation of AtTIM17-2 with mitochondria at 4 °C resulted in only a very small amount of 31-kDa AtTIM17-2 been protected from protease digestion, which suggested external binding to mitochondria (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Similarly, no import of AOX was observed under these conditions because no protease-resistant products were detected (Fig. 1C, lane 3). These mitochondria were washed in import buffer without precursor protein and incubated at 26 °C for 20 min. It was observed that ∼90% of the bound 31-kDa AtTIM17-2 protein was converted to the 28-kDa form. Thus we concluded that the 28-kDa form of AtTIM17-2 represents the truly imported form, and the protease-protected 31-kDa band is a stage III-like import intermediate that is imported across the outer membrane to a protease-insensitive location but not inserted into the inner membrane.The integrity of mitochondria, the rupture of the outer membrane and efficacy of the protease treatments performed in these experiments was monitored using antibodies raised to TOM20 (outer membrane marker), cytochrome c (intermembrane space marker), and the uncoupling protein (UCP; inner membrane marker). UCP was resistant to protease and outer membrane rupture, cytochrome c was only digested by protease upon outer membrane rupture, whereas TOM20 was digested by protease in intact and outer membrane-ruptured mitochondria (Fig. 1D).The C-terminal Region of AtTIM17-2 Is Protease-sensitive in the Outer Membrane—To determine which region of AtTIM17-2 was protease-sensitive in mitochondria, the N terminus was tagged with c-Myc and the C-terminal with His6. These proteins were expressed in an in vitro translation system, purified using nickel affinity chromatography, denatured in urea, and used in import assays with purified mitochondria. The imported and protease-protected proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Protease treatment resulted in the removal of the C-terminal His6 tag from AtTIM17-2 because no signal was detected when anti-His6 antibodies were used to detect imported products (Fig. 2A). In contrast, antibodies to c-Myc detected a protease product of 31 kDa compared with the undigested form of 34 kDa. The small differences in apparent molecular mass between the tagged prote"

To characterize the role of this protein in other nuclear processes we isolated chromatin particles from chicken liver, a vertebrate system that does not undergo X-inactivation. Chromatin digestion and fractionation studies determined that mH2A is evenly distributed at several levels of chromatin structure and stabilizes the nucleosome core particle in solution. However, at the level of the chromatosome, selective salt precipitation showed the existence of a mutually exclusive relationship between mH2A and H1, which may reveal functional redundancy between these proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of one major population of mH2A containing nucleosomes, which may become ADP-ribosylated. This report provides new clues into how mH2A distribution and a previously unidentified post-translational modification may help regulate the repression of autosomal chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2054872580,"To study the mechanism of gel-forming mucin packaging within mucin granules, we generated human mucous/goblet cells stably expressing a recombinant MUC5AC domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). The fusion protein, named SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK, accumulated in the granules together with native MUC5AC. Inhibition of protein synthesis or disorganization of the Golgi complex did not result in diminished intragranular SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK signals, consistent with long-term storage of the fusion protein. However, SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK was rapidly discharged from the granules upon incubation of the cells with ATP, an established mucin secretagogue. Several criteria indicated that SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK was not covalently linked to endogenous MUC5AC. Analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching suggested that the intragranular SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK mobile fraction and mobility were significantly lower than in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Incubation of the cells with bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, did not alter the fusion protein mobility, although it significantly increased (∼20%) the intragranular SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK mobile fraction. In addition, the granules in bafilomycin-incubated cells typically exhibited a heterogeneous intraluminal distribution of the fluorescent fusion protein. These results are consistent with a model of mucin granule intraluminal organization with two phases: a mobile phase in which secretory proteins diffuse as in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen but at a lower rate and an immobile phase or matrix in which proteins are immobilized by noncovalent pH-dependent interactions. An intraluminal acidic pH, maintained by the vacuolar H+-ATPase, is one of the critical factors for secretory protein binding to the immobile phase and also for its organization.

The mucous blanket that covers the gastrointestinal, tracheobronchial, urogenital, auditory, and conjunctiva epithelia and also the gills of fishes and the epidermis of amphibians lubricates these mucosas and creates a protective barrier against pathogenic and noxious agents (1Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar). This layer is a component of the mucosal innate host response that is regulated in response to inflammation and infection (2Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J.

Conversely, overproduction of mucus can be detrimental to health, as is evident in diseases characterized by a mucous hypersecretory phenotype such as cystic fibrosis (4Perez-Vilar J. Boucher R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 1564-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteins, glycoproteins, and phospholipids are an integral part of mucus, but current evidence suggests that gel-forming mucins, together with water and salts, largely determine the viscoelastic and adhesive properties of mucus.Only five different but structurally related gel-forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5B, MUC5AC, MUC6, and MUC19) are known in humans (5Gendler D.J.

In the different compartments of the Golgi complex, mucin dimers are O-glycosylated and sulfated (6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Once they reach the acidic trans-Golgi compartments, mucins are assembled into large covalent disulfide-linked oligomers/multimers (6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47116-47121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Fully processed mucins are stored in large secretory vesicles known as mucin granules, which occupy the majority of the cytoplasm in mucous/goblet cells (22Neutra M.R. Phillips T.L. Phillips T.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1984; 109: 20-39PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rogers D.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A combination of mucin granules released at a very low rate and/or small secretory vesicles departing from the trans-Golgi compartments might mediate constitutive mucin secretion (23Rogers D.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24McCool D.J. Forstner J.F. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+-regulated discharge of mucin granules can be rapidly triggered by a wide variety of physiological agents, including cytokines/chemokines, bacterial exoproducts, nucleotides, neurotransmitters, and proteases (25Jackson A.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 39-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Regulated secretion guarantees a high supply of mucins in a minimal period of time, e.g. in response to acute microbial infection or the sudden presence of noxious chemicals. An efficient mechanism of mucin packing within secretory granules is critical to attain this function.The mechanism of protein concentration in secretory granules has attracted great attention over the years (26Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that secretory products in granules form insoluble aggregates and/or are entrapped in a condensed matrix that fully constrains their mobility and ultimately permits high concentrations of the product to be attained (27Keeler C. Hodson M.E. Dannies P.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 22: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the case of mucin granules, the matrix is postulated to be constituted by condensed mucin multimers (29Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), which are also the major secretory product. In other cell types, however, the major secretory products might co-aggregate with intraluminal matrix proteins.Morphological evidences suggest that, upon fusion of the granule with the plasma membrane, the mucin matrix undergoes massive swelling with the discharge of accompanying secretory products (30Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mucin matrix swelling can be prevented by increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and decreasing its pH, it was proposed that these two factors are critical for mucin intragranular condensation (29Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, electron microscopy microanalysis suggests the existence of a high concentration of Ca2+ in the mucin granules, whereas in vivo measurements with pH-dependent fluorescent dyes suggest an acidic intraluminal environment (31Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 32Verdugo P. Aiken M. Langley L. Villalon M.J. Biorheology. 1987; 24: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Chin W.C. Quesada I. Nguyen T. Verdugo P. Novartis Found. Symp. 2002; 248: 132-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, an ion exchange-triggered phase transition from a dehydrated/condensed mucin matrix to fully hydrated mucus might explain the experimental observations (30Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The large size, polymeric nature, high charge density, and hydrodynamic radii of mucins suggest the existence of a complex mechanism of intragranular accumulation. These macromolecules have multiple specific domains and post-translational modifications (6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It is likely that they are critical for mucin condensation and play specific roles in the overall process. As a first step to study these issues, we modified an existing human colonic mucous/goblet cell line to stably express a recombinant mucin domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CK, cystine knot; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; Mf, mobile fraction. 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CK, cystine knot; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; Mf, mobile fraction. We report the characterization of this system and the analysis of mucin granule lumen by photobleaching techniques in live cells. The results strongly suggest that the mucin granule lumen comprises two components: a pH-dependent immobile phase and a fluid/mobile phase. The biological significance of granule compartmentalization is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of MUC5AC and MUC5B CK Domains, Construction of Plasmid Expression Vectors, and Murine Leukemia Virus Vector Production—cDNAs encoding MUC5AC and MUC5B CK (cystine-knot) subdomains were generated by PCR using human airway cDNA as template and oligonucleotide pairs (MGW Biotech Inc.) based on their reported sequences (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers AJ001402 and XM039877). Airway cDNA was prepared with SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from RNA purified from well differentiated human primary airway epithelial cells as described (34Bernacki S.H.

The amplified mucin cDNA fragments were initially cloned in the vector pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pSH-GFP, a plasmid that encodes a His-tagged secreted form of GFP (13Perez-Vilar J. Randell S.H. Boucher R.C. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to create plasmids pSHGFP-MUC5AC/CK and pSHGFP-MUC5B/CK. These plasmids encode fusion proteins (denoted SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK and SHGFP-MUC5B/CK, respectively) consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, following by six consecutive histidines, GFP, and the entire CK domain of MUC5AC (Fig. 1) or MUC5B. Murine leukemia retroviral vectors were made by PCR amplification of SHGFP-MUC5B/CK and SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK sequences from the previous two vectors and subcloning of the resulting DNA fragments between the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites of pHIT-XIP, a retroviral plasmid that encodes a puromycin-resistant marker. pHIT-XIP was derived from pHIT-LZ (35Johnson L.G. Mewshaw J.P. Ni H. Friedmann T. Boucher R.C. Olsen J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8861-8872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the lacZ gene with a cassette containing a multiple cloning site sequence, the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site sequence, and the puromycin resistance gene. The resulting vectors were used to produce replication-deficient murine leukemia virus particles in 293T cells according to standard procedures (35Johnson L.G. Mewshaw J.P. Ni H. Friedmann T. Boucher R.C. Olsen J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8861-8872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the plasmids mentioned above were analyzed by restriction nuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (University of North Carolina DNA Sequencing Facility) and found to have the expected DNA sequences. pssGFP-KDEL, a plasmid that encodes a soluble GFP sorted to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, was a generous gift from Dr. E. L. Snapp (Albert Einstein College of Medicine).Transient Expression and Biochemical Analysis of Recombinant Proteins in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks, transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and radiolabeled 24 h post-transfection with [35S]cysteine/methionine as described (36Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that Pro-mix (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the source of radiolabeled amino acids. Absorption of His-tagged proteins to TALON-IMAC (identated methal affinity chromatography) beads (Clontech) and analysis of the proteins by SDS gel electrophoresis/autoradiography were performed as described (16Bell S.L. Xu G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 357: 203-209Crossref Google Scholar).14C-Methylated proteins (Amersham Biosciences) used as molecular mass standards were 14C-methylated myosin (220,000 Da), phosphorylase b (97,400–100,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (66,000 Da), ovalbumin (46,000–50,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (30,000 Da), and lysozyme (14,300 Da).Permanent Expression and Biochemical Analysis of Recombinant Proteins in HT29–18N2 cells—HT29–18N2 cells (a generous gift from Dr. T. E. Phillips, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri) were maintained as described (37Philips T.E. Ramos R. Duncan S.L. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 25-cm2 T-flasks and transduced with retroviral vectors encoding SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK or SHGFP-MUC5B/CK at a multiplicity of infection of 100 following published protocols (35Johnson L.G. Mewshaw J.P. Ni H. Friedmann T. Boucher R.C. Olsen J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8861-8872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h later, the cells were moved to 15-cm diameter dishes in culture medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. The selection medium was changed every 5 days until resistant cells were confluent. Individual cell clones expressing the recombinant protein were obtained by limiting dilution of the polyclonal cell line or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting carried out at the University of North Carolina Flow Cytometry Facility. Both polyclonal cells and single cell clones under 20 passages were employed in this study.The biochemical identification of endogenous MUC5AC and recombinant His-tagged proteins synthesized by transfected cells was performed by protein blotting using rabbit anti-MUC5AC polyclonal antibody (38Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref Google Scholar) and mouse anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Total (cellular or culture medium) proteins were separated on agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes as described (39Thornton D.J. Howard M. Devine P.L. Sheehan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Morphological and Cytochemical Analysis of Fixed Cells—Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% (w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and embedded in paraffin after ethanol dehydration. Sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and the Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Some sections were deparaffinized with xylene; rehydrated; and stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (Abcam) following standard procedures, including antigen retrieval with citric acid, sequential incubations with appropriate goat biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated avidin, and the peroxidase substrates diaminobenzidine and H2O2. Sections were counterstained with 1% (w/v) methyl green in methanol, which stained nuclei and mucin granules in mucous/goblet cells, likely due to their polyanionic character. Control sections were processed with normal anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG.In other experiments, cells were briefly washed with PBS containing calcium and magnesium (1 mm each) and fixed in 2% (w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min on ice. Following a 10-min incubation in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and an overnight incubation at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, the cells were sequentially incubated at room temperature with primary and secondary antibodies (30 min each, both diluted in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). After several washes with PBS, cells were visualized under a confocal microscope within 3 h. Mouse anti-MUC5AC monoclonal antibody 45M1 (40Bara J. Gautier R. Mouradian P. Decaens C. Daher N. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was obtained from Lab Vision Corp. The epitope recognized by the anti-MUC5AC monoclonal antibody is not located in the CK domain, and therefore, this antibody detects endogenous MUC5AC, but not SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK.To visualize the ultrastructure of cells under an electron microscope, cells were fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in perfluorocarbon, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and embedded in Epon resin following published procedures (41Matsui H.

Sections (90 nm thick) were selected for evaluation.Live Cell Imaging—Cells in CO2-deficient medium plus 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) or in Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, essential and nonessential amino acids, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) were observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (University of North Carolina M. Hooker Microscopy Facility) at 37 °C on the microscope stage using 488-nm laser excitation for GFP.Fig. 2Expression and secretion of the MUC5AC and MUC5B CK domains.

Proteins were purified from the culture medium with TALON-IMAC (identated methal affinity chromatography) beads and separated by reducing SDS gel electrophoresis with (lanes 1–4) or without (lanes 5–8) prior reduction of the proteins with 2-mercaptoethanol. The gels were dried, and bands were detected by fluorography. The molecular weights (MW) of the standards are in thousands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Characterization of chemically fixed cells.A, cells grown for 3 days (panel a) or 8 days (panel b) in serum-free medium were processed for electron microscopy and observed under an optical microscope.

SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK fluorescence in a defined region of the mucin granule or the endoplasmic reticulum was photobleached for seven iterations for a total time period of ∼0.07 s at 80% laser power/100% transmission. In the case of the granules, the bleached region was a circular spot with the width of the laser beam (i.e. radius (r) of ∼0.26 μm). The fluorescence intensity (F) in the bleached area was monitored as a function of time after bleaching by scanning at 80% laser power/0.5% transmission every 0.3–0.7 s. As judged by bleaching entire granules, SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK photobleaching under these conditions was irreversible. Data sets with incomplete recoveries or in which the focal plane shifted were discarded by visual inspection of the recorded images. To assess differences in SHGFP-MUC5AC/CK mobility in the mucin granules under different conditions, we determined the characteristic diffusion times or recovery half-times (t½), i.e. the time required for F to recover to 50% of the plateau fluorescence intensity (Fm), from the recovery curves of normalized (fractional) fluorescence intensities versus corrected times (42Snapp E.

Thus, the data were fitted to a one-phase exponential curve: F(t) = Fm(1 – e–kt) and t½ = ln 2/k, where k is the rate constant. Although the differences in t½ obtained were minimal, an exponential expression fitted the data better than a hyperbolic equation or the expression of Feder at al. (43Feder T.J. Brust-Mascher I.

https://openalex.org/W2030802378,"We have shown previously that protein kinase C (PKC) ϵ can induce neurite outgrowth independently of its catalytic activity via a region encompassing its C1 domains. In this study we aimed at identifying specific amino acids in this region crucial for induction of neurite outgrowth. Deletion studies demonstrated that only 4 amino acids N-terminal and 20 residues C-terminal of the C1 domains are necessary for neurite induction. The corresponding regions from all other novel isoforms but not from PKCα were also neuritogenic. Further mutation studies indicated that amino acids immediately N-terminal of the C1a domain are important for plasma membrane localization and thereby for neurite induction. Addition of phorbol ester made this construct neurite-inducing. However, mutation of amino acids flanking the C1b domain reduced the neurite-inducing capacity even in the presence of phorbol esters. Sequence alignment highlighted an 8-amino acid-long sequence N-terminal of the C1b domain that is conserved in all novel PKC isoforms. Specifically, we found that mutations of either Phe-237, Val-239, or Met-241 in PKCϵ completely abolished the neurite-inducing capacity of PKCϵ C1 domains. Phorbol ester treatment could not restore neurite induction but led to a plasma membrane translocation. Furthermore, if 12 amino acids were included N-terminal of the C1b domain, the C1a domain was dispensable for neurite induction. In conclusion, we have identified a highly conserved sequence N-terminal of the C1b domain that is crucial for neurite induction by PKCϵ, indicating that this motif may be critical for some morphological effects of PKC.

The induction and elongation of neurites are cellular processes driven by cytoskeletal changes. These are under the control of different intracellular transduction pathways mediating signals from other cells or the extracellular matrix. The members of the PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NGF, nerve growth factor. family constitute one important family controlling the outgrowth of neurites. PKC isoforms have been suggested to both positively and negatively influence the outgrowth of neurites. There are 10 different PKC isoforms that are divided into three subclasses according to their structure and requirements for activation, classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ι/λ and ζ). Of these isoforms, particularly PKCδ (1Rosdahl J.A. Mourton T.L. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 292-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Corbit K.C. Foster D.A.

However, there are also indications that PKC isoforms, for instance PKCϵ, can counteract outgrowth (9Mikule K. Sunpaweravong S. Gatlin J.C. Pfenninger K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21168-21177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our group has shown previously that overexpression of PKCϵ in neuroblastoma (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B.

Cell Res. 2004; 292: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) cells leads to neurite outgrowth. A similar morphological effect of PKCϵ has also been observed in fibroblasts (10Hernandez R.M. Wescott G.G. Mayhew M.W. McJilton M.A. Terrian D.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 532-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Troller U. Raghunath A. Larsson C. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The neurite-inducing effect of PKCϵ is independent of its catalytic activity, and a region from the regulatory domain of the enzyme encompassing the two C1 domains with flanking structures is necessary and sufficient for the effect (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many proteins, besides PKC isoforms, contain C1 domains (12Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These domains can roughly be subgrouped as typical C1 domains that bind phorbol esters and atypical C1 domains that do not bind phorbol esters (13Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Classical and novel PKC isoforms contain two typical C1 domains. The structure of PKCα C1b (14Hommel U. Zurini M. Luyten M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), PKCδ C1b (15Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and PKCγ C1b (16Xu R.X. Pawelczyk T. Xia T.H. Brown S.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10709-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) domains has been determined, revealing that the C1 domain is a compact globular structure. The integrity of the domain depends on the coordinated binding of two Zn2+ ions by conserved cysteine and histidine residues. On the tip of the domain is a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding pocket located between two β strands (15Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The sides of the pocket are covered by hydrophobic residues, and binding of lipid generates a continuous hydrophobic surface that facilitates the insertion of the domain into the membrane. Besides the binding of lipids, C1 domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol.

For instance, in PKCϵ an F-actin-binding site is located C-terminal of the C1a domain (22Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). One important function of C1 domains is likely the targeting of the protein to specific intracellular locations. Several C1 domain-containing proteins are localized to the Golgi apparatus, and this is mediated via a C1 domain (23Caloca M.J. Wang H. Delemos A. Wang S. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Purohit A. Halilovic E. Doxsey S.J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 4829-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The fact that C1 domains both bind membranes and can mediate protein interaction implies that they also may serve as anchoring proteins at different membranes. We hypothesize that the PKCϵ C1 domains induce neurites by interacting with one or several proteins and either anchor them at the membrane, perhaps as a signaling complex, or, if they are membrane-residing proteins, induce a conformational change in them. To understand further such an interaction, this study was designed to identify a specific motif in the C1 region of PKCϵ that is crucial for induction of neurite outgrowth. We show that a stretch of eight amino acids N-terminal of the C1b domain, which is evolutionarily conserved in all novel PKC isoforms, is critical for neurite induction. Furthermore, we identify in this amino acid sequence three hydrophobic residues, the mutation of which completely abolishes the neurite-inducing capacity of the PKCϵ C1 domains. Plasmids—Plasmids encoding EGFP fusion proteins of PKCϵPSC1V3, PKCϵC1V3, full-length PKCϵ, and the C1 domains of PKCα, -δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ have been described previously (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B.

Restriction enzyme sites were introduced in the primers to enable ligation of the PKC fragments into the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). To generate PKCϵPSC1V3 with two C1a or two C1b domains, XhoI and MluI sites were inserted by PCR at both sides of the sequences encoding the C1a or C1b domains. The C1 domain-encoding sequence was thereafter inserted at the desired site in the PKCϵPSC1V3-encoding sequence. Expression vectors encoding PKCϵPSC1V3 fused to EGFP containing only one of the mutations, N-terminal or C-terminal of C1a or C1b, were generated by PCR-based cloning but introduced the restriction enzyme site on only one side of the C1 domain-encoding sequence. The ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to replace the sequence QRFSVNMP in PKCϵPSC1V3-EGFP with the scrambled sequence SMQPFNRV. The DpnI-treated PCR products were purified in 1% agarose gel and were thereafter ligated. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced in the PCRs. The scrambled sequence SMQPFNRV was also introduced in full-length PKCϵ by using the SacI and ScaI restriction enzyme sites to cleave out a PKCϵ fragment containing the scrambled sequence. The fragment was thereafter ligated into the full-length PKCϵ-pEGFP vector. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce the R236A, F237A, V239G, N240G, and M241G mutations in the PKCϵPSC1V3 sequence using the expression vector encoding PKCϵPSC1V3-EGFP as template. The mutations were verified by sequencing.

Gestblom C. Johansson I. Nanberg E. Pahlman S. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 727-736PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts and l-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell culture solutions were from Invitrogen. For transfections, cells were trypsinized and seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 200,000 (SK-N-BE(2)C cells) or 300,000 cells (SH-SY5Y/TrkA and PC12 cells) per 35-mm cell culture dish. The cells were transfected 24 h later using 2 μl of Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of DNA in 1 ml of serum-free medium according to the supplier's protocol. Six hours later, the transfection mixture was replaced with medium containing serum and antibiotics. Where indicated, cells were treated with 16 nm TPA (Sigma) or 50 μm C2-ceramide (Sigma) for 17 h or 100 ng/ml NGF (Promega) for 2 days. Morphology Studies—Seventeen hours, or 2 days for experiments with NGF, after transfection, cells were fixed and mounted as described previously (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Transfected cells, identified by the fluorescence of EGFP, were considered to have neurites if the process was longer than two cell bodies. For PC12 cells, processes longer than the length of one-half cell body were considered as neurites. 200 transfected cells per experiment were counted. Western Blotting—Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish or 1.2 × 106 (SK-N-BE(2)C) or 2.2 × 106 (SH-SY5Y/TrkA and PC12) cells/60-mm culture dish and transfected with 6 μl of Lipofectamine2000 and 3 μg of DNA in 3 ml of serum-free medium. The day after transfection cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)) followed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of proteins were electrophoretically separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Proteins were detected with primary antibodies toward GFP (1:250; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) using the SuperSignal system (Pierce) as substrate. The chemiluminescence was detected with a CCD camera. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min, permeabilized, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min. Syntaxin 6 was detected with a primary monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) diluted 1:25 followed by a secondary Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:400 in Tris-buffered saline. The coverslips were thereafter mounted as for morphology studies. Confocal Microscopy—Live cells were examined the day after transfection. The coverslips were washed twice with buffer H (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and mounted on the heated stage of a Nikon microscope. The localization of PKCϵ-EGFP was examined using a ×60 objective (NA 1.4) and a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system with excitation wavelengths at 488 nm and emission filter 515HQ30 prior to and 1 min after addition 1 mm carbachol. Fixed cells were examined with the same settings with the modification that Alexa Fluor 546 was detected using 543 nm excitation and 600LP emission filter. The Importance of the Pseudosubstrate and the V3 Region for Neurite Outgrowth Induced by the Regulatory Domain of PKCϵ—Our group has shown previously that overexpression of PKCϵ induces neurite outgrowth in SK-N-BE (2Corbit K.C. Foster D.A. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4209-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) neuroblastoma cells via the regulatory domain and that a region of PKCϵ encompassing the pseudosubstrate, the two C1 domains, and the V3 region (PKCϵPSC1V3) is sufficient for this effect (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To elucidate further which structures in PKCϵ are necessary for neurite outgrowth, the importance of amino acids N- and C-terminal of the C1 domains was investigated. For N-terminal amino acids we studied PKCϵ variants in which either all amino acids N-terminal of the C1a domain had been removed (PKCϵC1V3) or in which four amino acids prior to the C1a domain were included (PKCϵ4+C1V3). SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells, transfected with vectors encoding PKCϵPSC1V3 or the truncated variants fused to EGFP, were cultured in the absence or presence of 16 nm TPA for 17 h. Thereafter the number of transfected cells with neurites was quantified (Fig. 1A). Removal of the pseudosubstrate resulted in a construct with markedly reduced capacity to stimulate neurite outgrowth, and inclusion of four amino acids N-terminal of the C1a domain generated a construct with an intermediate effect. However, TPA treatment of cells overexpressing the truncated mutants led to neurite outgrowth to a similar extent as for cells overexpressing PKCϵPSC1V3. Thus, the necessity of the pseudosubstrate for optimal neurite induction can be compensated for by TPA treatment. Western blot on lysates from transfected cells confirmed the expression of proteins of proper size (Fig. 1B). Next, the importance of the C-terminal part of the PKCϵ regulatory domain for neurite outgrowth was investigated by gradually deleting parts of the V3 region. The PKCϵPSC1V3 region contains 80 amino acids C-terminal of the C1b domain. Constructs encoding a PKCϵ region beginning four residues N-terminal of the C1a domain and encompassing 39 (PKCϵ4+C1+39), 20 (PKCϵ4+C1+20), 12 (PKCϵ4+C1+12), or 6 (PKCϵ4+C1+6) residues C-terminal of the C1b domain were generated, and SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with the vectors. Neurite outgrowth was prominent and similar in cells overexpressing PKCϵ4+C1V3, PKCϵ4+C1+39, or PKCϵ4+C1+20, whereas no neurite induction could be detected in cells overexpressing PKCϵ4+C1+12 or PKCϵ4+C1+6 (Fig. 2A). Western blot on lysates of transfected cells demonstrated that non-neurite-inducing variants were not expressed at lower levels than neurite-inducing proteins (Fig. 2B), showing that the lack of neurite induction is not due to lower expression levels. To investigate whether the PKCϵ4+C1+12 region is capable of inducing neurite outgrowth when stimulated with TPA, cells overexpressing PKCϵ4+C1+12, PKCϵ4+C1V3, or PKCϵPSC1V3 were treated with TPA for 17 h after transfection (Fig. 2C). Still, the PKCϵ4+C1+12 construct did not induce neurite outgrowth, suggesting that more than 12 residues C-terminal of the C1b domain are required and that 20 residues C-terminal of the C1b domain are sufficient for neurite induction. To confirm that the PKCϵ4+C1V3 and PKCϵ4+C1+12 are responsive to phorbol esters, cells expressing these EGFP fusion proteins were treated with TPA and subjected to analysis with confocal microscopy (Fig. 2D). TPA treatment led to a plasma membrane translocation of both proteins demonstrating that they have retained their TPA sensitivity. The C1 Domains of All Novel PKC Isoforms Are Capable of Inducing Neurites in Neuroblastoma Cells—We have seen previously that the regulatory domains of all novel PKC isoforms to various extents have neurite-inducing capacity (3Ling M. Trollér U. Zeidman R. Lundberg C. Larsson C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Zeidman R. Trollér U. Raghunath A. Påhlman S. Larsson C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate if the region corresponding to PKCϵ4+C1+20 in other PKC isoforms also is capable of inducing neurite outgrowth. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were therefore transfected with vectors encoding EGFP fused to the C1 domains of PKCα, -δ, -η, and -θ flanked by 4 N-terminal and 20 C-terminal amino acids. Cells were grown for 17 h in the absence or presence of TPA and thereafter examined for neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of PKCδ4+C1+20, but not the corresponding regions in PKCα, -η and -θ, led to neurite outgrowth. After TPA stimulation, overexpression of C1 domains from all novel isoforms induced neurites, whereas overexpression of the corresponding region from the classical isoform PKCα had no effect. The expression levels of the EGFP-fused proteins were analyzed by Western blotting demonstrating that all proteins were expressed (Fig. 3C). However, the η and θ variants were expressed at lower levels, and there is therefore a possibility that the C1 domains of these isoforms may induce neurites also in the absence of TPA, if expressed at higher levels. Thus, the C1 domains of all novel PKC isoforms, but not of PKCα, have a capacity to induce neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, we investigated if only one of the two PKCϵ C1 domains is sufficient to induce neurites. For this purpose, we generated constructs encoding the isolated C1a or C1b domain including 4 residues N-terminal and 20 residues C-terminal of the C1 domain. Neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with the expression vectors and cultured in the absence or presence of TPA and examined for neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3B). Neither the isolated C1a nor the C1b domain could induce neurites by itself or after stimulation with TPA, indicating that overexpression of only one PKCϵ C1 domain is not sufficient to induce neurites. This is not due to lower expression levels of the isolated C1 domains because they are expressed at higher levels than PKCϵ4+C1+20 (Fig. 3C). Amino Acids Flanking the C1b Domain Are Critical for Neurite Outgrowth—Our next approach was to investigate whether the C1 domains can be exchanged for each other or whether each C1 domain has unique properties of importance for the neurite-inducing effect. To test this we aimed at generating constructs encoding PKCϵPSC1V3 with tandem C1a (PKCϵPSC1aC1aV3) or C1b (PKCϵPSC1bC1bV3) domains. For this purpose PCR primers were designed to introduce restriction enzyme sites on both sides of each C1 domain-encoding sequence (Fig. 4A). The cDNA encoding the C1 domain was thereafter inserted in the PKCϵPSC1V3 sequence, from which the other C1 domain had been excised. To obtain proper controls, we also created PKCϵPSC1aC1bV3 in which the restriction enzyme sites flanking the C1 domains were inserted. Neither the PKCϵPSC1aC1aV3 nor the PKCϵPSC1bC1bV3 construct had the capacity to induce neurites (not shown), but neither did control constructs containing the PKCϵPSC1V3 region with the mutations resulting from insertion of the restriction enzyme sites flanking the C1 domains, PKCϵPSC1V3(V166L/N167E, G221T/L222R) and PKCϵPSC1V3-(N240L/M241E, V295T/D296R) (Fig. 4B). Thus, amino acids flanking the C1 domains seem to be critical for neurite induction. To further pin-point the importance of amino acids flanking the C1 domains in PKCϵ, PKCϵPSC1V3 variants containing mutations on only one side of each C1 domain were also generated: PKCϵPSC1V3(V166L/N167E), PKCϵPSC1V3(G221T/L222R), PKCϵPSC1V3(N240L/M241E), and PKCϵPSC1V3-(V295T/D296R). SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transfected with the expression vectors and grown in the absence or presence of TPA, and EGFP-positive cells were scored for neurites (Fig. 4B). As shown previously, PKCϵPSC1V3 with mutations both N-terminal and C-terminal of the C1a domain had no neurite-inducing effect, but treatment with TPA made it neuritogenic. The same pattern was observed in cells overexpressing PKCϵPSC1V3 only mutated N-terminal of the C1a domain (V166L/N167E), whereas the effect of PKCϵPSC1V3 mutated C-terminal of the C1a domain (G221T/L222R) was similar to that of the wild-type that mediates neurite induction also in the absence of TPA. We have seen previously that the neurite induction of PKCϵ C1 domains seems to depend on its plasma membrane localization (7Zeidman R. Löfgren B. Påhlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Zeidman R. Trollér U. Raghunath A. Påhlman S. Larsson C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined the subcellular localization of the mutated PKCϵPSC1V3 variants with confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C). PKCϵPSC1V3 with mutations C-terminal of the C1a domain (G221T/L222R) had a similar plasma membrane localization as the wild-type. On the other hand, PKCϵPSC1V3 mutated N-terminal of the C1a domain (V166L/N167E) is to a large extent localized to the cytoplasm but a clear plasma membrane translocation can be induced by TPA. Thus, for these mutants localization to the plasma membrane seems to correlate to the neurite-inducing capacity of the mutant. It is therefore conceivable that the mutations suppress the neurite-inducing effect by altering the subcellular localization of the C1 domains. In contrast to the mutations flanking the C1a domain, mutations either N-terminal or C-terminal of the C1b domain both led to constructs that completely lacked neurite-inducing activity (Fig. 4B) and for these mutants, neurite induction could not be restored by treatment with TPA. Both mutants had a perinuclear localization pattern (Fig. 4C). Treatment with TPA led to a distinct plasma membrane localization, but as mentioned above, this was not accompanied by neurite induction. Thus, it is likely that the amino acids m"

Grb10 expression levels can influence Akt activity, and Grb10 may act as an adapter involved in the relocalization of Akt to the cell membrane. Here we identified 14-3-3 as a binding partner of Grb10 by employing a yeast two-hybrid screen. The 14-3-3·Grb10 interaction requires phosphorylation of Grb10, and only the phosphorylated form of Grb10 co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous 14-3-3. We could identify a putative phosphorylation site in Grb10, which is located in a classical 14-3-3 binding motif, RSVSEN. Mutation of this site in Grb10 diminished binding to 14-3-3. Thus, Grb10 exists in two different states of phosphorylation and complexes with 14-3-3 when phosphorylated on serine 428. We provide evidence that Akt directly binds Grb10 and is able to phosphorylate Grb10 in an in vitro kinase assay. Based on these findings, we propose a regulatory circuitry involving a phosphorylation-regulated complex formation of Grb10 with 14-3-3 and Akt.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), has been described. Interestingly, previously reported data have shown that the incubation with wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, abolishes Grb10 phosphorylation (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F.

The finding of four different splicing variants of Grb10 (human Grb10α, β, γ, and δ) may explain the controversy about the specific role of Grb10 as an activator or an inhibitor in particular signal transduction processes (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Three isoforms (β, γ, and δ) of Grb10 contain an intact PH domain, and one isoform lacks a PH domain (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that overexpression of a Grb10 isoform with an intact PH domain leads to Akt activation (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of Grb10 lacking an intact PH domain abolishes this activation. These data indicated the necessity of the Grb10 PH domain for its stimulatory effect on Akt. In accordance with this hypothesis, overexpression of a Grb10 isoform with an intact PH domain has a positive, stimulatory, and mitogenic effect on platelet-derived growth factor-BB, insulin growth factor-1, and insulin action (8Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Swamy O.R. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression of a Grb10 isoform lacking the PH domain inhibits insulin-stimulated substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of PI 3-kinase (9Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, the natural occurrence of different Grb10 isoforms with and without an intact PH domain may provide a mechanism for different regulation of signal transduction processes. However, recent additional studies showed controversial results regarding the role of Grb10 with an intact PH domain in insulin signaling (10Deng Y. Bhattacharya S. Swamy O.R. Tandon R. Wang Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8460-8467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The use of different cellular systems may account for these differences. Interestingly, the fusion of Grb10 to Akt revealed a constitutive active Akt chimera, further suggesting an important role of Grb10 in Akt regulation (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, a Grb10 mutant, which is constitutively attached to the plasma membrane, induced strong Akt activation and had a potent anti-apoptotic effect in Ba/F3 cells grown without survival factors. 2S. Urschel and J. Duyster, submitted for publication. 2S. Urschel and J. Duyster, submitted for publication. Together, these data suggest a mechanism of Akt activation through Grb10. Because Akt activation is a multistep process that requires the membrane translocation of the protein, Grb10 may act as a vehicle for Akt that facilitates the membrane localization of Akt. One of the first identified substrates of Akt was the Bcl2 family member Bad (13Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Akt phosphorylation of Bad mediates its interaction with 14-3-3, which prevents Bad from binding to Bcl-XL and suppresses apoptosis (14Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E33-E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another substrate of Akt is FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (15Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1 in the presence of survival factors, leading to FKHRL1 binding to 14-3-3. Binding to 14-3-3 causes cytosolic sequestration of FKHRL1 and prevents the nuclear translocation of FKHRL1. Survival factor withdrawal mediates the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FKHRL1, where the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules such as the Fas ligand is initiated by FKHRL1. In both cases, the pro-apoptotic function of these proteins is suppressed by interaction with 14-3-3, mediating sequestration in an appointed cell compartment. The interest in 14-3-3 in recent years has increased intensively because of the important interaction partners of 14-3-3 that are involved in cell cycle regulation (Cdc25), transcriptional control of gene expression (FKHRL members), or apoptosis (Bad). 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, and there exist to date seven isoforms in human cells and up to 15 in plants. These proteins generate homodimers and heterodimers (16Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Three preferred binding motifs of 14-3-3 have been described, namely Arg-Ser-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro, Arg-X-Arg-X-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro, and Arg-X-X-Ser(P), where Ser(P) represents a phosphorylated serine. Most of the interaction partners of 14-3-3 contain one of these motifs. But association with proteins that do not contain either one of these motifs, e.g. protein kinase Cμ, and association with unphosphorylated proteins, such as exoenzyme S, has been described (20Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified 14-3-3 as an interaction partner of Grb10. Phosphorylation of Grb10 is required for its interaction with 14-3-3 and is mediated by a 14-3-3 consensus binding site in Grb10. Based on these findings we present a hypothetical model of regulatory circuitry in which the phosphorylation of Grb10 regulates its interaction with 14-3-3 and Akt. Cell Lines, Expression Constructs, and Transfections—293, COS1, COS7, HeLa, and U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS. Ba/F3 cells were incubated in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS and murine interleukin-3. The murine Grb10 cDNA (pRK5 Grb10) was kindly provided by Renato Baserga of the Kimmel Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA. The human Grb10 cDNA (pBEX Grb10 gamma) was a kind gift from Feng Liu of the Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. To obtain a FLAG-tagged murine Grb10, the cDNA was cloned into pCMVTag from Stratagene. For mutation of the Grb10 Ser-76 and Ser-428, the serine was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate primers. The 14-3-3 cDNA was isolated from the yeast DNA and cloned into pCMV-Myc tagged from Stratagene. To obtain higher expression levels, we cloned the Myc-tagged 14-3-3 cDNA into a pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The hemagglutinin-tagged protein kinase B-Akt construct (pCMV6 HA-Akt) was a kindly gift from Thomas Franke, Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, NY. 293 cells were transiently transfected with M-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium methyl-sulfate (DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent; Roche Applied Science). COS1 and COS7 cells were transiently transfected with Gene Porter (GTS Inc., Biozol GmbH, Eching, Germany). Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected by electroporation and selection with 1 mg/ml G418 as described previously (22Bai R.Y. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K.M. Wang J.Y. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem). In Vivo Labeling of Cells with 32Pi—HeLa cells either starved in 0.5% FCS, stimulated with 10% FCS, or treated with 0.5 μm okadaic acid (OA) were cultured in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml 32Pi (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed from the corresponding lysates using either anti-Grb10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or control antiserum. In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation was performed with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Grb10 and Bad (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with active Akt, inactive Akt, or buffer alone, and the kinase assay was performed with 32P according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). The reactions were resolved by SDS-Page and visualized by autoradiography (BioMax, Kodak). Yeast Two-hybrid System—The DNA of Grb10 was cloned with BamHI/SalI into the yeast expression vector BTM116 BamHI/XhoI. A cDNA library derived from K562 cells was used (Clontech) as prey. Interactions were tested in the L40 yeast strain by assaying activation of the HIS3 reporter as described preciously (22Bai R.Y. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K.M. Wang J.Y. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antibody Preparation—To generate the antiphospho-Grb10 antibody, a phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 423–436 of the human Grb10 cDNA sequence was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Davids Biotechnology, Regensburg, Germany). The resulting serum was affinity purified using both the cognate phosphopeptide and the non-phosphopeptide. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed in accordance with standard procedures as described previously (23Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with the following antibodies: agarose-coupled anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene), anti-Myc 9E11 (Sigma), anti-14-3-3β K19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-14-3-3β H8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Grb10 (Upstate Biotechnology), and goat anti-Akt C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The phospho-specific Akt antibody (Ser-473) was obtained from New England Biolabs. For co-immunoprecipitation in tissues, the proteins were extracted from mouse lung by homogenization. The experiment was as described by O'Kelly et al. (24O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 26Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 27Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C.

The immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of a polyclonal anti-Grb10 antibody or a control antibody. The immunocomplexes were isolated with 40 μl of protein A beads. The proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE (12% for 14-3-3 and 8% for Grb10 separation). Blots were developed using SuperSignal chemoluminescent substrates from Pierce. GST Fusion Construct and GST Binding Studies—The 14-3-3 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX vector to obtain a GST-14-3-3 construct. The procedure for pull-down assays has been described previously (22Bai R.Y. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K.M. Wang J.Y. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with the GST fusion construct or with GST alone. Bound fractions of recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. A purified GST fusion protein of full-length Akt was obtained from a commercial source (Upstate Biotechnology). Treatment with Phosphatase, Wortmannin, or Okadaic Acid—Cells were transfected and harvested, and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The bound fractions were washed with phosphatase buffer (Pipes, pH 6) and incubated for the indicated time points at 30 °C with 0.4 units phosphatase (Sigma) with or without phosphatase inhibitors (NaF, ortho-vanadate, and glycerol phosphate). Cells were incubated with OA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for the indicated time points at the described concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D). Cells were incubated for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking FCS containing 500 nm wortmannin (Sigma). Untreated cells were incubated in media containing the same concentration of Me2SO. The Serine/Threonine Kinase Akt Interacts Directly with the Adapter Protein Grb10 and Phosphorylates Grb10 in Vitro— First we wanted to determine whether the described coimmunoprecipitation between Grb10 and Akt is a direct interaction between the two proteins (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We performed GST pull-downs with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Grb10 and purified GSTAkt protein (Fig. 1A). Both, Grb10WT and Grb10ΔPH showed a specific and direct interaction with Akt (Fig. 1A). We noted previously a mobility shift of Grb10 in SDS gels in Mo7e and K562 cells expressing the c-kit receptor or Bcr-Abl (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively. Other groups reported tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb10 as an effect of Tec (5Mano H. Ohya K. Miyazato A. Yamashita Y. Ogawa W. Inazawa J. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Hatake K. Kasuga M. Ozawa K. Kajigaya S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as serine phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additional data revealed that incubation with wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, abolished phosphorylation of Grb10, implicating a kinase downstream of this pathway (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because of their direct association, we assumed that Akt itself may be the kinase phosphorylating Grb10. In vitro kinase assays were performed with GST-Grb10 and with kinase active and inactive Akt. Bad, a known substrate of Akt, was used as a positive control (13Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, top section). The autoradiogram showed that GST-Grb10 incorporated 32P in the presence of kinase-active Akt. In this assay, the phosphorylation intensity was comparable with the phosphorylation of Bad (Fig. 1B). In the presence of kinase-inactive Akt, no 32P signal could be detected. Coomassie staining of the gel demonstrated equal levels of GST-Grb10 (Fig. 1B, bottom section). Thus, we identified Akt as a kinase able to phosphorylate Grb10 in an in vitro kinase assay. Phosphorylation is often regulated by a balance of kinases and phosphatases. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. Okadaic acid causes a 2.5–3-fold higher phosphorylation of many proteins (27Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), because the balance shifts in favor of phosphorylation. To investigate whether Grb10 phosphorylation is affected by phosphatase inhibitors, we treated COS1 cells expressing Grb10 with OA and harvested the cells after different time points (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis showed that after 40 min of incubation with OA, Grb10 started to undergo a mobility shift (Fig. 1C, lane labeled +40min). It is known that OA inhibits PP1 in the micromolar range and PP2A in the nanomolar range (27Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We transfected COS1 cells with FLAG-tagged Grb10WT or with Bad as a control, because PP2A is known to dephosphorylate Bad (27Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of OA (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis revealed that the mobility shift of Grb10 already occurs in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of OA indicating that PP2A and not PP1 is the phosphatase obligated for Grb10 dephosphorylation (Fig. 1D, top). To demonstrate that phosphorylation of endogenous Grb10 occurs in vivo, we incubated HeLa cells, either starved or incubated with agents that induce Grb10 phosphorylation, with 32P and performed immunoprecipitations of the corresponding lysates using anti-Grb10 or control antiserum. As depicted in Fig. 1E, phosphorylation of Grb10 was detectable in FCS-stimulated cells and at a reinforced level in cells treated with OA, whereas no phosphorylation was observed in serum-starved cells. The control precipitates did not give rise to unspecific signals. To further substantiate Grb10 phosphorylation, we generated a polyclonal phospho-specific Grb10 antibody raised against a phosphopeptide of Grb10. To test for specificity, we immunoprecipitated Grb10 from lysates derived from HeLa cells that were either serum-starved or stimulated with FCS and processed the respective blot for Western blot analysis. The phospho-Grb10 antiserum detected Grb10 only in the precipitate from FCS-stimulated cells, whereas no signal was observed in the serum-starved sample (Fig. 1F, top). Equal amounts of precipitated Grb10 were detectable in the Grb10 immunostain (Fig. 1F, bottom). We next performed Western blot analysis of lysates derived from HeLa cells that were serum-starved, stimulated with FCS, or treated with OA. As shown in Fig. 1G, top, the phospho-specific antiserum detected Grb10 only when stimulated with FCS and to a even higher extent when treated with OA. Only background signals were detectable in serum-starved cells. The specific phospho-Grb10 signal was abolished upon the addition of the relevant phosphopeptide (Fig. 1G, middle). Of note, an up-shift of Grb10 upon FCS stimulation or treatment with OA was not observed with the endogenous protein as compared with the overexpressed FLAG-tagged Grb10 protein. A Yeast Two-hybrid Screen Identified 14-3-3 as a New Binding Partner of Grb10 —From our data we hypothesized that Grb10 exists in two different states of phosphorylation that may regulate its interaction with other signaling molecules. To identify such binding proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a K562 cDNA library with a Grb10·LexA fusion protein as bait. In two independent screens the strongest interaction partner of Grb10 was identified to be the ϵ isoform of 14-3-3. To confirm the interaction between Grb10 and 14-3-3 in vitro, we performed GST pull-down assays. We expressed Grb10WT in COS1 cells and were able to precipitate Grb10 with GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 2A). Next, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Grb10 and Myc-tagged 14-3-3 in COS1 cells (Fig. 2B) and 293 cells (Fig. 2C) and performed co-immunoprecipitations in both directions. Western blotting revealed a specific interaction between Grb10 and 14-3-3 in both cell lines. Grb10·14-3-3 Interaction Requires Phosphorylation of Grb10— 14-3-3 proteins specifically recognize phosphorylated serine and threonine residues (29Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) but interact with unphosphorylated proteins as well (21Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, we treated Grb10·14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitates with phosphatase. Transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Grb10 and Myc-tagged 14-3-3 in 293 cells were precipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. The precipitated proteins were treated with and without an unspecific phosphatase or with phosphatase together with a specific phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 3A). The untreated co-immunoprecipitation showed a strong association between Grb10 and 14-3-3 (Fig. 3A, top section, lane labeled Ø). Incubation with the unspecific phosphatase resulted in a greatly diminished interaction between Grb10 and 14-3-3 (Fig. 3A, top section, lanes labeled +/5min and +/10min). The presence of phosphatase inhibitors could partially restore the interaction (Fig. 3A, top section, lane labeled +/5min/+Inhibitor). The second section from the top in Fig. 3A shows equal amounts of precipitated 14-3-3. The center section of Fig. 3A shows the control immunoprecipitation (IP), and the two bottom sections show similar expression levels of Grb10 and 14-3-3 in the cell lysates. These data indicate a requirement of Grb10 phosphorylation for 14-3-3 interaction. To emphasize the necessity of Grb10 phosphorylation for 14-3-3 interaction, we treated cells with OA and performed co-immunoprecipitations. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a greatly enhanced association between 14-3-3 and the hyperphosphorylated form of Grb10 in the presence of OA compared with the interaction between 14-3-3 and Grb10 in untreated cells (Fig. 3B, top section). Next, we were interested as to whether endogenous 14-3-3 associates with Grb10. Therefore, we stably expressed FLAG-tagged Grb10 or empty vector as a control in Ba/F3 cells. We treated the cells with or without OA and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3C). Only the hyperphosphorylated form of Grb10 was able to form a complex with endogenous 14-3-3, whereas we could not detect an interaction between Grb10 and endogenous 14-3-3 in untreated cells. The binding specificity was confirmed by the vector control reaction (Fig. 3C, two lanes labeled PCMVØ). To ascertain the interaction between the endogenous proteins, we stimulated serum starved HeLa cells with serum in the presence of OA and performed co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3D). The experiment showed an interaction between endogenous 14-3-3 and endogenous Grb10 only in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 3D, left sections, two right lanes). Accordingly, 14-3-3 and Grb10 could be coprecipitated from murine lung tissue when a polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate Grb10 from mouse lung (Fig. 3E, top section). Interaction of Grb10 and 14-3-3 Is Wortmannin-sensitive— The phosphorylation of Grb10 is PI-3 kinase-dependent (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the inhibition of Grb10 phosphorylation through the PI-3kinase inhibitor wortmannin is able to abolish the association between Grb10 and 14-3-3. We transiently co-expressed Grb10 and 14-3-3 and treated the cells with wortmannin. The cells were harvested, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Wortmannin treatment reduced the association between Grb10 and 14-3-3 as compared with the Me2SO (DMSO) control (Fig. 4, top section). Identification of Serine 428 in Grb10 as the 14-3-3 Recognition Site—14-3-3 proteins recognize conserved motifs containing phosphoserine such as Arg-X-Arg-X-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro, Arg-Ser-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro, and Arg-X-X-Ser(P). We found two potential 14-3-3 binding sites in Grb10, namely serine 76 within a RXXSXP motif and serine 428 within a RSVSEN motif (Fig. 5A). Both residues were substituted with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the ability of both mutants to bind 14-3-3 was examined. We transfected Grb10 WT, Grb10 S76A, and Grb10 S428A in COS1 cells and performed GST binding studies with GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 5B). Our data indicate that mutation at serine 428 impairs the ability of 14-3-3 to bind Grb10 (Fig. 5B, top section, lane labeled Grb10 S428A). The mutation of serine 76 to alanine did not affect 14-3-3 binding to Grb10 (Fig. 5B, top section, lane labeled Grb10 S76A). As a control, we incubated the Grb10 cell lysates with GST (Fig. 5B, middle section). The cell lysates used in this experiment are shown in Fig. 5B, bottom section. Grb10 Exists in Two Different States of Phosphorylation, i.e. in the Unphosphorylated Form It May Primarily Associate with Akt, and in the Phosphorylated Form It Interacts with 14-3-3— From our data we propose a hypothetical model in which Grb10 exists in two different states of phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). In the unphosphorylated state, Grb10 interacts with Akt. The Grb10·Akt complex translocates to the plasma membrane, where PDK1/2 phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Grb10, the Grb10·Akt complex dissociates, and the interaction with 14-3-3 occurs. The phosphorylation of Grb10 is the requirement for binding to 14-3-3. PP2A dephosphorylates Grb10, mediating dissociation of the Grb10·14-3-3 complex and leading to interaction with Akt. To further elucidate this hypothesis, we transfected COS1 cells with Akt, with or without 14-3-3, and with Grb10 WT and Grb10 S428A, the 14-3-3 binding mutant. Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies revealed that Grb10 WT mediates Akt activation, as we reported previously (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A, top section, second lane from the left). However, co-expression of Grb10 and 14-3-3 resulted in a reduced Akt activation (Fig. 6A, top section, second lane from the right). Interestingly, the expression of the Grb10 S428A mutant, which is unable to interact with 14-3-3, seems to result in an enhanced activation of Akt (Fig. 6A, top section, far right lane). This could be explained by the fact that the Grb10 molecule interacts either with Akt or with 14-3-3 in a competing fashion. By performing a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the ϵ form of 14-3-3 as a new interaction partner of Grb10. We show that Grb10 binds 14-3-3 in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that Grb10 is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and that incubation with the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin abolished Grb10 phosphorylation (4Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. Mandarino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These data suggested that a kinase downstream of the PI 3-kinase pathway is responsible for Grb10 phosphorylation. We observed that the Grb10·14-3-3 interaction was diminished after wortmannin treatment, providing evidence that the interaction between Grb10 and 14-3-3 requires the phosphorylation of Grb10. Treatment with wortmannin inhibits the downstream target of PI 3-kinase Akt. In this study, we were able to show a direct interaction between Grb10 and Akt using purified proteins in an in vitro binding assay. Moreover, we demonstrate that Akt is capable of phosphorylating Grb10 in an in vitro kinase assay. Thus, Akt may be the kinase responsible for Grb10 phosphorylation and regulation of the Grb10·14-3-3 complex. The regulation of 14-3-3 interactions with signaling molecules by phosphorylation has been shown previously by other groups. For example, the interaction of 14-3-3 and PDK1 requires phosphorylation of PDK1 (30Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39360-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Muslin et al. identified a motif for 14-3-3 interactions (Arg-Ser-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro) (19Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Recent studies with phosphopeptide libraries revealed that there exist additional preferred motifs for 14-3-3 binding, Arg-X-Arg-X-X-Ser(P)-X-Pro or Arg-X-X-Ser(P) (18Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Grb10 contains two potential 14-3-3 binding motifs in its amino acid sequence 73RXXSXP78 and 427RSVSEN432. Site-directed mutagenesis of the target serines revealed that serine 428 within the RSVSEN motif is required for the Grb10·14-3-3 binding. Therefore, we propose that serine 428 within the RSVSEN motif of Grb10 may be one of the phosphorylation sites. Treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor OA leads to the accumulation of phosphorylated Grb10. Because this accumulation is observed at a nanomolar concentration at which OA is a specific inhibitor of PP2A, this is a likely phosphatase to dephosphorylate Grb10. Binding of 14-3-3 to Grb10 was enhanced in cells treated with OA. In addition, the complex formation between endogenous 14-3-3 and Grb10 was only detectable after stimulation with serum and OA in various cell lines. There exist two explanations for the absent interaction between endogenous Grb10 and 14-3-3 in unstimulated or serum-starved cells. First, the level of Grb10 phosphorylation is too faint and, therefore, the affinity of 14-3-3 to Grb10 is too low. The second explanation involves the subcellular localization of the target protein. Without stimulation the two proteins may exist in two different cell compartments and, therefore, the two proteins could not associate. The fact that GST·14-3-3 pulls down overexpressed Grb10 WT but not the Grb10 S428A mutant from cell lysates argues for the first explanation. We have previously identified the serine/threonine kinase Akt as a binding partner of the adapter protein Grb10 (7Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This interaction mediates the activation of Akt. These data differ from two recent studies by Wick et al. (12Wick K.R. Werner E.D.

Dong L.Q. Ramos F.J. Hu D. Li Y. Quon M.J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 18: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that human Grb10γ with an intact PH domain has an inhibitory effect on Akt activation (11Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Ramos F.J. Hu D. Li Y. Quon M.J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 18: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Wick K.R. Werner E.D. Langlais P. Ramos F.J. Dong L.Q. Shoelson S.E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8460-8467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both studies observed their findings in CHO and HeLa cells, both stably expressing the insulin receptor. To rule out the possibility that the differences in these studies are due to the cell line or the Grb10 construct used, we transiently transfected Akt together with human Grb10γ or murine Grb10. In our hands overexpression of both forms of Grb10 induces an increase in Akt activation compared with that of the vector control in CHO cells (data not shown), although to a lower extent as compared with COS1 or 293 cells. Therefore, we conclude that Grb10 activates Akt in COS1 cells and to a lesser extent in parental CHO cells without expressing the insulin receptor. Many studies suggest a connection between Akt and 14-3-3. The serine/threonine kinase Akt phosphorylates Bad (13Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) and FKHRL1 (15Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar), which is the requirement for the interaction of Bad and FKHRL1 with 14-3-3. New insights show that 14-3-3 even interacts directly with Akt (31Powell D.W. Rane M.J. Chen Q. Singh S. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21639-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and PDK1 (30Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39360-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The association between 14-3-3 and PDK1 has an inhibitory effect on PDK1 activity, and the authors suggest that 14-3-3 has no effect on the translocation of PDK1. Additionally, the authors propose an inhibitory effect on Akt activity. These data show that 14-3-3 binding can have a direct effect on target protein activity. In addition, previous data characterize 14-3-3 proteins as gatekeepers (32Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and show that 14-3-3 can mediate the relocalization of nuclear ligands (33Brunet A. Kanai F. Stehn J. Xu J. Sarbassova D. Frangioni J.V. Dalal S.N. DeCaprio J.A. Greenberg M.E. Yaffe M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 817-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In this study we discovered a potential connection between the three proteins Akt, 14-3-3, and Grb10. In a hypothetical model we propose that Grb10 exists in two different states of phosphorylation. In the unphosphorylated state Grb10 interacts with Akt and recruits Akt to the membrane. Akt phosphorylates Grb10, mediating the interaction with 14-3-3. The interaction of phosphorylated Grb10 with 14-3-3 may lead to the translocation of Grb10 back to the cytosol. Here, PP2A could dephosphorylate Grb10 to allow a new interaction with Akt. We observed that the Grb10A428S mutant, which failed to interact with 14-3-3, enhances the activation of Akt as compared with Grb10WT. Therefore, it may also be true that Akt and 14-3-3 compete for the interaction with Grb10. In this scenario, 14-3-3 associates with Grb10 to prohibit the association of Grb10 with Akt. In summary, our data show that Grb10 interacts specifically with 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-regulated manner. This interaction may represent an important part of a regulatory circuitry as depicted in Fig. 6B."

Inhibition of polyamine synthesis suppresses carcinogen-induced epithelial cancers in animal models (1Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. Clin.

However, the therapeutic potential of DFMO is hindered by its unaccounted mechanisms of ototoxicity. DFMO decreases the level of polyamines in the cochlea (2Marks S.C. Mattox D.E. Casero R.A. Hear.

Moreover, to overcome the intrinsic membrane noise, the sensitivity of hair cells is dependent on the endocochlear potential (EP >80 mV). Thus, EP is indispensable for normal sound transduction (5Davis H. Physiol. Rev. 1957; 37: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Dallos P. Poppe A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. 8.

EP is generated by the high throughput of outward K+ flux across cells of the stria vascularis (StV) into the scala media by K+ transporters, pumps, and channels together with Cl- channels (7Splawski I.

A congenital deficiency in intermediate cells (IC(s)), melanocytes forming the middle cellular layer of the StV, results in a reduction in EP and an increase in the hearing threshold (13Tasaki I.

For this reason, as well as the fact that ICs express Kir4.1, it has been asserted that the Kir4.1 channel is responsible for the high throughput of outward K+ movement across the IC membrane that leads to generation of EP (15Hibino H. Horio Y. Inanobe A. Doi K. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kawamura M. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ando M. Takeuchi S.

Consistent with this assertion is the evidence that Ba2+, a nonspecific blocker of Kir channels, decreases the magnitude of EP (15Hibino H. Horio Y. Inanobe A. Doi K. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T.

Indeed, null deletion of the channel resulted in marked reduction in EP and a decreased concentration of endolymphatic K+ (17Marcus D.C. Wu T. Wangemann P. Kofuji P. Am. J.

Despite the circumstantial evidence, it is uncertain how an inward rectifier channel can produce a robust outward K+ efflux to generate EP. It is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that the Kir4.1 channels in the StV may be specialized to confer a tissue-specific function. Alternatively, the channel may not be a major player in K+ extrusion from ICs into the interstrial space (IS) but may contribute toward the removal of K+ from the IS.The inward rectification of Kir channels is caused by both blockage of the outward current by cytoplasmic Mg2+ and by intrinsic polyamines (21Ficker E.

We surmised that DFMO-induced ototoxicity is mediated through inhibition of polyamine synthesis, consequently altering inward rectification of inner ear-specific Kir4.1. Thus, we cloned mouse cochlear lateral wall-specific Kir4.1 and analyzed the phenotypic features of the channel both with and without DFMO to determine the effects of the drug on EP. It was reassuring to observe that DFMO reduced the inward rectification of cochlear lateral wall Kir4.1. However, it was startling to determine that the drug produces a marked reduction in EP. These results indicate that although Kir4.1 channels are involved in the generation of EP, the existing model for the generation of EP should be refined. The underlying cellular mechanisms for the contribution of Kir4.1 to EP generation are reevaluated, and the possible mechanism of DFMO-mediated ototoxicity is outlined.MATERIALS AND METHODSPCR and cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was purified from 12-week-old mouse inner ear StV using TRIzol reagent following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA (∼1 μg) was then used as a template to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Aliquots of this cDNA were used as a DNA template for PCR. The sequences of the 5′- and 3′-primers for amplification of the Kir4.1 channel were derived from the mouse brain sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF322631) as follows, 5′-GCCGCCACCATGACGTCGGTCGCTAAG-3′ and 5′-AGGATATCAGACGTTGCTG-3′, respectively. PCR was performed according to the following schedule: predenature at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were recovered after agarose gel separation and subcloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Four clones were selected and checked by the digestion of internal BglII and HindIII sites. The cDNA sequences were determined by the chain termination method. A representative clone, pKJ-E3, was analyzed using the Xenopus oocyte expression system.Expression in Heterologous Systems—For expression in the Xenopus oocyte system, the cDNA fragment containing the complete open reading frame of the Kir4.1 potassium channel was subcloned into the vector, pNLE, which included the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of a Xenopus β-globin gene (27Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). From the resulting expression plasmid, RNAs of Kir4.1 were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and injected into stage V–Vl oocytes as described (28Chiamvimonvat N. Perez-Garcia M.T. Ranjan R. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Electrophysiological Recordings—Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were carried out with a commercially available amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) with microelectrodes, which were filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were bathed in a solution that contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 1 mm niflumic acid to block endogenous chloride currents in oocytes (pH adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH). The current was activated using different voltage-clamped protocols as described under “Results.” Only the oocytes expressing robust Kir4.1 currents were selected for single-channel recordings.Single-channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached and excised patch configurations using a patch clamp amplifier, Axoptach 200B (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA), which was interfaced with a personal computer by way of an analog-to-digital converter. Whereas the whole-cell recordings were acquired using Pclamp software (Axon Instrument), the single-channel data were collected with custom-written software (Q program). Single-channel recordings of membrane patches were held at -40 mV and stepped to different depolarizing test pulses at frequencies from 0.2 to 0.5 Hz. Current traces were amplified and filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) on a four-step horizontal Flaming-Brown microelectrode puller (Sutter Instrument) and coated with Sylgard 184™ (Dow-Corning Corp., Midland, MI) to within 100 μm of the tip and fire-polished before use. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Endogenous Cl- currents were blocked with 1 mm niflumic acid in the recording pipette and in the bath solution. The bath solution contained 90 mm NaCl, 25 mm triethanolamine chloride, 5 mm 4-ammonium persulfate, 5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature (∼21 °C).Data Analysis—For single-channel recordings, leakage and capacitative transient currents were subtracted by fitting a smooth template to null traces. Leak-subtracted current recordings were idealized using a half-height criterion (29Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Single Channel Recording, 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 191-263Google Scholar). Transitions between closed and open levels were determined by using a threshold-detection algorithm, which required that two data points exist above the half-mean amplitude of the single unit opening. The computer-detected openings were confirmed by visual inspection, and sweeps with excessive noise were discarded. Amplitude histograms at a given test potential were generated and then fitted to a single Gaussian distribution using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to obtain the mean and S.D. At least five voltage steps and their corresponding single-channel currents were used to determine the unitary conductance. Single-channel current-voltage relations were fitted by linear least-square regression lines, and single-channel conductances were obtained from the slope of the regression lines. Idealized records were used to construct ensemble-averaged currents, open probability, and histograms for the distributions of open and closed intervals. Curve fits and data analyses were performed using Origin software (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Where appropriate, pooled data are presented as means ± S.D.Endocochlear Potential Measurement—Mice were anesthetized with 20% urethane (0.01 ml/g). A tracheal cannula was inserted, and the bulla was opened using a retroauricular approach. A small hole was made in the bony wall of the cochlea over the basal turn. A glass micropipette electrode filled with 150 mm KCl was advanced through the hole while secured to a hand-controlled micromanipulator. The electrode was connected to a high impedance DC amplifier. The reference electrode (silver/silver chloride pellet) was placed under the dorsal skin. The recording electrode passed through the spiral ligament of the lateral wall into the scala media. The potential difference (mV) between the scala media and the reference electrode was recorded.Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) Measurement—Mice were anesthetized with avertin, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveforms were recorded as previously described (30Dou H. Vazquez A.E. Namkung Y. Chu H. Cardell E.L. Nie L. Parson S. Shin H.S. Yamoah E.N. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2004; 5: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kozel P.J. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C.

Briefly, a ground needle electrode and recording needle were placed subcutaneously in the scalp, and a calibrated electrostatic speaker coupled to a hollow ear bar was placed inside the pinna. Broadband clicks and pure tones (8, 16, and 32 kHz) were presented to the ear of the animal in 10-dB increments, starting from 0 dB to 100 dB sound pressure level. The ABR sweeps were computer-averaged (time-locked with onset of 128–1024 stimuli, at 20/s) from the continuous electroencephalographic activity. The threshold of hearing was determined as the lowest intensity of sound required to elicit a characteristic waveform.RESULTSThe Kir4.1 channel has been cloned from the brain (32Li L. Head V. Timpe L.C. Glia. 2001; 33: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, given the presumed specific role of the channel in the inner ear, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using the primers related to mouse brain Kir4.1 and cDNA from mouse inner ear lateral wall to amplify StV-specific Kir4.1. A single band with the expected size of 1155 bp was obtained. The PCR product was cloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced. We identified the Kir4.1 channel cDNA from the StV that contained a complete open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number AY374423) encoding a putative protein with 379 amino acids. The analysis of the amino acid sequences of putative proteins from Kir4.1 cDNAs revealed high similarities between StV-specific and other cloned Kir4.1 channels (15Hibino H. Horio Y. Inanobe A.

The current rectifies inwardly, showing stunted growth at depolarized step potentials. By contrast, the current magnitude was robust in response to hyperpolarized step potentials from a holding potential of -40 mV (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a K+-selective channel, the whole-cell current-voltage relations shifted to depolarized potentials (Fig. 2B), and the estimated reversal potentials (Erev) were close to the calculated Nernst potential as the bath K+ was elevated systematically (Fig. 2C). The current was blocked by Ba2+ with a half-blocking concentration at ∼30 ± 10 μm, binding to ∼20% of the functional electrical field of the channel (Fig. 2, E and F). These results were in accord with previous reports (32Li L. Head V. Timpe L.C. Glia. 2001; 33: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N.

Moreover, the resting potential of oocytes expressing Kir4.1 was controlled exclusively by the Ba2+-sensitive current, indicating that the channel serves as a background current that clamps the membrane potential close to the net resting potential of the oocytes (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Inner ear-specific inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir4.1) currents.A, examples of inner ear-specific inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir4.1) currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

D, changes in the resting membrane potential of Xenopus oocytes upon application of increasing concentrations of Ba2+. The resting potential changed to more depolarized potentials with increasing concentrations of Ba2+. E, the effect of Ba2+ on the inward rectifier current was reversible. The dose-response relation of the effect of Ba2+ indicated that the half-blocking concentration was ∼30 ± 10 μm Ba2+. F, a plot of the natural logarithm of the function, Ic/Ib - 1, versus voltage gives a slope that indicates that Ba2+ binds to ∼20% of the functional electrical field of the channel. Ic represents the control current, and Ib is the current after Ba2+ block.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the effects of DFMO on the cloned Kir4.1 channels, Xenopus oocytes were injected with RNA and incubated in ND-96 solution containing 500 μm DFMO for 24 h. Experiments were also performed by injecting DFMO directly into oocytes. The ensuing whole-cell currents were compared with currents from control oocytes (Fig. 3, B and C). In accord with previous findings from Kir2.3 and other Kir channels, DFMO and other inhibitors of ODC produced a marked increase in the outward component of the current (37Shyng S.L. Sha Q.

Moreover, modification of Kir4.1 channel currents by DFMO did not alter the amplitude of the inward component of the current nor was there a rightward shift in the apparent Erev. As expected, oocytes treated with DFMO were more efficient in restoring the resting membrane potential than untreated cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when DFMO was injected directly into oocytes expressing the Kir4.1 channels.Fig. 3Effects of DFMO on inward rectification of Kir4.1 channel currents.A, continuous perfusion of a bath solution containing 20 mm K+ produced an expected membrane depolarization. The time course of recovery after washout (arrow) with control saline (ND 96) was faster (τ = 2.3 ± 1.8 min, n = 6) in DFMO-treated than in control (τ = 12 ± 4.7 min, n = 6) oocytes.

E, the single-channel conductances of control and DFMO-treated oocytes were 29.1 ± 5.3 pS and 31.2 ± 3.6 (n = 7), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to evaluate the effects of DFMO on the Kir4.1 channels by recording single-channel fluctuations. Under the cell-attached configuration and at a holding potential of -40 mV, single-channel events were observed at negative voltage steps. However, at positive step voltages, the openings were minute and remained unresolved (Fig. 3, D and E). By contrast, in excised patches, depolarized voltage steps elicited robust single-channel openings. Consistent with the whole-cell current records, cell-attached patches from DFMO-treated oocytes had single-channel openings at depolarized potentials, and the probability of channel openings increased substantially in the excised patch mode (data not shown). The single channel conductance obtained for the Kir4.1 channels (29.1 ± 5.3 pS, n = 7) was in accord with reports from the channel cloned from other systems (39Hayashi M. Komazaki S. Ishikawa T. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), giving further assurance that the identified Kir4.1 in the StV is not a unique channel.To ensure the high throughput of K+ across the ICs of the StV, the K+ concentration in the IS should be kept at relatively low levels. Inward rectification of Kir4.1 in the ICs may promote removal of K+ from the IS. Alternatively, like many other inward rectifier currents, the role of Kir channels in ICs may optimize the activity of an unidentified outward current by setting the membrane potential to a level that generates EP. Thus, we surmised that the modification of the inward rectification of Kir4.1 in vivo should alter EP and hearing threshold. ABRs were analyzed in DFMO-treated (1 mg/g of body weight/day for 4 weeks, Ref. 4Doyle K.J. Laryngoscope. 2001; 111: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) CBA-mice and compared with their age-matched sham controls to determine the sound pressure levels at which typical ABR waveforms are seen. The control mice exhibited the characteristic ABR waveform beginning at sound pressure levels of ∼40, 30, 15, and 30 dB using broadband clicks and pure tones of 8-, 16-, and 32-kHz stimuli (Fig. 4). The DFMO-treated mice yielded elevated thresholds for broadband clicks and the three pure pips tested. The generation of across-frequency elevation of hearing threshold by DFMO raised the possibility that the drug may affect a common trait along the cochlear spiral. The measurement of EP in DFMO-treated and sham-control mice suggested that the ototoxic effects of the drug are mediated at least partly through reduction of EP (Fig. 4B). The relation between increased hearing threshold and a decline in EP (0.8 dB/1 mV) was consistent with previous reports on several animal models, which demonstrated a correlation between hearing loss and EP (40Gratton M.A. Schmiedt R.A.

There were significant increases (p < 0.05) in the hearing thresholds of the DFMO-treated mice as compared with age-matched saline-injected controls. B, in addition, DFMO-treated mice had a significant reduction in endocochlear potential (EP at the basal turn of the cochlea, control = 87 ± 9 mV and DFMO-treated = 49 + 14 mV; apical turn, control = 83 ± 5 mV and DFMO-treated = 45 ± 8 mV; p < 0.05). The correlation between the reduction in EP and increased hearing threshold is striking.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONDFMO is potentially an efficient cancer-preventive drug. Yet, its insidious ototoxic side effect hinders its use as a mainstream cancer remedy. We have identified, cloned (GenBank™ accession number AY374423), and functionally expressed an inner ear lateral wall Kir4.1 channel that may serve as a target for the underlying mechanism for DFMO-induced ototoxicity. We report that the Kir4.1 channel in the lateral wall resembles and has properties that are consistent with an intermediate inward rectifier channel. Furthermore, in contrast to the suggestion that the channel may confer high outward throughput of K+ across ICs into the IS in the StV (17Marcus D.C. Wu T. Wangemann P. Kofuji P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C403-C407Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 44Takeuchi S. Ando M. Neurosci.

The first group consists of non-conserved residues, which form intermolecular hydrogen bonds accessible to solvent. The second group, comprised of strongly conserved residues, form intermolecular hydrogen bonds that are shielded from solvent. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the RNA-binding site of protein TL5. We found that replacement of residues of the first group does not influence the stability of the TL5·5 S rRNA complex, whereas replacement of residues of the second group leads to destabilization or disruption of the complex. Stereochemical analysis shows that the replacements of residues of the second group always create complexes with uncompensated losses of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

Thorough analysis of this information should contribute fundamentally toward understanding the principles of RNA· protein recognition. In the present work the structures of two complexes of 5 S rRNA with homologous ribosomal proteins, Escherichia coli L25 (5Lu M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1DFU) and Thermus thermophilus TL5 (6Fedorov R. Meshcheryakov V. Gongadze G. Fomenkova N. Nevskaya N. Selmer M. Laurberg M.

L25 and TL5 belong to the so-called CTC family of bacterial proteins. The first protein described under the CTC abbreviation was a general stress protein of Bacillus subtilis (7Völker U. Engelmann E. Maul B. Riethdorf S. Völker A. Schmid R. Mach H. Hecker M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Later the genes for homologous proteins were found in most of the sequenced bacterial genomes (8Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L.

Among these proteins there are one-domain, two-domain, and even three-domain representatives (5Lu M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wohnert J. Gorlach M. Brown L.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6377-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Beside L25, two other proteins of the CTC family were found in bacterial ribosomes, TL5 of T. thermophilus (12Gongadze G.M. Tishchenko S.V. Sedelnikova S.E. Garber M.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and CTC of Deinococcus radiodurans (10Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F.

E. coli L25, T. thermophilus TL5, and D. radiodurans CTC specifically bind 5 S rRNA at the same site, the so-called loop E region (10Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I.

Gongadze G.M. Garber M.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2004; 69: 749-754Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It was suggested that all CTC proteins could bind 5 S rRNA through a domain homologous to E. coli L25 (6Fedorov R. Meshcheryakov V. Gongadze G. Fomenkova N. Nevskaya N. Selmer M. Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Al-Karadaghi S. Liljas A. Garber M. Nikonov S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). T. thermophilus ribosomal protein TL5 was discovered and investigated thoroughly by our group (12Gongadze G.M. Tishchenko S.V. Sedelnikova S.E. Garber M.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Gongadze G.M. Meshcheryakov V.A. Serganov A.A. Fomenkova N.P. Mudrik E.S. Jonsson B.H. Liljas A. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B.

The isolated N-terminal fragment of TL5 (NfrTL5) 1The abbreviations used are: NfrTL5, N-terminal fragment of TL5; WT, wild type. possesses the same 5 S rRNA binding ability as the full-size protein (14Gongadze G.M. Meshcheryakov V.A. Serganov A.A. Fomenkova N.P. Mudrik E.S. Jonsson B.H. Liljas A. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of E. coli L25 and T. thermophilus TL5 complexed with virtually the same fragment of E. coli 5 S rRNA (Fig. 1) have been determined at a high resolution (5Lu M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Fedorov R. Meshcheryakov V. Gongadze G. Fomenkova N. Nevskaya N. Selmer M. Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Al-Karadaghi S. Liljas A. Garber M. Nikonov S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite rather low sequence identity between E. coli L25 and the N-terminal domain of T. thermophilus TL5 (18%), their three-dimensional structures and their modes of interaction with 5 S rRNA are very similar. Among the amino acid residues that form hydrogen bonds with RNA in the L25·5 S rRNA and TL5·5 S rRNA complexes, only five are strongly conserved in CTC family proteins (Arg-10, Arg-19, Tyr-29, His-85 and Asp-87, TL5 nomenclature). Superposition of the structures of the L25·5 S rRNA and TL5·5 S rRNA complexes reveals that the conformations of the side chains of the conserved residues are practically the same in the two complexes (6Fedorov R. Meshcheryakov V. Gongadze G. Fomenkova N. Nevskaya N. Selmer M. Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Al-Karadaghi S. Liljas A. Garber M. Nikonov S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, their contacts with RNA also coincide. These observations allow us to suggest that the conserved residues form an RNA recognition module on the protein surface (Fig. 1). This hypothesis stimulated us to use site-directed mutagenesis to change the residues involved in RNA binding in the TL5·5 S rRNA complex. We have found that replacement of the strongly conserved residues leads to destabilization or disruption of the complex. Analysis shows that intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by these residues are inaccessible to the solvent and that substitutions of these residues cause the uncompensated loss of one or more intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We suggest that these shielded intermolecular hydrogen bonds are responsible for the recognition between the protein and RNA. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To prepare wild type and mutant forms of the NfrTL5 polypeptide, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using oligonucleotides that contained the desired mutations. The ntl5WT and mutant fragments of the gene (ntl5H85A, ntl5H85N, ntl5H85T, ntl5H85F, ntl5D87N, ntl5D87E, and ntl5D87S) were amplified from pET11c/TL5 DNA by PCR. We used forward primer WT, 5′-AAATTGAAGGAGATATACATATGGAGTAC-3′ and reverse primers, WT, 5′-GGGCGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGTCC-3′; H85A, 5′-GGGCGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGTCCACCGCCTCGGGGC-3′; H85N, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGTCCACGTTCTCGGGGC-3′; H85T, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACAAAAAAGTCCACGGTCTCGGGGC-3′; H85F, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGTCCACGAACTCGGGGC-3′; D87N, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGTTAACGTGCTC-3′; D87E, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAATTCCACGTGC-3′; and D87S, 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGAGGACGAAGAAGGACACGTGCTC-3′. The ntl5R10A, ntl5R19A, ntl5Y29F, ntl5Y29S, and ntl5Y29R mutant fragments were constructed in two steps. In step 1, fragments carrying a mutation were amplified from pET11c/TL5 DNA by PCR with a T7 forward primer and corresponding oligonucleotides for each fragment, R10A, 5′-CTCCCTCCGCGTAGTAC-3′; R19A, 5′-GCCCGCCCGCGCGAGGGCC-3′; Y29F, 5′-GGTTGAACATGAGCCCGGGGAGC-3′; Y29S, 5′-GGTTGGACATGAGCCCCGGGAGC-3′; and Y29R, 5′-GCCGGTTGCGCATGAGCCC-3′. In step 2, the entire ntl5 fragments were then amplified from pET11c/TL5 DNA using the PCR products obtained in step 1 and the reverse primer WT. To construct the ntl5H85A mutant, the gene fragment was amplified in step 1 using 5′-GCGCCCCGAGGCGGTGGAC and the T7 reverse primer. The entire ntl5 fragment was then completed by PCR using the forward primer WT. The final PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET11c (17Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Gene Expression and Recombinant Protein Purification—All the mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Stratagene) using the Studier expression system (18Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). Two liters of 1% LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until the A590 nm reached ∼0.7. Expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g for 15 min) and kept frozen at –20 °C. Three grams of cells were suspended in 20 ml of HS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2 m NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 30 min followed by 400,000 × g for 1 h), the cleared cell extract was diluted 10-fold with HS buffer containing no NaCl or MgCl2 and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column. The protein was eluted using a linear NaCl concentration gradient (200–800 mm). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Obtaining and Radioactive Labeling of E. coli 5 S rRNA—Ribosomal RNA was isolated from E. coli ribosomes as described previously (20Nierhaus K.H. Dohme F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 (Amersham Biosciences). 5′-end labeling using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase was carried out as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeled RNA was purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide 19:1, w/w) containing 8 m urea. Gel-shift Analysis—Gel-shift analysis was carried out as described earlier (22Meshcheryakov V.A. Gryaznova O.I. Davydova N.L. Mudrik E.S. Perederina A.A. Vasilenko N.L. Gongadze G.M. Garber M.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1997; 62: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of E. coli 5 S rRNA was incubated in TKM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 2 min at 60 °C and chilled to room temperature. Then, an aliquot of the RNA (3–4 μg) was incubated in TKM buffer with the indicated amount of NfrTL5 for 10 min at 37 °C. Concentrations of 5 S rRNA and NfrTL5 proteins in the incubation mixture were 1 × 10–6–1 × 10–5m and 1 × 10–6–1 × 10–4m, respectively. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (70 × 80 × 0.75 mm, acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide 19:1, w/w) containing TAM buffer (90 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2) and run at 90 V at room temperature until xylene cyanol started to leave the gel. After the procedure the gels were stained with 0.25% (w/v) toluidine blue in 5% acetic acid, 20% ethanol and washed with water until the background stain disappeared. Formation of RNA·Protein Complexes and Filter Binding Assay—The procedures were carried out as described previously (23Serganov A.A. Masquida B. Westhof E. Cachia C. Portier C. Garber M. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1124-1138PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli 5′-32P-5 S rRNA was heated at 60 °C for 2 min in the buffer for complex formation (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 170 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and cooled to room temperature. Then, aliquots (3000–5000 cpm, quantified by scintillation counting) of the RNA and NfrTL5 were mixed in the same buffer containing 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min on ice. The incubation volume was 50 μl, and the concentration of the protein varied from 1 × 10–10m to 3 × 10–5m. Each assay was done in duplicate. The concentration of the labeled RNA in the assay was negligible (<1 × 10–9). Protein·RNA complexes were retained by filtration at 4 °C on nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore GS, 0.22μ m). The filters were washed once with 350 μl of the ice-cold buffer containing 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, dried, and analyzed for radioactivity. Nonspecific retention of RNA (4–6%) was measured by filtering the complete reaction mixture in the absence of NfrTL5. Specific retention (total retention minus nonspecific retention) was generally 30–60%. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) correspond to the concentration of NfrTL5 required to obtain half-saturation (assuming that complex formation obeys a simple bimolecular equilibrium) and were calculated according to the equation, Θ = [NfrTL5]/(Kd + [NfrTL5]), where Θ represents the fraction of radiolabeled RNA bound to the filter.

Effect of Mutations on TL5·5 S rRNA Interactions—In all experiments we used the NfrTL5 (residues 1–91), because in the isolated state this fragment possesses the same 5 S rRNA binding ability as the full-size TL5 (14Gongadze G.M. Meshcheryakov V.A. Serganov A.A. Fomenkova N.P. Mudrik E.S. Jonsson B.H. Liljas A. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The five strongly conserved amino acid residues, as well as some non-conserved residues that bind RNA, were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. Non-conserved residues were replaced only by alanine to eliminate hydrogen bonding with RNA. In the case of the conserved residues, a variety of different mutations were introduced. The mutant NfrTL5 polypeptides were isolated from overproducing strains and purified by the procedure described earlier (14Gongadze G.M. Meshcheryakov V.A. Serganov A.A. Fomenkova N.P. Mudrik E.S.

There is a good agreement between results obtained by these two techniques.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2A shows a selection of NfrTL5·5 S rRNA-binding curves. It can be seen that a plateau (saturation area) in binding curves is reached at 1–10 mm protein concentration region. To test the stability of 5 S rRNA·NfrTL5 complexes in this protein concentration region, we used the gel-shift method (a typical gel-shift pattern is shown in Fig. 2B). Stable complex of wild type NfrTL5·5 S rRNA was observed at 1–2 mm protein concentration (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In case of mutations of nonconserved residues involved in 5 S rRNA binding (Lys-14, Ser-16, and Arg-20), the same protein concentration was enough to form stable complexes between 5 S rRNA and the mutant NfrTL5 polypeptides (Table I). Even NfrTL5, which bears the double mutation S16A/R20A, has an RNA-binding curve virtually identical to that for wild type NfrTL5 (Fig. 2A). Thus, mutations of the non-conserved residues do not influence the RNA binding ability of the protein. In contrast, mutations of the five strongly conserved residues (Arg-10, Arg-19, Tyr-29, His-85, and Asp-87) lead to destabilization or disruption of the NfrTL5·5 S rRNA complex in all cases. Replacement of one of the three strongly conserved residues (Arg-10, Arg-19, or His-85) leads to 10-fold Kd increase (Table I and Fig. 2A). Complexes of these mutants with the RNA could not be formed at protein concentrations lower than 20–30 mm (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, the bands of these complexes have tails of free RNA. We suggest that this tailing is a consequence of the lower stability of the complexes between the mutant proteins and 5 S rRNA. Thus, mutations of these three strongly conserved residues markedly destabilize the complex. The most dramatic effect was observed for mutations of Tyr-29 or Asp-87 (Table I). Excluding D87E, all mutations of these two residues lead to disruption of the complex (no visible retention of labeled RNA at nitrocellulose membrane at protein concentration 5 mm). NfrTL5 bearing the Y29F mutation could not form a complex with 5 S rRNA even at 50 mm protein concentration (Fig. 2B, lane 7). The D87E mutation does not disrupt the complex but destabilizes it very strongly (Table I; Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). Besides making buried intermolecular H-bonds with RNA, the side chains of Tyr-29 and Asp-87 form an H-bond with one another. This H-bond stabilizes the conformations of the side chains of these two residues at the protein surface. All replacements of Tyr-29 and Asp-87 that we tested, excluding D87E, not only eliminate the intermolecular H-bonds between these residues and RNA but also disrupt the H-bond between these two residues. As for D87E, modeling shows that glutamic acid could make H-bonds with Tyr-29 and the RNA molecule, but the significantly larger size of the glutamic acid side chain creates some steric hindrance to tight protein-RNA contact. Thus, our data show that any change of side chains of residues located at positions 29 and 87 (specifically, the displacement of the atoms that make H-bonds with the rRNA) is critical for the specific recognition of 5 S rRNA by protein TL5. Naturally Occurring Changes in CTC Proteins—Naturally occurring changes of the five strongly conserved amino acid residues in CTC proteins shed further light on their role in RNA binding. Analysis of 150 homologous proteins of CTC family (8Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 23-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Frishman D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reveals only 1 replacement for Tyr-29 and <10 replacements for Asp-87 (Table II). One of the natural changes is the substitution of aspartic acid by glutamic acid at the position corresponding to Asp-87 in protein TL5. This substitution was found in the members of Enterococcus genus. According to our results, such a substitution strongly decreases the 5 S rRNA binding ability of protein TL5 (Table I). However, in bacterial species where the Asp/Glu exchange is observed at the corresponding positions of other CTC sequences, there is an interesting change in the sequence of the 5 S rRNA (25Szymanski M. Barciszewska M. Erdmann V. Barciszewski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the sequence of the loop E region of 5 S rRNA from Enterococcus faecalis. In comparison with E. coli 5 S rRNA, there is the only change, in E. faecalis 5 S rRNA G75 is replaced by U. In the TL5·5 S rRNA complex, G75 forms an H-bond with Asp-87. This appears to be an example of co-evolution of the structures of two interacting macromolecules. This assumption can be tested experimentally; the D87E mutant should form a stable complex with E. coli 5 S rRNA if G75 is replaced by U.Table IIChanges of the strongly conserved amino acid residues in proteins of the CTC familyResidue in TL5Total No. of identical residues in the analyzed 150 sequencesNo. of other residues at the same positionsArg-10143Gln, 3; Glu,3; Met, 1Arg-19145Lys, 5Tyr-29149Ile, 1His-85148Asn, 1; Ser, 1Asp-87138Glu, 3; Ser, 5; Ala, 1 Open table in a new tab Another interesting case is the naturally occurring replacement of Asp-87 by Ser or Ala found in CTC protein sequences of Cyanobacteria. Such mutations lead to disruption of the TL5·5 S rRNA complex (Table I). However, there are many changes in the 5 S rRNA of Cyanobacteria (14Gongadze G.M. Meshcheryakov V.A. Serganov A.A. Fomenkova N.P. Mudrik E.S. Jonsson B.H. Liljas A. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the loop E region of cyanobacterial 5 S rRNA is most likely different from that in the majority of the known bacterial 5 S rRNA structures (Fig. 3). This may also represent an example of co-evolution. A structural analysis of the TL5·5 S rRNA complex shows that the contacting sites of TL5 and 5 S rRNA are remarkably complementary (6Fedorov R. Meshcheryakov V. Gongadze G. Fomenkova N. Nevskaya N. Selmer M. Laurberg M. Kristensen O. Al-Karadaghi S. Liljas A. Garber M. Nikonov S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They are rather flat regions, a four-stranded β-sheet with adjacent parts of the N-terminal β-strand and α-helix in the protein and an irregular shallow groove in the RNA helix. The strongly conserved residues, Arg-10, Arg-19, and His-85, and the non-conserved residues, Lys-14, Arg-20, Arg-31, Lys-36, Arg-72, and Lys-78, provide a positively charged protein surface. The negative charge in the RNA-contacting region results from a specific disposition of phosphate groups. Amino acid residues involved in RNA binding in the TL5·5 S rRNA complex can be subdivided into two groups, the first group is non-conserved residues, and the second group is strongly conserved residues. The strongly conserved residues (Arg-10, Arg-19, Tyr-29, His-85, and Asp-87) are situated in the central part of the RNA-contacting surface of TL5, and the non-conserved residues are located at the periphery of this surface (Fig. 4). In the present work, a comparative structural analysis of two homologous complexes, TL5·5 S rRNA and L25·5 S rRNA, revealed that in both complexes the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of the non-conserved residues are accessible to the solvent, whereas the five strongly conserved residues and their intermolecular hydrogen bonds are shielded from the solvent (Table III). The site-directed mutagenesis of TL5 shows that replacement of residues of the first group does not influence the stability of the TL5·5 S rRNA complex, whereas a replacement of residues of the second group leads to destabilization or disruption of the complex.Table IIIProtein-RNA hydrogen bonds in the TL5·5 S rRNA complexLengthsAccessibilityHydrogen bondsProteinRNAÅÅ2Å2Non-conserved hydrogen bondsSer-16OG-O2PC933.2510.025.0Lys-14NZ-O2PA942.9916.012.0NZ-O1PU952.6916.039.0Arg-20NH1-O2PC932.805.024.5NH1-O2PA943.125.012.0Arg-31NH2-O2PG1062.6522.025.0Asn-34OD1-O-2′U742.924.012.0ND2-O-2U742.863.00.0Arg-72NE-O2PA1042.903.024.0NH2-O2PA1042.874.024.0Gln-73OE1-N2G753.012.00.0OE1-N2G1023.112.00.0NE2-N3G1023.103.00.0NE2-O2′G1022.883.018.5Conserved hydrogen bondsArg-10NH1-O2PG763.070.022.5NH2-O2′G752.790.00.0NH2-O3′G753.260.00.0Arg-19NH1-O2PU773.085.019.0NH2-O2′G763.170.00.0NH2-O3′G763.040.00.0Tyr-29OH-O2′U1032.660.00.0His-85NE2-O2′G752.850.00.0Asp-87OD1-N2G752.920.00.0 Open table in a new tab Thanks to the accessibility of the non-conserved residues and their RNA partners to solvent, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of these residues can be disrupted and replaced by new hydrogen bonds formed with solvent molecules. This means that the RNA·protein complex cannot be strongly destabilized by disruption of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by the non-conserved amino acid residues. Such substitutions may not be completely neutral, because they may cause entropic changes, but such differences among residue side chains are very small and do not greatly affect complex stability. Substitutions could also affect other non-covalent interactions such as van der Waals interactions, but, again, changes caused by such other non-covalent interactions (28Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are on the order of the thermal energy kT (∼2.5 kJ/mol). Therefore, the mutations of the solvent-exposed non-conserved amino acid residues do not cause the dissociation of the RNA·protein complex (Table I). A different situation arises with intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by conserved amino acid residues. These residues and their intermolecular hydrogen bonds are completely or partially inaccessible to the solvent. For this reason, the disruption of an intermolecular hydrogen bond of a conserved residue cannot be compensated by the formation of new hydrogen bonds. The uncompensated loss of a single intermolecular hydrogen bond should destabilize the RNA·protein complex by 20 ± 5 kJ/mol. Moreover, because displacements of the bonding groups by just an angstrom or so would compromise them, these intermolecular hydrogen bonds anchor the complex. All of this explains why the mutations in conserved residues that disrupt intermolecular hydrogen bonds cause significant destabilization or full disruption of the complex. It is typical that conserved intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the complexes of ribosomal proteins with their specific targets on rRNAs are not accessible to the solvent. This observation led us to the conclusion that the shielded intermolecular hydrogen bonds are a major factor in recognition. The results obtained in this work are in good agreement with our previous findings on the organization of RNA-recognition modules on the surface of ribosomal proteins (29Nevskaya N.A. Nikonov O.S. Revtovich S.V. Garber M.B. Nikonov S.V. Molecular Biology (Mosc.). 2004; 38: 926-936PubMed Google Scholar). We thank N. A. Matveeva for technical assistance, R. A.
