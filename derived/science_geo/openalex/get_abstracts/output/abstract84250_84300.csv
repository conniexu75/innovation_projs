https://openalex.org/W1975962007,X-ray diffraction data from polyoma capsid crystals were phased by refinement of low-resolution starting models to obtain a self-consistent structural solution. The unexpected result that the hexavalent morphological unit is a pentamer shows that specificity of bonding is not conserved among the protein subunits in the icosahedrally symmetric capsid.
https://openalex.org/W2097563956,"Molecular chimeras with the p21 transforming gene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus linked to DNA containing the long terminal repeat (LTR) of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) have been constructed. Transformants of NIH 3T3 cells induced by transfection with MMTV LTR-p21 hybrid DNA have been identified that express the normal p21 gene product. The levels of p21 RNA and protein in these transformants are regulated by physiological concentrations of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone. Hybrid transcripts containing p21 gene sequences originate at the normal MMTV viral initiation site. It is concluded that sequences necessary for hormonal control of transcription are completely specified by the viral genome and probably map within the viral LTR."

https://openalex.org/W1559386011,"A cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase has been purified to near homogeneity from bovine adrenal and heart tissues. The purification procedure utilizes chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and cGMP affinity resin. The procedure can be completed within 2 days and is easily adapted to large scale. To obtain pure enzyme, an 8,000-9,000-fold increase in specific activity was required in adrenal tissues and 15,000-30,000-fold in cardiac muscle. A single band of protein having an apparent Mr = 105,000-107,000 was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. At equilibrium, native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis revealed a single major band having an apparent Mr = 240,000. Cyclic GMP binding and phosphodiesterase activity co-migrated with the protein band on native polyacrylamide gradient gels. The enzyme bound cGMP with high affinity reaching a maximum binding of 1.02 mol of cGMP bound/mol of enzyme dimer. Titration curves of the binding data indicated at least two classes of binding sites with 10% maximal binding occurring at 7 nM and 90% maximal binding at 4 microM cGMP. Kinetic analysis indicated the enzyme can hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP with similar maximal rates. The nucleotide concentration at half-maximal velocity were 30 and 10 microM for cAMP and cGMP, respectively. The hydrolyses of both nucleotides exhibit positive homotropic cooperativity with Hill coefficients of 1.9 for cAMP and 1.3 for cGMP. The rate of cAMP hydrolysis by the purified enzyme when measured at 10 microM cAMP was enhanced 5- to 6-fold by low levels of cGMP."

https://openalex.org/W2054217735,"We studied mechanisms controlling gene expression during animal development using retroviruses as model genes. For this, substrains of mice have been previously derived carrying the Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) in their germ line. Virus activation occurs in some of these substrains at different stages of development, resulting in two classes of viral genomes. The genetically transmitted (endogenous) copy is present in every cell, whereas somatically acquired (""exogenous"") copies are carried only in cells that were superinfected. We compared these two classes of M-MuLV genomes using two parameters. DNA sequences of the endogenous M-MuLV genome in all mouse substrains were highly methylated in GCGC, the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme Hha I, and were not infectious (specific infectivity less than 10(-7) pfu per proviral genome) in a DNA transfection assay. In contrast, the ""exogenous"" copies were hypomethylated and infectious. These parameters are strongly correlated to genome activity in the animal: only tissues carrying exogenous copies express virus-specific RNA. With the assumption that gene expression of transfected DNA is controlled by mechanisms that are relevant for gene expression in the animal, our results suggest that DNA methylation plays a causative role in gene regulation during development and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1593554557,"We report the nucleotide sequence of 3.2 kilobase pair region of the Escherichia coli polA gene, comprising the coding region for DNA polymerase I with about 400 base pairs of flanking sequence. The amino acid sequence for DNA polymerase I derived from our DNA sequence is largely consistent with previous protein chemical data. In the following paper, Brown et al. (Brown, W. E., Stump, K. H., and Kelley, W. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1965-1972) present additional protein chemistry experiments that further confirm our sequence. Mild proteolysis of DNA polymerase I is known to produce two enzymatically active fragments (Brutlag, D., Atkinson, M. R., Setlow, P., and Kornberg, A. (1969) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 37, 982-989; Klenow, H., and Henningsen, I. (1970) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5632-5636). We have located the site of this cleavage between residues 323 and 324 of the 928 amino acid polymerase molecule. By sequence comparison of the polA1 and wild type alleles, we have identified the polA1 mutation as a change from Trp (TGG) to amber (TAG) at residue 342."

https://openalex.org/W1565354947,"Terbium, a trivalent lanthanide, effectively substituted for Ca2+ in calmodulin as judged by several criteria: intrinsic fluorescence spectra, altered mobilities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, formation of a stable complex with troponin I or calcineurin, and stimulation of phosphodiesterase. Calmodulin harbors four Ca2+ binding domains; domains I and II contain no tyrosine, whereas domains III and IV each have one tyrosine. The binding of Tb3+ to calmodulin was followed by the increase of Tb3+ fluorescence at 545 nm upon binding to calmodulin. This fluorescence was elicited either by exciting Tb3+ directly at 222 nm or by exciting the calmodulin tyrosine at 280 nm with resulting energy transfer from tyrosine to Tb3+. Fluorescence generated by direct excitation measures binding of Tb3+ to any of the Ca2+ binding domains, whereas energy transfer through indirect excitation is effective only when Tb3+ is within 5 A of tyrosine, indicating that Tb3+ necessarily occupies a Ca2+ binding domain that contains tyrosine. A judicious use of the direct and indirect excitation could reveal the sequence of fill of the binding domains. Our results suggest these domains are filled in the following sequence: 1) domain I or II; 2) domains III and IV; and 3) domain II or I that has not been filled initially."
https://openalex.org/W1575614265,"Carbon monoxide bound to cytochrome c oxidase has been observed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy between 10 K and 280 K in the dark and during and after continuous photolysis. CO bound to a3Fe absorbs near 1963 cm-1, with minor bands at lower frequencies. Photolysis at low temperatures transfers CO to CuB, with the major component near 2062 cm-1 and a minor one near 2043 cm-1. Vibrational absorptions are assigned by comparison with heme and copper carbonyls, by frequency dependence of all bands on the isotopic mass of CO, and by similar behavior of major and minor components with photolysis and relaxation kinetics as a function of temperature. Reformation of a3FeCO after photolysis is an apparent first order process below 210 K with a distribution of rate constants. The kinetics are well described by a power law. Arrhenius behavior is followed between 140 K and 180 K to yield a peak activation enthalpy of 40.3 kJ/mol and a distribution in g(H) = 2.56 kJ/mol (full width at half-maximum). The major component of a3FeCO shows a very narrow CO absorption band (full width at half-maximum = 2.4 cm-1), while that of CuBCO shows a broader CO absorption (full width at half-maximum = 6 cm-1). These data indicate that in the reduced carbon monoxide complex, a3FeCO is in highly ordered nonpolar surroundings sufficiently separated from CuB that it is not perturbed by motion of the latter, while CuBCO is in less ordered, more flexible surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W1482087680,"A purified, active succinate-ubiquinone reductase was prepared from succinate-cytochrome c reductase without damage to ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase by 1.1% Triton X-100 solubilization at pH 8.0, and calcium phosphate column chromatography in 50 mM Tris-succinate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mM potassium phosphate. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase thus obtained contains ubiquinone and catalyzes thenoyltrifluoroacetone-sensitive oxidation of succinate by 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in the absence of exogenous mediator. Addition of ubiquinone enhanced the activity about 50%. Analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme contains four polypeptides. The high molecular weight polypeptide contaminants usually observed in the Complex II preparation obtained by the reported method were absent. The active succinate-ubiquinone reductase can reconstitute with the cytochrome b-c1III complex, or Complex III to form succinate-cytochrome c reductase in the absence of exogenous ubiquinone or with the resolved ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase in the presence of ubiquinone and phospholipids. Under the proper conditions, all the original succinate-cytochrome c reductase was obtained, indicating that the resolution caused no damage to the protein, despite the removal of phospholipids and ubiquinone from the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase region."
https://openalex.org/W1502852420,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic agonists on protein phosphorylation in intact frog atrium. beta-Adrenergic agonists increase and muscarinic agonists decrease 32P incorporation into a 165,000-dalton (165K) protein within less than 1 min. The concentrations of isoproterenol that produce increases in 32P incorporation into the 165K protein and in systolic tension are similar. Further, the changes in 32P incorporation and tension produced by isoproterenol occur with similar time courses. Carbamylcholine decreases tension somewhat more quickly and at lower concentrations than it decreases 32P incorporation, however. Isoproterenol-stimulated 32P incorporation is thought to be mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase because bath application of dibutyryl cAMP, cholera toxin, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase 32P incorporation into the 165K protein in intact atria. When heart homogenates are incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, cAMP stimulates the incorporation of 32P into the 165K protein. cGMP is much less effective. We suggest that carbamylcholine decreases 32P incorporation into the 165K protein by a mechanism independent of cAMP levels because carbamylcholine inhibits the stimulation of 32P incorporation into the 165K band produced by 8-bromo cAMP in intact cells. Phosphorylation of the 165K protein occurs in cardiac muscle but not in other tissues. We hypothesize that the 165K protein is C-protein, because the 165K- and C-proteins have similar solubilities and are associated with the myofibril. Further, antibodies produced against the 165K protein bind to C-protein purified from rabbit heart and also bind to the same region of the myofibril where C-protein is found."
https://openalex.org/W1481740781,"Rat liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) mRNA was purified to 25% of total mRNA activity (greater than 50-fold enrichment) by polysome immunoprecipitation. This preparation was used as template for the synthesis of cDNA that was subsequently cloned in Escherichia coli. The resulting clones were screened by in situ hybridization and by hybrid-selected translation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. The cDNA insert of one plasmid, pPC2, was complementary to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA as determined by these screening procedures. pPC2 cDNA was 760 base pairs in length and a partial restriction enzyme map was constructed. pPC2 was labeled with 32P by nick translation and was used as a hybridization probe to quantitate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA following N6,O2'-dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) injection or glucose feeding. Bt2cAMP increased whereas glucose decreased the level of hybridizable phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA and in all cases the changes were proportional to the in vitro translational activities measured in a reticulocyte lysate system. The half-life of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA sequences was measured by an indirect procedure involving their quantitation, by hybridization assay, during deinduction and induction. The half-life was approximately 10-40 min during deinduction by glucose or during induction stimulated by Bt2cAMP. Our data indicate that cAMP enhances some step in the generation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1503898309,"Oxidative phosphorylation 1 (OP1), a nuclear gene of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is required for the expression of a functional mitochondria, has been isolated on a recombinant plasmid. The gene was selected from a recombinant plasmid pool which contained wild type yeast genomic DNA by transformation of the yeast nuclear mutant (op1) followed by a two-stage screening procedure. A recombinant plasmid containing a 2.6 kilobase Bam HI fragment of genomic yeast DNA inserted in either orientation into the single Bam HI site of yeast vector YEp 13 could complement the op1 mutation. Analysis of the gene product of this inserted DNA by three independent methods, 1) in vivo expression in Escherichia coli maxicells, 2) cell-free translation of plasmid selected RNA, and 3) expression analysis in yeast, revealed that its gene product is a protein of Mr = 30,000-32,000, which cross-reacts with specific anti-serum to the adenine nucleotide translocator of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The selection procedure is efficient and can be used for the isolation of any defined yeast nuclear gene which participates in mitochondrial development."

We report that reovirus type 1 (which induces hydrocephalus in mice) binds to the surface of isolated human and murine ciliated ependymal cells. With the use of recombinant viral clones, the binding property was mapped to the type 1 viral hemagglutinin, which also determines in vivo the affinity of reovirus type 1 for ependyma. Mumps virus, measles virus, parainfluenza type 3, and herpes simplex virus type 1 bind to murine ependyma cells, whereas reovirus type 3, herpes simplex virus type 2, and poliovirus type 2 do not."

The blocking factor is not present in plasma of bovine leukemia virus-free cattle or of cattle infected with common bovine viruses. Blocking of bovine leukemia virus expression by the plasma factor is reversible, and seems to be mediated by a nonimmunoglobulin protein molecule."

(1980) J. Biol. Chem, 255, 8483-8488). In the present studies, the binding stoichiometries of type II holoenzyme for cAMP and 8-N3cAMP were determined using Millipore filtration assays in the absence (Assay A) and presence (Assay B) of 2 M NaCl and histone. The binding stoichiometry of holoenzyme for cAMP was 2 mol/mol with Assay A, and 4 mol/mol with assay B. The binding stoichiometry for 8-N3cAMP was 2 mol/mol with Assay B or with Assay A following photolysis of the holoenzyme:8-N3cAMP mixture. In the absence of photolysis, the binding stoichiometry for 8-N3cAMP was 0.4 mol/mol with Assay A. Both 8-N3cAMP and cAMP fully dissociated the holoenzyme. Holoenzyme, labeled with 8-N3[3H]cAMP on a preparative scale, incorporated 1 mol of 8-N3[3H]cAMP/mol of regulatory subunit (RII) monomer. The labeled RII was separated from catalytic subunit, cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the resultant peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. A single radioactive peptide was observed which had the same NH2 terminal residue and amino acid composition as the peptide obtained when dissociated RII was labeled with 8-N3cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1543351102,"Titration of purple uteroferrin with two reducing equivalents of ferrous ion doubles the intensity of its g' = 1.74 EPR signal while inducing only minor changes in spectral characteristics. Unexpectedly, intensification of the EPR signal is not accompanied by a commensurate increase in visible absorption: only a small shift in peak position from 545 to 525 nm is observed. These observations suggest that uteroferrin can bind a second iron to form a paramagnetic complex that is essentially nonchromophoric. Titration of the pink protein with one oxidizing equivalent of ferric ion also doubles the intensity of its g' = 1.74 EPR signal, again shifting the primary visible absorption band to 525 nm. In either case, therefore, it is possible to augment the g' = 1.74 EPR signal without a corresponding augmentation of purple-pink color. Conversely, the addition of hydrogen peroxide (but not ferricyanide) to purple uteroferrin obliterates the g' = 1.74 EPR signal without abolishing the protein's visible absorption spectrum. Hence, it is also possible to have purple color without a corresponding g' = 1.74 EPR signal. To explain these curious results, two possible models, one involving low spin ferric iron exclusively and the other a combination of low spin ferric and high spin ferrous, are adduced."

https://openalex.org/W1993966005,"To determine when during S phase integrated viral DNA sequences in several tsA SV40-transformed Chinese hamster cell clones replicate, we pulse-labeled cultures with BrdUrd and subsequently collected mitotic cells during sequential time intervals. Restriction endonuclease mapping indicated that each of the three SV40-transformed Chinese hamster lung cell clones contained a single viral DNA sequence at a different, but in each case unique, chromosomal site. DNA was extracted from each population of mitotic cells and then was resolved into dense, BrdUrd-containing and light, unsubstituted DNA fractions by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. In each pair of samples obtained, we measured viral DNA sequences by solution hybridization using single-stranded SV40 32P-labeled DNA probes. Our results support the conclusions that specific genes within a mammalian DNA are programmed to replicate at particular times during S phase, and that the SV40 A gene product, large T antigen, programs integrated viral DNA sequences to replicate very early in S phase. The fractions of viral DNA replicated early in S phase appeared to correlate with each clone's content of functional large T antigen at permissive and nonpermissive culture temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2002390485,"Synthetic alpha-melanotropin stimulated the release of immunoreactive adrenocorticotropin from primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. The effect of the alpha-melanotropin was dose-dependent. Cells incubated with synthetic arginine-vasopressin and alpha-melanotropin simultaneously produced an amount of adrenocorticotropin that was greater than the sum of the amount that the cells produced in response to each peptide added separately. Other peptides structurally similar to alpha-melanotropin, such as, beta-, gamma 1-, gamma 2-, and gamma 3-melanotropin, were also tested for adrenocorticotropin-releasing activity. Only the gamma 3-melanotropin demonstrated a statistically significant effect. A vasopressin preparation (Pitressin, Parke-Davis) purified from posterior pituitaries and previously shown to contain some alpha-melanotropin was much more potent in releasing adrenocorticotropin than the synthetic vasopressin."

https://openalex.org/W1554960295,"Adrenocorticotropin(ACTH)-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase was examined in subclones derived from the ACTH-responsive, Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line. This report describes clonal variation in ACTH-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase and an associated variation in the level of a 68,000-dalton protein, p68. A subclone of Y1 cells with a low level of p68 (0.8% of total protein) exhibited a faster rate of desensitization and a slower rate of recovery from desensitization when compared with a clone containing a high level of p68 (10% of total protein). In three clones with low levels of p68, ACTH desensitized adenylate cyclase with ED50 values from 0.3 to 0.5 nM. In several clones with high levels of p68, the adenylate cyclase system was more resistant to ACTH-induced desensitization; the ED50 values for ACTH in these clones ranged from 2 to 12 nM. Among 11 ACTH-responsive subclones, the level of p68 correlated significantly (p less than 0.001, r = 0.87) with resistance to the desensitization induced by 1 nM ACTH. These results suggest that p68 may function in the maintenance of an ACTH-responsive adenylate cyclase system, or that the level of p68 and responsiveness to ACTH are coordinately regulated."
