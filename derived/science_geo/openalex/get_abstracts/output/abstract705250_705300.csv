https://openalex.org/W4310503841,"Non-invasive Gamma ENtrainment Using Sensory stimulation (GENUS) at 40Hz reduces Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology such as amyloid and tau levels, prevents cerebral atrophy, and improves behavioral testing performance in mouse models of AD. Here, we report data from (1) a Phase 1 feasibility study (NCT04042922, ClinicalTrials.gov) in cognitively normal volunteers (n = 25), patients with mild AD dementia (n = 16), and patients with epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode monitoring (n = 2) to assess safety and feasibility of a single brief GENUS session to induce entrainment and (2) a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2A pilot study (NCT04055376) in patients with mild probable AD dementia (n = 15) to assess safety, compliance, entrainment, and exploratory clinical outcomes after chronic daily 40Hz sensory stimulation for 3 months. Our Phase 1 study showed that 40Hz GENUS was safe and effectively induced entrainment in both cortical regions and other cortical and subcortical structures such as the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, and gyrus rectus. Our Phase 2A study demonstrated that chronic daily 40Hz light and sound GENUS was well-tolerated and that compliance was equally high in both the control and active groups, with participants equally inaccurate in guessing their group assignments prior to unblinding. Electroencephalography recordings show that our 40Hz GENUS device safely and effectively induced 40Hz entrainment in participants with mild AD dementia. After 3 months of daily stimulation, the group receiving 40Hz stimulation showed (i) lesser ventricular dilation and hippocampal atrophy, (ii) increased functional connectivity in the default mode network as well as with the medial visual network, (iii) better performance on the face-name association delayed recall test, and (iv) improved measures of daily activity rhythmicity compared to the control group. These results support further evaluation of GENUS in a pivotal clinical trial to evaluate its potential as a novel disease-modifying therapeutic for patients with AD."
https://openalex.org/W4310521237,"Amidst an unprecedented Monkeypox outbreak, we aimed to measure knowledge, attitudes, practices and Monkeypox vaccination intentions among the U.S. adult population. We conducted an online cross-sectional survey, representative of the U.S. adult general public in June 2022. We asked participants whether they would receive a Monkeypox vaccine, if they were recommended to do so. Participants also answered questions on their self-assessed level of Monkeypox knowledge, risk perception, perceived exaggeration of the threat, and self-efficacy around Monkeypox. Furthermore, we asked about their trusted sources of information, COVID-19 vaccination status and administered the 6-item Vaccine Trust Indicator (VTI). Survey weights were created based on age, gender and race. We analyzed predictors of Monkeypox vaccination intentions using logistic regression, adjusted for education, age, race and ethnicity. A total of 856 respondents completed the survey, of which 51% (n = 436) were female and 41% (n = 348) had a college degree or higher. If recommended, 46% of respondents intended to get vaccinated against Monkeypox, 29% would not get vaccinated and 25% did not know. Almost half the respondents (47%) found their own knowledge level about Monkeypox poor or very poor. The most trusted sources of information about the outbreak were healthcare professionals and officials, but also known doctors and researchers with a large online following. Only 24% indicated that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be in charge of the outbreak response. Being vaccinated against COVID-19 was a strong predictor of intention to receive a Monkeypox if recommended (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 29.2, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 13.1-65.3). Increased risk perception was positively associated with vaccination intentions (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.6), scoring high on the VTI as well (5.4, 95% CI (3.2-9.1). The low levels of self-assessed knowledge, vaccination intentions and influence of COVID-19 vaccination status point to a lack of clear communication."
https://openalex.org/W4310529450,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought forward an unprecedented situation, which has forced the educational institutes worldwide to use a propriety ""online only"" model for teaching and learning. Teachers have been compelled to deliver lectures online using some form of an online delivery platform. In this dilemma situation with the closure of the educational institutes, one of the very basic necessities is to ensure quality features of e-learning systems that are being used for the purpose of education delivery, particularly from the students' perspective. The objective of this study was to identify factors affecting pharmacy students' satisfaction in Vietnam during the COVID 19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey of a consecutive sample of 1612 valid responses from students who have been in distance learning at Hanoi University of Pharmacy has been conducted. An integrated model with three main dimensions had been developed: learner's characteristics; instructor's characteristics; system, and technology. Data were collected in the field on both online and offline platforms using the questionnaire of 39 items to investigate the critical factors affecting learners' satisfaction in e-learning. The reliability of the questionnaire was measured using Cronbach's alpha on this data. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis were employed for data analysis. Out of 2491 questionnaires distributed, 1612 questionnaires were completed (respond rate 64.7%). The results revealed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, system and technical dimension and instructors' characteristics are the critical factors affecting learners' perceived satisfaction. The perceived usefulness of the students was the most important factor affecting overall satisfaction (beta coefficient = 0.610). Multiple regression analysis yielded the four main factors explaining 59.9% of total satisfaction. The findings revealed how to improve learners' satisfaction and further strengthen their e-learning implementation. The interventional solutions on students' characteristics, instructors' characteristics and system & technical dimension should be considered and implemented to improve the quality of e-learning and students' satisfaction at Hanoi University of Pharmacy."
https://openalex.org/W4311069067,"Germline mutations within the Krebs cycle enzyme genes fumarate hydratase ( FH ) or succinate dehydrogenase ( SDHB , SDHC , SDHD ) are associated with an increased risk of aggressive and early metastasizing variants of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These RCCs express significantly increased levels of intracellular fumarate or succinate that inhibit 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, such as the TET enzymes that regulate DNA methylation. This study evaluated the genome-wide methylation profiles of 34 RCCs from patients with RCC susceptibility syndromes and 11 associated normal samples using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. All the HLRCC ( FH mutated) and SDHB-RCC ( SDHB mutated) tumors demonstrated a distinct CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). HLRCC tumors demonstrated an extensive and relatively uniform level of hypermethylation that showed some correlation with tumor size. SDHB-RCC demonstrated a lesser and more varied pattern of hypermethylation that overlapped in part with the HLRCC hypermethylation. Combined methylation and mRNA expression analysis of the HLRCC tumors demonstrated hypermethylation and transcription downregulation of genes associated with the HIF pathway, HIF3A and CITED4 , the WNT pathway, SFRP1 , and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and MYC expression, OVOL1 . These observations were confirmed in the TCGA CIMP-RCC tumors. A selected panel of probes could identify the CIMP tumors and differentiate between HLRCC and SDHB-RCC tumors. This panel accurately detected all CIMP-RCC tumors within the TCGA RCC cohort, identifying them as HLRCC -like, and could potentially be used to create a liquid biopsy-based screening tool. The CIMP signature in these aggressive tumors could provide both a useful biomarker for diagnosis and a target for novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4310503362,"Pedometer-facilitated interventions encourage physical activity via the accumulation of steps. Mixed evidence suggests that neighborhood walkability might influence the effectiveness of physical activity interventions, including pedometer-facilitated interventions. Our study investigated the moderating effect of neighborhood walkability on immediate (4-week) and short-term (12-week) changes in self-reported neighborhood-specific leisure and transportation walking, leisure-based moderate and vigorous-intensity physical activity, and leisure-based screen time during a pedometer-facilitated intervention (UWALK).This quasi-experiment undertaken in Calgary (Canada) compared behavior changes during the 12-week intervention between two neighborhood groups classified as 'walkable' or 'car dependent' based on Walk ScoreÂ®. Of the 573 volunteers (adults in the contemplation and preparation stages of physical activity behavior change), 466 participated in UWALK. Surveys captured sociodemographic characteristics, perceived neighborhood walkability, neighborhood preferences, motivation, physical activity and screen-based leisure. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed models estimated the differences in physical activity and leisure screen time between the neighborhood walkability groups at baseline, 4-weeks, and 12-weeks.UWALK participants included mostly females (83%) and had an average age of 49.2 years. Weekly minutes of walking for transport inside the neighborhood was higher (p < .001) among participants from walkable versus car dependent neighborhoods at baseline (42.5 vs. 21.1), 4-weeks (81.2 vs. 48.2), and 12-weeks (87.2 vs. 48.0). Regardless of neighborhood walkability, all physical activity outcomes were higher and leisure screen time lower at 4-weeks and 12-weeks compared with baseline. We found no significant neighborhood group by time interactions.Pedometer-facilitated interventions may be effective for supporting short-term changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior even among adults residing in low walkable neighborhoods."
https://openalex.org/W4310503856,"Medical schools are challenged to guard student wellbeing given the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak combined with an already high prevalence of mental distress. Although social support is generally associated with less crisis-induced stress, it is unknown whether this applies to medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak.The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on perceived stress of medical students was assessed by comparing their perceived stress levels during the outbreak to both their own baseline and the previous cohort's pre-COVID-19 stress levels. Then, the association between social support and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak was assessed.Dutch Year-1 medical students of cohort 2019 (n = 99) completed the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) at two time points: baseline (pre-COVID-19) and final measurement (COVID-19). Social support-emotional-informational support and club membership-was assessed during the final measurement. PSS and social support scores were compared to similar measurements of cohort 2018 (n = 196). Students' baseline stress levels, gender, and study performance were controlled for when comparing final stress levels.In cohort 2018 (pre-COVID-19), students' perceived stress levels did not differ significantly between the baseline and final measurements. Additionally, baseline stress levels of the two cohorts (2018 and 2019) were not found to be significantly different. Cohort 2019's final stress levels (COVID-19) were significantly higher compared to their baseline stress levels (paired t-test: t = 6.07, p < .001) and cohort 2018's final stress levels (linear regression: B = 4.186, p < .001). Only during the COVID-19 outbreak higher social support levels-i.e., emotional-informational support (B = -0.75, p < .001) and club membership (B = -3.68, p < .01)-were associated with lower stress levels.During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical students' perceived stress levels were higher-especially for students with lower social support levels. Our results suggest that medical schools should optimize social support to minimize crisis-induced stress."
https://openalex.org/W4310521683,"Among the new research possibilities offered by smartphones, collecting geolocation data (e.g., GPS coordinates) holds a prominent position, allowing the investigation of individuals' mobility with greater precision and less effort than conventional data collection methods. However, geolocation data are still affected by errors (e.g., inaccurate recorded locations) and limitations (e.g., inability to record the purpose of a trip). Sending a survey right in the moment an event of interest is detected using geolocation data can add the missing information, while reducing memory errors that typically affect conventional surveys (sent some days/weeks after). However, the possibilities offered by both geolocation data and in-the-moment surveys triggered by geolocation data are limited by individuals' willingness to participate. This paper assesses such willingness using a conjoint experiment carried out on a sample of 1,016 members of an opt-in online panel in Spain. The effects on such willingness to accept the conditions offered to participants and their personal characteristics are also studied. The results show that asking panelists to participate in in-the-moment surveys does not negatively affect willingness compared to only sharing geolocation data. However, the conditions offered to panelists for their participation (mainly project duration and incentives) have a strong influence on their willingness. Furthermore, panelists less concerned with privacy and safety, and more experienced in sharing social media content, installing apps and using Google Maps, are more willing to participate. Finally, answers to open questions reveal that the main reason for participating is getting the incentive, while not participating is primarily related to privacy issues."
https://openalex.org/W4310529363,"Interoception refers to the processing of stimuli originating within the body and is widely considered a multidimensional construct. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and measurement of the subjective, self-reported component, referred to here as interoceptive sensibility. As a contribution to knowledge on the topic, we sought to examine the construct commonality and distinguishability of seven self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility using Item Pool Visualisation (IPV), an illustrative method that locates item pools from within the same dataset and illustrates these in the form of nested radar charts. Adults from the United Kingdom (N = 802) completed seven measures of interoceptive sensibility, and the data were subjected to IPV. Results demonstrated that, of the included measures, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness-2 provided the closest and most precise measurement of the core interoceptive sensibility construct (i.e., core of the entire investigated item pool). The Body Awareness Questionnaire and the Private Body Consciousness Scale were also centrally located measures, while the Body Perception Questionnaire and the Body Responsiveness Scale appear to tap more distal aspects of the core construct. We discuss implications for interpreting complicated data patterns using measures of interoceptive sensibility and, more generally, for measuring the construct of interoceptive sensibility."
https://openalex.org/W4310529429,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the relationships between perceived support at the time of assistance, insecure attachment (i.e., avoidance and anxious attachment), and prolonged grief symptoms in family caregivers of palliative care patients deceased for at least one year. We also investigated the moderating role of insecure attachment in the relationship between perceived support and the intensity of prolonged grief symptoms. Method An exploratory cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 157 participants completed the Prolonged Grief Scale (PG-13) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). Results Correlational analyses indicated that prolonged grief symptoms were positively correlated with Avoidance attachment but not with Anxious attachment. Perceived support was negatively correlated with both the Avoidance and Anxious attachment factors. Lastly, the two insecure attachment dimensions were moderately and positively correlated with each other. Results of moderation analysis showed that high Avoidance attachment moderated the effect of perceived family and social support on the intensity of prolonged grief symptoms among family caregivers of palliative home-care-assisted patients. Results also showed that the Anxious attachment factor had a significant effect on prolonged grief symptoms, even though the interaction with perceived support was not significant. Conclusions Overall, these results underline that a high level of avoidance attachment may moderate the relationship between perceived support and the intensity of grief symptoms, thereby increasing the risk of developing a mental disorder. Interventions to prevent prolonged grief disorder among family caregivers should take these findings into account."
https://openalex.org/W4310529432,"A high yield of isolated protoplast and reliable regeneration system are prerequisite for successful somatic hybridization and genome editing research. However, reproducible plant regeneration from protoplasts remains a bottleneck for many crops, including cassava. We evaluated several factors that influence isolation of viable protoplasts form leaf mesophyll, induction of embryogenic calli, and regeneration of plants in three cassava cultivars; Muchericheri, TMS60444 and Karibuni. A relatively higher protoplast yield was obtained with enzyme mixture containing 5 g/L Macerozyme and 10 g/L cellulase. Muchericheri recorded relatively higher protoplast yield of 20.50Â±0.50Ã106 whereas TMS60444 (10.25Â±0.25Ã106) had the least protoplast yield in 10 g/L cellulase and 4 g/L cellulase. Freshly isolated protoplast cells were plated on callus induction medium (CIM) solid medium containing MS basal salt, 60 g/L D-glucose, 30 g/L sucrose, B5 vitamins, 100 mg/L myo-inositol, 0.5 mg/L copper sulphate, 100 mg/L casein hydrolysate, 4.55 g/L mannitol, 0.1 g/L MES, 10 mg/L picloram and 3 g/L gelrite to induce protoplast growth and development. The three cultivars reached colony formation but no further development was observed in this culture method. Protoplast growth and development was further evaluated in suspension culture using varying cell densities (1, 2 and 3Ã 105 p/mL). Development with highest number of minicalli was observed in cell density of 3Ã 105 p/mL. Minicalli obtained were cultured on CIM supplemented with 10mg/L picloram. Callus induction was observed in all cell densities with the cultivars. Highest somatic embryogenesis was observed in 2Ã 105 p/ml while no somatic embryogenesis was observed in cell density of 1Ã105 p/mL. Somatic embryos were matured in EMM medium supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP, 0.02 mg/L NAA and 1.5 mg/L GA3 then germinated in hormone free medium for plant regeneration. This protocol which used simple mixture of commercial enzymes is highly reproducible and can be applied in biotechnology research on cassava."
https://openalex.org/W4310529510,"We assessed the critical role of Housing First (HF) programs and frontline workers in responding to challenges faced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine HF frontline workers from three HF programs between May 2020 and July 2020, in Toronto, Canada. Information was collected on challenges and adjustments needed to provide services to HF clients (people experiencing homelessness and mental disorders). We applied the Analytical Framework method and thematic analysis to our data.Inability to provide in-person support and socializing activities, barriers to appropriate mental health assessments, and limited virtual communication due to clients' lack of access to digital devices were among the most salient challenges that HF frontline workers reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing virtual support services, provision of urgent in-office or in-field support, distributing food aid, connecting clients with online healthcare services, increasing harm reduction education and referral, and meeting urgent housing needs were some of the strategies implemented by HF frontline workers to support the complex needs of their clients during the pandemic. HF frontline workers experienced workload burden, job insecurity and mental health problems (e.g. distress, worry, anxiety) as a consequence of their services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the several work-, programming- and structural-related challenges experienced by HF frontline workers when responding to the needs of their clients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, they played a critical role in meeting the communication, food, housing and health needs of their clients during the pandemic, even when it negatively affected their well-being. A more coordinated, integrated, innovative, sustainable, effective and well-funded support response is required to meet the intersecting and complex social, housing, health and financial needs of underserved and socio-economically excluded groups during and beyond health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4310529609,"In recent years, many new immunologically active peptides from insects have been identified. Unfortunately, in most cases, their physiological functions are not fully known. One example is yamamarin, a pentapeptide isolated from the caterpillars of the Antheraea yamamai moth. This peptide has strong antiproliferative properties and is probably involved in the regulation of diapause. Additionally, antiviral activity was discovered. The results of the research presented in this paper are, to our knowledge, the first attempt to characterize the biological effects of yamamarin on the functioning of the reproductive processes and embryonic development of insects using a model species, the beetle Tenebrio molitor, a commonly known pest of grain storage. Simultaneously, we tested the possible activity of the molecule in an in vivo system. In this research, we present the multifaceted effects of yamamarin in this beetle. We show that yamamarin influences ovarian growth and development, maturation of terminal oocytes, level of vitellogenin gene transcript, the number of laid eggs, duration of embryonic development, and larval hatching. In experiments with palmitic acid-conjugated yamamarin (C16-yamamarin), we also showed that this peptide is a useful starting molecule for the synthesis of biopharmaceuticals or new peptidomimetics with gonadotropic activity and effects on embryonic development. The data obtained additionally provide new knowledge about the possible function of yamamarin in insect physiology, pointing to the important role of this pentapeptide as a regulator of reproductive processes and embryonic development in a heterologous bioassay with T. molitor."
https://openalex.org/W4310529622,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) arise from restricted regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and differentiate into myelin-forming cells after migration, but their ultrastructural characteristics have not been fully elucidated. This study examined the three-dimensional ultrastructure of OPCs in comparison with other glial cells in the early postnatal optic nerve by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. We examined 70 putative OPCs (pOPC) that were distinct from other glial cells according to established morphological criteria. The pOPCs were unipolar in shape with relatively few processes, and their Golgi apparatus were localized in the perinuclear region with a single cisterna. Astrocytes abundant in the optic nerve were distinct from pOPCs and had a greater number of processes and more complicated Golgi apparatus morphology. All pOPCs and astrocytes contained a pair of centrioles (basal bodies). Among them, 45% of pOPCs extended a short cilium, and 20% of pOPCs had centrioles accompanied by vesicles, whereas all astrocytes with basal bodies had cilia with invaginated ciliary pockets. These results suggest that the fine structures of pOPCs during the developing and immature stages may account for their distinct behavior. Additionally, the vesicular transport of the centrioles, along with a short cilium length, suggests active ciliogenesis in pOPCs."
https://openalex.org/W4310529897,"Our study aims to update knowledge about psychological distress and its changes in the Polish group of academic medical teachers after two years of a global pandemic. During the coronavirus disease, teachers were challenged to rapidly transition into remote teaching and adapt new assessment and evaluation systems for students, which might have been a completely novel situation that was not addressed before, especially in medical universities in Poland. We conducted a cross-sectional study at Poznan University of Medical Sciences from March to April 2022. The questionnaire included self-reported information on anxiety, stress, and depression. We found that post-pandemic levels of anxiety, stress, and depression have significantly (p<0.001) improved compared to initial levels at the beginning of coronavirus disease. In multivariate models, females had higher odds of improving levels of anxiety (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = -1.58-(-0.03); p = 0.04), stress (OR = 0.36; 95% CI = -1.83-(-0.22); p = 0.01), and depression (OR = 0.0.37; 95% CI = -1.58-(-0.12); p = 0.03). Anxiety, stress, or depression were not significantly associated with years of experience, the number of taught subjects, and weekly teaching hours, but only with the academic work during COVID-19 (Spearman ranxiety = 0.37, rstress = 0.32, rdepression = 0.37, p<0.001). For the virtual learning concerns, 79% of teachers reported that students might engage less; and it was correlated with higher weekly teaching hours (r = 0.19, p<0.05). Even though only 29.8% reported cheating as a concern, it was correlated with a higher number of taught subjects (r = 0.2, p<0.05). Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression have improved as time passed, not affecting teachers' academic performance. Concerns about virtual learning have been raised, suggesting it may be conjoined with classroom learning but not as an alternative. Universities should highlight the importance of seeking psychological support and provide essential programs to employees. Teachers' coping skills with psychological distress should be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W4311069068,"The ability to acquire chemical defenses through the diet has evolved across several major taxa. Chemically defended organisms may need to balance chemical defense acquisition and nutritional quality of prey items. However, these dietary preferences and potential trade-offs are rarely considered in the framework of diet-derived defenses. Poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) acquire defensive alkaloids from their arthropod diet of ants and mites, although their dietary preferences have never been investigated. We conducted prey preference assays with the Dyeing Poison frog ( Dendrobates tinctorius ) to test the hypothesis that alkaloid load and prey traits influence frog dietary preferences. We tested size preferences (big versus small) within each of four prey groups (ants, beetles, flies, and fly larvae) and found that frogs preferred interacting with smaller prey items of the fly and beetle groups. Frog taxonomic prey preferences were also tested as we experimentally increased their chemical defense load by feeding frogs decahydroquinoline, an alkaloid compound similar to those naturally found in their diet. Contrary to our expectations, overall preferences did not change during alkaloid consumption, as frogs across groups preferred fly larvae over other prey. Finally, we assessed the protein and lipid content of prey items and found that small ants have the highest lipid content while large fly larvae have the highest protein content. Our results suggest that consideration of toxicity and prey nutritional value are important factors in understanding the evolution of acquired chemical defenses and niche partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W4311069078,"Alcohol is the most used substance by women of childbearing age. Alcohol exposed pregnancies can have serious consequences to the fetus, and the UK has one of the highest rates of drinking during pregnancy. Alcohol use during motherhood is also a public health concern, linked with potential harms to the woman and child. This qualitative study investigated the attitudes and experiences of pregnant/parenting women and healthcare professionals regarding maternal drinking. A semi-structured focus group and interviews were conducted in the North West of England with pregnant women, mothers, and healthcare professionals. Quantitative measures captured demographics, alcohol use, and screened for mental ill-health for pregnant women and mothers. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse narratives. Findings revealed that most participants believed avoiding alcohol during pregnancy is the safest option. However, some pregnant women and mothers stated that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the harms of low-level drinking and that abstinence guidelines were patronising. All participants reported that low-level drinking during motherhood was acceptable. Heavy drinking was believed to pose serious harm during pregnancy and motherhood to the baby and mother, in addition to damaging relationships. Strong motives were revealed for choosing and avoiding to drink, such as coping with the difficulties of motherhood and parental responsibilities, respectively. Contradictions were found across quantitative and qualitative self-reports of consumption, reflecting potential underreporting of alcohol use. Additionally, drinking levels were discussed in extremes only (low/heavy) without considering âgrey areaâ drinking. Clear, consistent advice and guidelines are needed to support women in reducing their alcohol use during pregnancy and motherhood. These should include the unique potential risks regarding maternal drinking, and the harm attributable to non-clinically dependent alcohol use. The maternal participants in this study were middle-class, therefore, research is needed to capture the views and experiences of women of all socioeconomic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W4310500654,"Background The latest guidance on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) recommends exercise therapy. Tai Chi, an exercise method in traditional Chinese medicine, is reportedly helpful for CFS. However, the mechanism remains unclear. The present longitudinal study aimed to detect the influence of Tai Chi on functional brain connectivity in CFS. Methods The study recruited 20 CFS patients and 20 healthy controls to receive eight sessions of Tai Chi exercise over a period of one month. Before the Tai Chi exercise, an abnormal functional brain connectivity for recognizing CFS was generated by a linear support vector model. The prediction ability of the structure was validated with a random forest classification under a permutation test. Then, the functional connections (FCs) of the structure were analyzed in the large-scale brain network after Tai Chi exercise while taking the changes in the Fatigue Scale-14, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) as clinical effectiveness evaluation. The registration number is ChiCTR2000032577 in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Results 1) The score of the Fatigue Scale-14 decreased significantly in the CFS patients, and the scores of the PSQI and SF-36 changed significantly both in CFS patients and healthy controls. 2) Sixty FCs were considered significant to discriminate CFS ( P = 0.000, best accuracy 90%), with 80.5% Â± 9% average accuracy. 3) The FCs that were majorly related to the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN) significantly increased ( P = 0.0032 and P = 0.001) in CFS patients after Tai Chi exercise. 4) The change of FCs in the left FPN and DMN were positively correlated (r = 0.40, P = 0.012). Conclusion These results demonstrated that the 60 FCs we found using machine learning could be neural biomarkers to discriminate between CFS patients and healthy controls. Tai Chi exercise may improve CFS patientsâ fatigue syndrome, sleep quality, and body health statement by strengthening the functional connectivity of the left FPN and DMN under these FCs. The findings promote our understanding of Tai Chi exerciseâs value in treating CFS."

https://openalex.org/W4310503858,"Policy-capturing (PC) methodologies have been employed to study decision-making, and to assess how decision-makers use available information when asked to evaluate hypothetical situations. An important assumption of the PC techniques is that respondents develop cognitive models to help them efficiently process the many information cues provided while reviewing a large number of decision scenarios. With this study, we seek to analyze the process of answering a PC study. We do this by investigating the information acquisition and the cognitive processes behind policy-capturing, building on cognitive and attention research and exploiting the tools of eye-tracking. Additionally, we investigate the role of experience in mediating the relationship between the information processed and judgments in order to determine how the cognitive models of student samples differ from those of professionals. We find evidence of increasing efficiency as a function of practice when respondents undergo the PC experiment. We also detect a selective process on information acquisition; such selection is consistent with the respondents' evaluation. While some differences are found in the information processing among the split sample of students and professionals, remarkable similarities are detected. Our study adds confidence to the assumption that respondents build cognitive models to handle the large amounts of information presented in PC experiments, and the defection of such models is not substantially affected by the applied sample."
https://openalex.org/W4310503872,"Manually collecting landmarks for quantifying complex morphological phenotypes can be laborious and subject to intra and interobserver errors. However, most automated landmarking methods for efficiency and consistency fall short of landmarking highly variable samples due to the bias introduced by the use of a single template. We introduce a fast and open source automated landmarking pipeline (MALPACA) that utilizes multiple templates for accommodating large-scale variations. We also introduce a K-means method of choosing the templates that can be used in conjunction with MALPACA, when no prior information for selecting templates is available. Our results confirm that MALPACA significantly outperforms single-template methods in landmarking both single and multi-species samples. K-means based template selection can also avoid choosing the worst set of templates when compared to random template selection. We further offer an example of post-hoc quality check for each individual template for further refinement. In summary, MALPACA is an efficient and reproducible method that can accommodate large morphological variability, such as those commonly found in evolutionary studies. To support the research community, we have developed open-source and user-friendly software tools for performing K-means multi-templates selection and MALPACA."
https://openalex.org/W4310503886,"Multimorbidity, common in the primary care setting, has diverse implications for both the patient and the healthcare system. However, there is no consensus on the definition of multimorbidity globally. Thus, we aimed to conduct a Delphi study to gain consensus on the definition of multimorbidity, the list and number of chronic conditions used for defining multimorbidity in the Singapore primary care setting. Our Delphi study comprised three rounds of online voting from purposively sampled family physicians in public and private settings. Delphi round 1 included open-ended questions for idea generation. The subsequent two rounds used questions with pre-selected options. Consensus was achieved based on a pre-defined criteria following an iterative process. The response rates for the three rounds were 61.7% (37/60), 86.5% (32/37) and 93.8% (30/32), respectively. Among 40 panellists who responded, 46.0% were 31-40 years old, 64.9% were male and 73.0% were from the public primary healthcare setting. Based on the findings of rounds 1, 2 and 3, consensus on the definition of a chronic condition, multimorbidity and finalised list of chronic conditions were achieved. For a condition to be chronic, it should last for six months or more, be recurrent or persistent, impact patients across multiple domains and require long-term management. The consensus-derived definition of multimorbidity is the presence of three or more chronic conditions from a finalised list of 23 chronic conditions. We anticipate that our findings will inform multimorbidity conceptualisation at the national level, standardise multimorbidity measurement in primary care and facilitate resource allocation for patients with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4310521399,"Gastrointestinal (GI) disease is a major health concern in preweaned dairy calves. The objective of this fixed cohort study was to use RNA isolated from preweaned Holstein and Jersey heifer calf feces to study the molecular adaptations to variable clinical GI disease. The study was conducted on a commercial calf ranch in the western U.S. Enrolled calves were assessed twice daily for variations in demeanor, milk intake, and hydration. Fecal consistency scores were recorded at enrollment (day 1), and on the day (day 10) that a fecal sample was collected for differential gene expression (DGE). Calves with diarrhea on either day were classified as having either uncomplicated, localized GI disease (scours), or systemic GI disease (systemic enteritis). Eighty-four calvesâ fecal RNA was evaluated for DGE, of which 33 calves (n = 20 Holstein; n = 13 Jersey) were consistently healthy. The remaining 51 calves (n = 23 Holstein; n = 28 Jersey) experienced varying severity of GI disease during the sampling window. Genes of interest were related to the inflammatory response (i.e., IFNG , NFKB1 , NOD2 , TLR2 , and TLR4 ) and cell membrane or cytoplasmic transport (i.e., AQP3 , FABP2 , KRT8 and SLC5A1 ). Breed-specific findings indicated that AQP3 , IFNG , and TLR4 were upregulated in Holsteins with systemic enteritis, whereas KRT8 was downregulated in systemically affected Jerseys. Holsteins did not appear affected by scours aside from a tendency for DGE of toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the day of diarrhea. However, Jersey calves consistently demonstrated a tendency to upregulate IFNG , NFKB1 , and TLR4 when affected with either scours or systemic enteritis. These findings were more pronounced in systemically affected Jersey calves and were observed as a delayed response to both scours and systemic enteritis. These findings support previous observations suggesting that Holstein calves may be better equipped than Jersey calves to rapidly fight pathogen invasion."

This study assessed the impact of the use of NPIs on the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the UK AF.A longitudinal study design was adopted, and secondary data was analysed retrospectively. Clinical Read codes for ILI was used to generate data for flu seasons before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2017 to April 2021).Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of reporting ILI was ~ 4% across all flu seasons. The count of ILI was 2.9%, 2.2% and 3.1% during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 flu seasons respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both the rate of reporting ILI (0.6%) and the count of ILI (0.5%) were significantly smaller (p < .001). The rate of reporting ILI was positively correlated with the count of ILI (r (2) = .97, p = .014). Influenza vaccination rate increased by 1.3% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination rate was negatively correlated with the rate of reporting ILI (r (2) = -.52, p = 0.24) and the count of ILI (r (2) = -.61, p = 0.19). However, this correlation was not significant. The use of NPIs was negatively correlated with the rate of reporting ILI (r (2) = -.99, p = < .001) and the count of ILI (r (2) = -.95, p = 0.026). The overall multiple regression performed was statistically significant (R2 = 0.94, F (1, 2) = 33.628, p = 0.028). The rate of reporting ILI significantly predicted the count of ILI (Î² = 0.609, p = 0.028) while vaccination rate did not significantly predict the count of ILI (Î² = -0.136, p = 0.677).The incidence of ILI in the UK AF was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of NPIs and the rate of reporting ILI significantly reduced the count of ILI. Being vaccinated for influenza did not significantly reduce the count of ILI."

This is a retrospective study of adult lymphoma patients who received the COVID vaccine between 12/1/2020 and 11/30/2021. The primary endpoint was a positive anti-COVID spike protein antibody level following the primary COVID vaccination series. The primary vaccination series was defined as 2 doses of the COVID mRNA vaccines or 1 dose of the COVID adenovirus vaccine. Subgroups were compared using Fisherâs exact test, and unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 243 patients were included in this study; 72 patients (30%) with indolent lymphomas; 56 patients (23%) with Burkittâs, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) combined; 55 patients (22%) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL); 44 patients (18%) with Hodgkin and T-cell lymphomas (HL/TCL) combined; 12 patients (5%) with mantle cell lymphoma; and 4 patients (2%) with other lymphoma types. One-hundred fifty-eight patients (65%) developed anti-COVID spike protein antibodies after completing the primary COVID vaccination series. Thirty-eight of 46 (83%) patients who received an additional primary shot and had resultant levels produced anti-COVID spike protein antibodies. When compared to other lymphoma types, patients with CLL/SLL had a numerically lower seroconversion rate of 51% following the primary vaccination series whereas patients with HL/TCL appeared to have a robust antibody response with a seropositivity rate of 77% (p = 0.04). Lymphoma patients are capable of mounting a humoral response to the COVID vaccines. Further studies are required to confirm our findings, including whether T-cell immunity would be of clinical relevance in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W4310529414,"F eline u pper r espiratory t ract d isease (FURTD), often caused by infections etiologies, is a multifactorial syndrome affecting feline populations worldwide. Because of its highly transmissible nature, infectious FURTD is most prevalent anywhere cats are housed in groups such as animal shelters, and is associated with negative consequences such as decreasing adoption rates, intensifying care costs, and increasing euthanasia rates. Understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of FURTD is thus essential to best mitigate the negative consequences of this disease. Clinical signs of FURTD include acute respiratory disease, with a small fraction of cats developing chronic sequelae. It is thought that nasal mucosal microbiome changes play an active role in the development of acute clinical signs, but it remains unknown if the microbiome may play a role in the development and progression of chronic clinical disease. To address the knowledge gap surrounding how microbiomes link to chronic FURTD, we asked if microbial community structure of upper respiratory and gut microbiomes differed between cats with chronic FURTD signs and clinically normal cats. We selected 8 households with at least one cat exhibiting chronic clinical FURTD, and simultaneously collected samples from cohabitating clinically normal cats. Microbial community structure was assessed via 16S rDNA sequencing of both gut and nasal microbiome communities. Using a previously described ecophylogenetic method, we identified 136 and 89 microbial features within gut and nasal microbiomes respectively that significantly associated with presence of active FURTD clinical signs in cats with a history of chronic signs. Overall, we find that nasal and gut microbial community members associate with the presence of chronic clinical course, but more research is needed to confirm our observations."
https://openalex.org/W4310529417,"Background The midwifery model of care is a human rights-based approach (HRBA) that is unique and appropriate for the majority of healthy pregnant women, yet full expression may be limited within the medical model. Midwifery centers are facilities designed specifically to enable the practice of midwifery. In high resource countries, they have been shown to be cost effective, evidence-based, avoid over medicalization, and provide safe, efficient and satisfying care. Methods A quasi-experimental design was used to assess the impact of three models of care on womenâs experiences of respect, and trust in maternity care provision, both before and during the pandemic in Bangladesh, as well as their fear and knowledge around COVID-19, during the pandemic. The models were: âfully enabled midwiferyâ (âFEMâ) in freestanding midwifery centers; âmidwifery and medicineâ (âMAMâ) in medical facilities with midwives working alongside nurses and doctors; and âno midwiferyâ (âNoMâ) in medical facilities without midwives. Phone survey data were collected and analyzed from all women (n = 1,191) who delivered from Jan 2020-June 2020 at seven health care facilities in Bangladesh. Comparison of means, ANOVA, post hoc Tukey, and effect size were used to explore the differences in outcomes across time periods. Findings Pre-pandemic, women served by the FEM model reported significantly higher rates of trust and respect (p&lt;0Â·001) compared to the NoM model, and significantly higher rates of trust (p&lt;0Â·001) compared to MAM. During the pandemic, in the FEM model, the experiences of respect and trust did not change significantly from the pre-pandemic rates, and were significantly higher than both the MAM and NoM models (p &lt; 0Â·001). Additionally, during the pandemic, women served by the FEM model had the lowest experience of COVID fear (p&lt;0Â·001). Interpretation Fully enabled midwifery in midwifery centers had a significantly positive effect on womanâs experience of respect and trust in care compared to the other models, even in the context of a pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4310529664,"Objective To analyze the pregnancy outcomes of patients with cervical lesions treated by cold-knife conization (CKC). Methods Clinical data of healthy pregnant women and pregnant women who underwent CKC in Dalian Women and Childrenâs Medical Group from March 2010 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into a CKC group and a control group according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Statistical methods were used to compare pregnancy and delivery outcomes between the two groups. Results There were 400 patients in CKC group and control group, with 200 patients in each. There was no significant difference in the mode of delivery, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, in-hospital perinatal management, and cervical cerclage between the CKC group and the control group ( P &gt;0.05). The rates of preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, and neonatal admission in the CKC group were higher than those in the control group ( P &lt;0.05). In the CKC group, the incidence of premature rupture of membranes within six months postoperatively was higher than that after six months ( P &lt;0.05). The incidences of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes were not completely consistent in different conization ranges ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion CKC increases the incidence of preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, and neonatal adverse outcomes. Conization height can predict the occurrence of preterm delivery. Delaying pregnancy after surgery can reduce the incidence of adverse outcomes during the perinatal period."

A cross-sectional study was carried out that included the response of an online questionnaire. The data were collected from April 30 to September 26, 2021. To assess the different associations between variables to be measured, we fit Poisson regression models with robust variance.Responses were obtained from 3,850 adults from the general population group and 502 health professionals. Of the overall sample, 48.6% of participants from the general population were vaccinated against COVID-19, whereas in the healthcare professionals, 94.8% were vaccinated. The prevalence of general population vaccination increased with age, and was higher in women than men. Most participants did not show a preference for any vaccine itself. However, the prevalence of people vaccinated with their preferred vaccine was higher for the ones vaccinated with Pfizer's vaccine. 6.5% of the general population reported being reticent to be vaccinated. People from younger age groups, people with lower educational levels and those who were not from a risk group showed greater reluctance to be vaccinated. No gender differences in reluctancy were found.Health professionals were significantly less likely to refuse vaccination even though they had more doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. On the other hand, younger people, those with a lower level of education and those who were not from a risk group were the most hesitant."

An interview questionnaire was used to collect data on intention, desire, HIV Stigma Scale items, and HIV status. Dyadic fertility intention was examined using the actor-partner interdependence mediation model, based on the Traits-Desires-Intentions-Behavior framework.The husbands' or wives' internalized stigma had significant negative effects on their own fertility desire (Î² = -0.149, p<0.05 and Î² = -0.238, p<0.01, respectively). HIV-positive status of the husbands was weakly linked to their own fertility intention (Î² = -0.181, p<0.05). Husbands' perceived provider stigma was associated with their own and their wives' fertility intention via the mediating effect of their fertility desire (Î² = -0.374, p<0.001 and Î² = -0.203, p<0.01, respectively). The cumulative influence of their reproductive desire mediated the husband's perceived provider stigma and the wife's internalized stigma on their fertility intention.Stigma and HIV status were associated with fertility intention among couples living with HIV, mediated by fertility desire. The high intra-couple correlation suggested that counseling should be conducted when both spouses are present together with extensive discussions on concerns regarding HIV-related stigma, potential discrepancies between each partner's fertility desire and intention, and the influence of one partner on the other."

In Sapporo City University in Japan, 37 assessment items of the OSCE were configured as ""Overall,"" with 17 items as midwifery's normal delivery preparation (Part 1) and 20 items as midwifery's normal delivery assistance (Part 2). All students had attended lectures with textbooks. The first and second OSCEs were conducted before and after the clinical training, respectively. The scores of 54 students were retrospectively analyzed over 6 years (2014-2019). The results of the first and second OSCEs were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test, Fisher's exact test, and analysis of variance. The mean scores for ""Overall"" [0-37], ""Part 1"" [0-17], and ""Part 2"" [0-20] in the second OSCEs were significantly higher than those in the first OSCE (Overall: 22.7 vs 19.3, Part 1: 9.50 vs 7.71, Part 2: 13.2 vs 11.6, p<0.05, respectively). Regarding ""Overall"" and ""Part 1,"" a positive correlation was observed between the first and second OSCEs, wherein the full scores of ""Part 1,"" converted from 17 to 20 points to match the full scores of ""Part 2,"" were significantly lower than those of Part 2 (p<0.05, respectively). There was a positive correlation between the scores of the first and second OSCEs in ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" (p<0.05). The scores increased between the two OSCEs, and participants could objectively grasp the knowledge and skills. The OSCEs conducted twice were useful in skilling-up the normal delivery preparation and assistance skills of midwifery students. However, developing an advanced educational method might be necessary for the midwifery students' preparation of normal delivery, because the scores in the OSCEs were lower."

Three hundred and twenty-eight weaned calves (237 Â± 29.7 kg of BW) were randomly assigned to a 2 Ã 2 Ã 2 nested factorial design: conditioning, conditioned (C) or non-conditioned (N); rest, 0 (R0) or 8 (R8) h, and post-rest transport, 4 (T4) or 15 (T15) h. Calves were sampled before (LO1) and after (UN1) the initial 20-h journey, before (LO2) and after (UN2) the additional 4 or 15-h journey, and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, and 28 d after UN2. Data was analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Fixed effects included conditioning, transport, and time nested within rest period, while random effects included animal and pen. Greater shrink (p < 0.01) was observed in C than N calves after the initial 20-h transport. During the first week after transportation, the mean ADG of N calves was greater than C calves (p < 0.01). From d 14 to d 28, however, the mean ADG of C calves was greater than N calves (p < 0.01). Flight speed, cortisol and L-lactate concentrations were greater (p â¤ 0.05) in C than N calves between LO1 and d 5, while greater (p â¤ 0.02) non-esterified fatty acids, creatine kinase, serum amyloid-A, and haptoglobin concentrations were observed in N than C calves between LO1 and d 3. The R8-T4 calves had greater (p < 0.01) ADG than R8-T15 calves between LO1 and d 5. The R0-T4 calves had greater L-lactate concentrations than R0-T15 and R8-T4 calves (both p = 0.02) on d 1. The R0 calves had greater (p < 0.01) ADG than R8 calves between 14 and 28 d.

Data were obtained from a sample of 2,702 third and fourth grade students from 16 elementary schools in Taiwan and 9 schools in China. A self-administered questionnaire was used. The mental state of the children who participated in the study was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), while mobile gaming addiction was assessed using the short form of the Internet Gaming Disorders Scale (IGDS9-SF). The results showed that about 54% of children played mobile games with others (multi-player), while 31% played mobile games alone, and 15% did not play mobile games. Multiple logistic regression results indicated that behaviors such as participating in multi-player games, playing violent games, a poor parent-child relationship, and living in a rural area were associated with a greater risk of mobile gaming addiction. Involvement in multi-player games, playing violent games, mobile gaming addiction, and exposure to mobile violence/pornography were associated with greater risks of cyber aggression/victimization. Multiple regression results showed that being a multi-player, playing violent games, mobile gaming addiction, exposure to violence/pornography, exposure to cyber aggression/victimization, and having a poor parent-child relationship were associated with emotional and behavioral problems."
https://openalex.org/W4310504298,"Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was definitively authorized in France in 2017 after a two-year probationary period. The fact that the estimated number of MSM eligible for PrEP is still unknown is a barrier to this prevention toolâs roll-out at the national level. This study aimed to estimate the number of MSM eligible for PrEP in France, and to evaluate the direct cost of its roll-out. Methods We used data from several sources including the EnquÃªte Rapport au Sexe 2019-ERAS 2019 survey, the 2019 French population census from National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies ( INSEE) , and the National Public Health Agencyâs ( SantÃ© Publique France ) 2016 health barometer survey. We also used data from previous studies which estimated the proportion of MSM who were sexually active in the 12 months prior to the studies, and HIV prevalence in MSM in France. Furthermore, we used data on PrEP drug costs from the French public drug database and data on medical examinations costs from the IPERGAY study. Results For 2019, the number of HIV seronegative MSM in France who were sexually active in the previous 12 months was estimated at 398,015. Of these, 142,379 (95%CI: 139,893â145,241) and 104,645 (95%IC: 102311â106979) were eligible for PrEP, based on the Menza score and on official French criteria, respectively. The overall estimated cost of PrEP roll-out in eligible MSM varied between â¬ 317,685,216 and â¬ 545,903,216 for official French criteria, which was higher than the estimated â¬432,240,851 and â¬742,753,074 according to the Menza score. Conclusions Our estimations will enable policy makers to make evidence-based decisions about PrEP roll-out to MSM in France. To accelerate the process, it is important to decentralize PrEP delivery, authorize general practitioners to write prescriptions, and promote this prevention tool through information campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W4310504332,"Street-level crime maps are publicly available online in England and Wales. However, there was initial resistance to the publication of such fine-grained crime statistics, which can lower house prices and increase insurance premiums in high crime neighbourhoods. Identifying the causal effect of public crime statistics is difficult since crime statistics generally mirror actual crime. To address this question empirically, we would ideally experiment and introduce a source of random variation in the crime statistics. For instance, we could randomly increase or decrease the number of offences displayed in crime statistics and measure their effects on local house prices. For obvious reasons, we cannot pursue this research design. However, street-level crime maps contain intentional errors, which are the product of a geomasking algorithm designed to mask the location of crimes and protect the identity of victims. This project leverages features associated with the geomasking algorithm to estimate the effect of public crime statistics on house prices."
https://openalex.org/W4310521387,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is related to the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD); it is an independent risk factor for stroke and is also prevalent post-stroke. Furthermore, heart rate corrected QT (QTc) is an important predictor of the risk of arrhythmia and CVD. Thus, we aimed to investigate QTc interval variations in different sleep stages in OSA patients and whether nocturnal QTc intervals differ between OSA patients with and without stroke history. 18 OSA patients (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)â¥15) with previously diagnosed stroke and 18 OSA patients (AHIâ¥15) without stroke history were studied. Subjects underwent full polysomnography including an electrocardiogram measured by modified lead II configuration. RR, QT, and QTc intervals were calculated in all sleep stages. Regression analysis was utilized to investigate possible confounding effects of sleep stages and stroke history on QTc intervals. Compared to patients without previous stroke history, QTc intervals were significantly higher (Î² = 34, p &lt;0.01) in patients with stroke history independent of age, sex, body mass index, and OSA severity. N3 sleep (Î² = 5.8, p &lt;0.01) and REM sleep (Î² = 2.8, p &lt;0.01) increased QTc intervals in both patient groups. In addition, QTc intervals increased progressively ( p &lt;0.05) towards deeper sleep in both groups; however, the magnitude of changes compared to the wake stage was significantly higher ( p &lt;0.05) in patients with stroke history. The findings of this study indicate that especially in deeper sleep, OSA patients with a previous stroke have an elevated risk for QTc prolongation further increasing the risk for ventricular arrhythmogenicity and sudden cardiac death."
https://openalex.org/W4310521689,"Conventional passive tracking methods for underwater acoustic targets in sonar engineering generate time azimuth histogram and use it as a basis for target azimuth and tracking. Passive underwater acoustic targets only have azimuth information on the time azimuth histogram, which is easy to be lost and disturbed by ocean noise. To improve the accuracy of passive tracking, we propose to adopt the processed multi-beam Low Frequency Analysis and Recording (LOFAR) as the dataset for passive tracking. In this paper, an improved LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model (CNN) model is used to identify targets, and a passive tracking method for underwater acoustic targets based on multi-beam LOFAR and deep learning is proposed, combined with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to improve the tracking accuracy. The performance of the method under realistic conditions is evaluated through simulation analysis and validation using data obtained from marine experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4310522098,"In the US, incidence and mortality from cervical cancer disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities and low-income women. Despite affordable access to primary and secondary prevention measures at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening rates are low, suggesting the presence of non-financial barriers to uptake in this population. This explanatory sequential mixed-methods study sought to explore factors that influence the acceptability of cervical cancer prevention services among parents and legal guardians of vaccine-eligible girls attending an urban FQHC and to assess social influences related to cervical cancer prevention. Participants included eight mothers, one father, and two grandparents/legal guardians. Nine participants self-identified as Black/Afro-Caribbean, or African American, two as Latinx, and one as Native American. The quantitative data suggested discordance between participantsâ cervical cancer prevention knowledge and their practices. Most indicated that their daughters had received the HPV vaccine but were unsure about HPV transmission modes. Qualitative data revealed that participants were comfortable disclosing information on HPV infection and vaccination status, and most women were likely to share information related to cervical cancer testing and diagnosis. Few comments indicated personal stigma on the part of participants, but there was frequent expression of perceived public stigma (shaming and blaming women), gender differences (men are indifferent to risk), and distrust of the healthcare system. Findings highlight several concepts including the disharmony between knowledge and practice, prevalent perceived public stigma, cumbersome attitudes on the part of men regarding HPV and cervical cancer, and distrust of the healthcare system."

Methods We used weighted survey data from the 2016â2018 PNG Demographic and Health Survey (PNGDHS). A weighted sample of 3,822 women who were breastfeeding during the survey were included in the study. The outcome variable in the present study is current cigarette smoking. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between current cigarette smoking status and socio-demographic and economic variables of breastfeeding women. The regression analysis results were reported using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results From the weighted sample, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among breastfeeding women was 21.9%; of which 60.8% smoked daily. The mean number of cigarettes smoked in the last 24 hours preceding the survey was 6.05(SD = 5.99). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that breastfeeding women who were from the Momase (aOR: 2.337, CI: 1.786â3.058, p&lt;0.001) and Highlands (AOR: 1.589, CI: 1.213â2.082, p = 0.001), had no religious affiliation (aOR: 3.665, CI: 1.235â10.877, p = 0.019), and households with daughters as household heads (aOR: 1.901, CI: 1.231â2.935, p = 0.004) and being in more than one union (aOR: 2.374, CI: 1.805â3.123, p&lt;0.001) were significantly more likely to smoke cigarette compared to women from southern region, those affiliated to Anglican church, those with husband as household heads, and being in one union respectively. Conclusion Cigarette smoking among breastfeeding women in PNG is relatively high, and region of residence, religion, relationship to household head, and the number of unions remain independent predictors. Interventions should target the individual socio-economic and cultural contexts within which breastfeeding occurs."

In this study, we investigated whether the ginsenoside protopanaxadiol relieves chloroquine-induced retinopathy by restoring lysosomotropic abnormalities in human adult retinal pigment epithelial-19 cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Morphological alterations in autophagosomes of adult retinal pigment epithelial-19 cells was detected using confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry, whereas cellular reactive oxygen species levels were determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2'-7'-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate. Lysosomal function was assessed by measuring lysosomal pH and enzyme activity. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting analyses were performed. Adult retinal pigment epithelial-19 cells accumulated autophagosomes with fusion defects in lysosomes and reactive oxygen species formation following exposure to chloroquine. This effect trapped Beclin-1 and B-cell lymphoma 2 interfering with autophagy initiation and autophagosome development. Protopanaxadiol alleviated chloroquine-induced toxicity by modulating the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2, which was mediated by the AMP-activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin signal axis. Furthermore, autophagy and apoptosis were simultaneously controlled by protopanaxadiol via upregulation of autophagy flux and decreased reactive oxygen species formation and apoptotic protein expression. These findings suggest that protopanaxadiol is a promising treatment strategy for chloroquine-mediated retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W4310529584,"Studies focused on jumping performance in humans have so far investigated either its biological or sociocultural significance, with very little attentions paid to the inseparable relations of these two aspects in daily life of people. Integrating both ethnographic and biomechanical methods, this research investigated the biosocial features of the jump performance of Maasai youth in its most well observed context, the wedding ceremony. Ethnographic data were used to explain the social status of participants, the physical movements and singing tempo of performers, and their interactions. Biomechanical methods were applied to assess the heights and frequencies of identified repetitive double-legged vertical jumps (n = 160, from 15 male youths). All youth performers followed a certain posture pattern, paying specific attention to their final landing. Large variations exist in their jumping heights [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.237]; however, the frequency in jump repetitions were maintained with the least variations (CV = 0.084). Cheering interactions were confirmed, but with no significant difference in height between the cheered and non-cheered groups. These results indicate that the Maasai youths did not compete for jump height during local ceremonies. Rather, they emphasized the rhythmical retention of jumps, corresponding to other youth mates who were singing alongside. In the broader context of human behaviors, the analysis addresses the diverse meanings of motor performances in different daily contexts that reject the generalized sports regime of âhigher/faster-the-betterâ."
https://openalex.org/W4310529599,"Multiple Quaternary glacial refugia in the Iberian Peninsula, commonly known as ""refugia within refugia"", allowed diverging populations to come into contact and admix, potentially boosting substantial mito-nuclear discordances. In this study, we employ a comprehensive set of mitochondrial and nuclear markers to shed light onto the drivers of geographical differentiation in Iberian high mountain populations of the midwife toads Alytes obstetricans and A. almogavarii from the Pyrenees, Picos de Europa and Guadarrama Mountains. In the three analysed mountain regions, we detected evidence of extensive mito-nuclear discordances and/or admixture between taxa. Clustering analyses identified three major divergent lineages in the Pyrenees (corresponding to the eastern, central and central-western Pyrenees), which possibly recurrently expanded and admixed during the succession of glacial-interglacial periods that characterised the Late Pleistocene, and that currently follow a ring-shaped diversification pattern. On the other hand, populations from the Picos de Europa mountains (NW Iberian Peninsula) showed a mitochondrial affinity to central-western Pyrenean populations and a nuclear affinity to populations from the central Iberian Peninsula, suggesting a likely admixed origin for Picos de Europa populations. Finally, populations from the Guadarrama Mountain Range (central Iberian Peninsula) were depleted of genetic diversity, possibly as a consequence of a recent epidemic of chytridiomycosis. This work highlights the complex evolutionary history that shaped the current genetic composition of high mountain populations, and underscores the importance of using a multilocus approach to better infer the dynamics of population divergence."
https://openalex.org/W4310529603,"Simulation is a learner-centered practice that helps develop and maintain knowledge, skills, and competencies. This study evaluated the effect of neonatal resuscitation simulation-based education for medical students in the fifth year (part of the regular clinical clerkship program) on the perceived performance of their technical and non-technical skills. In addition, we analyzed the difference between instructor's and learners' evaluations of technical skills after the simulation. A one-group pretest-posttest design was adopted. The simulation-based education of the neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) was conducted for 40 medical students from July to November 2020 at a medical school in South Korea. The simulation-based education comprised 5 minutes of pre-briefing, 10 minutes of running the simulation, and 30 minutes of debriefing (using a recorded video). The perceived performance of students' technical and non-technical skills before and after the simulation was compared by collecting and analyzing the pre- and post-questionnaires. The perceived performance of technical (p = .001) and non-technical skills (p < .001) was found to have significantly increased after the simulation. Particularly, the performance of technical skills, such as diagnostic (p = .007) and therapeutic actions (p < .001) and non-technical skills, such as leadership (p < .001), teamwork (p = .001), and task management (p = .020) improved significantly. There was no significant difference in the evaluations of the technical performance of the instructor and learners after the simulation (p = .953). Simulation-based education can improve technical skills, such as diagnostic and therapeutic actions for neonatal resuscitation. It is also effective in enhancing non-technical skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and task management. Further, after the simulation-based education, students can fully self-evaluate through objective reflection and improve their clinical competency."
https://openalex.org/W4310529613,"The human brain networks responsible for selectively listening to a voice amid other talkers remain to be clarified. The present study aimed to investigate relationships between cortical activity and performance in a speech-in-speech task, before (Experiment I) and after training-induced improvements (Experiment II). In Experiment I, 74 participants performed a speech-in-speech task while their cortical activity was measured using a functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. One target talker and one masker talker were simultaneously presented at three different target-to-masker ratios (TMRs): adverse, intermediate and favorable. Behavioral results show that performance may increase monotonically with TMR in some participants and failed to decrease, or even improved, in the adverse-TMR condition for others. On the neural level, an extensive brain network including the frontal (left prefrontal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior frontal gyri) and temporal (bilateral auditory cortex) regions was more solicited by the intermediate condition than the two others. Additionally, bilateral frontal gyri and left auditory cortex activities were found to be positively correlated with behavioral performance in the adverse-TMR condition. In Experiment II, 27 participants, whose performance was the poorest in the adverse-TMR condition of Experiment I, were trained to improve performance in that condition. Results show significant performance improvements along with decreased activity in bilateral inferior frontal gyri, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the left inferior parietal cortex and the right auditory cortex in the adverse-TMR condition after training. Arguably, lower neural activity reflects higher efficiency in processing masker inhibition after speech-in-speech training. As speech-in-noise tasks also imply frontal and temporal regions, we suggest that regardless of the type of masking (speech or noise) the complexity of the task will prompt the implication of a similar brain network. Furthermore, the initial significant cognitive recruitment will be reduced following a training leading to an economy of cognitive resources."
https://openalex.org/W4310529693,"A potential treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is to biochemically alter the mechanical properties of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) through Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) injection. The purpose of this study was to determine the time- and dose-dependent effects of CCH injection on TCL elastic modulus and thickness. Nine TCLs were dissected from cadaveric hands for this study. CCH doses of 50U, 100U, 150U, 200U, and 250U were injected into five points on the TCL, respectively. B-mode and shear wave elastography images were taken of each injection point using robot-assisted ultrasound imaging immediately after injection, as well as 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after injection. TCL thickness and mean shear wave speed were measured for each CCH dose at each time point. CCH doses of 200U and 250U decreased shear wave speed by 18.70% and 30.01% (p<0.05), respectively, after 24 hours. CCH doses of 150U, 200U, and 250U decreased TCL thickness by 7.28%, 10.97%, and 14.92%, respectively, after 24 hours (p<0.05). Our findings suggest that CCH injection may be effective in degrading TCL tissue, with higher doses of CCH resulting in greater tissue degradation up to 24 hours after injection."
https://openalex.org/W4311068977,"Introduction Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is characterized by involuntary urine leakage immediately after reporting of sudden, compelling desire to void. Electrostimulation and non-invasive neuromodulation have been considered as the first and third line of UUI treatment but there is a lack of consensus on which parameters are more efficient. Thus, this study aims to compare the effect of low versus medium frequency currents on urinary incontinence severity and quality of life in women with UUI complains. Methods It will be a randomized controlled trial with 5 arms, double-blinded (outcome assessor and statistician). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 11479119.9.0000.5406) and has been prospectively registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-8bkkp6). Concerning, double-blind process, the blinded assessor will be responsible for evaluate primary and secondary outcomes at baseline and follow-up without information about allocation and the statistician will perform analyses without information about group codification. One hundred and five participants will be randomized to receive: (1) Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation-low frequency, (2) Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation-high frequency, (3) Aussie median frequency, (4) Interferencial median frequency or (5) High voltage stimulation. The application will be performed during 20 sessions of 45-minutes, twice a week for 10 weeks, in groups of maximum 5 participants. The participants will be evaluated before treatment (baseline- 0 week), during the treatment (5 weeks) and after the last treatment session (10 weeks). The primary outcomes measures will be UI severity and quality of life, and the secondary outcome will be pelvic floor strength. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). The variables will be described by the mean and 95% confidence interval. The distribution of normality will be analyzed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. ANOVA for repeated measures will be performed. Mauchlyâs test the hypothesis of sphericity and when if this violated the hypotheses, the analyses will be based on the Greenhouse-Geisser test. Peer-to-peer comparisons will be performed using the Bonferroni Post-Hoc test. The significant level adopted will be 5% (p â¤ 0.05). Conclusion This study will enhance knowledge about effect of different neuromodulation currents in the improvement of UUI."
https://openalex.org/W4311069001,"Background The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) with direct-acting antivirals has undergone a spectacular revolution and added significant value to healthcare systems and patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency and value of Sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens for a target population of 85,959 chronic HCV patients treated in Spain during 2015â2019, compared to previous therapeutic strategies (peginterferon/ and ribavirin in double/triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir). Methods A previously developed lifetime Markov model was adapted to simulate the disease HCV evolution. In SOF-based regimens, all patients (100%) were treated regardless with sustained virological response (SVR) of 93â98%, obtained from real-world data. In previous therapeutic, only â¥F2 patients were treated according to clinical practice (38%) with an average SVR of 61% taken from published literature. The value was measured as clinical and economic impact in terms of avoided HCV-related mortality and liver complications; total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) applying an annual 3% discount rate. Results Compared to previous therapeutic, during lifetime, SOF-based regimens reduced decompensated cirrhosis by 89%, hepatocellular carcinoma by 77% and liver transplant by 84%, decreasing the cost associated to liver complications management in â¬770 million. SOF-based regimens also decreased liver-related mortality by 82%. Besides, SOF-based regimens gained 310,765/QALYs, saving â¬274 million (considering drugs, monitoring, and HCV management). Conclusion For Spain, SOF-based regimens offer value for HCV patients in terms of lowering HCV-related liver disease burden and generating significant cost savings for the health system, contributing to the WHO goal."
https://openalex.org/W4311069036,"Increasing the number of physicians per population may improve the quality of medical services, but there are few reports on this aspect in the field of surgery. This study aimed to examine whether the number of physicians is associated with the number of nighttime emergency surgeries, which may be one of the indicators of the quality of medical services in the field of surgery.This was a prefecture-based ecological study utilizing open data from Japanese government surveys conducted between 2015 and 2019. The relationship between the number of physicians and the number of nighttime emergency surgeries in 47 prefectures of Japan was evaluated by correlation analysis and panel data regression analysis. The correlation analysis was conducted between the number of physicians per 100,000 population and the number of nighttime emergency surgeries per 100,000 population per year in each prefecture in Japan. In the panel data regression analysis, panel data of the prefectures in Japan from 2015 to 2019 were created. We evaluated whether the number of physicians was related to the number of nighttime emergency surgeries, independent of the number of acute care beds per 100,000 population, population density, and the elderly population ratio.From the correlation analysis, the correlation coefficient between the number of physicians per 100,000 population and the number of nighttime emergency surgeries per 100,000 population was 0.533 (P < 0.001). In the panel data regression analysis, there was a significant association between the number of physicians per 100,000 population and the number of nighttime emergency surgeries per 100,000 population (P < 0.001). The regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) for the number of physicians per 100,000 population was 0.246 (0.113-0.378).The number of physicians is associated with the number of nighttime emergency surgeries."
