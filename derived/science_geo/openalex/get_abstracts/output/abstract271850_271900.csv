https://openalex.org/W2166390717,"The degree of herbivory and the effectiveness of defense varies widely among plant species. Resource availability in the environment is proposed as the major determinant of both the amount and type of plant defense. When resource are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses. Leaf lifetime, also determined by resource availability, affects the relative advantages of defenses with different turnover rates. Relative limitation of different resources also constrains the types of defenses. The proposals are compared with other theories on the evolution of plant defenses."

We will recognize the symbolic and social meanings of environments, not just their economic utility; we will emphasize their historical significance as well as the future generations that will use them. At the same time, we must realize that there are things we may not want to trade at all, except in the sense of letting someone else have his share of the environment also. As environments become more differentiated, smaller areas will probably be given greater significance, and it may be possible for more groups to have a share. It is likely that we shall want to apply our technology to the creation of artificial environments. It may be possible to create environments that are evocative of other environments in other times and places. It is possible that, by manipulating memory through the rewriting of history, environments will come to have new meaning. Finally, we may want to create proxy environments by means of substitution and simulation. In order to create substitutes, we must endow new objects with significance by means of advertising and by social practice. Sophistication about differentiation will become very important for appreciating the substitute environments. We may simulate the environment by means of photographs, recordings, models, and perhaps even manipulations in the brain (48). What we experience in natural environments may actually be more controllable than we imagine (49). Artificial prairies and wildernesses have been created, and there is no reason to believe that these artificial environments need be unsatisfactory for those who experience them. Rare environments are relative, can be created, are dependent on our knowledge, and are a function of policy, not only tradition. It seems likely that economic arguments will not be sufficient to preserve environments or to suggest how we can create new ones. Rather, conscious choice about what matters, and then a financial and social investment in an effort to create significant experiences and environments, will become a policy alternative available to us. What's wrong with plastic trees? My guess is that there is very little wrong with them. Much more can be done with plastic trees and the like (50) to give most people the feeling that they are experiencing nature. We will have to realize that the way in which we experience nature is conditioned by our society-which more and more is seen to be receptive to responsible interventions. Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, was very concerned about the uses of the dead to the living and suggested (51): If a country gentleman have rows of trees leading to his dwelling, the autoicons [embalmed bodies in an upright position] of his family might alternate with the trees; copal varnish would protect the face from the effects of rain-caoutchouc [rubber] the habiliments."

This constitutes the first direct observations of microorganisms on ore fines."

Struvite may have precipitated from evaporating seawater on the primitive earth, and may have been important for prebiotic phosphorylation."

The technique is taxonomically applicable since it makes an important but usually neglected floral character readily demonstrable."
https://openalex.org/W1985367380,"Plants of Saxifraga oppositifolia (Saxifragaceae) possess metabolic adaptations that allow them to grow successfully in polar desert microenvironments. Net photosynthesis (net carbon uptake) continues to be positive during drought until the leaf water stress declines to the range of -21 to -29 bars, which is considerably below the nonstress range of 0 to -10 bars. The plants can survive leaf water stresses of at least -44 bars in the field and leaf water stresses of -55 bars in a growth chamber."
https://openalex.org/W2052054216,"Pheromone-releasing females of the closely related noctuid moths Trichoplusia ni and Autographa californica attract mainly males of their own species. Sex-pheromone-concentration specificity appears to be an important reproductive isolating mechanism for these two species. Apparently, both species utilize the same pheromone, cis-7-dodecenyl acetate, for mating communication, but T. ni utilizes a higher level than does A. californica. Traps releasing amounts of cis-7-dodecenyl acetate that are highly attractive for males of one of the species catch very few males of the other species."

https://openalex.org/W2061909893,"We describe a method for the determination of the gravity potential of Venus from multiple-frequency radar measurements. The method is based on the strong frequency dependence of the absorption of radio waves in Venus' atmosphere. Comparison of the differing radar reflection intensities at several frequencies yields the height of the surface relative to a reference pressure contour; combination with measurements of round-trip echo delays allows the pressure, and hence the gravity potential contour, to be mapped relative to the mean planet radius. Since calibration data from other frequencies are unavailable, the absorption-sensitive Haystack Observatory data have been analyzed under the assumption of uniform surface reflectivity to yield a gravity equipotential contour for the equatorial region and a tentative upper bound of 6 x 10(-4) on the fractional difference of Venus' principal equatorial moments of inertia. The minima in the equipotential contours appear to be associated with topographic minima."
