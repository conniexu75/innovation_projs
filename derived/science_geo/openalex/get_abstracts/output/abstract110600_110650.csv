https://openalex.org/W1583940462,"Peroxidation of the lipid moieties of low density lipoproteins (LDL) is regarded as an early event in atherogenesis. Because bilirubin is a physiological reductant with antioxidant activities, we investigated its inhibitory action on the radical-mediated oxidation of LDL and plasma lipids. Exposing fresh human blood plasma to lipophilic peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN) resulted in rapid oxidation of ubiquinol-10, followed by that of ascorbate and bilirubin. Plasma lipids were well protected from peroxidation as long as these three antioxidants were present, as assessed by the amounts of cholesterylester hydroperoxides formed during this period. Following consumption of these antioxidants, and in the presence of alpha-tocopherol, the rate of hydroperoxide formation increased sharply with roughly 2 molecules of cholesterylester hydroperoxides being formed for each peroxidation initiating event. Supplementation of AMVN-oxidizing plasma with exogenous bilirubin at the onset of rapid lipid peroxidation, i.e. after depletion of endogenous ubiquinol-10, ascorbate, and bilirubin, led to a halt in both hydroperoxide formation and consumption of alpha-tocopherol. When isolated LDL was incubated with AMVN, approximately 9 molecules of cholesterylester hydroperoxides were formed per peroxidation initiating event and while alpha-tocopherol was consumed. Addition of free or albumin-bound bilirubin to isolated LDL at the onset of oxidation resulted in a strong inhibition of hydroperoxide formation and alpha-tocopherol consumption, the effect being more pronounced with the free pigment. Addition of the corresponding amounts of albumin alone was without effect. In the presence of albumin-bound bilirubin, some 30% of the pigment was initially converted into biliverdin, whereas formation of this oxidation product was not observed with the free pigment. Also, the presence of bilirubin oxidase partially reversed the inhibitory activity of bilirubin on AMVN-induced LDL oxidation in the absence but not presence of albumin. An attenuation of hydroperoxide formation and a temporary increase in LDL's alpha-tocopherol concentration were observed when free- or albumin-bound bilirubin were added to AMVN-oxidizing, alpha-tocopherol-containing LDL. In contrast, hydroperoxide formation was not inhibited significantly when the albumin-bound pigment was added to oxidizing LDL after complete consumption of its alpha-tocopherol. Our results show that bilirubin inhibits oxidation of LDL lipids initiated within the lipoprotein core and indicate that this activity is mediated by interaction of the pigment with LDL's alpha-tocopherol."

https://openalex.org/W1479965447,"The effects of cadmium on estrogen receptor and other estrogen-regulated genes in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were studied. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 microM cadmium decreased the level of estrogen receptor 58%. Cadmium induced a parallel decrease in estrogen receptor mRNA (62%). Progesterone receptor levels increased 3.2-fold after cadmium treatment. This induction was blocked by the anti-estrogen ICI-164,384. Progesterone receptor mRNA was also increased by cadmium, as well as cathepsin D mRNA. An in vitro nuclear transcription run-on assay showed that cadmium increased the transcription of the progesterone receptor and pS2 genes and decreased transcription of the estrogen receptor gene. These are not general effects of heavy metals, as zinc, 25 and 100 microM, did not affect progesterone receptor protein and mRNA levels. Cadmium stimulated pS2 and progesterone receptor mRNAs in a clone of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the human estrogen receptor, but had no effect in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with antisense estrogen receptor. Cadmium also stimulated an estrogen response element in transient transfection experiments. These data suggest that the effects of cadmium are mediated by the estrogen receptor independent of estradiol. In addition to its effect on gene expression, cadmium induced the growth of MCF-7 cells 5.6-fold."

https://openalex.org/W1518868828,"We have immunologically identified the isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) present in neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes and examined their regulation by hormones and phorbol ester. Both cell types express the Ca(2+)-dependent alpha-PKC and the Ca(2+)-independent epsilon- and delta-PKC isoforms. The atypical zeta-PKC isoform is also expressed in neonatal, but only weakly in adult cells. Stimulation of the alpha 1-adrenergic or purinergic receptor with phenylephrine or ATP, respectively, increases membrane-associated immunoreactivity of both epsilon- and delta-PKC in neonatal and adult cells; endothelin and carbachol are also effective in adult cells. In contrast, none of the agonists leads to increases in membrane-associated alpha-PKC in cardiomyocytes. PKC zeta is also unaffected by receptor stimulation. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate causes redistribution and subsequently down-regulation of alpha-, epsilon-, and delta- but not zeta-PKC. The three isoforms are down-regulated at distinctively different rates, with alpha-PKC being the most rapid and epsilon-PKC the slowest. We used selective down-regulation of alpha-, epsilon-, and delta-PKC to investigate the role of these isoforms in PKC phosphorylation-dependent events in neonatal myocytes. Our findings suggest that epsilon-PKC is responsible for the phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS, an endogenous PKC-specific substrate. In contrast, agonist-induced c-fos expression is unlikely to be mediated by epsilon-PKC since the response is rapidly down-regulated and apparently Ca(2+)-dependent. Our finding that the PKC isoforms are differentially responsive to neurohormones suggests that they play distinct and specific roles in cardiac function."

https://openalex.org/W2137033600,"PLECKSTRIN1, the major protein kinase C substrate of platelets, contains domains of about 100 amino acids at the amino and carboxy termini that have been found in a number of proteins, including serine/threonine kinases, GTPase-activating proteins, phospholipases and cytoskeletal proteins2–5. These conserved sequences, termed pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, are thought to be involved in signal transduction. But the details of the function and binding partners of the PH domains have not been characterized. Here we report the solution structure of the N-terminal pleckstrin-homology domain of pleckstrin determined using heteronuclear three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure consists of an up-and-down β-barrel of seven antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal amphiphilic α-helix that caps one end of the barrel. The overall topology of the domain is similar to that of the retinol-binding protein family of structures6–10"
https://openalex.org/W1578627625,"A truncated motor domain of the alpha subunit of Drosophila kinesin was obtained by expression in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in the presence of MgATP. This domain (designated DKH340) extends from the N terminus to amino acid 340. The isolated protein contains a stoichiometric level of tightly bound ADP and has a low basal rate of ATP hydrolysis of 0.029 +/- 0.002 s-1 in the absence of microtubules. The rate of release of bound ADP is 0.026 +/- 0.003 s-1. The approximate equality of the ADP release rate and the steady state ATPase rate indicates that ADP release is the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis in the absence of microtubules. The rate of ATP hydrolysis is stimulated 3000 fold-by addition of microtubules (MT) (kcat = 80 s-1; KMT0.5,ATPase = 160 nM for half-saturation of the ATPase rate by microtubules at saturating ATP levels; KMT0.5ATPase = 43 microns for half-saturation of the ATPase rate by ATP at saturating microtubule levels). Binding of DKH340 to MTs is biphasic in the presence of adenosine 5-(beta-gamma-imido)t-riphosphate. One DKH340 binds tightly per tubulin heterodimer, but greater than one DKH340/tubulin heterodimer can be bound at higher ratios of DKH340/microtubules. In the presence of MgATP, KMT0.5,Binding for physical binding of DKH340 to microtubules is weaker than KMT0.5,ATPase for stimulation of hydrolysis. These results are consistent with a model in which DKH340 cycles on and off the microtubule during hydrolysis of each ATP molecule. For this model, the kcat/KMT0.5,ATPase ratio of 5 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 is at least as large as the bimolecular rate constant for association with microtubules, and this value approaches the diffusion controlled limit. Nucleotide-free DKH340 can be produced by gel filtration in the absence of Mg2+, but it reforms tightly bound ADP slowly in the presence of MgATP (t1/2 > or = 10 min), and thus it is likely to be in a conformational state which is not produced during steady state ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1498270936,"The objective of this study has been to delineate the side-specific effects of Na+ and K+ on the transport kinetics of tissue-specific Na/K pumps. Two experimental systems have been used. In one, Na/K pumps of exogenous microsomal membrane sources (rat axolemma, kidney) were delivered by membrane fusion into dog erythrocytes, and in the other, the three isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the rat enzyme were individually transfected into HeLa cells as in previous studies (Jewell, E.A., and Lingrel, J. B (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16925-16930), with the alpha 2 and alpha 3 isoforms rendered relatively resistant to ouabain by site-directed mutagenesis. Whereas the kidney microsomes comprise the alpha 1 catalytic isoform, the axolemma microsomes were predominantly alpha 3 (approximately 60%) with lesser amounts of alpha 2 (approximately 25%) and alpha 1 (approximately 15%) as measured by the ouabain-sensitive profile of phosphoenzyme as well as by immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies using membranes of known specific activity as standards (alpha 1 of kidney, alpha 1 and alpha 2 of muscle). Both systems were analyzed with respect to the effects of varying concentrations of cytoplasmic Na+ and extracellular K+ on pump-mediated 86Rb+(K+) influx. With the individual isoform-transfected HeLa cells and monensin added to vary and control the intracellular Na+ concentration, differences in apparent affinities of the alpha 3 isoform compared with the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms were observed, i.e. a approximately 3-fold higher affinity for extracellular K+ and approximately 4-fold lower affinity for cytoplasmic Na+. Thus, in the presence of 10 mM extracellular Na+, apparent K0.5 values for extracellular K+ activation of K+(Rb+) influxes were 0.22 +/- 0.02 mM for alpha 1, 0.20 +/- 0.02 mM for alpha 2, and 0.09 +/- 0.01 mM for alpha 3. At high intracellular K+ (> or = 100 mM) and saturating extracellular K+ concentrations, apparent K0.5 values for cytoplasmic Na+ activation were 17.6 +/- 1.1 mM for alpha 1, 19.7 +/- 1.0 mM for alpha 2, and 63.5 +/- 9.1 mM for alpha 3. The functional differences observed with the individual isoform-transfected cells were completely consistent with the kinetic differences observed with the axolemma and kidney pumps fused into erythrocytes. Axolemma pumps had a approximately 3-fold lower K0.5 for extracellular K+ and a approximately 2-fold higher K0.5 for cytoplasmic Na+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1531450317,"Skeletal alpha-actin (SkA) is representative of the cardiac genes that are expressed at high levels in embryonic myocardium, down-regulated after birth, and reactivated by trophic signals including type beta-transforming growth factors (TGF beta). To investigate the molecular basis for cardiac-restricted and TGF beta-induced SkA transcription, we have undertaken a mutational analysis of the SkA promoter in ventricular myocytes, with emphasis on the role of three nominal serum response elements. Serum response factor (SRF) and the bifunctional factor YY1 are the predominant cardiac proteins contacting the proximal SRE (SRE1). Mutations of SRE1 that prevent recognition by SRF and YY1, or SRF alone, virtually abolish SkA transcription in both TGF beta- and vehicle-treated cells; mutation of distal SREs was ineffective. A mutation which selectively abrogates YY1 binding increases both basal and TGF beta-dependent expression, substantiating the predicted role of YY1 as an inhibitor of SRF effects. However, efficient SkA transcription requires combinatorial action of SRE1 with consensus sites for Sp1 and the SV40 enhancer-binding protein, TEF-1. As isolated motifs, either SRE1- or TEF-1-binding sites function as TGF beta response elements. Induction of the SkA promoter by TGF beta required SRF and TEF-1 in concert, unlike other pathways for TGF beta-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1593806089,"Thrombin activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in platelets via a mechanism involving G-proteins, possibly of both the heterotrimeric and the low molecular weight families. We have investigated the regulation of PI 3-kinase present in platelet cytosol, and we show that this activity can be stimulated by a mixed preparation of G-protein beta gamma-subunits. This stimulation is reversed by preincubation of the beta gamma-subunits with GDP-liganded alpha-subunits. The beta gamma-stimulated activity is inhibited by wortmannin, a recently identified inhibitor of PI 3-kinase in other systems. In addition, the activity associates with PDGF receptor phosphotyrosyl peptide and monoclonal antibody designed to interact with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. We suggest that this beta gamma-sensitive activity is related to previously identified forms of PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W3595601,"Glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme central to glutamate metabolism, is deficient in patients with heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by multiple system atrophy. There is evidence for multiplicity of human glutamate dehydrogenase, which may account for the heterogeneity of the above disorders. However, only one mRNA that is encoded by an intron-containing gene (GLUD1) is presently known. Because blindness due to neuroretinal degeneration can occur in rare forms of multiple system atrophy, we searched for retina-specific GLUD mRNA(s) by screening a lambda gt10 library derived from human retina. A novel cDNA encoded by an X chromosome-linked intronless gene, designated GLUD2, was isolated and characterized. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of human tissues revealed that the novel cDNA is expressed in human retina, testis, and, at lower levels, brain. In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes generated proteins with distinct electrophoretic characteristics. The retinal cDNA was expressed in the baculovirus heterologous system, producing a protein capable of catalyzing the oxidative deamination of glutamate. The mobility of the expressed protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and its catalytic properties were very similar to those of the naturally occurring human brain glutamate dehydrogenases. The novel gene will be useful for understanding the biology of human neural and testicular tissues and in the study of X-linked neurodegenerative disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1523369023,"Adipose tissue contains substantial stores of retinoid (retinol+retinyl ester) that, quantitatively, are second only to retinoid stores in the liver. Our studies show that retinoid levels in adipose tissue are markedly influenced by dietary retinoid intake. Because lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increases the uptake of lipoproteins and lipid emulsion particles by many cell types including adipocytes, we investigated whether LPL also increases retinoid uptake by adipocytes from lipid-containing particles. Addition of LPL (10 micrograms/ml) to BFC-1 beta adipocytes produced a 2-fold increase in cellular uptake of [3H]retinoid from a lipid emulsion containing [3H]retinyl ester. Heparin, which displaces LPL from binding sites on cell surface proteoglycans, increased [3H]retinoid uptake by an additional 2-fold. High performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that greater than 75% of the media and 85% of the cellular radioactivity was present as retinol. The conversion of retinyl ester to retinol by LPL was then assessed using model retinyl ester containing lipid emulsions. Although triglyceride appears to be the preferred substrate for LPL, after greater than 25% of the triglyceride was hydrolyzed, significant amounts of retinyl ester were hydrolyzed by LPL. Retinyl ester hydrolysis was increased approximately 20-fold in the presence of a source of apolipoprotein C-II. The physiologically significant palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate esters of retinol were all hydrolyzed by LPL. When LPL was incubated with [3H]retinyl ester containing rabbit mesenteric chylomicrons and in the presence of heparin and apolipoprotein C-II, the LPL was able to completely hydrolyze the retinyl ester to retinol. Thus, LPL is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of retinyl esters and, through the process of hydrolysis, may facilitate uptake of retinoid by adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1551232709,"GATA-1 is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein thought to be involved in the expression of the vast majority of erythroid specific genes. We have examined the phosphorylation of GATA-1 in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and have mapped the sites of phosphorylation by overexpression of GATA-1 in monkey kidney COS cells. We show that GATA-1 is phosphorylated on 6 serines within its amino terminus in uninduced MEL cells and that a 7th site, serine 310, becomes phosphorylated after MEL cells are induced to differentiate by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide. This site lies near the carboxyl boundary of the DNA-binding domain in a conserved region of the protein believed to be involved in DNA bending. Detailed analyses indicate, however, that phosphorylation at this site, or the other sites identified, does not significantly influence DNA-binding affinity or specificity, DNA bending, or transcriptional transactivation by GATA-1."
https://openalex.org/W1584455845,"The membrane topology of the alpha subunit of the H+,K(+)-ATPase was investigated by using in vitro transcription/translation of DNA sequences encoding fusion proteins that contained possible membrane-spanning segments. The vectors consisted of DNA sequences encoding (a) either the first 101 (M0 vectors) or the first 139 (M1 vectors) amino acids of the N-terminal region of the alpha subunit of the ATPase, (b) a variable region, and then (c) the C-terminal 177 amino acids of the C-terminal region of the beta subunit, with five N-linked glycosylation sites. The variable region of the fusion protein contained the cDNA sequences representing the possible eight or 10 membrane-spanning segments either alone or in various combinations. Transcription/translation was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine using a coupled reticulocyte lysate in the absence and presence of microsomes. The fusion protein was identified by autoradiography following separation using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Glycosylation of a translated sequence corresponded to membrane insertion and translocation of the C-terminal beta sequence. This method allowed analysis of signal anchor sequences using the M0 vector. The presence of a stop transfer sequence in the variable segment of the M1 vector resulted in inhibition of translocation of the C-terminal beta sequence. The sequences for the first four membrane segments could act as either signal anchor or stop transfer sequences. Therefore, this region of the alpha subunit has four membrane-spanning segments that are co-inserted with translation. The sequence corresponding to membrane segment M8 acted as a stop transfer sequence. The sequence corresponding to membrane segment M9 acted as a signal anchor sequence, and that corresponding to membrane segment M10 acted as a stop transfer sequence. The sequences representing the fifth, sixth, and seventh (M5, M6, and M7) membrane segments were unable to co-insert into the membrane. These data verify the first four and the eight membrane-spanning segments of the alpha subunit of the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase and provide evidence for translational insertion of an additional pair of membrane-spanning segments, M9 and M10. It appears that insertion of membrane segments M5, M6, and M7 is determined differently from the other membrane-spanning segments. In combination with other methods, this in vitro transcription/translation method is useful for defining the membrane topology of the P type ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1594802810,"To investigate the trafficking of transforming growth factor-alpha precursor (pro-TGF-alpha) in polarized epithelial cells, wild type and membrane-fixed human pro-TGF-alpha were introduced into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We show that wild type pro-TGF-alpha was synthesized and processed normally to release mature 5.6-kDa TGF-alpha into the basal medium while membrane-fixed pro-TGF-alpha remained cell-associated. Antibody (mAb-528) receptor blockade experiments demonstrated the efficient consumption of basally released TGF-alpha by basolateral epidermal growth factor receptors, indicating that TGF-alpha can act in an autocrine manner in these polarized epithelial cells. Biochemical analysis showed pro-TGF-alpha was expressed on the basolateral surface as either a 17- or 30-kDa species; the 17-kDa forms of both pro-TGF-alpha constructs had basolateral/apical ratios of > 20:1. By confocal microscopy, membrane-fixed pro-TGF-alpha was immunolocalized to lateral membrane surfaces. In pulse-chase experiments combined with cell surface immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that newly synthesized wild type and membrane-fixed pro-TGF-alpha are delivered directly to the basolateral surface with 94 and 96% efficiency, respectively. These results also provide direct evidence for sequential cleavage of pro-TGF-alpha at the basolateral membrane surface. Thus, pro-TGF-alpha is sorted intracellularly and vectorially targeted to the basolateral membrane domain in these polarized epithelial cells. The MDCK cell line provides an ideal in vitro model to examine the molecular basis for trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha and other epidermal growth factor-like growth factors in polarized epithelial cells and their potential interactions with basolateral epidermal growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1520730446,"Sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate, metabolites of sphingolipids, stimulate cell proliferation in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and induce transient increases in intracellular free calcium (Zhang, H., Desai, N. N., Olivera, A., Seki, T., Brooker, G., and Spiegel, S. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 114, 155-167). However, little is yet known of the nuclear events that follow the early responses induced by sphingolipid metabolites. Using a gel retardation assay, we found that specific DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) was markedly increased after treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with sphingosine 1-phosphate and sphingosine. The DNA binding specificity of AP-1 was confirmed with competing probes containing consensus sequences of AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, SP-1, and NF1/CTF. The c-fos gene product was detected in the AP-1 complex using anti-c-Fos antibody. The dose response for stimulation of DNA binding activity of AP-1 by sphingosine 1-phosphate correlated closely with its effect on DNA synthesis. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine, which inhibits sphingosine-induced DNA synthesis and the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, also inhibited sphingosine-stimulated AP-1 DNA binding activity. This result further supports our proposal that sphingosine 1-phosphate mediates the mitogenic effect of sphingosine. Our results indicate that sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced DNA synthesis and cell division may result from activation of AP-1 protein, linking signal transduction by sphingolipid metabolites to gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1553930358,"Abstract Natural killer receptor protein 1 (NKR-P1, a family of proteins), which is a dimeric transmembrane protein predominantly on rat and murine natural killer cells, contains an extracellular motif related to calcium-dependent animal lectins. The domain architecture of this protein and the finding that its cross-linking with antibody results in activation of natural killer cells make it a promising candidate for a receptor function. We have expressed a full-length NKR-P1 protein of the rat in COS cells and prepared soluble extracellular fragments by controlled proteolysis or by expression of truncated cDNA in bacteria. Dimerization of soluble NKR-P1 is predominantly dependent on the presence of an intact juxta-membrane stalk region and independent of N-glycosylation. Binding and inhibition studies using monosaccharides and neoglycoconjugates indicate that NKR-P1 is a lectin with a preference order of GalNAc > GlcNAc > Fuc > Gal > Man. At neutral pH, Ca2+ is tightly associated with the protein such that only a proportion can be removed by 10 mM EGTA. However, NKR-P1 can be decalcified completely at pH 10 with a total loss of carbohydrate binding. After recalcification at pH 8, carbohydrate binding is completely restored. Thus, NKR-P1 differs from other calcium-dependent animal lectins investigated so far in its pattern of monosaccharide recognition and in the tightness of Ca2+ binding."
https://openalex.org/W2153768528,"MHox is a mesoderm-specific homeodomain protein that binds an A/T-rich element that is essential for activity of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer. The MHox binding site also binds the ubiquitous homeodomain protein Oct-1 as well as myocyte enhancer-binding factor-2 (MEF2), which belongs to the MADS superfamily of transactivators. To determine which of these proteins activates MCK transcription through the A/T element, we mutated this sequence such that it would selectively bind MHox, MEF2, or Oct-1 and tested the activities of the mutant enhancers in skeletal muscle cells. These mutant enhancers revealed that only MEF2 is able to activate the MCK enhancer through the A/T element. The convergence of homeodomain and MADS proteins on the A/T element in the MCK enhancer provides a mechanism through which a single DNA sequence can mediate positive and negative regulation of gene transcription and is reminiscent of the roles of these two classes of transcription factors in the control of other cell-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1542125447,"The multicatalytic protease (MCP) associates with a 20 S ATPase complex in the presence of ATP to form the 26 S ubiquitin/ATP-dependent protease. This association results in a uniform 3-fold activation of peptide hydrolysis by MCP. In the absence of nucleotides, an 11 S regulator binds MCP and differentially stimulates its peptidase activities from 3-fold to 25-fold depending upon the peptide. When incubated separately with ATPase complex or regulator, all MCP molecules are converted to 26 S protease or to an activated MCP, respectively. Competition between ATPase complex and regulator for limiting amounts of MCP results in the 26 S protease as the only assembled species. Rabbit reticulocyte regulator is composed of a single 30-kDa protein. Among the 15 subunits in the ATPase complex, there is also a 30-kDa protein. Three findings demonstrate that the 30-kDa subunits in each complex are distinct proteins. First, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel revealed different isoelectric points for each 30-kDa protein. Second, anti-regulator antibodies did not cross-react with proteins in the ATPase complex or in the 26 S protease. Third, directly sequenced peptides from the 30-kDa subunit of the ATPase complex are not present in the deduced amino acid sequence of the regulator. Thus, the regulator and ATPase complex are independent activators of MCP."
https://openalex.org/W1501535983,"Proteoliposomal vesicles reconstituted with sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase and exogenous lipids sustain ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and H+ ejection, as well as net charge displacement by Ca2+. We have studied the effect of lumenal (inner) and medium (extravesicular) pH variations on the countertransport ratios of H+ and Ca2+. We find that the Ca2+/H+ molar ratio is approximately 1 when the lumenal and medium pH is near neutrality, but changes with a specific pattern when the medium pH is varied in the presence of a constant lumenal pH and when the lumenal pH is varied in the presence of a constant medium pH. Empirical analysis of the experimental data shows that the apparent pK of the residue(s) releasing H+ into the medium is approximately 6.1, whereas the apparent pK of the residue(s) binding lumenal H+ is approximately 7.7. Assuming that the same acidic residues are involved in H+ and Ca2+ countertransport, our findings suggest a lower affinity for H+ in their outward orientation (prevalent in the ground state of the enzyme) and a higher affinity for H+ in lumenal orientation (prevalent in the phosphorylated state of the enzyme). Cyclic pK changes, coupled to ATP utilization, promote cation exchange, Ca2+ uptake, and H+ ejection by the vesicles. The stoichiometry of countertransport and net charge displacement is matched by a corresponding electrogenic behavior. A calculation of voltage development related to initial rates of charge transfer (dV/dt = (dQ/dt)/Cm) is given as a corrective replacement of a previous steady state calculation."
https://openalex.org/W1533014491,"The Spo0A transcription factor is responsible for the initiation of sporulation and is active in transcription only after phosphorylation by a specific signal transduction pathway, the phosphorelay. The effect of phosphorylation on the physical properties of Spo0A was determined. Spo0A and Spo0A approximately P both behaved as monomers during Sephacryl chromatography and gel electrophoresis, suggesting that phosphorylation did not modify the oligomerization state of the protein. Trypsin digested Spo0A at a single cleavage site between residues 142 and 143 within a hinge connecting two tightly folded domains. The amino domain retains ability to be phosphorylated by the phosphorelay. The carboxyl domain is active as a DNA-binding protein and retains the sequence specificity of the intact molecule for 0A boxes on the abrB promoter as revealed by footprinting studies. The carboxyl domain stimulated in vitro transcription from the spoIIG promoter 5-fold greater than an equal amount of Spo0A and about half as well as equivalent amounts of Spo0A approximately P. Thus, the unphosphorylated amino domain inhibits the transcription stimulation activity of the carboxyl domain. We suggest that phosphorylation activates transcription regulation functions of Spo0A by modifying the spatial relationships of the amino and carboxyl domains."
https://openalex.org/W1574889225,"The 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor (5-HT1AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC). We have studied the functional domains of 5-HT1AR using synthetic peptides to block or mimic receptor function. The entire second intracellular loop (5-HT1AR-i2) and the carboxyl end of the third intracellular loop (5-HT1AR-i3-C) strongly inhibited forskolin-stimulated AC activity. These effects were not additive with those of 5-HT. Like 5-HT, the peptides 5-HT1AR-i3-C and -i2 weakly inhibited AIF4- and Mn2+ stimulated AC activity. 5-HT1AR binding assays indicated that peptides could interact with the same G-protein pool as the 5-HT1AR. 5-HT1AR-i3-C- and -i2-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding on Go/Gi proteins. Only 5-HT1AR-i3-C partially adopted an alpha-helical conformation in solution. These data show that different domains in the 5-HT1AR second and third intracellular loops can couple to and activate Gi proteins in order to mediate AC inhibition. Peptide-induced AC inhibition was not sensitive to pertussis toxin as opposed to the 5-HT1AR-mediated effect. Our data show that the 5-HT1AR and the 5-HT1AR peptides activate Gi proteins in a slightly different manner."
https://openalex.org/W1527284807,"Lipoyl-AMP:N epsilon-lysine lipolytransferase (lipolytransferase) catalyzes the transfer of the lipoyl group from lipoyl-AMP to a lysine residue of the specific enzyme proteins. We have shown previously that the lipoyltransferase activities locate in mitochondria using apoH-protein of the glycine cleavage system as an acceptor of the lipoyl group (Fujiwara, K., Okamura-Ikeda, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17463-17467). Here we describe the purification and the characterization of two isoforms of lipolytransferase termed lipoyltransferase I and lipoyltransferase II from bovine liver mitochondria. Lipoyltransferase II was purified to apparent homogeneity, whereas the final product of lipoyltransferase I still contained a minor contaminant. Although the two forms could be resolved on a hydroxylapatite column chromatography, they were indistinguishable, as judged by: (a) behavior during purification on ion exchange, hydrophobic, or affinity columns; (b) molecular mass determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel exclusion chromatography (40 kDa); and (c) catalytic properties (substrate specificity, kinetic constants, and optimal pH). Both lipoyltransferase I and II could not use lipoic acid plus MgATP as a substrate in place of lipoyl-AMP. Surprisingly, the lipoyltransferases transferred not only the lipoyl group but also the acyl groups from hexanoyl-, octanoyl-, and decanoyl-AMP to apoH-protein to a similar extent."
https://openalex.org/W1539813719,"Protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a heparin-binding plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) which is thought to be a physiological regulator of activated protein C. We are using recombinant PCI (rPCI) to study structural determinants of target proteinase specificity. A cDNA encoding full-length PCI has been expressed as a fully active proteinase inhibitor using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus). rPCI was expressed maximally 4 days after infection and could be expressed either in Sf9 or High-Five cells. rPCI bound heparin and was conveniently purified with heparin-Sepharose (eluting > 0.5 M NaCl). The rPCI formed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-stable complexes with thrombin and activated protein C (APC). The inhibitory properties of wild-type rPCI and plasma-derived PCI are essentially the same either in the absence or presence of heparin with thrombin, APC, trypsin, and urokinase. The residues Phe353-Arg354-Ser355 (P2-P1-P1') constitute part of the reactive site loop of PCI with the Arg-Ser peptide bond being cleaved by the proteinase. Using site-directed mutagenesis we studied the contribution of the reactive site FRS for proteinase inhibition in rPCI. Changing the P1 residue Arg354-->Met generated a reactive site similar to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor which was a much poorer inhibitor of thrombin, APC, trypsin, and urokinase. Changing the P2 residue Phe353-->Gly generated a mutant with a reactive site like antithrombin which was better at inhibiting thrombin or urokinase, but was much less active with APC or trypsin. Changing the P1' residue Ser355-->Met generated a reactive site like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and this protein inhibits all the proteinases essentially like wild-type rPCI. These results show the importance of PCI's Phe353 (P2) and Arg354 (P1) in target proteinase specificity, and they further support the concept of reactive site sequences determining serpin function."
https://openalex.org/W1575385349,"Triple helix formation of nucleic acids is the most rational approach to designing site-specific transcription inhibitors. To increase their efficiency, reactive moieties such as psoralen or ethenocytosine have been introduced on the third strand. In transfected cells, these compounds induce a site-specific covalent binding of the third strand to the targeted sequence and efficiently block RNA polymerases. However, the stability of this transcription inhibition has never been checked. We have designed a plasmid containing a triple helix binding site in the coding region of the beta-galactosidase reporter gene and a polymerase chain reaction assay to follow quantitatively the cross-link of a psoralen-derivatized third strand in transfected cells. This assay has revealed that the cross-link was removed within a few hours, leading only to a transitory inhibition of gene expression. Control experiments in DNA repair-deficient cells suggest the implication of repair enzymes in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1552348318,"Overlapping cDNA clones which encode the protein core of a rat submandibular gland mucin-glycoprotein have been isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis revealed a translated region of 966 nucleotides encoding a protein of 322 amino acid residues. The translational start site begins with a putative signal sequence comprising the initial 22 N-terminal residues. The predicted secreted portion of the apomucin revealed three distinct domains: an N-terminal domain which is enriched in glutamine (14%), proline (13%), and tyrosine (10%); a central region which consisted of eleven, 39-base pair tandem repeats with the consensus sequence PTTDSTTPAPTTK; and a C-terminal domain which is enriched in threonine and serine residues (47%) which are not part of a repeat motif. The expression of apomucin transcript appears restricted to the rat submandibular and sublingual glands. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNAs suggested a low copy number (1, 2) for this apomucin gene and a limited polymorphism in the number of tandem repeats. Collectively, our sequence and expression data indicate that the cloned rat submandibular gland apomucin is distinct from any of the other salivary (bovine, porcine, or human) or rat apomucins reported thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1501974649,"Synthesis of rhodanese in a cell-free coupled transcription/translation system derived from Escherichia coli leads to an accumulation of full-length rhodanese protein on the ribosomes as well as to enzymatically active protein that is released from the ribosomes into the supernatant fraction. The ribosome-bound protein is enzymatically inactive but can be activated and released from the ribosomes without additional protein synthesis by subsequent incubation in the presence of the added chaperones DnaJ, DnaK, GrpE, GroEL, and GroES plus ATP. Efficient activation requires that all of the chaperones are present together during incubation which yields fully active rhodanese. Incubation in the presence of DnaJ only inhibits release whereas incubation with only GroES or DnaK promotes the release of enzymatically inactive protein. Incubation of the ribosome with puromycin leads to the release of enzymatically inactive protein whereas release and activation in the presence of all of the chaperones is blocked by sparsomycin. The effect of these antibiotics provides very strong evidence that enzymatically inactive, full-length rhodanese is bound to the ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA and that the peptidyl transferase reaction is required for its release. Considered together, the data indicate that chaperone-mediated late stages of rhodanese folding into the enzymatically active, native conformation are intimately associated with the process of termination and release that occurs as part of the reaction cycle of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1601038910,"Cyclophilin B (CyPB) is a cyclosporin-binding protein, known to be located mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Its previous characterization in human milk implies that the protein may be released from the secretory pathway and recovered in biological fluids. In an attempt to understand the role of the extracellular CyPB, we have investigated the binding capacity of the protein to cells derived from human T- and B-lymphocytes. We present here evidence that CyPB binds to T-lymphocytes and that the binding to the Jurkat T-cell surface is specific, saturable, and reversible. The dissociation constant Kd was 12 nM, and the number of binding sites was estimated to 35,000/cell. We report that the surface-bound CyPB was internalized at 37 degrees C and subsequently degraded in the cell. We also show that the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A does not inhibit the surface binding of CyPB, and does not interfere with internalization of the protein. These results support the hypothesis that the selective action of the immunosuppressive drug results in part from its interaction with the extracellular form of CyPB."
https://openalex.org/W1539372226,"We have investigated the mechanism of the rebound of glycogen stores in the liver of 72-h fasted rats. The liver of 72- and 96-h fasted rats contains significant amounts of glycogen (about 5 mg/g, wet weight) as compared to the liver of 24- and 48-h fasted rats, which contains less than 2 mg of glycogen/g of liver, wet weight. Rebound of glycogen does not involve glycogen synthase activation or glycogen phosphorylase inhibition. It could be dependent on the concentration of the precursor substrate of glycogenesis, i.e. glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), which is higher by about 45% in the liver of 72- and 96-h fasted rats than in the liver of 48-h fasted rats. The 72-h increase of Glc-6-P compared with the 48-h values could not be explained either by late modifications of the total activities of glucokinase, hexokinases, Glc-6-P dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) or by changes in plasma glucose and insulin/glucagon ratio. In agreement with the fact that total glucose output tends to decrease upon prolonged fasting, the increase of Glc-6-P concentration in the liver of 72-h fasted rats suggests the involvement of a metabolite inhibition of Glc-6-Pase. The increase of the alpha-ketoglutarate concentration in the 72- and 96-h fasted liver with regard to the 48-h fasted liver (about three times) might account for such an inhibition since we show here that Glc-6-Pase is inhibited in vitro in the presence of relevant concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate, Glc-6-P, and Mg2+ ions."

https://openalex.org/W1676378030,"Some steps in the receptor-mediated transport of newly synthesized mannose 6-phosphate-containing lysosomal enzymes are assumed to be accompanied by changes in the phosphorylation state of receptors. In vitro, the metabolically phosphorylated 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR 46) was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A. The synthetic cytoplasmic domain of MPR 46 was phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping showed that casein kinase II phosphorylates MPR 46 in vitro at the same site that is phosphorylated in vivo. Inhibition studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to different amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic tail of MPR 46 revealed that the sequence 26-32 (ADGCDFV) contribute to efficient phosphorylation of serine 56. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with wild type human MPR 46 cDNA or cDNAs containing mutations in the cytoplasmic tail and assayed for their phosphorylation state in vivo. The phosphorylation of mutant receptors with deleted residues 23-28 (NLVADG) was strongly reduced. These data indicate that residues on the N-terminal side of the phosphorylatable serine 56 may influence the efficiency with which a casein-kinase II-like kinase phosphorylates MPR 46."
https://openalex.org/W1591378180,"During bacteriophage Mu transposition, strand transfer is catalyzed in the presence of phage-encoded A and B proteins and Escherichia coli HU protein, attaching Mu ends to target DNA and creating an intermediate in transposition. Bacteriophage Mu A protein, which remains tightly bound to the Mu ends in the native strand-transfer intermediate, blocked initiation of Mu DNA replication by a system of 8 host proteins (DnaB helicase, DnaC protein, DnaG primase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, DNA polymerase I, DNA gyrase, DNA ligase, and single-strand binding protein). This 8-protein system had all enzymatic activities to convert the deproteinized intermediate to a cointegrate; however, additional host factor(s) were required to replicate the native intermediate. While replication of the native intermediate absolutely required DnaB helicase, DnaC protein, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the specific requirements were relaxed for the deproteinized intermediate. Other host factors were able to replace these specific factors. These results indicate that Mu A protein, in conjunction with additional host factor(s), acts to promote assembly of specific host replication proteins at the Mu replication fork. This process may alter the stable interaction of Mu A protein with the ends to allow initiation of Mu DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1536821532,"Cbp1p is a nuclear encoded protein required for the stabilization of mitochondrial COB mRNA, which codes for apocytochrome b in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The COB gene is cotranscribed with the upstream tRNA(Glu) gene. Release of tRNA(Glu) from the initial transcript generates a precursor mRNA with a 5'-end at position -1098. The 5'-end of mature COB message is generated by cleavage of the pre-mRNA at nucleotide -955 or -954. Previous work indicated that Cbp1p acts through cis-elements near these cleavage sites. Here we have tested whether Cbp1p stabilizes COB mRNA solely by stimulating the processing of COB precursor RNA at nucleotide -955/-954. Yeast strain TG955 was constructed such that the -955 COB mRNA 5'-processing site coincides with the upstream tRNA 3'-endonuclease site at position -1098, allowing the 5'-end of COB mRNA to be formed by the tRNA 3'-processing enzyme. Respiratory growth and stability of COB mRNA in TG955 are Cbp1p-dependent. Therefore, we conclude that Cbp1p is important for the stabilization of COB mRNA after 5'-processing."
https://openalex.org/W1516945930,"The transcriptional activities of c-Ets-1 and v-Ets and their functional interaction with the AP-1 factor c-Jun were investigated. Several recombinant Ets proteins were produced and purified either from bacteria or from insect cells. Plasmid DNAs that contained the polyoma virus enhancer Ets/AP-1 element were used as templates for in vitro transcription assays in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract and various combinations of the Jun and Ets proteins. Under these conditions full-length c-Ets-1 on its own does not markedly influence transcription but abolishes the strong transcriptional stimulation normally elicited by Jun. This repression depends on the Ets-binding site and on specific features of c-Ets-1 structure, as both v-Ets and a natural splicing variant c-Ets-1 (delta VII) fail to inhibit Jun activity. These findings suggest that c-Ets may act both as a transcriptional repressor or activator depending on promoter context and splicing pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1503690520,"The ABF1 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been found to bend the DNA containing the target site for DNA binding. A bend angle of about 120 degrees was measured and the bend center was 7 base pairs to the 5' end of the ABF1 consensus-containing sequence. Phasing analysis showed that intact ABF1 bends the DNA towards the minor groove. We have subjected ABF1 to partial proteolysis and have found that proteolytic fragments were able to bind to the DNA-binding site and induce partial bends in the DNA. Interestingly, the locations of the bend centers, the bend angles, and the plane of the bends induced by the proteolytic peptides of ABF1 were different from those of the intact protein. We present a model for the mechanism of bending of DNA by ABF1."
https://openalex.org/W1554917820,"The functions of a deoxynucleoside kinase and a deoxynucleotidase can give rise to substrate cycles in which the two enzymes catalyze in opposite directions the irreversible interconversion of a deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphate (dNMP) and its deoxynucleoside. Earlier evidence showed that pyrimidine dNMP cycles occur in cultured cells and participate in the regulation of the size of dNMP pools there by affecting the transport of deoxyribonucleosides across the cell membrane. Here, we apply an isotope flow method using labeled adenine as precursor of dAMP and DNA to quantify deoxyadenosine excretion as a measure of the catabolic activity of a putative dAMP/deoxyadenosine cycle. A comparison of human CEM lymphoblasts and hamster V79 fibroblasts, including mutant cells lacking kinases for the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine, shows a much lower deoxyadenosine excretion in CEM cells (0.05% of dATP synthesized by reduction of ADP) as compared with V79 cells (4% of dATP). Mutational loss of deoxycytidine kinase increases these values to 0.3% in CEM cells and to 10% in V79 cells. This strongly suggests the presence of a dAMP/deoxyadenosine cycle in both CEM and V79 cells. Additional loss of adenosine kinase only marginally affects deoxyadenosine excretion in CEM cells. The small excretion of deoxyadenosine (also in the absence of both kinases) demonstrates that in CEM cells the in situ activity of the deoxynucleotidase affecting the dAMP/deoxyadenosine substrate cycle is very low and that the cycle has mainly an anabolic function there."
https://openalex.org/W1496627438,"The conformational changes that accompany association of the tryptophan synthase alpha and beta 2 subunits are probed by investigating the effects of solvents on the catalytic and spectroscopic properties of tryptophan synthase. Low concentrations of ethanol, propanol, and butanol inhibit conversion of L-serine and indole to L-tryptophan by the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Inhibition depends on the concentration, chain length, and hydrophobicity of the alcohol. In contrast, these alcohols increase the rates of conversion of beta-chloro-L-alanine and indole to L-tryptophan and of L-serine to pyruvate. Thus, alcohols alter the substrate specificity and reaction specificity of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. These altered specificities are similar to those of the free beta 2 subunit in aqueous solution. The spectroscopic properties of enzyme-substrate intermediates formed by the alpha 2 beta 2 complex in 3 M ethanol and 0.5 M 1-butanol also resemble the intermediates formed by the free beta 2 subunit in aqueous solution. Experiments using gel-filtration, membrane ultrafiltration, and limited proteolysis show that the alpha 2 beta 2 complex does not dissociate at low concentrations of alcohols. Our results provide evidence that alcohols can stabilize an alternative conformation of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex which is similar to the open conformation of the free beta 2 subunit in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1483123501,"DnaK, the Hsp70 of Escherichia coli, autophosphorylates in vitro. Of the two heat shock proteins that interact with DnaK, GrpE inhibits DnaK phosphorylation, whereas DnaJ has no effect on the reaction. Three synthetic peptides are shown to inhibit DnaK phosphorylation. The potency of a given peptide correlates with its affinity for the DnaK protein. A truncated DnaK that lacks the carboxyl-terminal peptide-binding domain autophosphorylates; this reaction is resistant to the inhibitory peptides. Phosphorylation of the truncated DnaK is still inhibited by GrpE, indicating that the GrpE-binding site resides in the DnaK amino-terminal domain. Thus, DnaK phosphorylation is regulated in vitro, and possibly in vivo, by physiologically relevant substrates and cofactors."

https://openalex.org/W1596847447,"An RNA polymerase I core promoter binding factor (CPBF) was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat adenocarcinoma ascites cells by chromatographic fractionation on a series of columns including an oligodeoxynucleotide affinity column. The final preparation contained two polypeptides with molecular masses of 44,000 and 39,000 daltons. The binding of the factor to the promoter was demonstrated by Southwestern blotting, UV cross-linking and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The specificity of its binding to the core promoter was confirmed by competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay using several unlabeled oligo probes in the assay. The addition of increasing amounts of purified CPBF to the in vitro transcription reaction that contains a limiting quantity of the factor resulted in dramatic stimulation of RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription of rat ribosomal RNA gene. The transcription stimulatory activity associated with the purified CPBF fractions co-purified with the core promoter binding activity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Finally, in a reconstitution transcription system which is devoid of the factor and is incapable of ribosomal gene transcription, purified CPBF could trans-activate the pol I promoter. These data indicate that CPBF is a novel pol I promoter binding factor required for ribosomal gene transcription."
