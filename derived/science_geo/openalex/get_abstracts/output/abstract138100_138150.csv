Although a great deal is known about the pathogenic role of PrPSc, the physiological function of PrPC has remained a mystery. Several lines of evidence have recently suggested the possibility that PrPCmay play a role in the metabolism of copper. To further investigate the interaction of PrPC and copper, we have analyzed the effect of this metal ion on the endocytic trafficking of PrPC in cultured neuroblastoma cells. We report here that copper rapidly and reversibly stimulates endocytosis of PrPC from the cell surface. This effect may be physiologically relevant and suggests the hypothesis that PrPC could serve as a recycling receptor for uptake of copper ions from the extracellular milieu.

Although a wealth of information is now available about the role of PrPSc in the disease process, relatively little is known about the normal, physiological function of PrPC. PrPC is expressed in neurons and glia of the brain and spinal cord and at lower levels in several peripheral tissues and in leukocytes (3Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L.

Its localization on the cell surface would be consistent with roles in cell adhesion and recognition, ligand uptake, or transmembrane signaling. Mice in which the endogenous PrP gene has been ablated do not display any gross anatomical or developmental defects (8Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Fluethmann H. Lipp H.-P. DeArmond S.J.

How these abnormal phenotypes, when present, relate to the normal function of PrPC is unclear. Identifying the function of PrPC may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases, because loss of this function as a result of conversion to PrPSc may explain some features of the disorders.Several new pieces of data suggest that PrPC may play a role in the metabolism of copper. First, the N-terminal half of PrPC contains a series of histidine- and glycine-containing peptide repeats that are capable of binding copper ions. Synthetic peptides or recombinant PrP fragments encompassing the repeats bind copper with a K d of 5–10 μm, and binding of the metal induces conformational alterations in the polypeptide chain (15Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Copper also facilitates restoration of protease resistance and infectivity during refolding of guanidine-denatured PrPSc (20McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J.D.O. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Second, the total content of copper but not of several other metals is only 20% of normal in crude membranes, synaptosomes, and endosomes derived from the brains ofPrn-p0/0 mice that contain a disrupted PrP gene (18Brown D.R. Qin K.F. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Vonbohlen A. Schulzschaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This result suggests that PrPC may be a major copper-binding protein in brain. Third, neuronal Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) from Prn-p0/0 mice is less enzymatically active and incorporates less radioactive copper than the enzyme from normal mice; the opposite is true for SOD from transgenic mice that over-express PrPC (21Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Neurons cultured fromPrn-p0/0 mice are also more sensitive to oxidative insult, perhaps because of reduced SOD activity (21Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that PrPC could be involved in delivery of copper ions to SOD and perhaps other cuproenzymes. Finally, PC12 cells selected for resistance to copper toxicity have increased expression of PrPC, suggesting a role for the protein in removal or detoxification of copper (23Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Exactly how copper and PrPC are functionally related is unclear at present. One possibility is that bound copper serves as an essential cofactor for an as yet undetermined enzymatic activity of PrPC, as it does in cuproproteins such as SOD and cytochrome c oxidase (24Linder M.C. Goode C.A. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). By virtue of its presence on the cell surface, PrPC could also function as a sink for chelation of extracellular copper ions or as a carrier protein for uptake and delivery of copper ions to intracellular targets. An important piece of information that may shed light on the functional interaction of PrPC and copper is how the metal affects the cellular localization and trafficking of PrPC. We have shown previously that PrPC is constitutively endocytosed from the plasma membrane via clathrin-coated pits and transits an early endosomal compartment before being recycled back to the cell surface (25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shyng S.L. Heuser J.E. Harris D.A. J.

Immunol. 1996; 207: 77-93PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that copper has a dramatic effect on this cycle.RESULTSWe have previously characterized the cellular trafficking of PrPC using lines of N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells that have been stably transfected to express either moPrP or chPrP (29Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Shyng S.L. Moulder K.L. Lesko A. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore used these cells to examine the effects of copper on the cellular distribution of PrPC. To determine whether copper altered the total amount of PrPC on the cell surface, we treated cells for 90 min with CuSO4 and then biotinylated them with a membrane-impermeable reagent. The amount of biotinylated PrP was then determined by immunoprecipitating PrP from cell lysates, running the immunoprecipitates on SDS-PAGE, and developing blots of the gel with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and ECL. We found that at concentrations of 200 μm and above, CuSO4dramatically reduced the amounts of both moPrP and chPrP on the cell surface (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when the amount of surface PrP was assayed by sensitivity to externally applied trypsin (data not shown).Because PrPC in N2a cells is constitutively endocytosed from the plasma membrane (25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shyng S.L. Heuser J.E. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we tested whether the effect of copper on the total amount of surface PrPC could be explained by a stimulatory effect on endocytosis. To measure endocytosis, we surface-iodinated cells at 4 °C, warmed them to 37 °C to initiate internalization, and then scored the amount of iodinated PrP that became inaccessible to externally applied phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), a bacterial enzyme that cleaves the glycolipid anchor responsible for attaching PrP to the membrane. Using this assay, we found that 500 μmCuSO4 rapidly stimulated internalization of both chPrP (Fig. 2, A and B) and moPrP (not shown). An increase in internalized PrP could be seen after as little as 5 min of incubation, and after 30 min 65% of the protein was internalized, compared with 15% in untreated cells. Stimulation of endocytosis could also be demonstrated using biotinylation rather than iodination to label surface PrP molecules. Using this procedure, the minimum concentration of CuSO4required to produce an observable increase in internalization was ∼100 μm (Fig. 2, C and D). At this concentration, ZnSO4 also stimulated endocytosis of chPrP, but no effect was seen with CoCl2, MnCl2, or FeSO4 at 500 μm (not shown). The effect of copper on PrP was not due to a generalized increased in endocytosis of surface proteins, because 500 μm CuSO4 did not significantly alter internalization of [125I]-transferrin (not shown).Figure 2Copper stimulates endocytosis of chPrP. A, N2a cells expressing chPrP were surface-iodinated at 4 °C and were then warmed to 37 °C for the indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of 500 μmCuSO4. Cells were then treated with PIPLC at 4 °C, and chPrP was immunoprecipitated from the PIPLC incubation media (surface,S lanes) and cell lysates (internal, I lanes) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, the amount of PrP was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis of the gel lanes inpanel A, and the amount of internal PrP was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of PrP (surface + internal) at each time point. (The time course of internalization in absence of copper is slower in these experiments than in previously published work (25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably because of differences in the growth conditions of the cells).C, N2a cells expressing chPrP were surface-biotinylated at 4 °C and were then warmed to 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of CuSO4. Cells were then treated with PIPLC at 4 °C, and chPrP was immunoprecipitated from the PIPLC incubation media (surface, S lanes) and cell lysates (internal, I lanes), separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by development of gel blots with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and ECL. D, the amount of PrP was quantitated by film densitometry of the gel lanes in panel C, and the amount of internal PrP was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of PrP (surface + internal) at each copper concentration. The experiments shown in this figure are representative of at least three similar ones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We found that the effect of copper was rapidly reversible. Within 15 min of removal of the metal, PrP began to redistribute from the inside to the outside of the cell, as assayed by accessibility to PIPLC (Fig.3, A and B). By 60 min, a new steady-state was reached at which about 40% of the protein was internal, about the same percentage that is reached after endocytosis in the absence of copper (25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This readjustment of the steady-state distribution is presumably due to the previously documented ability of PrPC molecules to recycle back to surface of N2a cells after they are internalized (25Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly measure this recycling process, we first incubated surface-iodinated cells for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 500 μmCuSO4 to stimulate internalization of PrP and then stripped surface PrP by treatment with PIPLC at 4 °C and finally re-warmed the cells in the presence of PIPLC to release recycled molecules into the medium. Using this procedure (Fig. 3, C andD), we found that when copper was absent from the re-warming medium, almost all of the previously internalized PrP recycled to the surface with a t 12 of 10 min, consistent with the results of Fig. 3 B. Interestingly, when copper was present in the re-warming medium, PrP also returned to the surface, although somewhat more slowly than in the absence of metal (t 12 = 20 min). This result implies that although copper markedly stimulates the rate of PrP internalization, it has much less effect on the rate of recycling.Previous studies have implicated the N-terminal peptide repeats of both mammalian and chicken PrP in copper binding (15Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We have also shown that this region of the polypeptide chain is essential for efficient endocytosis of PrP (27Shyng S.L. Moulder K.L. Lesko A. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of copper on endocytosis of N-terminally deleted forms of chPrP using a surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 4). chPrP normally contains eight hexapeptide repeats (31Harris D.A. Falls D.L. Johnson F.A. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal one-third of the molecule (Δ25–91), including all eight hexapeptide repeats, almost completely abolished the effect of copper, although the protein underwent some degradation during the course of the experiment (not shown). Deletion of the first four repeats (Δ42–65) or the last four repeats (Δ66–91) attenuated but did not eliminate copper-induced internalization of PrP, suggesting that the remaining repeats retain residual copper coordinating activity.Figure 4N-terminally deleted forms of chPrP are endocytosed less efficiently in response to copper.Internalization of wild-type and deleted forms of chPrP expressed in N2a cells was assayed by surface biotinylation, as described in the legend to Fig. 2 C. The amount of PrP internalized at 5 min in response to 500 μm CuSO4 was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of PrP (surface + internal).Bars represent the mean ± S.E. of two to six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur previous studies have shown that PrPC is constitutively endocytosed from the cell surface via clathrin-coated pits and passes through an early endocytic compartment before being returned to the plasma membrane (29Harris D.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that copper ions rapidly and reversibly stimulate the endocytic arm of this cycle.It is attractive to speculate that this effect is attributable to binding of copper ions directly to PrPC, because purified, recombinant forms of PrP have been shown to bind copper ions, most likely via the peptide repeats (15Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Zinc also binds to PrPC, although less tightly than does copper (32Pan K.M. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with a direct effect of copper on the internalization of PrPC, we find that N-terminally deleted forms of chPrP that are missing some or all of the peptide repeats are less efficiently endocytosed than the full-length protein in response to extracellular copper. One hypothesis to explain how binding of copper could stimulate endocytosis of PrPC is that the metal, by altering the conformation of PrPC, increases the affinity of the protein for a putative endocytic receptor that localizes PrPC in clathrin-coated pits. Because PrPC is attached to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, it lacks a cytoplasmic domain that could bind directly to the intracellular components of coated pits. We have therefore postulated the existence of a transmembrane receptor whose extracellular domain binds PrPC via its N-terminal region and whose cytoplasmic domain contains signals for interacting with adapter molecules and clathrin (27Shyng S.L. Moulder K.L. Lesko A. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Harris D.A. Gorodinsky A. Lehmann S. Moulder K. Shyng S.-L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 207: 77-93PubMed Google Scholar).Enhanced internalization of PrPC requires copper concentrations in the range of 100–500 μm, which is 10–50-fold greater than the estimated K d for binding of copper to synthetic PrP peptides and recombinant PrP synthesized in bacteria (15Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due, in part, to binding of copper ions to other molecules such as amino acids that are present in the Opti-MEM medium used for our experiments, a phenomenon that would lower the concentration of free copper. It is also possible that the effect of copper on endocytosis occurs by binding to sites on cell-expressed PrPC that are distinct from the ones characterized on bacterially derived or synthetic PrP or to sites on other molecules involved in PrPCinternalization. In any case, the average copper concentration in brain has been estimated to be ∼100 μm and may be even higher in specific brain regions (19Stöckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 33Smith R.M. Dreosti I.E. Smith R.M. Neurobiology of the Trace Elements. 1. Human Press, Clifton, NJ1983: 1-40Google Scholar). Therefore, the endocytic response we have described here is potentially relevant from a physiological standpoint.One attractive hypothesis is that PrPC serves as a receptor for uptake of copper ions from the extracellular milieu. PrPC might bind copper ions on the cell surface and then deliver them to an endocytic compartment within which the bound ions dissociate from PrPC and are transferred to other copper-carrier proteins that move the ions into the cytosol. PrPC would then return to the cell surface to begin another cycle. This proposed function for PrPC is analogous to that of the transferrin receptor in uptake of iron (34Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9681-9689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the metal ions bind directly to the receptor in the case of PrPC rather than to a protein carrier comparable with transferrin. Although plasma membrane copper transporters and cytoplasmic copper chaperones have been identified in yeast and humans (35Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of copper uptake by mammalian cells is still poorly understood (36Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Further exploration of the interaction between PrPC and copper ions at the cellular level may shed important light on this subject.

Although a wealth of information is now available about the role of PrPSc in the disease process, relatively little is known about the normal, physiological function of PrPC. PrPC is expressed in neurons and glia of the brain and spinal cord and at lower levels in several peripheral tissues and in leukocytes (3Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L.

We have synthesized the fragment as seven overlapping peptides that spontaneously assemble into triple helices. On the basis of their capacity to bind purified α2β1 and the recombinant α2A-domain, and their ability to support α2β1-mediated cell adhesion, we identified two peptides, CB3(I)-5 and -6, which contain an α2β1 recognition site. Synthesis of the peptide CB3(I)-5/6, containing the overlap sequence between peptides 5 and 6, allowed us to locate the binding site within the 15-residue sequence, GFP*GERGVEGPP*GPA (where P* represents hydroxyproline), corresponding to residues 502–516 of the collagen type I α1 chain. The Glu and Arg residues in the GER triplet were found to be essential for recognition since substitution of either residue with Ala caused a loss of α2 A-domain binding. By contrast, substitution of the Glu in GVE did not reduce binding, but rather enhanced it slightly. We were unable to detect significant recognition of α2β1 by the peptide CB3(I)-2 containing the putative α2β1 recognition sequence DGEA. Peptides CB3(I)-1 to -6, together with peptide CB3(I)-5/6, exhibited good platelet-aggregatory activity, in some cases better than collagen. However, peptide CB3(I)-7 was inactive, suggesting the presence of an inhibitory element that might account for the lack of aggregatory activity of the parent α1(I)CB3 fragment.

Integrins that recognize collagen can modulate cell behavior, including adhesion and spreading, migration, division, metabolism, and the expression of the differentiated phenotype. These important processes are physiologically relevant to growth and development, wound repair, and angiogenesis and in pathological processes such as thrombosis and tumor metastasis. Integrin α2β1 is also an important collagen receptor in hemostasis, where it plays an essential role in the arrest of platelets, under conditions of blood flow, on the collagen fiber surface exposed as a consequence of injury (1Kuhn K.

Activation of platelets by collagen may also be a cause of thrombosis, especially that associated with rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque, which leads to exposure of underlying collagens (8Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Jacotot B. Mathé D. Fruchart J.-C. International Congress Series 1155: Atherosclerosis XI. Elsevier, Singapore1998: 299-306Google Scholar). Previous fragmentation studies (9Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Zijenah L.S. Goodall A.H. Humphries M.J. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have indicated the presence of a number of integrin α2β1 recognition sites in collagen I, which, with collagen III, represents the main platelet-aggregatory collagen species in the vessel wall and perivascular space (8Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Jacotot B. Mathé D. Fruchart J.-C. International Congress Series 1155: Atherosclerosis XI. Elsevier, Singapore1998: 299-306Google Scholar). In particular, α2β1-mediated platelet adhesion to fragment α1(I)CB3 derived from the α1(I) chain of collagen I is as good as to the parent collagen (9Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Zijenah L.S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition studies with short linear (non-helical) peptides led to the conclusion that the sequence DGEA, corresponding to residues 435–438 of the α1(I) chain, is an α2β1recognition sequence in α1(I)CB3 (11Staatz W.D.

Despite the ability of the fragment to support integrin-mediated adhesion, it largely lacks the capacity to activate platelets (12Morton L.F. Fitzsimmons C.M. Rauterberg J. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

In order to discover sequences in α1(I)CB3 recognizing α2β1, and to gain insight into the structural features of collagen controlling its platelet-activatory ability, we have synthesized the fragment as seven overlapping peptides that spontaneously assemble into triple helices. Based on their ability to support α2β1-mediated adhesion of platelets and HT 1080 cells and to bind the purified integrin and the recombinant α2 A-domain, we have identified a 15-residue α2β1 recognition sequence, corresponding to residues 502–516 of the α1(I) chain, containing a GER triplet crucial for activity. We were unable to detect activity within the peptide CB3(I)-2 containing the sequence DGEA. Based on the platelet aggregatory activity of the peptides, we have identified a locus that may contain an inhibitory element and possibly explain the lack of aggregatory activity of the parent fragment. Monomeric collagen type I, for use in solid-phase assays and cell adhesion studies, was purified from bovine skin, following limited pepsin digestion, as described previously (9Morton L.F.

Anti-(human integrin α2β1) mAb, clone Gi9, was purchased from The Binding Site Ltd. (Birmingham, United Kingdom (UK)). Fmoc-amino acids were from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK). Fmoc-Asp(t-butyl ester)- pentafluorophenyl ester and Fmoc-(Fmoc-2-hydroxy-4-methylbenzyl)Gly-OH were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (UK) Ltd.

TentaGel R RAM resin was from Rapp Polymere GmbH (Tubingen, Germany). Other reagents were analytical grade or better. Platelet adhesion was measured in Immulon 2 96-well plates using 51Cr-labeled gel-filtered human platelets as described (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), employing the conditions of Santoro (16Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), i.e. static adhesion at room temperature in the presence of Tris-HCl, to avoid the formation of platelet aggregates. We have observed in earlier studies (17Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that adhesion is largely of single platelets with no obvious evidence of deposition of platelet aggregates. Results are expressed as bound radioactivity as a percentage of the total applied. Assays were undertaken in triplicate, and data are presented as the mean. Adhesion to BSA-coated wells measured concurrently was never more than 1%. When testing mAbs for inhibitory activity, platelets were pre-incubated with antibody for 15 min. Results presented are representative of three replicate experiments. Platelet aggregation was measured turbidimetrically at 20 °C using citrated human platelet-rich plasma as previously (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

Unattached cells were counted electronically and adhesion calculated as the number of adherent cells expressed as a percentage of the total cell count. Assays were undertaken in triplicate and the data expressed as the mean ± S.D. BSA-coated wells were used to determine nonspecific background adhesion. Data presented are representative of three repeat experiments. Integrin α2β1 was purified from solubilized membranes of human platelets by affinity chromatography on collagen-Sepharose as described (19Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J.

Homogeneity was established by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identification as α2β1 was by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (20Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with BCA reagent (Pierce & Warriner (UK) Ltd., Chester, UK) and the purified integrin was biotinylated using a kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Amersham, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The suitability of the biotinylated product for use in solid-phase assays, as described below, has been demonstrated in earlier studies (20Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J.

Briefly, wells of 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated for 2 h at room temperature with 100 μl of a solution of collagen or peptide, 1–10 μg/ml in 0.01m acetic acid. Wells were then blocked for 1 h with 100 μl of TBS containing 50 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A4503). After three washes with 200 μl of washing buffer (TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA; Sigma A7638), 100 μl of 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated integrin in adhesion buffer (washing buffer plus either 2 mm MgCl2and 1 mm MnCl2 or 10 mmNa2EDTA, as required) was applied to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed as above and incubated for 30 min with 100 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Life Sciences) diluted 1:1500 with washing buffer. The wells were again washed three times and bound integrin detected using a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine-peroxidase substrate system (KPL, Gaithersburg, Maryland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Maxline Emax plate reader (Molecular Devices Ltd., Crawley, UK). Mean values from triplicate assays were corrected for a background reading obtained from using BSA-coated wells, i.e. wells coated with 0.01 macetic acid (vehicle) in the absence of substrate and then blocked with BSA. Background absorbance was never more than 10% of that obtained with collagen. Results are given as the mean ± S.D. Recombinant human α2 integrin A-domain was produced, as described by Tuckwell et al.

Integrin α2A-domain-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose column. The suitability of the purified protein for solid-phase assays described below has been established in earlier studies (21Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp multiwell plates were coated for 1 h at room temperature with collagen or peptides and blocked with BSA (Sigma A4503) as described above. After three washes with TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A7638), 100 μl of a solution of 50 μg/ml α2 A-domain fusion protein in the above buffer or one containing 5 mm EDTA in place of Mg2+, was applied to the wells and the plates incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed as before. Bound A-domain was detected by the addition of 100 μl of 10 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A7638). Plates were incubated for 45 min and then washed three times as above. After adding 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO Ltd., Ely, UK) diluted 1:2000 in TBS (plus Mg2+ and BSA), the plates were incubated for another 45 min, then given a final wash as above. Wells were then treated with a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine-peroxidase substrate system (KPL) and the absorbance at 450 nm read using the Emax plate reader. Assays were undertaken in triplicate and readings corrected for background as above. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Peptides were synthesized as C-terminal amides on TentaGel R RAM resin in a PerSeptive Biosystems 9050 Plus PepSynthesiser. In general, Fmoc-amino acids (4 eq) were activated withN-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-yl-methylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (4 eq) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (8 eq) (23Carpino L.A.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 7523-7526Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peptides were released from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, ethanedithiol, and triisopropylsilane (90:5:2.5:2.5, by volume) for 6 h at room temperature. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a column of Vydac 219TP101522 using a linear gradient of 5–45% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing homogeneous product were identified by analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a column of Vydac 219TP54, pooled, and freeze-dried. All peptides were found to be of the correct theoretical mass by mass spectrometry. Initially, seven overlapping peptides based on the sequence of the bovine collagen fragment α1(I)CB3, designated CB3(I)-1 to -7, were synthesized (see Fig. 1). Subsequently, a peptide designated CB3(I)-5/6, containing the overlap sequence shared between peptides 5 and 6, and other peptides containing a variant of this sequence, as detailed later, were made. The triple-helical stability of each peptide was assessed by polarimetry as described previously (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

Melting temperatures (T m(1/2)) of the peptides were as follows: CB3(I)-1, 32 °C; CB3(I)-2, 39 °C; CB3(I)-3, 37 °C; CB3(I)-4, 36 °C; CB3(I)-5, 30 °C; CB3(I)-6, 30 °C; CB3(I)-7, 26 °C; CB3(I)-5/6, 39 °C. A representative melting curve, of CB3(I)-6, is shown in Fig.2. In accord with previous findings (4Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb.

Of the seven peptides CB3(I)-1 to -7, only peptides 5 and 6 showed α2β1 binding (Fig. 3, a andb). Binding to these two peptides was greater than to collagen (Fig. 3 b) and strongly inhibited by EDTA (90%; data not shown). Peptide CB3(I)-5/6, containing the overlap sequence between peptides 5 and 6 (see Fig. 1) also exhibited binding of α2β1 comparable to that to collagen. In this case, too, binding was strongly divalent cation-dependent and fully inhibited by anti-α2 mAb 6F1 (Fig. 3 c). These results suggested that the binding exhibited by peptides CB3(I)-5 and -6 was attributable to a single binding locus contained in the overlap sequence GFP*GERGVEGPP*GPA. As before (20Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed divalent cation-dependent binding of α2 A-domain to collagen which could be prevented by anti-α2β1 mAbs (Fig.4, a and b). As for intact α2β1, significant cation-dependent binding occurred only to peptides CB3(I)-5, -6, and -5/6 (Fig. 4, a and b). Slight binding to CB3(I)-3, -4, and -7 was nearly all cation-independent (nonspecific). Binding to CB3(I)-5/6 was consistently greater than to collagen (Fig. 4, a and b) and was fully inhibited by the anti-α2β1 mAbs 6F1 and Gi9. Inhibition by Gi9 is shown in Fig. 4 b as an example. Inhibition by 6F1 and Gi9 reflects the known ability of these mAbs to bind to isolated α2 A-domain (21Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These results confirmed the presence of an α2β1recognition site in the CB3(I)-5/6 sequence. In order to determine the structural features of this sequence essential for activity, we synthesized a number of modifications of the peptide 5/6, as follows: peptide desE-5/6, in which the two Glu residues are replaced by Ala (T m(1/2) = 44 °C); peptide GVA-5/6, in which the Glu in GVE is replaced by Ala (T m(1/2) = 41 °C); peptide GAR-5/6, in which the Glu in GER is replaced by Ala (T m(1/2) = 42 °C); and peptide GEA-5/6, in which the Arg in GER is replaced by Ala (T m(1/2) = 38 °C). Binding studies with α2 A-domain indicated that the Glu and Arg residues in GER were important for the recognition of α2β1, while the Glu residue in GVE was not. Thus, there was excellent binding to peptide GVA-5/6, better than to collagen and peptide CB3(I)-5/6, but poor binding to peptides desE-5/6, GEA-5/6, and GAR-5/6 (Fig. 5). Adhesion of these cells to collagen is essentially by a single mechanism involving integrin α2β1 (18Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol.

In the present study, adhesion was measured at 20 °C to ensure that peptides were fully triple-helical. In accord with our previous data (18Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we observed good adhesion of the cells to collagen, which was strongly inhibited by the anti-α2β1 mAb, 6F1 (Fig.6). No significant adhesion above background occurred to peptides CB3(I)-2, -3, -4, and -7, but peptides CB3(I)-5 and -6 supported adhesion, which was always as good as to collagen and was inhibited equally as well by mAb 6F1 (Fig. 6). Cells remaining attached in the presence of 6F1 showed a complete absence of spreading (not shown). Interestingly, HT 1080 cells consistently showed adhesion to peptide CB3(I)-1, around two-thirds of that to collagen, and this adhesion, too, was inhibited by 6F1 (Fig. 6). In confirmation of the existence of an integrin α2β1recognition sequence in the overlap between peptides CB3(I)-5 and -6, peptide CB3(I)-5/6 supported adhesion of HT 1080 cells that was as good as to collagen and was just as susceptible to blockade with 6F1 (Fig.6). Platelet adhesion to immobilized monomeric collagen is Mg2+-dependent and fully inhibitable by an anti-α2β1 mAb such as 6F1 (4Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 7523-7526Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Adhesion to the collagen-related peptide GCP*(GPP*)10GCP*G is largely cation-independent, the small amount of cation-dependent adhesion being secondary to platelet activation (15Morton L.F.

In all cases, adhesion was partly divalent cation-dependent. However, only in the case of peptides CB3(I)-5, -6, and -5/6 was this cation-dependent element of adhesion susceptible to blockade with mAb 6F1 (TableI).Table IEffect of the anti-(α2 subunit) mAb 6F1 on the divalent cation-dependent platelet adhesion to α1CB3-based peptidesSubstrateAdhesion (% of total radioactivity bound)Inhibition by 6F1 of cation-dependent adhesionTotal (+Mg2+)α2β1-independent (+6F1)Cation-independent (+EDTA)Cation-dependent (col 2–col 4)%Collagen151114100CB3(I)-115161050CB3(I)-21617880CB3(I)-31315940CB3(I)-41414590CB3(I)-517721565CB3(I)-61475980CB3(I)-71213840CB3(I)-5/6211615685Adhesion was measured in 96-well plates at 20 °C using51Cr-labeled gel-filtered platelets and is expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity bound.

Following cross-linking, peptides CB3(I)-1 to -6 and CB3(I)-5/6 all showed substantial platelet aggregatory activity when tested at 20 °C. Peptides CB3(I)-6 and -5/6 were consistently more active than collagen fibers. Unexpectedly, CB3(I)-7 was without activity, even when tested at up to 2 mg/ml. The minimum concentration for activity was as follows: CB3(I)-1 to -3, 1 μg/ml; CB3(I)-4, 5 μg/ml; CB3(I)-5, 10 μg/ml; CB3(I)-6 and -5/6, 0.1 μg/ml; CB3(I)-7, > 2.0 mg/ml. For comparison, fibers were active at 0.5 μg/ml. Aggregation stimulated by CB3(I)-5/6 and the inactivity of CB3(I)-7 are shown in Fig. 7. In this study we have identified in the bovine collagen type I fragment α1(I)CB3 a 15-residue sequence, GFP*GERGVEGPP*GPA, corresponding to residues 502–516 of the parent α1(I) chain, that, on the basis of α2β1 and α2 A-domain binding and α2β1-mediated cell adhesion, is an α2β1 recognition sequence. From studies of α2 A-domain binding, we have concluded that the GER triplet is essential for activity, while the Glu in the GVE triplet appears to be unimportant. A GER triplet at this locus is also present in the bovine α2(I) chain and in human α1(I) and α2(I) chains (30Kadler K. Protein Profile; Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril-forming Collagens. 5. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). In an earlier study (18Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we identified part of an α2β1recognition site in the bovine collagen α1(III) chain, residues 522–528. We speculated that the GER sequence close by, equivalent to the GER triplet in the α1(I) sequence studied here, may be involved in α2β1recognition. Evidence presented here for the involvement of a Glu residue in the recognition of α2β1 is particularly intriguing in the light of the crystal structure of the α2 A-domain where modeling studies indicated that a Glu (rather than an Asp) in a collagen triple helix could coordinate with a Mg2+ bound to the integrin A-domain metal ion binding site (31Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The GER motif within the α2β1-binding sequence shows distinct resemblance to the α1β1 recognition site in collagen IV which involves an Asp (rather than Glu) residue at position 461 in the α1(IV) chain and an Arg residue at the same residue position (461) in the α2(IV) chain (32Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kuhn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In our case, the crucial Glu and Arg residues occur in adjacent positions in the same α chain. We do not know as yet whether recognition involves the Glu and Arg residues in the same or in adjacent chains of the triple-helical structure. It is also clear that not all GER sequences in collagen can be acting as α2β1recognition sites since, for example, a GER sequence is present in the inactive peptides CB3(I)-2 and -3. It is of interest that CB3(I)-1, which also contains a GER triplet, can support α2β1-mediated adhesion of HT 1080 cells. This may suggest that α2β1 expressed by HT 1080 cells is slightly different to platelet α2β1. It is known, for example, that α2β1 exhibits a different ligand specificity when expressed on other cell types (33Kirchhofer D. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 615-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Binding of the α2 A-domain to peptide CB3(I)-5/6 was consistently greater than to collagen. The reason for this is not clear, but may reflect a higher density of binding sites in the immobilized peptide than presented by immobilized collagen. Conversely, α2β1 binding was greater to collagen than to CB3(I)-5/6, perhaps reflecting enhancement of collagen binding to α2β1 A-domain by site(s) in the adjacent EF hand domain (35Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HT 1080 cell adhesion to collagen is mediated predominantly by a single α2β1-dependent mechanism. In contrast, platelet adhesion to collagen is a complex phenomenon; while adhesion to immobilized monomeric collagen is a divalent cation-dependent process mediated by α2β1 (4Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M.

Goodall A.H. Humphries M.J. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) involving other receptors such as Gp VI and CD 36 (29Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All the peptides studied here revealed both cation-dependent and -independent adhesion. We assumed any effect of 6F1 to be directed against cation-dependent adhesion, since it is well established that divalent cations (Mg2+) are essential for α2β1 function. As regards platelet adhesion, only the three peptides CB3(I)-5, -6, and -5/6 revealed any sensitivity to 6F1, confirming the location of an α2β1 recognition site in the 5/6 overlap sequence. Cation-dependent adhesion to peptides which is unresponsive to 6F1 probably involves a secondary process of attachment subsequent to primary adhesion which might be mediated by Gp VI. We have observed a similar phenomenon using peptides consisting solely of repeat GPP* sequences where primary cation-independent adhesion (mediated by Gp VI) 3Knight, C. G., Morton, L. F., Onley, D. J., Peachey, A. R., Ichinohe, T., Okuma, M., Farndale, R. W., and Barnes, M. J. (1998) Cardiovasc. Res., in press. is enhanced by a secondary cation-dependent process (15Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In other studies,3 we have found that a peptide consisting of the CB3(I)-5/6 overlap sequence inserted within repeat GPP (rather than GPP*) triplets, fails to exhibit any cation-independent adhesion, but rather, like monomeric collagen, supports cation-dependent adhesion fully mediated by α2β1. This observation supports the view that GPP* sequences in the peptides are responsible for cation-independent adhesion (via Gp VI) and confirms the identification of the 5/6 overlap sequence as an α2β1 recognition sequence. The higher cation-independent adhesion to CB3(I)-5/6 relative to CB3(I)-5 and -6 probably reflects its higher relative content of GPP* triplets. From inhibition studies using short, linear (non-helical) peptides, Santoro and colleagues (11Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7363-7367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified the sequence DGEA, corresponding to residues 435–438 of the α1(I) chain, as an α2β1 recognition site. This sequence occurs in CB3(I)-2 of the present study. However, this peptide failed to bind α2β1 or the α2 A-domain or to support α2β1-mediated adhesion. Fields and colleagues (36Grab B. Miles A.J. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12234-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have also reported that a triple-helical peptide containing DGEA was unable to support integrin (β1)-mediated fibroblast adhesion. We proposed previously that the platelet-aggregatory activity of collagen might be an intrinsic property of the triple helix. This activity could be modified by the presence of sequences that might enhance activity, for example α2β1 recognition sequences, or might diminish activity, for example, by exhibiting a preponderance of negative charges (7Kehrel B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our current studies indicate that the basic aggregatory activity of collagen is not simply a recognition of the triple helix per se but rather a highly specific recognition by platelet Gp VI of GPP* sequences within the collagen triple helix.3 The aggregatory activity of CB3(I)-1 to -6 may be due in large part to the inclusion of the terminal GPP* sequences necessary to ensure the triple-helical conformation required for platelet reactivity (28Barnes M.J. Weiss J.B. Jayson M.I.V. Collagen in Health and Disease. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1982: 179-197Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although all the peptides have the same (GPP*)3 sequence at either end, they reveal a considerable range of activity with the most active able to aggregate platelets at 0.1 μg/ml, whereas others are only active at 10 μg/ml and above. The high activity of peptides CB3(I)-6 and -5/6 might be attributable to the presence of the α2β1 recognition sequence. However, against this, peptide CB3(I)-5, also containing this sequence, is of relatively poor activity. Remarkably, CB3(I)-7, despite having the (GPP*)3 repeat at either end, was unable to induce platelet aggregation. This might indicate the presence in CB3(I)-7 of an inhibitory sequence that could possibly account for the inactivity of the parent fragment α1(I)CB3. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the inactivity of the fragment might be due to an inappropriate distribution or inadequate density of GPP* triplets. Interestingly, the equivalent collagen III fragment, α1(III)CB4, which possesses good aggregatory activity, contains twice as many GPP* triplets as α1(I)CB3 (18Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As speculated previously (18Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Knight C.G.

https://openalex.org/W1979451022,"Nuclear export of intron-containing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA is mediated by the viral Rev protein that contains both an RNA binding domain specific for the viral Rev response element (RRE) and a nuclear export signal (NES). The cellular CRM1 (Exportin1) protein functions as a nuclear export receptor for proteins carrying a Rev-like NES in a process that also requires the GTP bound form of the Ran GTPase. Using purified recombinant factors, we show by co-precipitation, gel mobility shift and protein footprinting assays that full-length Rev protein interacts directly with CRM1 in vitro independently of both the integrity of the characteristic leucine residues of the NES and the presence of the cytotoxin leptomycin B (LMB). Addition of RanGTP induces the formation of an RRE-Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex that is sensitive to LMB, NES mutations, and Ran being charged with GTP. Within this complex, CRM1 is readily cross-linked to Cys89 near the NES of Rev. By protein footprinting, we demonstrate that the NES of Rev and two regions in CRM1 become inaccessible to endoproteinases upon binding suggesting that these regions are involved in protein-protein interactions. Our data are consistent with a model in which CRM1 is the nuclear export receptor for the Rev-RRE ribonucleoprotein complex and that RanGTP binds to a preformed Rev-CRM1 complex and specifies a functional interaction with the NES."
https://openalex.org/W2101421032,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), which convert glucose 6-phosphate plus UDP-glucose to trehalose, are part of the trehalose synthase complex. In addition to the TPS1 (previously also called GGS1, CIF1, BYP1,FDP1, GLC6, and TSS1) andTPS2 (also described as HOG2 andPFK3) gene products, this complex also contains a regulatory subunit encoded by TSL1. We have constructed a set of isogenic strains carrying all possible combinations of deletions of these three genes and of TPS3, a homologue ofTSL1 identified by systematic sequencing. Deletion ofTPS1 totally abolished TPS activity and measurable trehalose, whereas deletion of any of the other genes in most cases reduced both. Similarly, deletion of TPS2 completely abolished TPP activity, and deletion of any of the other genes resulted in a reduction of this activity. Therefore, it appears that all subunits are required for optimal enzymatic activity. Since we observed measurable trehalose in strains lacking all but the TPS1gene, some phosphatase activity in addition to Tps2 can hydrolyze trehalose 6-phosphate. Deletion of TPS3, in particular in atsl1Δ background, reduced both TPS and TPP activities and trehalose content. Deletion of TPS2, TSL1, orTPS3 and, in particular, of TSL1 plusTPS3 destabilized the trehalose synthase complex. We conclude that Tps3 is a fourth subunit of the complex with functions partially redundant to those of Tsl1. Among the four genes studied,TPS1 is necessary and sufficient for growth on glucose and fructose. Even when overproduced, none of the other subunits could take over this function of Tps1 despite the homology shared by all four proteins. A portion of Tps1 appears to occur in a form not bound by the complex. Whereas TPS activity in the complex is inhibited by Pi, Pi stimulates the monomeric form of Tps1. We discuss the possible role of differentially regulated Tps1 in a complex-bound or monomeric form in light of the requirement of Tps1 for trehalose production and for growth on glucose and fructose. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), which convert glucose 6-phosphate plus UDP-glucose to trehalose, are part of the trehalose synthase complex. In addition to the TPS1 (previously also called GGS1, CIF1, BYP1,FDP1, GLC6, and TSS1) andTPS2 (also described as HOG2 andPFK3) gene products, this complex also contains a regulatory subunit encoded by TSL1. We have constructed a set of isogenic strains carrying all possible combinations of deletions of these three genes and of TPS3, a homologue ofTSL1 identified by systematic sequencing. Deletion ofTPS1 totally abolished TPS activity and measurable trehalose, whereas deletion of any of the other genes in most cases reduced both. Similarly, deletion of TPS2 completely abolished TPP activity, and deletion of any of the other genes resulted in a reduction of this activity. Therefore, it appears that all subunits are required for optimal enzymatic activity. Since we observed measurable trehalose in strains lacking all but the TPS1gene, some phosphatase activity in addition to Tps2 can hydrolyze trehalose 6-phosphate. Deletion of TPS3, in particular in atsl1Δ background, reduced both TPS and TPP activities and trehalose content. Deletion of TPS2, TSL1, orTPS3 and, in particular, of TSL1 plusTPS3 destabilized the trehalose synthase complex. We conclude that Tps3 is a fourth subunit of the complex with functions partially redundant to those of Tsl1. Among the four genes studied,TPS1 is necessary and sufficient for growth on glucose and fructose. Even when overproduced, none of the other subunits could take over this function of Tps1 despite the homology shared by all four proteins. A portion of Tps1 appears to occur in a form not bound by the complex. Whereas TPS activity in the complex is inhibited by Pi, Pi stimulates the monomeric form of Tps1. We discuss the possible role of differentially regulated Tps1 in a complex-bound or monomeric form in light of the requirement of Tps1 for trehalose production and for growth on glucose and fructose. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose is synthesized by a large enzyme complex comprising the two catalytic activities of trehalose biosynthesis: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) 1The abbreviations used are: TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; TPP, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase; Tre-6-P, trehalose 6-phosphate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; TPP, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase; Tre-6-P, trehalose 6-phosphate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) (1Cabib E.

Several genes encoding subunits of the trehalose synthase complex have been cloned. TheTPS1/TSS1 gene has been cloned as encoding the smallest (56 kDa) subunit responsible for TPS activity (4Bell W.

Two-hybrid analysis has indicated that it might also encode a functional component of the trehalose synthase complex (7Reinders A. Bürckert N. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Boller T. Wiemken A. De Virgilio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and its expression is coregulated with that of TPS1/TSS1 andTPS2 (8Winderickx J. de Winde J.H. Crauwels M.

The cloning of the TPS1 gene has revealed a novel connection between trehalose metabolism and the control of glycolysis (for review, see Ref. 15Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain this connection. 1) The Tps1 protein has, in addition to its function in trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre-6-P) synthesis, a separate regulatory function that is responsible for the restriction of glucose influx by interaction with glucose transport and sugar kinase activity (14Thevelein J.M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 2) Trehalose metabolism prevents overflow of glycolysis during the initiation of glucose fermentation by deviation of sugar phosphates into trehalose synthesis with concomitant recovery of free Pi required by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction (16Hohmann S. Neves M.J. de Koning W. Alijo R. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 3) Tre-6-P, the intermediate of trehalose biosynthesis, restricts sugar influx into glycolysis by inhibition of hexokinase activity (17Blazquez M.A. Lagunas R. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All genes encoding subunits of the trehalose synthase complex display significant sequence homology to the TPS1 gene (5Vuorio O.E. Kalkkinen N. Londesborough J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6De Virgilio C. Bürckert N. Bell W. Jenà P. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that despite this homology, none of the other subunits of the trehalose synthase complex, singly or in combination, can take over the function of Tps1 in synthesizing Tre-6-P or in controlling glucose influx into glycolysis. Using a set of strains with all possible combinations of deletions in the four genes encoding the trehalose synthase complex, we report on the contribution of the different gene products to the two catalytic activities of the trehalose synthase complex in vitro, to regulatory properties of TPS activity in vitro, and to trehalose accumulation in vivo. In addition, we show that part of the Tps1 protein is apparently present as free protein, that this monomeric Tps1 protein has catalytic activity, and that it displays different regulatory properties compared with the Tps1 protein in the trehalose synthase complex. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Overexpression of TPS1, TPS2, TPS3, and TSL1 was carried out with a YEplac195 (URA3) plasmid containing the respective genes behind their own promoter. The cells were grown at 30 °C, as indicated, either to exponential phase or to stationary phase and on rich or synthetic medium with glucose (2%, w/v), galactose (2%, w/v) or glycerol (3%, v/v) as carbon source. Rich medium contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract and 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone. Synthetic medium was prepared according to Sherman et al. (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

The growth measurements on solid agar medium (see Fig. 7) were performed on rich medium with 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and the respective sugar as indicated.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this study All strains are isogenic to W303–1A and carry the same markers.StrainGenotypeRef. sourceW303–1AMAT a ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 can1–100 GAL mal SUC233Thomas B.J.

The coding region of the TSL1 and TPS3 genes was deleted completely using the same polymerase chain reaction approach (20Eberhardt I. Hohmann S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and replaced by the marker genes as indicated in TableI. Trehalose was determined as described by Neveset al. (21Neves M.J. Jorge J.A. François J.M. Terenzi H.F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Tre-6-P was quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (22Hohmann S. Bell W. Neves M.J. Valckx D. Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the expression of trehalose and Tre-6-P content as estimated intracellular concentration, the following conversion factor was used: 7 mg of protein equals 100 μl of intracellular volume. TPS activity in crude cell extracts or after purification by Superose 6 FPLC (see below) was determined according to Hottiger et al. (23Hottiger T. Schmutz P. Wiemken A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and TPP activity according to De Virgilio et al. (6De Virgilio C. Bürckert N. Bell W. Jenà P. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as microkatals/g of protein (1 microkatal/g of protein = 1 μmol/s/g of protein). Protein was determined by the biuret method (24Zamenhoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 696-704Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Extracts of stationary phase cells were loaded on a Superose 6 HR 16/50 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mmNH4HCO3, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. The flow rate used was 12 ml/h, and the volume of the fractions collected was 0.8 ml. The proteins in the samples from the gel filtration column were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and washed once with cold acetone. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.1m NaOH before addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Conditions for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted by electroporation from the SDS gel onto nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the membranes were treated with blocking solution and incubated with the primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-trehalose synthase complex antibody, kindly provided by Dr. J. Londesborough, VTT, Espoo, Finland) overnight at room temperature in a 1:2000 dilution. After washing, the bound primary antibodies were detected using monoclonal anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated immunoglobulin. We have constructed a set of 16 isogenic strains in the W303-1A background displaying all possible combinations of deletions in the four known genes encoding the trehalose synthase complex (Table I). For all genes, the entire open reading frame was deleted. TheTPS1 gene was essential to detect significant TPS activity whatever the combination of other genes present (Fig.1). This was true in exponential as well as in stationary phase. However, in the presence of a functionalTPS1 gene, deletion of the other genes also affected TPS activity, both in exponential and in stationary phase. The single deletion of TPS3 or TSL1 had the least effect, but the double deletion caused a strong decrease in TPS activity. This is the first evidence that TPS3 encodes an active functional component of the trehalose synthase complex. In the triple deletion strain tps2Δ tsl1Δ tps3Δ, significant TPS activity was detected, indicating that theTPS1 gene product displays TPS activity in the absence of all other (known) subunits. TPP activity was entirely absent in all strains lacking TPS2, both in exponential and in stationary phase (Fig.2). Deletion of TSL1 and/orTPS3 had only a limited effect on TPP activity, especially in exponential phase, but deletion of both genes reduced TPP activity under either growth condition. Deletion of TPS1 severely reduced TPP activity, whatever other gene combination present. Trehalose and Tre-6-P levels were determined only in stationary phase cells because, in wild-type strains, trehalose content is very low in exponential phase. In strains lacking TPS1,no trehalose or Tre-6-P was detected (Fig.3). Deletion of TSL1 orTPS3 slightly reduced trehalose content, whereas the double deletion strain had <50% of the trehalose level in the wild-type strain. In addition, the tsl1Δ tps3Δ andtps3Δ strains showed a somewhat elevated Tre-6-P level compared with the wild-type strain. Very high increases in Tre-6-P were observed in all strains containing tps2Δ. Additional deletion of TSL1 or TPS3 had only a little effect on this elevated Tre-6-P level. All tps2Δ strains, however, still contained high levels of trehalose. We fractionated yeast cell extracts according to molecular mass of the proteins using Superose 6 FPLC, and we used Western blot analysis to detect the presence of the protein components of the trehalose synthase complex after separation of all proteins in each fraction by SDS gel electrophoresis (Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Antibodies raised against the whole trehalose synthase complex (kindly provided by Dr. J. Londesborough) were used. We consistently detected the smallest component (Tps1) both as part of the trehalose synthase complex and as apparently free monomeric protein, at least not bound to the complex. The other subunits were mainly or only detected in the trehalose synthase complex. They seem to be present at lower levels than Tps1, although it cannot be excluded that the reactivity of the antibodies for the other components of the trehalose synthase complex is lower.Figure 5Western blot analysis of subunits of the trehalose synthase complex in cell fractions first separated by Superose 6 FPLC and subsequently submitted to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Antibodies raised against the purified trehalose synthase complex were used.

Antibodies raised against the purified trehalose synthase complex were used. Tps1, Tsl1, and Tps2 were detected in fractions 16 and 17 (±600 kDa). Dimers of Tps2 and/or Tps1 and Tps2 might be present in fractions 20 and 21 (±200 kDa). Free Tps1 was present in fractions 23 and 24 (±50 kDa), with possible Tps1 dimers in fraction 22.

A, extract of the wild-type strain;B, part of the same extract incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before separation by FPLC. The molecular mass standards used for calibration are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To check whether the presence of the free Tps1 protein might be the result of unspecific breakdown of the trehalose synthase complex, we incubated cell extracts for an extended period of time (30 min) at 30 °C. However, this treatment did not cause any change in the protein pattern of the FPLC-fractionated cell extracts (Fig. 4), indicating that the trehalose synthase complex is quite stable and that free Tps1 protein is probably also present in vivo. Deletion of either TSL1 or TPS3 appeared to destabilize the trehalose synthase complex to some extent since more free Tps1 protein and more breakdown products were detected (Fig.5, A–C). However, in both cases, Tps2 and a strong band of Tps1 could still be detected at the normal elution position of the trehalose synthase complex. Deletion ofTSL1 produced a more dramatic effect than deletion ofTPS3, with a higher proportion of Tps1 and also Tps2 being detected free from the complex. In cell extracts of atsl1Δ tps3Δ strain, on the other hand, no evidence for the presence of the trehalose synthase complex was observed (Fig. 5 D). All Tps2 was detected free from the complex. The clear difference in complex formation in the presence and absence of Tps3 in the tsl1Δ strain confirms that it is part of the trehalose synthase complex. In all samples, a slight background of Tps1 was also detected, possibly caused by unspecific retention by the Superose beads. Deletion of TPS2 caused the most dramatic effect, with only Tps1 free from the complex being present (Fig. 5 E). We also investigated whether overexpression of TPS2, TSL1,and TPS3 separately or TPS2 and TSL1simultaneously could reduce the level of free Tps1 protein. In none of these cases, however, was a reduction observed (data not shown). This also indicates that the expression of neither of these subunits is limiting for the formation of trehalose synthase complexes. Overexpression of TPS2 and TSL1, both separately and combined, was clearly observed on the Western blots (data not shown). Overexpression of TPS3, on the other hand, did not result in the appearance of an additional band, probably because of the failure of the antibodies to react with the Tps3 protein. In a control experiment, the TPS3-containing plasmid was introduced into a tsl1Δ tps3Δ strain. This restored the presence of the trehalose synthase complex in the high molecular mass fractions, confirming that TPS3 was truly expressed from this plasmid (data not shown). In FPLC-fractionated extracts of wild-type cells, TPS activity could be measured only at the position of the trehalose synthase complex and not at the position of the free Tps1 protein (data not shown). However, in extracts from a tps2Δ tsl1Δtps3Δ, strain TPS activity was clearly detected (see below), which fits with the presence of trehalose and Tre-6-P in vivo in cells of such a strain. The growth properties of the 16 different deletion strains on galactose and fructose are shown in Fig. 6 A. All strains lacking the TPS1 gene were unable to grow on fructose whatever other combination of genes present. In addition, the presence of the TPS1 gene was sufficient for growth on fructose whatever other combination of genes present (Fig. 6 A). Similar results were obtained for growth on glucose, except that the growth defect was somewhat less stringent than for growth on fructose (data not shown). Overexpression of any one of the four genes in a wild-type strain did not cause a noticeable growth defect on glucose or fructose (data not shown). In addition, overexpression ofTPS2, TPS3, or TSL1 in atps1Δ strain was unable to restore or even improve growth on glucose or fructose (Fig. 6 B). We also investigated the effect of deletion of the subunits encoded byTPS2, TSL1, and TPS3 on the regulation of TPS1-encoded TPS activity. The enzyme from wild-type cells is inhibited by inorganic Pi with aK i of 1–2 mm (Fig.7) (2Vandercammen A. François J. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Londesborough J. Vuorio O.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of TSL1,but not TPS3, slightly reduced the inhibition by Pi (Fig. 7). This was observed both with cells grown on glucose until stationary phase and with exponential phase cells grown on glycerol (Fig. 7). Deletion of both TSL1 andTPS3, deletion of TPS2, or deletion of all three genes eliminated Pi inhibition and switched it into Pi stimulation (Fig. 8). This was observed both for cells grown on glucose until stationary phase (Fig. 8) and with exponential phase cells grown on glycerol (data not shown). In the latter case, the activities in the strainstsl1Δ tps3Δ, tps2Δ, andtsl1Δ tps3Δ tps2Δ in the absence of Pi were 0.049, 0.130, and 0.024 microkatals/g, respectively, and they increased to 344.7, 261.3, and 438.8% of these values in the presence of 10 mm Pi. TPS activity as a function of the Pi concentration in the assay is shown in Figs. 7 and 8 as relative activity compared with the activity in the absence of Pi, which was taken as 100%. The absolute values for the activity in the absence of Piare indicated in the legends of Figs. 7 and 8. We also measured phosphate inhibition of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase in crude cell extracts and after FPLC purification of the complex from cells grown on rich yeast extract/bacto peptone/glucose medium, and we found that, in this case, the activity was still inhibited by phosphate, but much less (maximum 50%) compared with enzyme from cells grown on synthetic glucose medium (data not shown). TPS activity is strongly stimulated by fructose 6-phosphate (26Londesborough J. Vuorio O.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This effect can be observed clearly only in extracts from cells of a phosphoglucoisomerase mutant. In extracts of wild-type strains, phosphoglucoisomerase activity converts part of the TPS substrate glucose 6-phosphate into fructose 6-phosphate, which then acts as a stimulator of TPS activity. Our measurements of inhibition by Pi were carried out in cell extracts of the wild-type strain without added fructose. However, because of the presence of phosphoglucoisomerase, an equilibrium mixture of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate was rapidly formed in the test medium. Probably because of this reason, further addition of fructose 6-phosphate only slightly stimulated TPS activity (±20%). This additional activation did not appear to be affected by deletion of the other subunits of the trehalose synthase complex (data not shown). In the yeastS. cerevisiae, trehalose is synthesized by a large multisubunit complex comprising the two catalytic activities TPS and TPP (1Cabib E. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 259-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vandercammen A. François J. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Londesborough J. Vuorio O.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is different from Escherichia coli, where the two enzymatic activities reside in separate enzymes encoded by the genes otsA (responsible for TPS activity) andotsB (responsible for TPP activity) (27Giæver H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strøm A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2841-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kaasen I. Falkenberg P. Styrvold O.B. Strøm A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 889-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kaasen I. Mcdougall J. Strøm A.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Up to now, four genes have been identified that appear to encode components of the trehalose synthase complex in S. cerevisiae:TPS1, TPS2, TPS3, and TSL1. TPS1 is homologous to otsA from E. coli and remarkably also over its entire sequence to each of the other yeast subunits (∼35% identity in each case). Interestingly,otsB shows homology only to the C-terminal part of theTPS2 gene product, which is therefore probably responsible for the TPP activity of Tps2 (29Kaasen I. Mcdougall J. Strøm A.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The comparison between the yeast andE. coli enzymes shows that the homology among the four genes in yeast might play a role in the formation of the trehalose synthase complex. Why yeast employs a complex to synthesize trehalose is not clear, but may have to do with improved efficiency and/or control of trehalose synthesis by a complex of the two enzymatic activities. In addition, it might also have to do with the role played by theTPS1 gene product and/or the intermediate Tre-6-P in the control of glucose influx into yeast glycolysis (15Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S.

Possibly, trehalose synthesis by the complex allows a tighter control of the cellular Tre-6-P level, which otherwise might cause too much inhibition of hexokinase activity. Normally, one would expect most of the Tre-6-P to be channeled inside the complex and only small amounts to leak out into the cytosol.

One mutant, P8A*, does not dimerize. However, it has wild type binding affinity, stimulates chemotaxis, inhibits adenylate cyclase, and stimulates calcium influx with wild type potency and efficacy. These data suggest that MCP-1 binds and activates its receptor as a monomer. In contrast, Y13A*, another monomeric mutant, has a 100-fold weaker binding affinity, is a much less potent inhibitor of adenylate cyclase and stimulator of calcium influx, and is unable to stimulate chemotaxis. Thus Tyr13 may make important contacts with the receptor that are required for high affinity binding and signal transduction. We also explored whether a mutant, [1+9–76]MCP-1 (MCP-1 lacking residues 2–8), antagonizes wild type MCP-1 by competitive inhibition, or by a dominant negative mechanism wherein heterodimers of MCP-1 and [1+9–76]MCP-1 bind to the receptor but are signaling incompetent. Consistent with the finding that MCP-1 can bind and activate the receptor as a monomer, we demonstrate that binding of MCP-1 in the presence of [1+9–76]MCP-1 over a range of concentrations of both ligands fits well to a simple model in which monomeric [1+9–76]MCP-1 functions as a competitive inhibitor of monomeric MCP-1. These results are crucial for elucidating the molecular details of receptor binding and activation, for interpreting mutagenesis data, for understanding how antagonistic chemokine variants function, and for the design of receptor antagonists.

Chemokines are small secreted proteins that function as intercellular messengers to control migration and activation of specific subsets of leukocytes (1Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Crit. Rev.

This process is mediated by the interaction of chemokines with seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors on the surface of target cells.

Thus a wide range of clinically important diseases are associated with chemokines and their receptors, motivating many studies to understand the molecular details of chemokine function. Chemokines have been classified into two major families based on their pattern of cysteine residues, their chromosomal location, and their cell specificities (22Schall T.J. Bacon K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). α-Chemokines such as IL-8 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; [1+9–76]MCP-1, MCP-1 lacking residues 2–8; WT, wild type MCP-1; WT*, WT MCP-1 with a mutation of M64I; WT*(C77), WT* with a cysteine added to the C terminus; [1+9–76](C77), [1+9–76]MCP-1 with a cysteine added to the C terminus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; [1+9–76]MCP-1, MCP-1 lacking residues 2–8; WT, wild type MCP-1; WT*, WT MCP-1 with a mutation of M64I; WT*(C77), WT* with a cysteine added to the C terminus; [1+9–76](C77), [1+9–76]MCP-1 with a cysteine added to the C terminus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. have a conserved CXC cysteine motif and act predominantly on neutrophils, whereas β-chemokines have a CC signature and attract monocytes and T-cells.

Mutagenesis studies, particularly of α- and β-chemokines, have provided some insight into the structural determinants of receptor binding and the specificity of these proteins, but many details have yet to emerge. Considerable effort has been devoted to characterizing the stochiometry of chemokine-receptor complexes because most chemokines oligomerize to an extent that depends on concentration and pH (26Lowman H.B.

Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have also revealed a striking correlation between chemokine class and mode of dimerization (38Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimerization may play an important role in chemokine function. A key question, however, is whether dimerization is required for receptor binding and activation or whether it plays a more subtle role in protein stability, regulation, surface presentation and retention, formation of the chemotactic gradient, or other processes unrelated to chemotaxis. In the case of the CXC chemokine IL-8, monomeric mutants were shown to recruit and activate neutrophils in vitro as efficiently as wild type (26Lowman H.B. Fairbrother W.J. Slagle P.H. Kabakoff R. Liu J. Shire S. Hebert C.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), consistent with the view that it interacts with its receptor as a monomer. For the CC chemokine, MCP-1, some data suggest that a dimer may be the receptor-bound form of the protein (29Zhang Y. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In these studies, a heterogeneous mixture of chemically cross-linked MCP-1 was shown to be active in chemotaxis assays. In addition, a deletion mutant lacking residues 2–8 ([1+9–76]MCP-1), which acts as a receptor antagonist, was also shown to inhibit chemotaxis by wild type but not by chemically cross-linked MCP-1. Finally, [1+9–76]MCP-1 containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag coprecipitated iodinated MCP-1 in an immunoprecipitation assay. Based on these results, it was postulated that MCP-1 interacts as a dimer and that [1+9–76]MCP-1 acts as an dominant negative antagonist by formation of inactive heterodimers with the wild type protein. Although this conclusion is consistent with the data, the heterogeneous nature of the cross-linked MCP-1 species allows alternative interpretations. Other data including the function of IL-8 obligate monomers, geometric considerations based on the three-dimensional structure of MCP-1, and the best data and models regarding G-protein-coupled receptor structure and function (39Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 40Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev.

Because resolving this issue is necessary for a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of leukocyte migration and for the modeling and utilization of structural data for the design of receptor antagonists, we felt compelled to investigate further whether MCP-1 can bind and activate its receptor as a monomer. To explore the requirement of dimerization in the interaction of MCP-1 with its receptor, we mutated residues that contribute significantly to the dimer interface and assessed the effect of these mutations on receptor binding, on activation, and on dimerization. We also characterized the aggregation state of [1+9–76]MCP-1 at concentrations up to the millimolar range to assess whether it can form a homodimer. Finally, to elucidate the mechanism by which [1+9–76]MCP-1 acts as a receptor antagonist, we carried out binding competition experiments to address whether it functions as a dominant negative or classic competitive inhibitor. With the exception of [1+9–76]MCP-1, all mutants were made in the context of MCP-1 M64I, referred to as WT*, and expressed in E. coli. We have demonstrated that WT* behaves identically to WT in binding and activity assays (see Table I). This alteration in the primary structure improves the purity and homogeneity of the mutants by eliminating the formation of species containing methionine-sulfoxide at position 64.Table ISummary of binding and activity data for WT MCP-1 and all mutantsMutationBinding to THP-1 cellsBinding to CCR2-CHL cellsInhibition of cAMP synthesisStimulation Ca+2influxStimulation of chemotaxisFoldK dFoldK dFoldIC50FoldEC50FoldEC50Mut/wtnmMut/wtnmMut/wtnmMut/wtnmMut/wtnm[1–76] (Wild type)1.00.035 ± 0.021 (441)1.00.030 ± 0.017 (46)1.00.048 ± 0.017 (21)1.03.39 ± 2.3 (19)1.00.360 ± 0.315 (16)[1–76, M64I] (Wild Type*)0.90.031 ± 0.018 (5)0.90.027 ± 0.016 (6)1.10.054 ± 0.022 (4)0.50.170 ± 0.085 (2)[P8A]*1.00.035 ± 0.015 (4)0.70.020 ± 0.012 (4)0.5bp < 0.01, significant.0.024 ± 0.009 (4)0.41.49 ± 0.80 (3)0.20.089 ± 0.003 (2)[V9A]*1.30.046 ± 0.016 (5)1.40.041 ± 0.012 (5)2.10.098 ± 0.068 (3)0.50.175 ± 0.021 (2)[V9E]*6.2ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.217 ± 0.015 (4)7.6ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.229 ± 0.009 (2)13.4ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.641 ± 0.339 (4)6.3ap < 0.001, highly significant.2.27 ± 0.55 (3)[V9A + T10A]*2.30.080 ± 0.027 (2)2.8bp < 0.01, significant.0.083 ± 0.020 (2)8.3ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.398 ± 0.018 (2)[T10E]*20ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.704 ± 0.298 (7)27ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.801 ± 0.510 (8)118ap < 0.001, highly significant.5.654 ± 3.936 (5)64ap < 0.001, highly significant.23.0 ± 14.1 (2)[Y13A]*95ap < 0.001, highly significant.3.319 ± 1.433 (20)160ap < 0.001, highly significant.4.768 ± 2.973 (6)1065ap < 0.001, highly significant.50.82 ± 36.48 (11)45ap < 0.001, highly significant.153 ± 109 (2)Antagonist>100,000dNo chemotaxis was observed at 100 μm, the highest concentration tested.(4)[1 + 9–76]6.8ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.240 ± 0.153 (5)7.2ap < 0.001, highly significant.0.215 ± 0.033 (3)109ap < 0.001, highly significant.5.198 ± 4.34 (5)Antagonist>200,000cNo calcium influx was observed at 200 μm, the highest concentration tested.(2)Antagonist>10,000eNo chemotaxis was observed at 10 μm, the highest concentration tested.

Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of the WT* template and cloned into a pET3 based plasmid, pAED-4 (44Doerring D.S. Functional and Structural Studies of a Small f-actin Binding Domain. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Plasmids were then transformed into TAP302 cells, 2S. Lichter, T. M. Handel, H. J. George, and T. Patterson, unpublished results. which are BL21 pLys S cells engineered with a thioredoxin reductase knockout to make the intracellular redox potential more conducive to disulfide bond formation. Using this strain, disulfide bonds appear to be formed in the cell, eliminating the need for a refolding step. Cells were grown in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillan and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C in standard 2.8-liter shaker flasks. When the cell density reached 0.6 A 600, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 1 h, rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 24 μm. Cells were incubated with shaking for an additional 3–4 h and harvested by centrifugation. 15N-Labeled proteins were expressed in the same manner except with MOPS (45Neidardt F. Bloch P. Smith D. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) minimal medium containing15N-ammonium sulfate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) in place of Luria broth. Post-induction times varied from 3 to 18 h. Typically, proteins were purified from 1.5-liter E. colicells, harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 6000 ×g. Cells were lysed in 200 ml of buffer by sonication on ice for three 5-min cycles with 5 min of cooling between cycles, using a 1.25-cm horn type sonicator at 80–90% power. The lysis buffer contained 10 mm K2PO4, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3000 units DNase I. Cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,800 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C and then loaded on a 40-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with lysis buffer. Protein was eluted with a gradient of NaCl in 10 mmK2PO4, pH 7.5; typically MCP-1 mutants elute at 0.4 ± 0.1 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a 4.6 × 250 mm C18 column with a 5-μm particle size and 300-Å pore size. Proteins were eluted using a gradient of increasing acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; typically, proteins eluted at 34 ± 5% acetonitrile. They were then lyophilized, dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 35 mm Tris, pH 8, reacted with 15 μg of aminopeptidase (Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ)/1 mg of protein for 36 h at room temperature, and repurified by reversed-phase HPLC. Aminopeptidase treatment removes only the N-terminal methionine when proline is the second residue of the mature protein. The protein was then lyophilized, redissolved in water at 1–5 mg/ml, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. These methods typically yielded 0.5–5 mg of purified protein/1.5 liter of bacteria. The N-terminal truncation mutant, [1+9–76]MCP-1, was expressed as a secreted protein in Pichia strain GS115 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using expression vectors, pPIC9 (Invitrogen). Expression cassettes consist of the AOX1 promoter, a secretion sequence, [1+9–76]MCP-1 cDNA derivative, and a transcription terminator. Vector pPIC9 uses the Saccharomyces α-mating factor prepro-secretion sequence, and we inserted the [1+9–76]MCP-1 gene immediately after the Lys-Arg codons of the α-mating factor sequence. Thus the sequence of the junction between these two proteins is GVSLEKR↓QVTCCY, where the downward facing arrow represents the cleavage site of the fusion protein, pSRF224. Expression cassettes were integrated into the AOX1 genes. This was done by first linearizing the expression plasmids at the edges of the 5′AOX1 and 3′ AOX1 homology region usingBglII and subsequently transforming into yeast. Successful integration was determined by histidine prototropy, mut−phenotype, and MCP-1 expression. Pichia strains containing MCP-1 expression cassettes were grown to saturation by shaking for up to 2 days at 30 °C in noninducing medium. Noninducing medium is BMGY (Invitrogen), containing buffered complex medium and 1% glycerol. Two liters of cells could be grown in this manner. Expression of MCP-1 was induced by resuspending the cells in 400 ml of medium containing 0.5% methanol and either BMMY (Invitrogen) containing buffered complex medium or synthetic medium.

These methods typically yielded 30 mg/liter of crude secreted MCP-1 derivative and often 20 mg/liter of purified protein. Proteins were purified and characterized as described above for E. colimaterial, starting with the cell growth medium but without the aminopeptidase step. The molecular masses of all proteins were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry and differed by no more than 1 Da from the expected value. Protein purity was analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC; the average purity was 95 ± 5%. All protein concentrations were determined using an ε280 extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid composition (48Gill S. von Hippel P. Anal.

Jarnagin, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, binding was measured using membranes prepared from two cell lines, THP-1 and CCR2-CHL. Each assay was composed of membranes, 50 pm125I-MCP, MCP buffer, protease inhibitors, and test protein. Equilibrium was achieved by incubation at 28 °C for 90 min. Membrane-bound 125I-MCP was collected by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in polyethyleneimine and bovine serum albumin, followed by four rapid washes with approximately 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. MCP buffer consists of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Protease inhibitors include 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, and 0.35 μg/ml pepstatin. THP-1 cells are from a human monocyte cell line (ATCC TIP-202) that expresses both CCR1 and CCR2. CCR2-CHL cells are Chinese hamster lung cells (ATCC CRL-1657) that have been stably transformed with an expression vector, pSW104, bearing the human CCR2b receptor and a neomycin resistance marker plasmid as described previously (49Jarnagin K. Bhakta S. Zuppan P. Yee C. Ho T. Phan T. Tahilramani R. Pease J.H. Miller A. Freedman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28277-28286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The CCR2-CHL and the THP-1–4X cells express approximately 10,000 CCR2 receptors per cell, whereas THP-1, HEK-293-CCR2b, and CHO-K1-CCR2b-cAMP-Luc-neo-22 cells express approximately 5000 CCR2 receptors/cell (see below).

Briefly, adenylate cyclase inhibition was measured by direct cAMP measurement using stable HEK293-CCR2b-transfected cells that were labeled with [H3]adenine, stimulated with forskolin, and inhibited by exposure to the appropriate mutant for 15 min. cAMP was isolated with ion exchange chromatography and quantified by radioactivity determination. Adenylate cyclase inhibition was also measured using the firefly-luciferase reporter gene attached 3′ to a cAMP response enhancer, CREB; these elements were contained within the cell clone, CHO-K1-CCR2b-cAMP-Luc-neo-22. The assay measured adenylate cyclase inhibition after 6 h of exposure to the appropriate mutant in the presence of forskolin. Luciferase expression was quantified using the Luclite substrate (Packard Inst, Downers Grove, IL). Cytosolic calcium influx was measured in THP-1–4X cells loaded with the fluorescent dye Fura-2-AM (50Blue Jr., D.R. Craig D.A. Ransom J.T. Camacho J.A. Insel P.A. Clarke D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1588-1596PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of fluorescence intensity was done by integrating the signal for 82 s following the addition of mutant protein. Conversion of signal intensity to calcium molarity was done by standard methods (51Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).4 Chemotaxis was measured over 1 h using THP-1–5X cells in a 96-well Boyden chamber apparatus. Cell migration through the polycarbonate filter was quantified by fluorescent staining using propidium iodide in 0.1% Triton X-100. These assays typically gave a stimulated to unstimulated migration of 4–10-fold (average 6-fold) using 3 nm MCP-1, a maximally effective concentration for this protein. All 441 determinations of the K d for the WT protein were tested for statistical normality; the data are log-normally distributed as would be expected from the ratio definition ofK d. Similarly, the WT tests of CCR2-CHL binding, inhibition of cAMP synthesis, calcium flux, and chemotaxis were found to be log-normally distributed. Thus all of the statistical tests on the K d values and IC50 values were performed as pK d values and pIC50values. Significance is noted in Table I as explai"

However, the factors that affect permeability to gases remain unclear because of the difficulty of accurately measuring gas movements. To determine the roles of lipid composition and the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel in altering CO2 flux across membranes, we developed a fluorometric assay to measure CO2 entry into vesicles. Maximal CO2 flux was ∼1000-fold above control values with 0.5 mg/ml carbonic anhydrase. Unilamellar phospholipid vesicles of varying composition gave widely varying water permeabilities but similar CO2 permeabilities at 25 °C. When AQP1 purified from human red blood cells was reconstituted into proteoliposomes, however, it increased water and CO2 permeabilities markedly. Both increases were abolished with HgCl2, and the mercurial inhibition was reversible with β-mercaptoethanol. We conclude that unlike water and small nonelectrolytes, CO2permeation is not significantly altered by lipid bilayer composition or fluidity. AQP1 clearly serves to increase CO2 permeation, likely through the water pore; under certain circumstances, gas permeation through membranes is protein-mediated.

AQP1 clearly serves to increase CO2 permeation, likely through the water pore; under certain circumstances, gas permeation through membranes is protein-mediated. Ions require specific membrane transporters or channels to traverse the lipid bilayer. Uncharged molecules, however, may cross the bilayer either through specific channels or by partitioning into the bilayer and diffusing through the hydrophobic region of the lipid molecules (1Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar, 2Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). Until recently, small uncharged molecules, such as water, were believed to diffuse freely across the bilayer (1Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers and Pumps: An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar, 2Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality.

Physiol. 1996; 271: F243-F245PubMed Google Scholar), requiring the presence of selective channels like those for water (aquaporins) to permit the flux of these small nonelectrolytes (3Zeidel M.L. Am.

Membrane permeability to gases has been less extensively studied, however, because of the difficulty of accurately measuring gas fluxes. Gross movement of O2 and CO2 across the lung has been measured, as has NH3 permeability of some membranes (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 6Kikeri D. Sun A. Zeidel M.L. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Waisbren S.J.

Although it has been accepted that gases are freely permeable across membranes, rapid flux of gases across some membranes would upset carefully regulated electrolyte concentrations. For example, NH3/NH4+ balance requires restricted permeability to NH3, and low NH3 permeability has been demonstrated in gastric glands (7Waisbren S.J. Geibel J.P. Modlin I.M. Boron W.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and renal thick ascending limb epithelia (6Kikeri D. Sun A. Zeidel M.L. Hebert S.C.

Recent studies have also provided evidence that aquaporins may be capable of mediating flux of CO2 across membranes (9Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed a method to measure CO2 fluxes across the membranes of unilamellar vesicles. In liposomes or proteoliposomes with entrapped 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) 1The abbreviations used are: CF, 5,6-carboxyfluorescein; AQP1, aquaporin 1; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CF, 5,6-carboxyfluorescein; AQP1, aquaporin 1; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. and carbonic anhydrase, we measured the rate of pH drop engendered when abrupt exposure to external CO2/HCO3− leads to rapid entry of CO2 into the vesicle and generation of carbonic acid. Using this method we compared water and CO2permeability of a variety of membranes and demonstrated that aquaporin 1 (AQP1) reconstituted as the sole protein in proteoliposomes mediates CO2 flux. Powdered lipids were suspended in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.40, and either 1.0 mm CF for CO2 measurements or 20.0 mm CF for water measurements (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), either without or with 0.5 mg/ml bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (CA) (3240 Wilbur-Anderson units/mg of protein). Vesicles were prepared by heating to 40 °C and then cooling on ice three times, followed by 20 serial extrusions of the mixture through a 0.1-μm pore polycarbonate filter using an Avanti mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) warmed on a heating block to ∼50 °C as described (5Lande M.B.

Before flux measurements, extravesicular CF was removed by passing the liposomes through a Sephadex G-50 column as described previously (11Negrete H.O. Rivers R.L. Gough A.H. Colombini M. Zeidel M.L.

For CO2 permeability (P gas) measurements, vesicles were abruptly exposed to a CO2 gradient by rapidly mixing with an equal volume of freshly made 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.40, that was kept capped throughout the experiment. Fluorescence changes were measured on a stopped-flow device as described (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen.

For water permeability (Pf) measurements, vesicles were identically prepared except 20.0 mm CF was used and the vesicles were abruptly exposed to hyperosmolar external solution. Sufficient sucrose was added to the external medium so that solution osmolality doubles when equal volumes of external medium and vesicles are mixed. Pf was measured and calculated as described (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10Priver N.A. Rabon E.C. Zeidel M.L.

AQP1 was preserved in solution containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.80, containing 1.0 mmNaN3, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1.2% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside (Calbiochem) before reconstitution. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed by standard techniques. Reconstitution into proteoliposomes was performed as described (12Zeidel M.L. Nielsen S. Smith B.L.

Briefly, 9 mg of bath-sonicated, purified Escherichia coli phospholipid (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) was mixed with 1.0 ml of a solution containing 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.50, 1.0 mm NaN3, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.25% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside, and 100 μg of purified AQP1. This mixture was vortexed, placed on ice for 20 min, and rapidly injected through a 25-gauge needle into 25 ml of reconstitution buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.50, 15 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, pH 7.0, 15 mm CF, 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature. Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 123,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Two to three washes were performed in CF-free reconstitution buffer. E. coliphospholipid liposomes without AQP1 were prepared similarly except that an equivalent volume of the storage buffer was substituted for the protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that the AQP1 proteoliposomes and control E. coli liposomes are unilamellar (12Zeidel M.L. Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Ambudkar S.V. Maunsbach A.B. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fluorescence changes were again converted to pH changes as described above except that the measured buffer capacity was 23.9 mm/pH unit. The uncatalyzed hydration of CO2 is slow, and the reaction is catalyzed in vivo by CA. When measuring CO2 flux across a bilayer in vitro, it is important to demonstrate that the flux is not rate-limited by the hydration reaction. Therefore, we measured the flux of CO2across the bilayer of lipid vesicles in the absence and presence of entrapped CA. In the absence of CA, the hydration of CO2 is clearly rate-limiting because the addition of CA causes ∼1000-fold increase in the rate of pH change (Fig.1). Varying the amount of entrapped CA revealed no increase in the rate of acidification at levels above 0.2–0.3 mg/ml. Therefore, 0.5 mg/ml CA was included in all subsequent CO2 flux measurements. We first determined the effect of lipid composition on the rate of CO2 entry into vesicles. We had previously shown thatPf of synthetic phospholipid vesicles varies directly with the fluidity of the bilayer (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To determine whether membrane fluidity affects CO2 permeability in a similar manner, we measured the water and CO2 permeabilities of phospholipid vesicles that are known to represent a wide range of bilayer fluidities (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Vesicles exhibited unimodal size distributions with an average diameter of 263 ± 78 nm (n = 42) (data not shown). As shown previously (5Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) water permeabilities for the three vesicle compositions varied by more than 130-fold (Fig.2 and TableI), ranging from 0.208 ± 0.066 × 10−3 cm/s for the least fluid bilayer (60% sphingomyelin:40% cholesterol) to 28.0 ± 2.7 × 10−3 cm/s for the most fluid bilayer (dilinoleoyl lecithin). The CO2 permeabilities for lipid vesicles of the same compositions, however, did not vary significantly (Fig. 2 and Table I), with all three compositions having CO2permeabilities of ∼1.55 × 10−3 cm/s. Therefore, membrane fluidity does not govern the permeability of lipid vesicles to CO2.Table IWater and CO2 permeabilities of liposomes and proteoliposomesLipid compositionWaterP fCO2 P gascm/s × 10−3cm/s × 10−360% sphingomyelin/40% cholesterol0.208 ± 0.0661.43 ± 0.6380% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl lecithin/20% cholesterol12.6 ± 4.61.68 ± 0.72100% dilinoleoyl lecithin28.0 ± 2.71.54 ± 0.13E. coliphospholipid4.61 ± 4.040.53 ± 0.14AQP1 reconstituted into E. coli phospholipid18.4 ± 5.81.94 ± 0.72 Open table in a new tab Given that some membranes restrict water and gas fluxes (1Stein W.D.

Indeed, it is now well established that specific water channels (aquaporins) mediate water flow across membranes (3Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F243-F245PubMed Google Scholar, 4Agre P. Bonhivers M. Borgnia M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14659-14662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in principal cells of the collecting duct of the kidney, water flow is hormonally regulated by the insertion of AQP2-containing vesicles into the apical membrane (19Deen P.M.T.

It has recently been shown that the AQP1 water channel causes a 40% increase in CO2permeability when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (9Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the authors were unable to distinguish among three explanations for this increase: 1) a change in lipid composition of the cell membrane, 2) increased expression of a native gas channel, or 3) direct mediation of gas transport by AQP1. Our results argue against a large effect of lipid composition, so we addressed the questions of other gas channels and AQP1 permeability directly by purifying and reconstituting AQP1 into proteoliposomes and measuring the CO2permeability. As reported previously, AQP1 purified from red blood cells was purified to homogeneity and represented the sole protein in proteoliposome preparations (12Zeidel M.L. Nielsen S. Smith B.L.

AQP1 contains a cysteine residue at position 189 that is essential for function and that is sensitive to mercurial compounds (20Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the lower panel of Fig. 3 A, the effects of blocking this cysteine with HgCl2 and of reversing the blockade with β-mercaptoethanol are shown. HgCl2 reducedPf to values similar to those of liposomes lacking AQP1, and mercaptoethanol reversed this effect. We next examined the effect on CO2 permeability of reconstituting AQP1 into proteoliposomes (Fig. 3 B). As occurred with Pf, addition of AQP1 also results in an approximately 4-fold increase in CO2 permeability (upper panel), the liposomes having a permeability of 0.53 ± 0.14 cm/s and AQP1 proteoliposomes exhibiting a permeability of 1.94 ± 0.72 cm/s. The increase in CO2 permeability that results from incorporation of AQP1 is again eliminated by HgCl2, and the inhibition by HgCl2 is again reversed by β-mercaptoethanol. This demonstrates that the AQP1 protein can serve as a CO2channel. These results further suggest that water and CO2may traverse the same pathway because the permeabilities both increase by approximately 4-fold and because both permeabilities exhibit the same reversible inhibition by HgCl2. Because the AQP1 conductance for water is known (16Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the amount of AQP1 and the conductance of AQP1 for CO2 can be calculated. Under the conditions of the present studies, the AQP1 conductance for CO2 is 2.0 × 10−16 mmol of CO2 s−1 AQP1−1 molecule. The water and CO2 permeabilities of liposomes and proteoliposomes are also summarized in Table I. We have clearly demonstrated that AQP1 can increase CO2permeation of lipid bilayers, likely through the water pore of the protein. The physiological relevance of this finding is not certain, but the abundance of AQP1 in tissues that serve to transport CO2 such as red blood cells and in tissues that are intimately linked to bicarbonate-based pH control such as blood cells (21Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), renal proximal tubule (4Agre P. Bonhivers M. Borgnia M.J. J. Biol.

Studies of the permeabilities of other gases and studies in AQP1-deleted animals will provide further information about the physiological basis for this phenomenon."

Normal vascular endothelial cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis though they express both Fas and FasL. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a major component of OxLDL, induces endothelial cell suicide by sensitizing endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here, we show that endothelial cell apoptosis by OxLDL and LPC-C16:0 was dose-dependent and correlated with down-regulation of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), an intracellular caspase inhibitor. FLIP down-regulation also occurred when endothelial cells were treated with toxic doses of LPC-C18:0 or minimally modified low density lipoprotein (LDL). In contrast, FLIP was not down-regulated by native LDL, acetylated LDL, LPC-C12:0, cholesterol, or 7-ketocholesterol, which are not toxic to endothelial cells. The cytotoxicity of oxidized lipids was reversed by transfecting endothelial cells with a FLIP expression plasmid. The results demonstrate, for the first time, FLIP regulation under conditions that lead to pathological tissue destruction.

However, the mechanisms by which stimuli sensitize cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis remains to be elucidated. Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in Fas-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway (11Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

OxLDL and its lipid constituents have numerous detrimental effects on endothelial cell function, including the induction of apoptosis (25Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Galle J. Zeiher A.M.

Vascular endothelial cells express functional FasL and detectable Fas on their cell surface, but they are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis under normal conditions (5Sata M. Walsh K. Nat.

Recently, we documented that OxLDL induces endothelial cell suicide through Fas-FasL interaction by sensitizing endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (29Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Here, we show that FLIP may play a role in regulating the sensitivity of endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. This is the first report of FLIP regulation outside of the immune system and under conditions of pathological tissue destruction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described (30Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM; Clonetics, San Diego, CA). HUVECs cultured in a 96-well plate at 80% confluency were incubated with OxLDL or LPC at indicated doses for 16 h. Cell viability was measured by means of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Haze K. Nakamura N. Sato K. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. Mizuki M. Tagawa S. Ohga S. Hatake K. Drummond A.H. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). LDL was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (d = 1.019–1.063) from freshly drawn, citrated normolipidemic human plasma to which EDTA was added (32Galle J. Stunz P. Schollmeyer P. Wanner C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized in the presence of 5 μmCuSO4 for 24 h at 25 °C, and the degree of oxidation was assessed by the increase of mobility on 1% agarose gel (1.4 versus native LDL) (32Galle J. Stunz P. Schollmeyer P. Wanner C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) was prepared by dialyzing native LDL against 9 μm FeSO4 in phosphate-buffered saline for 72 h at 4 °C as described (33Liao F. Berliner J.A. Mehrabian M. Navab M. Demer L. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2253-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility increased 1.1 to 1.2 versus native LDL. Acetylation of LDL was performed with excess acetic anhydride. All lipid reagents were purchased from Sigma. An antiserum against human FLIP was generated in New Zealand White rabbits against a peptide spanning amino acids 2–27 (SAEVIHQVEEALDTDEKEMLLFLCRD) synthesized using the multiple antigen technology (34Francis M.J. Hastings G.Z. Brown F. McDermed J. Lu Y.A. Tam J.P. Immunology. 1991; 73: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar). The IgG fraction of the antiserum was isolated using E-Z-SEP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and affinity-purified on the corresponding peptides coupled to Affi-Gel 15 gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). HUVECs were treated with OxLDL (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg of protein/ml) or LPC (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μm) for 21 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The protein content was measured with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The cell lysates (15 μg for each lane) were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with either anti-FLIP, anti-α-tubulin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), anti-Bcl-2 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Bcl-x (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep antibody to mouse Ig or rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HUVECs cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with β-galactosidase expression plasmid (1.5 μg) and a pCR3-based (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expression plasmid (0.15 μg) for human long form of FLIP (FLIPL) (a generous gift from Dr. J. Tschopp), Bcl-2, or Bcl-XL using the Superfect procedure (Qiagen). After 48 h, HUVECs were incubated with 60 μm LPC-C16:0 for 24 h, fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, and stained with X-gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The number of viable blue cells attaching to the culture plate was counted as described (35Perlman H. Sata M. Le Roux A. Sedlak T. Branellec D. Walsh K.

To study FLIP regulation under conditions of endothelial cell death, we initially determined the parameters influencing oxidized lipid-induced apoptosis. HUVECs were treated with different doses of OxLDL or LPC-C16:0 for 24 h, and mitochondrial function was assessed by the MTT assay, an indicator of cell death (31Tanaka M. Suda T. Haze K. Nakamura N.

Lower doses of OxLDL and LPC-C16:0 were slightly stimulatory, consistent with reports that these agents can stimulate growth (40Chen J.K. Hoshi H. McClure D.B. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell.

To study regulation of FLIP under conditions of OxLDL- or LPC-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, a polyclonal antibody was generated against the 26-amino acid sequence of the N terminus of FLIP. This sequence is common among all of the reported isoforms (14Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.

Immunoblotting revealed that untreated HUVECs express a 55-kDa immunoreactive protein that has an identical mobility to the positive control, an extract from COS cells transfected with the FLIPL expression plasmid (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with OxLDL (Fig. 2 A) or LPC-C16:0 (Fig.2 B) markedly down-regulated expression of the FLIP-immunoreactive protein in a dose-dependent manner and occurred at doses of OxLDL or LPC that induced endothelial cell death (Fig. 1, A and B). Expression levels of the previously reported FLIPS were very low or undetectable in HUVECs. The Bcl-2 family of proteins functions as positive and negative regulators of apoptosis (42Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), including Fas-mediated cell death (43Perez D. White E. J.

In contrast to FLIP, OxLDL treatment had no effect on the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax or the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-x or Bcl-2 (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, LPC did not affect the expression of genes encoding the death-signaling molecules,FADD, FAP, FAF, DR3,TRAIL, TNFR-p55, or RIP (not shown). These data suggest that oxidized lipids specifically modulate FLIP levels, and that they do not have widespread effects on the expression of other apoptosis-regulatory molecules. Other lipid species were examined for their ability to induce cytotoxicity and down-regulate FLIP. Native LDL did not influence HUVEC viability (Fig. 3 A). Acetylated LDL, which is internalized by endothelial cells but lacks biological effects (44Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys.

On the other hand, MM-LDL, which promotes atherogenesis by acting as an inflammatory agent (33Liao F. Berliner J.A. Mehrabian M. Navab M. Demer L. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2736-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), also did not affect endothelial cell viability, whereas LPC-C18:0, a component of OxLDL, induced endothelial cell death. Finally, cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol did not kill endothelial cells. Immunoblotting against FLIP revealed that cytotoxic concentrations of MM-LDL and LPC-C18:0 down-regulated FLIPLexpression level, whereas nontoxic lipids did not (Fig. 3 B). These results further suggest that FLIPL down-regulation accounts for endothelial cell sensitization to Fas-mediated apoptosis To examine the functional significance of FLIP down-regulation in sensitization of human endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis, we tested whether ectopic expression of FLIP could protect against LPC-induced apoptosis (Table I). Using a co-transfection cell death assay (35Perlman H. Sata M. Le Roux A. Sedlak T. Branellec D. Walsh K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3576-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Miura M. Zhu H.

As expected, treatment with LPC-C16:0 reduced the number of viable β-galactosidase-positive cells. The FLIP expression plasmids significantly increased the number of viable β-galactosidase-positive cells compared with the pcDNA control plasmid or mock co-transfection, indicating that ectopic expression of FLIPL prevented endothelial cells from LPC-induced apoptosis. Consistent with observations that Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 protects Fas-mediated apoptosis (43Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), ectopic expression of Bcl-XL also protected LPC-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 did not.Table IEctopic expression of FLIP protects endothelial cells from LPC-induced apoptosisPlasmidNumber of β-galactosidase-positive cells/wellMock41.5 ± 6.0pcDNA39.3 ± 4.9FLIPL111.5 ± 20.4Bcl-XL119.0 ± 22.3Bcl-240.5 ± 8.2HUVECs cultured in 24-well plates in EGM medium were co-transfected with the test plasmid (0.15 μg) and β-galactosidase expression plasmid (1.5 μg) using the Superfect procedure (Qiagen).

FLIP down-regulation correlates with a loss of endothelial cell viability, and oxidized lipid-induced cell death was reversed by forced FLIP expression. Previously, FLIP regulation has only been described during T cell activation where it may control Fas-mediated suicide (14Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L.

Pectins that represent around 30% of the primary plant cell walls play a key role in plant physiology as well as in plant pathology. The general structure of pectic polymers consists of homogalacturonan linear chains (smooth regions) interspersed with highly branched galacturonic chains (hairy regions). Some of the galacturonic residues linked by α-1,4 glycosidic bonds are methyl-esterified at the carboxyl group. The degree of methylesterification (DE) 1The abbreviations used are: DE, degree of methylesterification; PME, pectinmethylesterases; DPn, degree of polymerization; MCM, multiple chain mechanism; SCM, single chain mechanism; MAM, multiple attack mechanism. varies greatly depending on the plant organ and the degree of differentiation of the cells. Young, plastic cell walls are generally characterized by a high content of highly methylated pectin that decreases in parallel with the loss of extensibility of the walls, whereas the amount of acidic residues increases (1Goldberg R. Morvan C. Roland J.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 523-532Google Scholar, 2Li Y.Q. Chen F. Linskens H.F. Cresti M. Sex Plant Reprod. 1994; 7: 145-152Google Scholar, 3Mc Cann M. Roberts K. Visser J. Voragen A.G.J. Pectins and Pectinases. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 91-116Google Scholar). Moreover, the balance between high and low methylated pectins varies inside the wall of a single cell (4Roberts K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) generating microdomains. Not only the number but also the distribution of free, unesterified galacturonate carboxyl groups within the galacturonan regions will control the gell-forming capacity of the pectin and thereby the porosity and the extensibility of the apoplasm (5Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar, 6Goldberg R. Morvan C. Jauneau A. Jarvis M.C. Visser J. Voragen A.G.J. Pectins and Pectinases. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 151-172Google Scholar). It is commonly accepted that the polygalacturonic backbone is polymerized in the cis-Golgi cisternae, methylesterified in the medial-Golgi, substituted with side chains in the trans-Golgi, and exported to the cell walls as a highly methylated polygalacturonan (7Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). At a later stage, it is deesterified in muroby cell wall pectinmethylesterases (PMEs). Many proteins exhibiting PME activity have been purified, and their biochemical features such as molecular weight, optimal pH, pI, and substrate specificity have been established (8Bordenave M. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 17. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., Berlin1996: 165-180Google Scholar). In some cases, the corresponding genes have also been cloned and sequenced (9Albani D. Altostair I. Arnison P.G. Fabijanski S.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Mu J.H. Stains J.P. Kao T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Richard L. Qin L.X. Goldberg R. Gene. 1996; 170: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but so far three-dimensional models based on either crystallographic data or NMR analyses are lacking. A limited number of investigations of the action pattern of PME have been reported (12de Vries J.A. Rombouts F.M. Voragen A.G.J. Pilnik W. Carbohydr. Polym. 1983; 3: 245-258Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13.Versteeg, C.

Partially deesterified polymers have been submitted to hydrolysis by endogalacturonases that are known to stop their attack in the vicinity of a methylated galacturonic unit, and the fragments released were subsequently characterized (13.Versteeg, C. (1979) Pectinstearases from the Orange Fruit: Their Purification, General Characteristics, and Juice Cloud-destabilizing Properties. Ph.D. thesis, Wageningen, Nethelands.Google Scholar). In another approach, the activity coefficients αCa2+(αCa2+ is a complex function of the linear charge density of the macromolecule) of the calcium pectinates were determined after enzymatic deesterification (14Markovic O. Kohn R. Experientia. 1984; 40: 842-843Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these investigations, it was proposed that alkaline PME from higher plants (tomato, orange, alfalfa) catalyze deesterification of pectin linearly along the chain of the molecule, giving rise to blocks of free carboxyl groups, whereas acidic microbial PMEs cause a random cleavage of esterified carboxyl groups (14Markovic O. Kohn R. Experientia. 1984; 40: 842-843Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of the plant PMEs, studies have also pointed to the importance of a free carboxyl group in the vicinity of the active site (13.Versteeg, C. (1979) Pectinstearases from the Orange Fruit: Their Purification, General Characteristics, and Juice Cloud-destabilizing Properties. Ph.D. thesis, Wageningen, Nethelands.Google Scholar, 14Markovic O.

J. 1991; 279: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A major drawback to the afore-going methods is that they provide only indirect information on the distribution of the carboxyl units after PME action and do not lead to a precise description of the reaction mechanism. In quantitative studies of the action pattern of tomato PME, Grasdalenet al. have established the methoxyl distribution at various stages (DE) of the reaction with 1H NMR spectroscopy (15Grasdalen H. Andersen A.K. Larsen B. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 289: 105-114Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar,16Andersen A.K. Larsen B. Grasdalen H. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 273: 93-98Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The three mechanisms, which are generally evoked in theoretical transformations of polysaccharides (18Greenwood C.T. Milne E.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1968; 23: 282-366Google Scholar), were considered (see Scheme FSI): (a) multiple chain mechanism, where the enzyme-substrate complex dissociates after each reaction, resulting in conversion (deesterification) of just one residue for each attack; (b) single chain mechanism, where an enzymic attack is followed by a contiguous conversion of all residues in an E-block starting with the E-residue in the attacked UE-diad (where U and E are unesterified and esterified residues, respectively); and (c) multiple attack mechanism, where the enzyme deesterifies a limited average number of residues for every active enzyme-substrate encounter. Their results were best interpreted with the multiple attack mechanism, assuming that the enzyme attacked alternating UE sequences and deesterified linearly preferentially toward the reducing end. The degree of polymerization (DPn) of the pectin samples used in this work was fairly low (n∼ 15 residues), and end group effects were necessarily important that might partially explain why the enzymatic deesterification deviated from an idealized block-producing mechanism. However, the major pitfall of these studies resides in the enzyme preparation as the tomato PME was not purified and contained several isoforms. Indeed, in most cases cell walls contain several PMEs differing in their biochemical properties and encoded by different genes (11Richard L. Qin L.X. Goldberg R. Gene. 1996; 170: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, the behavior of PME in solution sometimes differs from that exhibited by cell wall-bound enzymes (8Bordenave M. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 17. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., Berlin1996: 165-180Google Scholar), and it would be hazardous to extrapolate physiological explanations of the functions of PME in vivousing such an approach. Comparison of PME activity for both cell wall-bound and solubilized states is a necessary precaution if one wishes to understand the action mode in vivo. In the present study, partially depolymerized pectin samples were incubated with either purified PME isoforms or cell wall-bound enzymes to elucidate the PME action patterns. Under suitable conditions, substrates with an average DPn of ∼100 can be obtained by thermally induced depolymerization, and it was demonstrated with various complementary techniques such as size exclusion chromatography, potentiometry, viscosimetry, and 13C NMR that these samples retain the characteristics of the parent polymer (DE and methoxyl distribution) while adopting the random-coil conformation (as opposed to the aggregated forms of the native pectins), which is mandatory for solution-state NMR structural studies (19Catoire L. Goldberg R. Pierron M. Morvan C. Hervé du Penhoat C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From the behavior of solubilized and cell wall-bound PMEs, we ultimately aimed to shed light on the role of the different PME isoforms in the cell wall-stiffening process, which occurs along the mung bean hypocotyl. The pectin sample (apple pectin classic AU 201 (DE 74.4%)) was graciously supplied by Herbstreith & Fox KG (Neuenbürg, Germany). The thermal depolymerization protocol and the characteristics of the resulting polymers have been described previously (18Greenwood C.T. Milne E.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1968; 23: 282-366Google Scholar). As regards the samples used in the present work,13C NMR end group analysis indicated a DPnof 100, whereas the one estimated (20Garnier C. Axelos M.A.V. Thibault J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 219-232Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) from the intrinsic viscosity ([η] = 0.5) was roughly 50. The totally esterified pectin was a gift from Dr. Baron. Cell walls were isolated from the upper 2.5 cm of hypocotyl tissues of 3-day-old seedlings of mung bean (Vigna radiata L. Wilzeck) according to a procedure previously described (1Goldberg R. Morvan C. Roland J.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 523-532Google Scholar). PMEs bound to the cell wall fragments were solubilized with 1 m NaCl, and the different isoforms were recovered according to Bordenave and Goldberg (21Bordenave M. Goldberg R. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 999-1003Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Bordenave M. Goldberg R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Assay for PME activity estimation (total volume 6 ml) contained 30 mg of thermally depolymerized polymers. PME activity was measured titrimetrically by following the release of protons in the presence of 150 mmNaCl. The protons were titrated with 10 mm NaOH under nitrogen, the pH being maintained at 5.6 or 7.6 with an automatic titrator (TTT 80, Radiometer). The reaction rate, as μeq of H+ released/min/mg of protein, was estimated from the time necessary to reduce the DE by 1.67% i.e. the time necessary to release 2.5 μeq of H+ from the pectin sample. The reaction was stopped by lowering the pH to 3 with 0.05 nHCl when less than around 0.05 μeq of H+ were released/min in the incubation medium. All samples were stored at −20 °C before NMR analysis. In the case of a random distribution of methoxyl groups, thermally depolymerized pectins with a wide range of DE (35–75%) can be analyzed at room temperature, as the major fraction of the polymers adopts the random-coil conformation and is detected by NMR spectroscopy (19Catoire L. Goldberg R. Pierron M. Morvan C. Hervé du Penhoat C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, because of a change in the distribution of the methoxyl groups upon deesterification with PME and/or the salt concentration, the pectins incubated with PME were much more prone to aggregation than the starting material. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio in the 13C spectra, the samples were desalted on an ion-exchange resin (DOWEX, H+ form) and then dialyzed at 4 °C to obtain a less acidic pH (4 to 6 depending on the DE). Finally, EDTA (0.5 eq) was added to remove divalent cations. Totally decoupled 13C spectra were recorded at 60 °C on aqueous solutions of the pectins (∼2% w/v) at 100.6 MHz. Starting samples containing all possible distributions of the methoxyl groups for a 10-residue fragment of given DE (i.e. 210, 120, 45, 10 fragments for DE values of 60, 70, 80, and 90%, respectively) were first generated as a linear two-dimensional array. A polydisperse population (between 100 to 4000 chains) of polymers of given DPn (n = 25, 50, 100, or 200) and DE (73%) with a random sequence were then built from these 10-residue fragments using a random number generator. The DE and the triad populations (EEE, EEU, UEE, UEU, EUE, UUE, EUU, and UUU, where the underscore designates the residue that is either being considered in the simulation algorithm or detected in NMR spectra) and the homopolymer E-block and U-block populations (for block-lengths of 1–100 residues) of the resulting two-dimensional arrays were evaluated and compared with the corresponding data of the pectins used for assaying enzyme activity. The enzymatic reactions were simulated as follows (see Scheme Scheme FSI). Random generation of the point of attack (the point of attack XE↓X or PA is defined by the integers, which correspond to the chain and residue positions in the two-dimensional array), evaluation of constraint criteria (i.e. PA must be a methoxylated residue; for certain mechanisms, 1–3 neighboring residues were required to be E or U units, and all positions between 1–10 residues away from PA were considered for these constrained units), and sequential (single chain mechanism) or single residue (multiple chain) deesterification toward a given end of the macromolecule until a deesterified unit or the end of the chain was encountered (or a given number of residues, k, in the case of the multiple attack mechanism). For suitable decrements in the DE (5%), the fractional triad populations (EEE, EEU, UEE, UEU, EUE, UUE, EUU, and UUU) and the homopolymer E-block and U-block populations of the resulting sample of polydisperse polymers were evaluated. The average E- and U-block lengths, NE and NU, which included all the E or U residues except the isolated ones (UEU or EUE), were as follows: NE = ((DE-UEU)/EEU) and NU = (((1 − DE) − EUE)/UUE). The following R-factor has been used to evaluate the quality of the fits with the experimental data: Rf = Σ ((EEEexpt − EEEcalc)2 + ([EEU + UEEexpt] - [EEU + UEEcalc])2 + (UEUexpt − UEUcalc)2), where the summation extends over all the DE values for which data were collected. Replacing the sums by the corresponding squared experimental average deviations afforded the experimental R-factor. The standard deviation in the triad populations, estimated from simulations initiated with different seeds for the random number generator was ≪1%. The degree of esterification was potentiometrically estimated as previously reported (1Goldberg R. Morvan C. Roland J.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 523-532Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were dialyzed and weighed, and a portion was set aside for colorimetric estimation of the galacturonic acid content according to Blumenkranz and Asboe-Hansen (23Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). After transformation into the H-form with Amberlite IR 120H, the weight and the uronic acid content were again determined to assure that all of the starting pectin was recovered from the ion-exchange resin. The sample was then neutralized under nitrogen flux with sodium hydroxide. After saponification (4 h, 4 °C) the new negative charges were estimated as above. The degree of esterification was calculated as the number of new charges over the total amount of galacturonic acid. To visualize the effects of the degree of methylesterification of the substrate on the reaction rate of the deesterification process, plots of activityversus DE have been given in Fig.1 for the long term incubations, which were performed either at pH 5.6 (○) or pH 7.6 (•) with bound (A and C) or solubilized (B,D, E, and F) PMEs. None of the enzymatic fractions was able to generate totally deesterified pectins, as the reaction stopped before the DE had dropped to values that varied between 20 and 50% depending on the enzyme used in the assay. PMEs bound to their natural matrix (Fig. 1 A) or solubilized with NaCl (Fig. 1 B) reacted similarly to the decrease in DE. In both cases, whatever the DE, the reaction rate was higher at pH 7.6, but the differences between the reaction rates estimated at pH 7.6 and 5.6 were larger when the enzymes were still bound to the cell walls. Moreover, at pH 7.6, two successive phases were observed depending on the DE; during the first phase (from DE 70% to DE 40–50%), the reaction rate lowered very slightly with DE, whereas below this level it decreases much more rapidly. At pH 5.6 this decrease was observed as soon as the DE dropped below 60%. This lowering of the reaction rate was not because of a paucity of methylester bonds because even at a DE of 50% the concentration of methyl groups in the assay was still 10-fold higher than the K m. A dichotomy appears in the behavior of the three purified enzymes. Two of them, PMEα and PMEγ, reacted in a similar way to decreasing DE. At pH 7.6, plots of the reaction rateversus DE presented a plateau for high DE values (74–45%) followed by an abrupt regular drop to zero at lower DE values (24 and 32% for α and γ, respectively, Fig. 1, D andE). At pH 5.6, the decrease in activity started at DE values of about 65–70%, and it was sharper for PMEα than for PMEγ. At high DE, contrary to cell wall fragments or isoform mixtures, the maximal activity was higher at pH 5.6 than at pH 7.6, a situation that persisted over a larger range of DE values in the case of PMEγ. These data explain why PMEαand PMEγ have been reported to display different pH sensitivities when incubated with citrus pectin whose DE is around 65%; with such substrates PMEγ exhibits an acidic optimal pH, whereas PMEα activity is barely modified between pH 5.6 and 7.6 (21Bordenave M. Goldberg R. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 999-1003Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The behavior of PMEβ differs markedly from that of the other two isoforms (Fig. 1 F); at pH 7.6, for high DE values a plateau in activity is not detected, and for all DE values, activities are higher than at pH 5.6. This tendency was observed both when the enzyme was bound (Fig. 1 C) and when it was solubilized (Fig. 1 F), the only difference being an attenuation in the effect of the pH after solubilization of the enzyme. Finally, when a totally esterified pectin sample was incubated with PMEβ, enzymic activity was negligable. It has been demonstrated that the populations of triad structures such as UEU, EEE, UUU etc., and the average length of the E-blocks of pectins can be estimated from the corresponding 1H (15Grasdalen H.

These latter data were in good agreement with the DE independently established by potentiometry, indicating that the random-coil species detected with the latter technique was representative of the polymer as a whole. The discrepancies in the minimum DE values obtained either during the kinetic activity measurements (Fig. 1) or in the course of NMR analyses (Table I) stems from a regain in enzyme activity upon raising the pH from 3 to 4–6 during the preparation of the NMR samples (see “Materials and Methods”). For example, upon lowering the pH of a solution containing PMEα to 3 and storing at 5 °C for 2 weeks, the enzyme recovers 5 and 16% of its normal activity when the pH is raised to 5.6 and 7.6, respectively.Table ITriad populations (EEE, EEU+UEE, UEU and UUU) as a function of DE estimated from 100.6 MHz 13C NMR spectra of pectin samples incubated with PME from Vigna RadiataEnzymeDEpH = 5.6DEpH = 7.6EEEEEU+UEEUEUUUUEEEEEU+UEEUEUUUU%%α13.5643.5808–––81.523117.54.559.521.556.510–44.521.513.59.533.54818.517.512–50.527167.527.55424201027.5γ2310.584.561.51242.55.581.546.52315.58363814.510.513325026.5176.5–40151411375322171435.5β194.56859.5331312849276.512.5866.537.515166.54537.515.5157433917.515.5641.542.516197.5–4016.5158.5374920.521.57334520.5195.5–512519.56.529.5α,β,γ402111.57.540.53411.514.5847Cell wall fragments35.513.514.57.5404016.516.57384320.5139.5384216.5187.540.5Eluted cell wall fragments30615953.5421619742.551165.2212.5The populations of the starting polymer (DE 74%) were as follows: 40.5, 28, 5.5 for EEE, EEU+UEE, UEU, respectively (UUU not measurable).

Open table in a new tab The populations of the starting polymer (DE 74%) were as follows: 40.5, 28, 5.5 for EEE, EEU+UEE, UEU, respectively (UUU not measurable). The average deviations for the experimental triad populations have been indicated as error bars in Fig. 3. Potentiometric measurements of the DE are in agreement with the NMR values indicated. Dashes indicate no detectable quantities. Experimental DEs are indicated in bold face. From inspection of the triad populations, it can be seen that the results obtained by incubation with either PMEα or PMEγ at a given pH were analogous (see DE 23% at pH 5.6 for PMEα and PMEγ). As regards the esterified residues (XEX) at pH 5.6, the EEE and UEU populations were the major and minor ones, respectively, at DE values as low as 23%. In contrast, at pH 7.6, the EEE and EEU + UEE populations were similar, and the UEU population became significant below DE values of 50%. Subsequently, all the data for PMEα and PMEγ were simultaneously fitted to the same theoretical plots of triad populations versus DE to increase the number of experimental points. In the case of incubations with PMEβ, for all DE values the EEE and EEU + UEE populations were similar, whereas the UEU population was a minor one for DE values above 30%. As a result, data concerning incubations with PMEβ were considered separately. The NMR data for pectin incubated with the preparation containing a mixture of all the solubilized enzymes (α, β, and γ) displayed a similar pattern to that observed for the α or γ isoforms. As regards the cell wall-bound enzymes, the triad populations of pectins that had been treated with the crude preparation were analogous to those obtained with the α and γ isoforms. In contrast, the results observed with pectins which had been incubated with cell wall fragments that had been extracted with NaCl solutions (here only, the β isoform remained bound to the cell wall fragments) tended to be similar to the data recorded for the pure β isoform. The theoretical polymers generated for simulation of various reaction mechanisms all displayed both a Bernoullian distribution of triad populations and average E-block lengths, NE, identical to those of the partially depolymerized pectic samples. From simulations that were conducted in both directions (from left-to-right and from right-to-left), it was ascertained that the random-number generator had not introduced a skewed distribution of the methoxyl groups. 1000 chains were necessary to minimize end group effects for simulations with the experimental DPn (i.e. 100,000 residues). When only one constraint was associated with the deesterification process (i.e. a free carboxyl group in a specified position with respect to the point of attack) the reaction continued down to the requested DE value of 4%. However, the reaction stopped at much higher DE values (10–30%) when the number of constraints increased and/or DPn decreased. It should be emphasized that end groups effects strongly affect the UEU population for calculations involving shorter chains. The fits for the more pertinent simulations have been collected in Table II.Table IIEstimations of the agreement between theoretical and experimental triad populations (R-factors × 10−2) for simulations of various mechanisms (see Scheme FSI) of PME-mediated deesterification of pectinsEnzyme pHExpSCM XUXE↓XMAM XUXE↓XSCM XUXnE↓X (n≥ 2)an indicates the number of residues X inserted.MCM XE↓XSCM XUE↓Xαγ-5,62.001.252.353.92151.42(0.88)(0.57)(1.00)(2.10)(9.70)(0.09)[0.60][0.16][0.22][1.56][2.39][0.33]{0.52}{0.52}{1.13}{0.26}{2.91}{1.10}αγ-7,62.081.110.513.526.537.16(0.76)(0.35)(0.13)(0.13)(3.94)(1.98)[0.68][0.10][0.20][1.51][2.20][0.33]{0.64}{0.66}{0.18}{1.88}{0.39}{4.85}β-5,61.441.302.070.305.153.21(0.56)(0.19)(0.09)(0.12)(3.16)(1.62)[0.44][0.99][1.40][0.11][0.17][0.24]{0.44}{0.12}{0.58}{0.07}{3.06}{1.35}β-7,61.681.122.681.1711.21.83(0.72)(0.08)(0.34)(0.72)(7.56)(0.72)[0.72][0.68][1.72][0.38][0.56][0.08]{0.24}{0.36}{0.34}{0.07}{3.06}{1.03}Partial R-factors for individual triad populations ( (EEE), [EEU + UEE], {UEU}) have also been given.

HBx has been shown to alter the coordinated balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, being able to either induce or block apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the HBx is a potent caspase 3 inhibitor. Rat fibroblasts (REV2) and hepatoma cells (Hep) synthesizing the HBx protein were resistant to various apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion, tumor necrosis factor α, or anti-Fas antibodies administration. In these cells, HBx prevented DNA fragmentation and cell death in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, with a similar efficiency as the competitive caspase 3 substrates inhibitors VAD-FMK and DEVD-FMK. Protein extracts obtained from the HBx positive cells contained a very low caspase activity, and addition of anti-HBx antibody restored the endogenous caspase activity. To obtain a functional map of the anti-caspase activity of HBx, various cell lines were established that synthesized either N-terminally or C-terminally truncated HBx molecules. These gene dissection experiments revealed that the regions required for the anti-caspase activity overlap with the two known transactivation domains of HBx.

In mammalian cells, the CPP32 activity and apoptosis are regulated by various endogenous and exogenous factors including different virus gene products (2Shen Y. Shenk T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

HBx has been reported to sensitize rodent fibroblasts as well as human hepatoma cells to TNFα cytotoxicity and to DNA damage-induced p53-dependent apoptosis (4Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Levrero, unpublished observations. On the other hand, HBx also inhibits apoptosis induced by p53 overexpression in human primary fibroblasts (9Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K.

Therefore, the fate of infected cells expressing HBx is likely to be determined by the balance between apoptotic and antiapoptotic signals of viral cellular and environmental origin. The ability of HBx to modulate cell survival is potentially relevant for both viral pathogenicity in acute and chronic HBV infection as well as for the late development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the long term, it is the anti-apoptotic function of HBx that is likely to be the major determinant for manifestation of the transformed phenotype. From this perspective, it is of central importance to define the molecular mechanisms underlying HBx-induced dysregulation of the cell death program. HBx has been reported to contain two Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor consensus sequences that overlap with its two transcription activation domains (11Takada S. Kido H. Fukutomi A. Takeshi M. Koike K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the HBx may prevent cell death via caspase inhibition. To test this hypothesis we established several cell lines expressing either wild type HBx or different deletion/insertion mutants and analyzed the apoptotic response of these cells upon application of different apoptotic stimuli. These experiments revealed that HBx efficiently blocks caspase 3 (CPP32) activity and apoptosis in both rat fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. HBx prevented PARP cleavage without affecting caspase 3 zymogen conversion, and this blockade of caspase 3 activity did not requirede novo protein synthesis. pCMV-X/F contains the HBV-X coding region (HBV nucleotides 1372–1833) with the nucleotide sequence encoding the flag polypeptide (DYKDDDDK) at the C-terminal end inserted into the multiple cloning site (EcoRI/EcoRV) of the pCDNA3 vector. The HBx N-terminal and C-terminal deletion and the HBV-X two codon insertion mutants at amino acid residue 68 and 88 have been described (28Murakami S. Cheong J.-H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Runkel L. Fisher M. Schaller H. Virology. 1993; 197: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The GST-c-IAP-2, the GST-HBx, and the GST-FasC were made by PCR amplification of the c-IAP-2 open reading frame from plasmid pRK-myc-c-IAP-2 (kindly provided by D.V. Goeddel), of the HBx open reading frame from plasmid pCMV-X/F, and of the portion of the human Fas open reading frame corresponding to the cytoplasmic region from lysine 191 to the stop codon at the amino acid 335, respectively. The PCR amplification products were inserted in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). REV2 cells (12Bauer M. Guhl E. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hepatoma cells McA-RH7777 (26Lin K.H. Wintwers A.L. Lindahl R. Cancer Res. 1994; 44: 5219-5226Google Scholar) were microinjected (7Graessmann A. Graessmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or transfected with the pCMV-X/F plasmid, and permanent cell lines were established. REV2 cells were grown in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), hepatoma cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μg/ml dexamethasone. Microinjection was performed as described (7Graessmann A. Graessmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For inhibition of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm. Apoptosis was induced by withdrawal of fetal calf serum. For induction of apoptosis by growth factors or drugs, 100 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor a (Sigma), 5 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 1 μm doxorubicin (Sigma) was added to the medium. For staining the apoptotic cells propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to the cell culture medium (2 μg/ml) for 15–30 min. Low molecular weight DNA was extracted as described (31Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0/10 mm EDTA/0.5% Triton X-100 and treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 20 μg/ml proteinase K. After phenol and phenol/chloroform extraction the DNA was subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. REV2 and REV2-X/F cells were incubated for 24-h intervals with 10 μm BrdUrd under serum-free conditions or after addition of 0.1% FCS. Cells were stained with mouse anti-BrdUrd and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BrdUrd labeling and detection kit, Boehringer Mannheim); BrdUrd-positive cells were determined by fluorescence microscopy. RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA with 200 units of superscript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 20 μl of enzyme buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min at 42 °C. PCR was performed with 100 ng of cDNA in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cycling profile was 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The primer sets used for the semiquantitative PCR were: 5′-GCT ATT TAC ACC ACA AAG-3′ and 5′-CTC TGC TTC TTC TGG ATT-3′ for SV40 T-antigen, 5′-CCA ACT GGA TCC TGC GCG GGA CGT CCT TTG-3′ and 5′-GTT CAC GGT GGT CTC CAT G-3′ for HBx, 5′-CCT CTG AGT CAG GAG ACA TT-3′ and 5′-GCT GGC AGA ACA GCT TAT TG-3′ for p53, 5′-AGG AAC TAT GAC CTC GAC-3′ and 5′-ATT CAG GGA TCT GGT CAC-3′ for c-myc, 5′-TTC CAC GGA GAA GAA GCT CA-3′ and 5′-TTG AGG GCA TCG TCG TAG AA-3′ for c-jun, 5′-AGA CAC CCC TTC ATC CAA GA-3′ and 5′-CAG AGA CAG CCA GGA GAA AT-3′ forbcl-2, 5′-ATG AAG ACA GGG GCC TTT-3′ and 5′-CAA AGT AGA AGA GGG CAA CC-3′ for bax, and 5′-AGC TGG AGT CAG TTT AGC GA-3′ and 5′-CGT CAG GAA CCA GCG GTT-3′ for bcl-xL/S.

Protein extracts obtained from REV2 and REV2-X/F cells were subjected to Western blot analysis. The membranes were hybridized either with anti-CPP32 (Upstate Biotechnology) or with anti-PARP antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-rabbit-HRP was used as second antibody. CPP32 activity was determined with the ApoAlert colorimetric assay kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. REV2 and REV2-X/F protein extracts (150 μg) were incubated with DEVD-pNA for 1 h at 37 °C, and the chromophore p-nitroanilide was spectrophotometrically measured at λ = 405 nm. Inhibitors were added to the REV2 and REV2-X/F cells for 24 h (DMEM without serum) at the following concentrations: 1 μm VAD-FMK or DEVD-FMK (CLONTECH), 50 μm PD 98059 (Biolabs), 10 units PKA inhibitor (Biolabs), 200 nm wortmannin (Sigma), 50 μm MG 101, or MG 115 (Serva). For the antibody treatment cell lysates were incubated with 100 or 1000 ng of anti-Flag (M2, Kodak) or 1000 ng of anti-SV40-T (Ab-2, Oncogene Science) for 30 min, and then CPP32 activity was determined. GST-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Fusion proteins were obtained from the soluble fraction and affinity purified on gluthathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by standard methods. Purified recombinant caspase 3 (Upstate Biotechnology) (0.5 μg) was incubated with the GST fusion proteins (1 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 400 μl of caspase buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose and 5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1% final concentration of bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100), and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A polyclonal antibody against the p20 subunit of the 32-kDa cysteine protease (CPP32) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was utilized for immunoblotting. REV2 cells are SV40 T-antigen positive tumor revertant cells (12Bauer M. Guhl E. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), isolated from SV40 transformed Ref-52 cells (SV-52). In contrast to the SV-52 cells, REV2 cells do not grow in soft agar, displaying a high demand for growth factors. As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), serum depletion caused rapid cell loss, and all REV2 cells died within 6 days in the absence of growth factors. Cell death was caused by apoptosis, as demonstrated by propidium iodide staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling reaction and by cleavage of chromatin into nucleosomal fragments (Fig. 1 C). To test whether the HBx could prevent apoptosis in these cells, 2–4 pCMV-X/F DNA molecules (a cytomegalovirus promoter-based plasmid that encodes a FLAG tagged version of HBx) were microinjected into the nuclei of REV2 cells, and 10 independent HBx positive cell lines were established (13Gottlob K. Pagano S. Levrero M. Graessmann A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3566-3570PubMed Google Scholar). We found that, in contrast to the REV2 cells, all the HBx positive lines were resistant to growth factor depletion and exhibited a low apoptotic rate upon serum starvation, as it is exemplary shown for the representative REV2-X/F cell line (Fig. 1, A, B, andC). Furthermore, REV2-X/F cells continued to divide after 48 h of starvation (Fig. 1, B and D). After 96 h of starvation REV2-X/F cells still responded to as low as 0.1% serum by entering into the S phase with a high efficiency, whereas BrdUrd incorporation was not demonstrable in the REV2 cells (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, a significant proportion of the REV2-X/F cells survived without serum for more than 19 days (Fig.1 A). These results support the notion of HBx being a strong mitogen (5Chirillo P. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11215-11219Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Next we asked how HBx may carry out its antiapoptotic function. Because HBx coactivates transactivation of several viral and cellular genes in transient transfection assays through a still unknown mechanism (for review see Ref. 15Yen T.S.B.J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 20-30Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we tested whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the described antiapoptotic activity. To test this, cycloheximide (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 2 h prior to serum starvation, and the apoptotic rate of REV2 and REV2-X/F cells was determined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling reaction and propidium iodide staining. Cycloheximide treatment did not affect REV2-X/F cell survival (Fig.2 A), thus implying that the antiapoptotic activity of HBx was independent from its ability to activate cellular gene expression. Accordingly, inhibition of apoptosis by HBx was not associated with changes in the expression rate of either antiapoptotic genes (e.g. bcl-2 andbcl-xL) or apoptotic genes (e.g. baxand p53) (Fig. 2 B). These observations implied a possible direct interference of HBx with the apoptotic pathways. Because the HBx possesses two regions bearing a strong homology with the Kunitz domain of serine protease inhibitors that overlap the mapped transactivating domains of the protein (11Takada S. Kido H. Fukutomi A. Takeshi M. Koike K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether HBx may exert an anti-caspase activity and how this correlates with the antiapoptotic function of HBx. Protein extracts were prepared from REV2 and REV2-X/F cells, and the caspase 3 (CPP32) activity was analyzed. Serum starvation caused a strong increase of the caspase activity in the REV2 (Fig.3 A), whereas the caspase activity in the extracts from REV2-X/F cells remained at the same level as in noninduced cells or in cells incubated with the caspase inhibitors VAD-FMK (1 μm) or DEVD-FMK (1 μm). Complexing HBx by adding anti-FLAG antibodies to REV2-X/F cell extracts restored the endogenous caspase activity, whereas no effect was observed with control antibodies (e.g. SV40 T-antigen antibodies) (Fig. 3 B). Because triggering and propagation of the apoptotic signal involves the cleavage of both CPP32 and its major downstream substrate, the PARP, REV2, and REV2-X/F cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. HBx did not prevent CPP32 proteolytic processing but entirely blocked PARP cleavage. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that HBx inhibits CPP32 activity, but it does not prevent the proenzyme conversion. Next we evaluated whether the inhibition of caspase 3 activity on downstream targets by HBx might be due to a direct inhibitory interaction with caspase 3. However, we could not demonstrate a physical interaction between the CPP32 and HBx by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in REV2X/F cells (data not shown), and, differently from c-IAP-2 (16Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), recombinant HBx does not interact with purified enzymatically active p20 subunit of CPP32 (Fig.3 D). Thus, although the molecular targets of HBx are still unknown, the inhibitory mechanism of HBx appears to be different from that of other viral and cellular inhibitors of caspases, such as the cowpox virus CrmA and the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family members (17Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). In fact, although earlier studies suggested that activated CPP32 interacts in vitro with and might be a target of CrmA (18Tewari M. Quan L.T. O′Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar), recent evidence indicates that CrmA acts in vivo as a potent inhibitor of some active initiator caspases, including FLICE/caspase 8, and of pro-inflammatory caspases (19Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Doxit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Moreover, as regards the IAPs, they inhibit the activity of the effector caspases 3 and 7 in vitro (16Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 20Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), and although they selectively bind the activated forms of both caspases (16Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 20Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), they also prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspase 3 induced by both cytochrome C in cytosolic extracts and by etoposide in intact cells (16Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that HBx is able to interact with components of the proteasome and to affect signal transduction pathways potentially involved in apoptosis regulation (21Fisher M. Runkel L. Schaller H. Virus Genes. 1995; 10: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C.-Y. Liang T.J. J.

Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the involvement of these potential HBx targets in REV2 cell apoptosis. However, neither the proteasome inhibitors (MG101, MG115) nor the MEK (PD-98059), PKA, or PKB (wortmannin) inhibitors prevented CPP32 activation (Fig. 3 E) or affected apoptosis (data not shown). Similar experiments to those as described above were repeated using the hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 (Hep cells) (26Lin K.H. Wintwers A.L. Lindahl R. Cancer Res. 1994; 44: 5219-5226Google Scholar). For this purpose 10 independent cell lines were generated that express the HBx/F transgene (e.g.: Hep-X/F cells). Hep cells are less sensitive to growth factor depletion than the REV2 cells, but all Hep cells died within 96–120 h under serum-free conditions (Fig.4, A and B). Addition of the specific competitive caspase inhibitors VAD-FMK or DEVD-FMK to the culture medium strongly reduced the apoptotic response (data not shown). In contrast to the Hep cells, the Hep-X/F cells survived for a long period without serum, and DNA fragmentation was not demonstrable under these conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, HBx expressing Hep-X/F cells entered into the S phase and divided again when 0.1% serum was added to the medium after 120 h starvation and displayed a low CPP32 enzymatic activity after starvation (Fig.4 C). In starved Hep-X/F cells CPP32 underwent proteolytic processing, but PARP cleavage did not occur (data not shown). It is well documented that caspase 3 inhibitors block apoptosis induced by the engagement of TNF-R1 and Fas, which suggests that CPP32 is a downstream effector in TNF-R1 and Fas-mediated apoptosis (27Enari M. Talaian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that HBx sensitizes Chang hepatoma cells to TNFα apoptotic killing (4Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we found that all Hep-X/F cell lines are resistant to TNFα treatment (1–3% apoptotic cells) as compared with the parental Hep cells (20–30% apoptotic cells), even at a higher TNFα concentration (500 ng/ml) and after a 48-h incubation period. Accordingly, no increase in caspase 3 activity was observed in the Hep-X/F (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, addition of anti-Fas antibodies (5 ng/ml) to the culture medium induced Hep cell death (25–30% after 48 h), whereas no effect was observed on the Hep-X/F cells. We then functionally mapped the anti-caspase activity of HBx by generating REV2 derived cell lines expressing a number of HBx deletion and two amino acid insertion (Arg-Pro) mutants (Fig.5, A and B) (28Murakami S. Cheong J.-H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Runkel L. Fisher M. Schaller H. Virology. 1993; 197: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All mutations that affect either one of the two Kunitz-like domains strongly inhibited HBx ability to block apoptosis. Indeed, truncation of the distal segment of the Kunitz domain within the second transactivation domain (HBx/1–136) caused a significant reduction of the antiapoptotic activity. Similarly, the insertion of the amino acids arginine-proline into the first transactivation domain (at position 68/69) entirely inactivated the antiapoptotic function of HBx, whereas the insertion of arginine-proline between the amino acids 88 and 89 had no effect for the antiapoptotic HBx function (Fig. 5 A). The N-terminally truncated HBx/51–154 inhibited apoptosis with the same efficiency as the wild type HBx, whereas the HBx/1–50 mutant did not exhibit any antiapoptotic activity (Fig. 5 A). This indicates that the first 50 N-terminal amino acids of HBx, which are required for HBx dimerization (28Murakami S. Cheong J.-H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are crucial for cell transformation (13Gottlob K. Pagano S. Levrero M. Graessmann A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3566-3570PubMed Google Scholar), are entirely dispensable for the anti-caspase activity. In summary we were able to demonstrate for the first time that HBx is a potent inhibitor of the CPP32 enzyme. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect is not entirely clear. Although HBx blocks CPP32 activity it does not prevent proenzyme conversion. So far we could not demonstrate a physical interaction between CPP32 and HBx by either co-immunoprecipitation or by in vitro assays with recombinant proteins. One possible explanation may be that HBx targets additional downstream cofactors of CPP32 necessary for execution of the cell death program. Recently an heterodimeric protein that is activated by caspase 3 and triggers DNA fragmentation has been described (30Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Although we do not know how HBx blocks CPP32 activity, our results indicate that its continuous expression may protect cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli. However, HBx expressing REV2 or Hep cells are still very sensitive to doxorubicin treatment, 3K. Gottlob and A. Graessmann, unpublished observations. further suggesting that some p53-dependent apoptotic pathways are not inhibitable by HBx (5Chirillo P. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Indeed, HBx has been reported both to sensitize cells to DNA damage-induced p53-dependent apoptosis and to block cell death due to p53 overexpression (5Chirillo P. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Sturzbecher H.W.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14707-147128Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction can be partially explained by the observation that apoptosis induced by wild type p53 overexpression is efficiently blocked by caspase 3 competitive substrate inhibitors, whereas doxorubicin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis proceed at least partly through a CPP32 independent pathway (32Lotem J. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12507-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We thank S. Murakami and H. Schaller for providing us with critical reagents. We thank E.

Agonist-stimulated formation of ceramide-1-phosphate is now shown to occur in 32PO4-labeled neutrophils. Ceramide-1-phosphate is formed by a calcium-dependent ceramide kinase, found predominately in the neutrophil plasma membrane. The neutrophil kinase is specific for ceramide because, in contrast to the bacterial diglyceride kinase, ceramide is not phosphorylated under conditions specific for diglyceride phosphorylation. Conversely, 1,2-diacylglycerol does not serve as substrate for the neutrophil ceramide kinase. Ceramide kinase activation occurs in a time-dependent fashion, reaching peak activity 10 min after formyl peptide stimulation and challenge with antibody-coated erythrocytes. The lipid kinase activity is optimal at pH 6.8. Because the formation of the phagolysosome is a critical event in phagocytosis, the effect of ceramide-1-phosphate in promoting the fusion of liposomes was determined. Both the addition of increasing concentrations of sphingomyelinase D and ceramide-1-phosphate promoted liposomal fusion. In summary, ceramide-1-phosphate is formed during phagocytosis through activation of ceramide kinase. Ceramide-1-phosphate may promote phagolysosome formation.

In summary, ceramide-1-phosphate is formed during phagocytosis through activation of ceramide kinase. Ceramide-1-phosphate may promote phagolysosome formation. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) 1The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxo-1,3-diazol-4-yl; EIgG, IgG-opsonized erythrocytes. participate in host defense by releasing antimicrobial proteins from intracellular granules into phagosomes. A number of highly specialized functions, including chemotaxis, adhesion, superoxide production, and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, permit PMNs to accomplish this complex task (1Boxer G.J. Curnutte J.T. Boxer L.A. Hosp. Pract. 1985; 40: 69-90Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin G.I. Inflamation. Raven Press Ltd., New York1988: 309-323Google Scholar). The signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis are determined by the activation state of the PMN, as well as by the type of agonist used for activation. Membrane fusion plays an important role in the degranulation process by creating a pathway by which granule contents have access to phagosomes or to the extracellular milieu. Although the conditions required for PMN activation have been extensively studied, much remains to be learned about the cofactors and mechanisms that promote fusion between granules and the plasma membrane. Recently it has been shown that Ca2+ alone does not promote fusion between neutrophil granules and plasma membrane fractions using a cell-free fusion assay (3Francis J.W. Smolen K.J. Balazovich R.D. Sandborg A. Boxer L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, other components must be required to bring about phagolysosomal formation. These components likely include annexin, VAMP-2, and lipids (4Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, the lipid signaling pathways leading to these complex events have not been clearly defined. The agonist-stimulated hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids produces potent second messengers. Among these messengers is diacylglycerol, generated indirectly by phosphatidic phosphohydrolase acting on phosphatidic acid generated by phospholipase D. Phospholipase D activation accompanies phagocytosis mediated by Fc receptors in the PMN. Inhibition of either phospholipase D or phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase prevents the PMN phagocytic response. Diacylglycerol formed by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or indirectly through the phospholipase D pathway is a potent activator of protein kinase Cδ, which in turn stimulates the Raf-MEK- MAP (Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway (6Fallman M. Gullberg M. Hellberg C. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2656-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is also required for phagocytosis to ensue (8Suchard S.J. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4961-4967PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingosine formed from ceramide by the enzymatic activity of ceramidase inhibits phagocytosis by blocking the action of protein kinase Cδ as well as inhibiting the formation of diacylglycerol by phosphatidic phosphohydrolase. We recently observed that ceramide is generated at a time when the respiratory burst is terminated, indicating that ceramide may function as a critical component of receptor-mediated signaling in PMNs (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, the addition of cell-permeable ceramides blocks oxidant release (4Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last decade it has become evident that sphingolipids, in addition to being structural components of membranes, have multiple biological activities: regulating cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions and differentiation (10Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Merrill Jr., A.H. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 40: 361-414Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for a role of ceramides in signal transduction has come from studies using exogenous sphingomyelinase and cell-permeable ceramides to duplicate receptor-mediated activation. Sphingomyelinase and short chain ceramides have been used to implicate ceramides in such diverse processes as apoptosis, Ca2+ influx, superoxide generation, proliferation, and cell cycle regulation (12Obeid L.M.

With the recent cloning of the neutral sphingomyelinase and its overexpression in the U937 cell line, some of the functional effects of the exogenous cell-permeable ceramide have been questioned (17Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Wilhelm S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is a general consensus that ceramide blocks the activation of phospholipase D in fibroblasts and PMNs (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26318-26325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ceramides may therefore contribute to the attenuation of the phagocytic response in these cells. A novel pathway has previously been suggested to occur in HL-60 cells and synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane wherein ceramide produced as a result of sphingomyelinase, but not beta glucosidase, is rapidly phosphorylated by a calcium-dependent ceramide kinase (20Kolesnick R.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Kolesnick R.N. Hemer M.R. J. Biol.

Because of the effects on PMN function previously observed with ceramide, we determined whether ceramide could be metabolized to ceramide-1-phosphate in PMNs and whether the latter product might be functionally significant. In the present study we report that PMNs labeled with [32P]H3PO4 form ceramide-1-phosphate endogenously, that PMNs have a Ca2+-dependent ceramide kinase, which is distinct from diglyceride kinase, that the activity of ceramide kinase increases with PMN activation during phagocytosis, that ceramide kinase is localized mainly in the plasma membrane, and that ceramide-1-phosphate promotes Ca2+-dependent fusion of phospholipid vesicles. All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, (Birmingham, AL). Calcium chloride hydrate was purchased from Aldrich; EGTA was obtained from Fluka Chemical Co. (Ronkonkoma, NY). High performance liquid chromatography grade water was purchased from Fisher. Sphingomyelinase D (spider), fMLP, imidazole, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, diisopropylfluorophosphate, andn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside were obtained from Sigma. Ceramide-1-phosphate was generated through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase D as described under “Methods.”sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli and dithiothreitol were purchased from Calbiochem. Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from VWR (Chicago, IL); [γ-32P]adenosine-5′-triphosphate and H3[32P]O4 were obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Sheep erythrocytes were purchased from Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD). IgG was obtained from Cappel Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). Ficoll-Paque was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies used for subcellular marker protein determinations were the kind gift from Dr. Lars Kjeldsen. Cells—Human PMNs were isolated from human peripheral blood as described previously (4Nakamura T. Abe A. Balazovich K. Wu D. Suchard S.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh whole blood was obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteers and immediately added to acid citrate dextrose. The PMNs were purified by dextran sedimentation followed by hypotonic lysis to remove the majority of erythrocytes and then centrifuged through Ficoll-Paque to remove contaminating mononuclear cells. Before activation of PMNs and subcellular fractionation, cells were incubated for 5 min on ice with 5 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, washed, and resuspended in the desired buffer. Sheep erythrocytes were opsonized with antisheep erythrocyte IgG as described previously (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phagocytosis assays were conducted essentially as outlined by Pommier (23Pommier C.G. Inda I. Fries L.F. Takahashi T. Frank M.M. Brown E.J. J Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1844-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PMNs were preactivated with fMLP (100 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C, then EIgG (1 × 108/ml) were added to the activated PMNs, and the activation was continued for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously by Kjeldsen et al. (24Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Lollike K. Nielsen M.H. Borregaard N. Blood. 1994; 83: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated PMNs (control cells, fMLP-preactivated cells, or fMLP-preactivated-phagocytosing cells) were resuspended at 1.5–5 × 107/ml in disruption buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2ATP, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm piperazine, N, N′-bis-2-ethanolsulfonic acid, pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation, and the postnuclear supernatant was applied to a discontinuous Percoll gradient (1.05/1.09/1.12 g/ml). The gradient was centrifuged at 37,000 ×g for 30 min, resulting in four visible bands. These bands consisted of (from the bottom) the α-band, containing azurophil granules; the β1-band, containing specific granules; the β2-band, containing gelatinase granules; and a γ-band, containing light membranes including secretory vesicles and plasma membranes. The clear cytosol was on top. The gradient was collected as 35 fractions by aspiration from the bottom of the tube. All fractions were assayed for myeloperoxidase (an azurophil granule marker), lactoferrin (a specific granule marker), gelatinase (a gelatinase granule marker), HLA class I (a plasma membrane marker), and latent alkaline phosphatase (a marker for secretory vesicles). All marker proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (24Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Lollike K. Nielsen M.H. Borregaard N. Blood. 1994; 83: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic assay (25deChatelet L.R. Cooper M.A. Biochem. Med. 1970; 4: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The membrane pellets were washed once in phophate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C. Ceramide-1-phosphate was synthesized by use of sphingomyelinase D from spider venom. Sphingomyelin (10 mg) was dissolved in chloroform and evaporated under nitrogen. A buffer consisting of 0.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm CaCl2 was added to the dried lipid, and the mixture was probe-sonicated for 1 min. One mg of spider venom sphingomyelinase D was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. The lipids were extracted as described previously (26Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,27Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Mahdiyoun S. Thomas T.P. Wu D. Barcelon F.S. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22968-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and developed on high performance TLC in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v). The corresponding spot for ceramide-1-phosphate was identified using the radiolabeled standard, scraped, eluted, and checked again for purity by high performance TLC after mild alkaline hydrolysis. Kinase activity was measured as described by Bajjalieh et al. (22Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sonicated cells or membrane fractions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 5 μm lipid (ceramide or diacylglycerol), 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (4 Ci/mmol), and 3 mmCaCl2. The reaction was stopped with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 1 ml of 1 m NaCl. The mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged for 5 min at 800 ×g. The lower layer was washed twice with 2 ml of 1% HClO4. An equal volume of the chloroform phase was removed and dried under nitrogen. Glycerophospholipids were degraded by mild alkaline hydrolysis in 0.2 m NaOH in methanol at room temperature for 2 h. This step was omitted in studies where diacylglycerol was the substrate. Identification of the reaction product was based on comparison of the reaction product ceramide-1-phosphate to standard in several TLC solvent systems and on the demonstration that ceramide-1-phosphate was resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis. The three systems included chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:8, v/v), chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (65:43:1:3, v/v), and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1,v/v), with the latter system run on an oxalate-impregnated plate (28Jolles J. Zwiers H. Dekker A. Wirtz K.A. Gispen W.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The third system was employed for further assays. The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was determined from the percent conversion of substrate to product and the specific radioactivity of [γ-32P]ATP. For determination of pH dependence, three different buffers were used: 50 mm citric acid-sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0–6.2; 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.2–6.8; and 50 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.8–8.4. The method described by Kanohet al. (29Kanoh H. Kondoh H. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed. The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 125 μl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaF, 1.0 mm deoxycholate, 1.6 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and plasma membranes. Immediately before incubations, diacylglycerol was sonicated in the Tris-HCl buffer containing deoxycholate, NaF, and dithiothreitol. The sonication was conducted at 0 °C for 5 min at maximum intensity using a microprobe Branson Sonifier. The reaction mixture was incubated for 7 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of concentrated HCl to tubes followed by 1.5 ml of water. The reaction products were then extracted with 1.0 ml of 1-butanol. When the enzyme was assayed with phosphatidylserine, the reaction conditions were the same as those described for the standard incubation except for the omission of deoxycholate. Diacylglycerol was sonicated without detergent immediately before the incubation. PMNs (75 × 106/ml) were incubated with 18.75 μl of carrier-free H3[32P]O4 (10 mCi/ml) at room temperature in a buffer consisting of 30 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. After incubation, the PMNs were diluted and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before the measurement of phagocytosis. The reaction was terminated by the centrifugation of the PMNs, removal of the supernatant, and the addition of 2 ml methanol. After transferring the samples to a glass tube, 2 ml of methanol and 8 ml of chloroform were added, and the sample was resonicated for 30 s in a bath sonicator and centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 ×g. The supernatant was saved, and the pellets were re-extracted with 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (2/1,v/v) and sonicated for 30 s. The sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 ×g, the supernatants were combined with those of the first extraction, and 4.8 ml of 1 m NaCl were added. After centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g, the lower layer was transferred to another tube and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. The lipids were dried under nitrogen, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and applied to high performance TLC plates, which were developed using the system described above. The corresponding spots for ceramide-1-phosphate were identified by comigration with a radiolabeled standard, scraped, and quantitated by liquid scintillation. Calcium buffers were prepared in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0) such that dilutions gave a range of final ionized [Ca2+] (100 nm to 14 mm) as predicted using the system of Bers (30Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and measured using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Orion Research, Inc., Boston, MA). For liposome preparation, phospholipids were mixed, dried under argon, and redissolved in diethyl ether. Complex liposomes were prepared with a molar ratio of phsophatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine/sphingomyelin of 24:27:16:13:20 with 50 mol % cholesterol. This phospholipid composition was chosen to resemble that of neutrophil plasma membrane (31Woodin A.M. Wineke A.A. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), partially replacing phosphatidylcholine with additional sphingomyelin. To prepare NBD Rh liposomes, 1% NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine and 1% Rh-phosphatidylethanolamine were added to the initial phospholipid mixture before drying. Phospholipids dissolved in diethyl ether were emulsified with buffer A, and large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by reverse phase evaporation (32Duzgunes N. Wilschut J. Fraley R. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 642: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,33Duzgunes N. Allen T. Fedor J. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After evaporation, liposomes were extruded three times through a 0.1-μm filter to ensure uniform size. Fusion was measured by liposome dilution as described previously (34Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, large unilamellar vesicles containing 1% NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine and 1% rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine were formed such that the distance between NBD and rhodamine was sufficiently close that the rhodamine quenched the NBD fluorescence. Liposomes (300 mg of total phospholipids, 9:1 unlabeled to labeled vesicles) and sphingomyelinase D were combined in a cuvette and incubated with the addition of calcium. The fluorescence was measured continuously on an SLM 8000 spectofluorometer for 90 s. Fusion between an unlabeled liposome or granule and a labeled vesicle resulted in an increase in the distance between NBD and rhodamine and a decrease in fluorescence-quenching. Ca2+-induced vesicle lysis was controlled for by monitoring the signal in the absence of unlabeled vesicles. Previous work has demonstrated the existence of phagocytosis-dependent ceramide formation in PMNs (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain whether ceramide-1-phosphate was also formed during phagocytosis, PMNs were labeled with H3[32P]O4, the lipids were extracted, and the product profile was evaluated in several TLC solvent systems by comparison to known standards. When the labeled cell extract was developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water 10:4:3:2:1, v/v), a labeled product comigrating with ceramide-1-phosphate (Rf 0.37) was detected. This product was resistant to alkaline hydrolysis and was clearly separable from phosphatidic acid (Rf 0.52) and lysophosphatidic acid (Rf 0.27). Ceramide-1-phosphate was formed in freshly isolated PMNs labeled with high specific activity H3[32P]O4for 40 min. Basal ceramide-1-phosphate labeling did not increase significantly past 50 min of labeling. When PMNs were labeled for 30 min with H3[32P]O4 and then stimulated with 100 nm fMLP for 10 min, no significant change in ceramide-1-phosphate labeling was observed. However, if the fMLP-primed PMNs were challenged with EIgG for 10 additional min, ceramide-1-phosphate activity increased by 187% compared with time-matched control cells. The addition of EIgG in the absence of fMLP priming resulted in no significant change in ceramide-1-phosphate labeling (Fig. 1). Thus only fMLP-primed cells challenged with EIgG demonstrated increased ceramide-1-phosphate labeling over basal levels. The increase in ceramide-1-phosphate labeling paralleled both the observed increase in ceramide levels and the greater increase in phagocytic index seen with PMNs primed with fMLP (104 ± 14, mean ±S.D., n = 3) compared with unprimed cells (24 ± 14) as previously reported (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus fMLP appears to be necessary but not sufficient for the formation of ceramide and ceramide-1-phosphate and the induction of phagocytosis in suspended PMNs. A subcellular fractionation of PMNs was performed on a three layer Percoll density gradient to determine whether both ceramide kinase activity and ceramide were present in PMN plasma membranes (Fig.2, top panel). This fractionation resolved known mobilizable subsets of granules and secretory vesicles in human PMNs. Secretory vesicles (identified by latent alkaline phosphatase) and plasma membranes (recognized by HLA class I) were present in the light-membrane region. The profiles of these two markers overlapped with the secretory vesicles being slightly denser and extending lower into the gradient and the plasma membranes being slightly lighter and remaining in the upper part of the gradient. The cytosol was present above the light membrane fractions (fractions 25 to 35). The subcellular fractions were assayed for the presence of ceramide kinase activity. Although ceramide was present in all fractions, the lipid kinase activity was primarily localized in plasma membrane fractions (1.64 ± 0.8 pmol/min/mg of protein). A lower activity was detected in the cytosolic fractions (0.49 ± 0.09 pmol/min/mg of protein) (Fig. 2, bottom panel). These initial data were consistent with the presence of ceramide kinase activity in the PMN plasma membrane. The E. coli diglyceride kinase phosphorylates both diacylglycerol and ceramide. By contrast, ceramide has not been demonstrated to be a substrate for mammalian diglyceride kinase. It was reasonable to determine whether the formation of ceramide-1-phosphate was the result of a Ca2+-dependent ceramide kinase or whether a Mg2+-dependent diacylglycerol kinase activity might be responsible for the ceramide kinase activity. If the PMN diglyceride kinase is responsible for the synthesis of ceramide-1-phosphate, then 1,2-diacylglycerol should demonstrate competitive inhibition of ceramide for such a diacylglycerol kinase but not for the ceramide kinase. When ceramide (0.1 mm) was used as substrate, increasing concentrations of 1,2-diacylglycerol (0.1 to 3.0 mm) failed to inhibit calcium-dependent ceramide phosphorylation even though there was a concentration-dependent increase in phosphatidic acid (Fig.3 A). Moreover, ceramide phosphorylation was blocked in the presence of 25 mmMgCl2 in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3 B). Finally, when 1,2 diacyglycerol (0.1 mm) was present, increasing concentrations of ceramide (0.1 to 3.0 mm) failed to diminish phosphatidic acid formation (Fig. 3 C). These data are consistent with the presence of separate calcium-dependent diglyceride kinase and ceramide kinase activities. When incubations were performed in the presence of phosphatidylserine, a known activator of most diglyceride kinases (29Kanoh H. Kondoh H. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ceramide kinase activity declined with increasing phosphatidylserine concentrations (Fig. 4). Amphiphilic detergents such as deoxycholate are known activators of diglyceride kinase. Therefore, ceramide kinase activity was assayed in plasma membrane fractions using ceramide or dioleoylglycerol as substrate in the assay system containing deoxycholate. Ceramide-1-phosphate formation was not observed under these assay conditions (data not shown). These data are consistent with the interpretation that the lipid kinase activity in PMNs, responsible for ceramide-1-phosphate formation, is a ceramide kinase distinct from diglyceride kinase. The effects of calcium and magnesium on the phosphorylation of ceramide were also studied (Fig. 5). The ceramide kinase activity varied between 6.09 ± 0.9 and 17.69 ± 0.89 pmol/min/2 × 106 cell equivalents when free Ca2+ was varied between 0 and 5 mm. In contrast, diacylglycerol kinase activity was unaffected by any change in free calcium concentration (data not shown). Mg2+depressed ceramide kinase activity at all concentrations studied. The pH dependence of PMN ceramide kinase activity was assessed (Fig.6). No measurable activity was observed at pH values less than 5. Maximal calcium-dependent ceramide phosphorylation occurred at pH 6.8 and rapidly fell to a minimal level at pH 8.2. The activity was therefore optimal within a physiological pH range. Lineweaver-Burke analysis of ceramide kinase activity was obtained with varying concentrations of ATP (0.01 μm-10 mm). An apparent V max = 0.820 pmol/min/mg of protein and an apparent K m = 13.08 μm for ATP were determined. It has been previously reported that activation of a Mg2+-dependent, neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramide formation occurs during phagocytosis (35Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Kjeldsen L. Mansfield P. Boxer L.J. Shayman J.A. Suchard S. Blood. 1998; 91: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide kinase activity increased for 10 min after fMLP stimulation and EIgG challenge (Fig. 7). Activity rapidly fell by 15 min to levels approaching the basal inactivated state. Changes in granule and/or plasma membrane phospholipid composition may alter their fusogenic potential and, thus, may serve as one mechanism to regulate granule-plasma membrane fusion. The Ca2+ requirements for liposome fusion in control “complex” liposomes with a phospholipid composition that resembled that of human PMN plasma membranes were determined. The threshold for complex liposome fusion was 6 mm Ca2+ (Fig.8). To evaluate the effect of ceramide-1-phosphate on liposome fusion, complex liposomes were prepared by replacing 50% of the sphingomyelin with ceramide-1-phosphate (10% final phospholipid composition). The incorporation of ceramide-1-phosphate into complex liposomes had no effect on threshold fusion Ca2+ requirements. However, the rate and extent of fusion were significantly increased. Sphingomyelinase D was used to understand further the potential effect of ceramide-1-phosphate on granule-plasma membrane fusion. The treatment of liposomes with sphingomyelinase D had no effect on Ca2+-dependent fusion thresholds. However, increasing concentrations of sphingomyelinase D resulted in an increase in both the initial rate of fusion as well as the total fusion of complex liposomes (Fig. 9 B). To determine the extent of phospholipid metabolism that occurred during our fusion assay, ceramide-1-phosphate generation in parallel experiments was quantitated (Fig. 9 A). Increasing concentrations of sphingomyelinase D were incubated with complex liposomes for 30 min at 37 °C. The lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography. As expected, sphingomyelinase D produced a concentration-dependent conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide-1-phosphate. An augmentation in fusogenicity was observed when as little as 0.45% of the membrane phospholipid composition was ceramide-1-phosphate. In parallel experiments performed in the absence of unlabeled liposomes only a minimal signal could be detected. Thus fusion was dependent on the presence of Ca2+and could not be explained by lysis of the labeled vesicles. Sphingomyelinase D alone was not fusogenic because no fusion occurred without either preincubation (phospholipid metabolism) or Ca2+. Our results from this and previous studies indicate a role for both ceramide and the metabolite ceramide-1-phosphate in modulating the functional behavior of PMN during phagocytosis. The signal that a cell receives depends upon the balance of production of bioactive lipids; thus, it is important that the role of ceramide-1-phosphate in PMN be elucidated. Our previous data indicate that the sphingomyelin pathway is important to PMN activation (9Suchard S. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of EIgG by suspended PMN stimulates a parallel increase in both neutral sphingomyelinase activity and ceramide within the first min of activation. Ceramide may be further metabolized to ceramide phosphate by ceramide kinase or sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate or N, N-dimethylsphingosine by the sequential action of either ceramidase and sphingosine kinase or ceramidase and methyltransferase, respectively (36Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Igarashi Y. Kitamura K. Toyokuni T. Dean B. Fenderson B. Ogawa T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 265: 5385-5389Google Scholar, 38Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3154-3159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although ceramide levels increase during phagocytosis, it may be one of those second messengers that is regulating phagocytosis. In this study it is reported that another enzyme, ceramide kinase, can mediate ceramide catabolism. The present study identifies the existence of ceramide kinase activity in human neutrophils. This calcium-dependent ceramide kinase is localized to the plasma membrane and secretory vesicles based on the colocalization with the plasma membrane marker HLA and with the secretory vesicle marker latent alkaline phosphatase. Previous studies have shown that Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis induces an increase in activity in a plasma membrane-associated neutral sphingomyelinase in fMLP-activated human PMN. The increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity resulted in increased ceramide levels. The presence of ceramide kinase activity in the plasma membrane is consistent with these previously identified signaling events. Ceramide kinase activity has been previously reported in HL-60 cells (21Kolesnick R.N. Hemer M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18803-18808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Dressler K. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier reports, PMN ceramide kinase activity was observed to be calcium-dependent and optimally active at physiologic calcium concentrations and neutral pH. The ceramide kinase activity is distinguishable from diacylglycerol kinase based on both substrate specificity and cation requirements. Ceramide kinase activity is also inhibited in the presence of phosphatidylserine, an activator of diacylglycerol kinase. Ceramide kinase activity increased in the PMN plasma membrane when the cells were activated with fMLP and EIgG, whereas diacylglycerol kinase activity failed to rise. These data contrast with those reported for human leukemia HL-60 cells. The ceramide kinase activity in this cell line, although separable from diglyceride kinase activity, was Mg2+-stimulable (21Kolesnick R.N. Hemer M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18803-18808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the physiological function of ceramide kinase. Gomez-Munoz et al. reported that DNA synthesis could be stimulated by using synthetic short chain ceramide-1-phosphate (19Gomez-Munoz A. Waggoner D. O'Brein L. Brindley D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26318-26325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The presence of ceramide kinase activity in synaptic vesicles has led to the suggestions that ceramide-1-phosphate may attenuate membrane charge, regulate vesicle transport, or mediate membrane fusion. Phospholipid composition is known to play a significant role in membrane fusogenicity. Because exogenous sphingomyelinase has been observed to induce vesicle formation from the plasma membrane of macrophages, it seemed reasonable to ascertain whether ceramide-1-phosphate could affect membrane fusion. Experiments with synthetic phosphatidylcholine vesicles demonstrated that calcium-induced vesicle fusion was correlated with phosphatidic acid content. Because the phosphorylation of ceramide would produce an acidic phospholipid similar in structure to phosphatidic acid, the role of ceramide-1-phosphate in phospholipid-dependent vesicle fusion was explored. Complex liposomes were prepared with a phospholipid composition similar to that of PMN plasma membrane with and without the incorporation of ceramide-1-phosphate. Ceramide-1-phosphate enhanced phospholipid-dependent vesicle fusion. Although direct incorporation of phospholipids into vesicles is an accepted method for controlling phospholipid composition, this method assumes that all phospholipids are equally distributed throughout the membrane and therefore cannot account for local pooling of individual phospholipids. The potential role of phosphatidic acid (40Blackwood R.A. Transue A.T. Harsh D.M. Brower R.C. Zacharec S.J. Smolen J.E. Hessler R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and arachidonic acid (41Forehand J.R. Johnston R.B. Bomalaski J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4918-4925PubMed Google Scholar) formation on membrane fusion events has been previously examined using exogenous phospholipases. The augmentation of phospholipid vesicle fusion by ceramide-1-phosphate was verified by the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide-1-phosphate with sphingomyelinase D. This augmentation was observed when as little as 0.5% (1% of the outer membrane leaflet) was ceramide-1-phosphate, suggesting that ceramide-1-phosphate formation potentially may play a positive regulatory role in PMN granule-plasma membrane fusion. The fusogenic effects of ceramide-1-phosphate were distinct from those previously reported for proteins such as annexins and free fatty acids. These latter factors lower the calcium requirements and not the rate of membrane fusion (42Francis J.W. Balazovich K.J. Smolen J.E. Margolis S.D. Boxer L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus ceramide-1-phosphate serves as a cofactor for membrane fusion, a hypothesis that is currently under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2069637967,"The antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of the human cathelicidin peptide LL-37 is inhibited by plasma. Because LL-37 does not undergo rapid degradation in human plasma, we postulated that this inhibition results from binding of LL-37 to unidentified proteins. An LL-37 binding plasma protein has now been isolated by affinity chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins that bound to an LL-37 column revealed one band with a molecular mass of about 26 kDa, and amino acid sequence analysis identified the protein as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance showed that LL-37 and isolated apoA-I bind with an apparent K d in the low micromolar range. 50 μm of apoA-I inhibits the antibacterial activity of 50 μm LL-37 by about 50% of the inhibition exhibited by plasma. In addition, anti-apoA-I IgG completely blocks the plasma inhibition of LL-37 antibacterial activity up to a peptide concentration of 25 μm and blocks most of the plasma inhibition at higher LL-37 concentrations. These results indicate that apoA-I is the main LL-37 binding protein in human plasma and may work as a scavenger of LL-37, thus suggesting a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of a cathelicidin peptide.

Naturally occurring antibacterial peptides are widespread and play an important role in host defense (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). These peptides are derived from gene-encoded precursors by proteolysis. Cathelicidins constitute one family of such peptides that has been identified in bovine, porcine, rabbit, mouse, ovine, and human tissues (2Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 3Gallo R.L. Kim K.J. Bernfield M. Kozak C.A. Zanetti M. Merluzzi L. Gennaro R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cathelicidins have a conserved N-terminal region followed by a highly variable C-terminal antibacterial domain. The sequence of the proregion is similar to cathelin, isolated from porcine leukocytes as a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (5Ritonja A. Kopitar M. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The C-terminal parts generate the active peptides, which can be divided into three structurally different groups. One group contains α-helical peptides; another consists of peptides rich in certain residues, such as Pro, Arg, and Trp; and a third group are peptides with one or two disulfide bonds. Cathelicidins exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, and fungicidal activity (6Kokryakov V.N. Harwig S.S.L. Panyutich E.A. Shevchenko A.A. Aleshina G.M. Shamova O.V. Korneva H.A. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The human cathelicidin LL-37 was originally predicted from a cDNA clone (7Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and the mature peptide LL-37 was isolated from degranulated granulocytes (8Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Odeberg J. Bergman T. Olsson B. Salcedo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). LL-37 is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The LL-37 CAMP(cathelicidin antimicrobialpeptide) gene is up-regulated during inflammatory skin disorders, whereas no expression was detected in normal skin (9Frohm M. Agerberth B. Ahangari G. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Lidén S. Wigzell H. Gudmundsson G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15258-15263Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene is highly expressed in lung epithelia, and significant expression is also found in other epithelial tissues like the gastrointestinal tract (10Bals R. Wang X. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9541-9546Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), suggesting that LL-37 participates in the human first line of defense. LL-37 is highly cationic and transforms from an unordered to amphipathic α-helical structure in an anion-, pH-, and concentration-dependent manner; the antibacterial activity of LL-37 correlates with the α-helical content (11Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The minimal inhibitory concentration of LL-37 against Escherichia coli D21 is 5 μm, and LL-37 down to 15 μm is cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells (11Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Therefore it seems likely that released LL-37 is harmful to host cells. However, in human plasma both the antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of LL-37 is inhibited, which is not caused by proteolysis (11Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We have now isolated the main LL-37 binding protein from human plasma and identified it as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). 1The abbreviations used are: apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. Investigations of the interactions between LL-37 and apoA-I suggest that apoA-I can function as a scavenger of LL-37 and thereby prevent host cell damage. Streptavidin-agarose, human apoA-I, human albumin, and egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) were from Sigma. Sheep anti-human apoA-I IgG was from The Binding Site. Human plasma was from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at Karolinska Hospital. Phast gels were from Pharmacia, and Sep-Pak cartridges were from Waters. All chemicals for peptide synthesis were from Perkin-Elmer. Biotinyl-Lys-(Gly)3-LL-37 (biotinylated LL-37) was synthesized withtert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry in an ABI 430A peptide synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer), starting from 1 g of resin-bound LL-37 (11Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). First three Gly residues were added, and thereafterN ε-biotinyl-Lys (Bachem) dissolved in dimethylformamide was added using double coupling. The protecting groups were removed, and the peptide was released from the resin by cleavage in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride/anisol/dimethylsulfide (10:1:1 v/v/v) for 80 min at 0 °C. After removal of scavenger and protecting groups with diethylether, the peptide was recovered in 30% acetic acid and lyophilized. Biotinylated LL-37 was isolated by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column and a linear gradient of acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass of the purified peptide determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was 5023 Da (calculated 5019 Da). The antibacterial activity of biotinylated LL-37 is identical to that of LL-37, as determined by the inhibition zone assay (see below). The secondary structure of biotinylated LL-37 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 or pH 5.0, is indistinguishable from that of LL-37, as judged by CD spectroscopy. Biotinylated LL-37 (50 nmol) in 1 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was mixed with 1 ml of streptavidin-agarose suspension. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then poured into a glass column (inner dimeter, 0.6 cm). After equilibration with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 ml of human plasma was added, and the column was incubated for 20 min. Thereafter the plasma was eluted, the column was washed with 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and finally eluted with 2 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. The low pH eluate was desalted on a reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 column (125 Å pore size) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the protein was eluted with 80% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The Sep-Pak eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and sequence analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed in 10–15% gradient gels with the Phast-system (Pharmacia). Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out in an ABI 494 Protein Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer), and phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified by HPLC. For antibacterial assay, LL-37 was dissolved at 25–220 μm in different solutions, including (i) water, (ii) human plasma, (iii) 50 μm apoA-I in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), (iv) 670 μm albumin in buffer A, (v) apoA-I (50 μm), and albumin (670 μm) in buffer A, (vi) PC (0.3–1.5 mm) in buffer A, (vii) apoA-I (35 μm) and PC (600 μm) in buffer A, (viii) human plasma (which contains 35–70 μm apoA-I) plus anti-apoA-I IgG (100 μm), (ix) the flow-through from the LL-37 affinity column, and (x) human plasma diluted with buffer A. 1-mm-thick plates were poured with Luria-Bertani broth containing medium E (0.8 mm MgSO4, 9.6 mm citric acid, 57.4 mm K2HPO4, and 16.7 mmNaNH4HPO4), 1% agarose, and approximately 6 × 104 E. coli D21 cells/ml. Wells (diameter, 3 mm) were punched in the plates and loaded with 3 μl of sample. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, the diameters of inhibition zones were recorded (12Hultmark D. Engström Å. Andersson K. Steiner H. Bennich H. Boman H.G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Real time interaction studies were performed using Biacore 2000 (Biacore AB) optical biosensor system (13Jönsson U. Fägestam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky S. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated LL-37 was immobilized on a streptavidin coated SA sensor chip (Biacore AB) to a level of about 1900 response units. A continuous flow (30 μl/min) of buffer containing 113 mm NaCl, 24 mmNaHCO3, 3.9 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% Surfactant P20 (Biacore AB), pH 7.3, was maintained over the sensor surface. ApoA-I was diluted in buffer to concentrations from 2.5 to 15 μm. Samples of apoA-I (150 μl) were injected over immobilized LL-37 at a flow of 30 μl/min. After the sample pulse the dissociation of bound apoA-I was recorded for 10 min. Prior to the next sample the LL-37 surface was regenerated with 15 μl of 1m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH. Unspecific binding was monitored by using a reference flow cell containing a streptavidin or biotin-streptavidin-coated sensor chip. There was no difference in the unspecific binding to these two chips. Binding to the reference cell was subtracted from the data generated in the LL-37 cell. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The data were evaluated using Biaevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB). Human plasma proteins that bind to biotinylated LL-37 were purified by affinity chromatography. The bound proteins were eluted from the column by 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. pH 5.0 was chosen for elution because at this pH protein side chain carboxylate anions (presumed to be involved in charge interactions with polycationic LL-37) start to get protonated, but LL-37 (and biotinylated LL-37) still exhibits 70% of the helical content observed at pH 7.4. Therefore pH 5.0 buffer was expected to decrease charge interactions between LL-37 and bound protein while retaining a mainly helical conformation of LL-37. SDS-PAGE of the eluate showed only one band with a molecular mass of about 26 kDa (Fig. 1). Edman degradation for 20 cycles unambiguously identified the protein as human apoA-I (Fig. 2). The calculated molecular mass of human apoA-I is 28 kDa and is thus in good agreement with the mass estimated from SDS-PAGE.Figure 2The LL-37 binding protein is apolipoprotein A-I. Amino acid sequences of human apoA-I and that determined of the LL-37 binding protein are compared. The sequence determined is identical to that of human apoA-I residues 1–20. Residues that were not unambiguously determined are indicated by X. The Pro amount was 19 pmol in cycle 3 and 17 pmol in cycle 4, and no other residue increased in cycle 4, strongly indicating Pro also at position 4. At cycle 6 only Ser increases, as judged by visual inspection of the chromatogram, but integration of the peak area does not unambiguously support this assignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The amount of apoA-I that bound to the affinity column was estimated from the inhibition of LL-37 antibacterial activity exhibited by the flow-through, compared with diluted plasma. The flow-through showed the same inhibition as plasma diluted to 85%. Assuming that the decreased inhibition is caused only by removal of apoA-I, this means that 50 μm apoA-I (mean apoA-I concentration in human plasma) × 2 ml (plasma volume applied) × 0.15 = 15 nmol of apoA-I bound to the LL-37 column. Provided that there is a 1:1 binding between LL-37 and apoA-I, the maximal binding is 50 nmol. Finally, apoA-I isolated by Sep-Pak chromatography inhibited LL-37 antibacterial activity to the same extent as commercially available apoA-I (see below), and the apoA-I yield during Sep-Pak chromatography was about 75%. In some affinity purification experiments, albumin was found together with apoA-I. We believe this is caused by the large amounts of albumin in plasma (10–20 times the apoA-I concentration) and possibly also by secondary interactions between albumin and apoA-I bound to LL-37. No effects of albumin on the LL-37 antibacterial activity could be found (see below). To find out whether apoA-I isolated from human plasma inhibits LL-37 antibacterial activity, LL-37 at different concentrations was mixed with 50 μm apoA-I, and the activity against E. coliD21 was analyzed. At 220 μm of LL-37, apoA-I exhibited 30% of the inhibitory capacity of plasma, whereas at 50 μm of LL-37, 50% of the plasma inhibition was reached, as determined from the inhibition zone diameters, where a doubled LL-37 concentration yields an increase in zone diameter of 1 mm. The discrepancy in inhibitory capacity between isolated apoA-I and plasma could be caused by apoA-I being removed from its plasma environment or by the existence of additional LL-37 binding plasma proteins not detected by affinity chromatography. The following two control experiments indicate that the former alternative (isolated apoA-I being less effective than apoA-I in plasma) is the most likely explanation: (i) Addition of anti-apoA-I IgG to human plasma restores the LL-37 antibacterial activity to that observed in water (Fig.3). This strongly indicates that no other plasma protein contributes significantly to plasma inhibition of LL-37. The incomplete recovery at high LL-37 concentrations (Fig. 3) may be caused by LL-37 competing with antibodies for apoA-I binding or by LL-37 interacting also with phospholipids (see below). (ii) Albumin at 670 μm does not affect LL-37 antibacterial activity, and addition of albumin to apoA-I does not increase the inhibitory capacity. We conclude that apoA-I is the main, or only, LL-37 binding protein in human plasma. However, PC·apoA-I complexes as well as PC alone partly inhibit the antibacterial activity of LL-37. It is thus possible that LL-37-phospholipid interactions can contribute to the plasma inhibition of LL-37. Real time interactions between LL-37 and apoA-I were studied by surface plasmon resonance detection using immobilized biotinylated LL-37. Confirming the results from affinity chromatography, biosensor studies showed a binding between LL-37 and apoA-I. An overlay plot of sensorgrams for different concentrations of apoA-I is shown in Fig. 4. The obtained data were used for calculation of apparent association (K a) and dissociation (K d) constants. A 1:1 interaction model was found to be the most relevant, as judged from the residuals between fitted curves and experimental data. Global fitting of data from three experiments, covering three to five apoA-I concentrations each, was applied for simultaneous calculation of apparent association and dissociation rate constants.K d for the LL-37-apoA-I interaction was calculated from the kinetic rate constants (k on = 0.7–1.6 × 103m−1s−1; k off = 1.0–2.3 × 10−3 s−1) and was in the range 0.6–2.4 μm. K a was in the range 0.4–1.5 × 106m−1. A protein responsible for plasma inhibition of LL-37 antibacterial/lytic activity was isolated by affinity chromatography and identified as apolipoprotein A-I. ApoA-I is concluded to be the main, or only, plasma protein that binds and inhibits LL-37: (i) isolated apoA-I inhibits the antibacterial activity of LL-37 to 50% compared with the inhibition exerted by whole plasma and (ii) addition of anti-apoA-I IgG to plasma completely blocks inhibition of the antibacterial activity up to 25 μm LL-37. In addition, real time binding analysis confirmed the results from affinity chromatography and showed that the LL-37-apoA-I binding has aK d of about 1–2 μm. LL-37 is cytotoxic to human leukocytes at concentrations (15–25 μm) that are only three to five times its minimal inhibitory concentration value against bacteria, includingPseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli (10Bals R.

Agerberth, and J. Johansson, unpublished observation. The LL-37 precursor is present in plasma (14Sorensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the mature peptide is found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 3B. Agerberth, J. Grunewald, E. Castaños-Velez, B. Olsson, H. Jörnvell, H. Wigzell, A. Eklund, and G. H. Gudmundsson, manuscript in preparation. This and the fact that other cathelicidins are released from neutrophil granulocytes (15Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) suggest that LL-37 acts extracellularly. Furthermore, LL-37 is up-regulated during different inflammatory skin disorders, giving a high concentration at inflammatory sites (9Frohm M. Agerberth B. Ahangari G. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Lidén S. Wigzell H. Gudmundsson G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15258-15263Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). If this applies to inflammatory disorders in general, the existence of mechanisms that protect against LL-37 cytotoxicity appear relevant. LL-37 and apoA-I could interact both at inflammatory sites and in plasma, because the blood vessels are permeable to both proteins and because LL-37 could be released from the precursor in plasma. The apparentK d for the LL-37-apoA-I binding implies that physiological apoA-I plasma concentrations (50 μm) will scavenge >90% of LL-37 at concentrations (25 μm) where it is cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells. Thus, our data suggest that apoA-I can function as a scavenger of LL-37 and thereby prevent host cell damage secondary to LL-37 release at inflammatory sites. This is the first report describing inhibitory mechanisms involved in the regulation of cathelicidin antibacterial peptides. However, defensins bind to activated α2-macroglobulin in plasma, which was suggested as a scavenging mechanism in inflamed tissues (16Panyutich A. Ganz T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ApoA-I apparently has several antiinflammatory functions in addition to its possible role in scavenging LL-37; it is involved in the protection against endotoxins (17Levine D.M. Parker T.S. Donnelly T.M. Walsh A. Rubin A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12040-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), binds and inhibits polymerization of complement factor C9 (18Hamilton K.K. Zhzo J. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3632-3638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibits IgG-induced neutrophil activation as measured by degranulation and superoxide production (19Blackburn W.D. Dohlman J.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Pillion D.J. Koopman W.J Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1911-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter function is mediated by free apoA-I but not by high density lipoprotein particles, which may in turn serve as a regulatory mechanism because acute phase proteins may displace apoA-I from high density lipoprotein particles during inflammation (19Blackburn W.D. Dohlman J.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Pillion D.J. Koopman W.J Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1911-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I contains amphipathic α-helical regions and complement factor C9 and LL-37 likewise contain amphipathic helices. It is tempting to speculate that the amphipathic helices of apoA-I, which are central for its ability to interact with phospholipids, also serve to bind amphipathic peptides. Several cathelicidin peptides are amphipathic and may also be subject to scavenging by apoA-I or other amphipathic plasma proteins. Notably, the antibacterial activity of the porcine cathelicidin PR-39, which is neither lytic nor amphipathic (20Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cabiaux V. Agerberth B. Johansson J. Homblé F. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In conclusion we show that apolipoprotein A-I binds LL-37, suggesting that this could be a means of attenuating cytotoxic effects at inflammatory sites. Drs.

One of the primary metabolic responses mediated by insulin is the stimulation of facilitated glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissues. It is now widely accepted that insulin regulates glucose uptake in adipocytes by recruiting GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins to the plasma membrane from an intracellular membrane pool (1Stephens J.M.

However, the role of IRS-1 proteins in insulin action on glucose transport is less clear, with some studies indicating that IRS protein tyrosine phosphorylation can be blocked without affecting glucose transport activation (23Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also it has been shown that the protein serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PBK), which functions as an effector of 3′-polyphosphoinositides and becomes activated by insulin (26Franke T.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). However, evidence against this latter hypothesis has been reported (30Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H.

It has recently been reported that integrin engagement on the surface membrane of cells also promotes activation of PI 3-kinase as well as activation of Akt kinase (31King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that α5β1-integrin cross-linking enhances IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity and potentiates insulin signaling in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human insulin receptors (CHO-T) (32Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we addressed the question of whether β1-integrin clustering in rat adipocytes also activates the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt/PKB pathway and whether activation of this signaling pathway by β1-integrin might stimulate glucose transport as does insulin. Here we show that β1-integrin engagement indeed markedly enhances IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity as well as Akt/PKB activation but has no effect on glucose uptake in rat adipocytes. This result supports the hypothesis that one or more other signaling pathways, perhaps acting in conjunction with IRS/PI 3-kinase complexes, appear to be necessary to activate glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 and anti-p85 polyclonal antibody used for immunoblotting were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 immunoglobulin used for immunoprecipitation was prepared as described previously (33Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-β1-integrin antibody used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting was a gift from Dr. C. Michael DiPersio. Phospho-Akt (Ser473) specific polyclonal antibody was from New England Biolabs, Inc. Plasma human fibronectin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary protein A, and secondary antibodies were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein A-Sepharose was from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP, 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose, and the Renaissance Chemiluminescence Detection System were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Centriprep-10 concentrators were obtained from Amicon. The bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit was from Pierce. PI was from Avanti Lipids, and silica gel G TLC plates were from Whatman. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of Male Sprague-Dawley Rats (125–150 g) by collagenase digestion using Krebs-Ringer/HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 2 mmpyruvate. After 30 min of rest, cells were incubated at 37 °C with or without anti-β1-integrin monoclonal antibody, K20 (4 μg/ml), and plasma human fibronectin (40 μg/ml) for 30 min and then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and immediately homogenized in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and subjected to differential centrifugation as described previously (34Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to obtain subcellular fractions. Plasma membrane and low density microsomes fractions were resuspended in buffer A, and cytosolic fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep-10 apparatus. Protein was quantified by bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. GLUT-4 enriched fractions were prepared from rat adipocyte low density microsomes, utilizing the sedimentation sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation method exactly as described (35Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). IRS-1 and β1-integrin were immunoprecipitated from subcellular fractions prepared as described above. For IRS-1 immunoprecipitation, buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to cytosol or low density microsomes as indicated in the figure legends and kept on ice for 20 min, and 20 μg of anti-IRS-1 polyclonal immunoglobulin was added to solubilize subcellular fractions. For β1-integrin immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting plasma membrane (100 μg) was solubilized in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated overnight with 5 μl of anti-β1-integrin polyclonal antibody or 10 μg of nonimmune rabbit IgG. The mixtures were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing, protein A-Sepharose was added, and samples were incubated for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times in PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with appropriate antibody (33Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IRS-1-associated PI-3-kinase activity assays were performed as described previously (33Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxy-glucose uptake was measured in isolated adipocytes as described (20Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether rat adipocytes contain β1-integrin, we performed immunoprecipitation and immunodetection of this integrin in adipocytes using a specific anti-β1-integrin antibody. Analysis of the adipocyte plasma membrane subcellular fraction separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-β1-integrin antibody revealed the presence of a 130-kDa band, corresponding to the molecular mass of β1-integrin (36Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), that could be immunoprecipitated by this antibody but not by nonimmune IgG (data not shown). These data confirmed the presence of β1-integrin in rat adipocytes. β1-Integrin clustering caused by incubating cells with activating anti-β1-integrin monoclonal K20 antibody and fibronectin has been shown to activate integrin signaling pathway and promote tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (37Kornberg L.-J. Earp H.S. Turne C.E. Prockop C. Juliano R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 38Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). We confirmed and extended these findings by treating isolated rat adipocytes with K20 antibody plus fibronectin and examining the effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation detected by Western blotting with anti-tyrosine antibody 4G10. β1-Integrin activation promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of 130-, 140-, and 58-kDa proteins in cytosol, low density microsomes, and subcellular fractions, respectively, prepared from adipocytes (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the engagement of β1-integrin activates signaling pathways that enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in isolated rat adipocytes. Next, we examined whether β1-integrin activation modulates signaling by insulin. Fig.1 A shows that β1-integrin engagement in rat adipocytes markedly potentiated the ability of insulin to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor at both submaximal and maximal doses of the hormone. Similar to this effect observed on insulin receptor phosphorylation, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of insulin and in response to all doses of insulin employed was enhanced by β1-integrin clustering, as shown in Fig. 1(B and C). These data suggest that β1-integrin signaling in adipocytes enhances insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. These data are also consistent with our previous report showing enhanced insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins by α5β1-integrin activation in CHO-T cells (32Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We recently observed that the enhanced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by α5β1-integrin engagement in CHO-T cells is associated with increased binding and activity of the p85/p110 PI 3-kinase (32Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effect of β1-integrin activation on the association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 as well as the PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from rat adipocytes. As seen in Figs. 1 and2, β1-integrin clustering promotes the increased association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, as well as PI 3-kinase activity, with IRS-1 immunoprecipitates in the absence or presence of submaximal and maximal concentrations of insulin. The protein serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB has recently been shown to be activated by insulin, and substantial evidence indicates that Akt/PKB functions downstream of PI 3-kinase (26Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 27Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt/PKB occurs by its phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 by the protein kinase PDK1 and an unknown kinase, respectively. Thus, experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of β1-integrin engagement on Akt/PKB activation as detected by its enhanced phosphorylation at serine 473 in adipocytes treated with a range of insulin concentrations. As seen in Fig.3, β1-integrin clustering was associated with a significant, severalfold increase in serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt/PKB in adipocytes, using an antibody specific to this epitope. Enhanced serine phosphorylation in Akt/PKB was also observed when either submaximal or maximal doses of insulin were employed, similar to the effect of β1-integrin engagement on IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2). It has been shown that expression of high levels of PI 3-kinase or Akt/PKB is sufficient to promote increased glucose transport in adipocytes (29Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed experiments to examine the effect of β1-integrin engagement on 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in adipocytes treated without or with various concentrations of insulin. Surprisingly, as seen in Fig.4, no effect of β1-integrin clustering was observed on GLUT4 translocation nor on 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake, neither in the absence nor in the presence of submaximal or maximal concentrations of insulin. In contrast, insulin was found to stimulate glucose uptake severalfold, as expected, in a concentration-dependent manner. The data presented here demonstrate a novel insulin-independent mode by which IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, its associated PI 3-kinase activity, and Akt/PKB activity can be enhanced in primary rat adipocytes. Although β1-integrin signaling on these proteins is not as great as a maximal concentration of insulin, it is equal to the effects observed with about 1–10 nm insulin under our experimental conditions (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). This latter concentration range of insulin causes nearly maximal activation of deoxyglucose uptake (Fig. 4), whereas β1-integrin cross-linking is without effect. One explanation for this may relate to a different localization of IRS-1/PI 3-kinase complexes (42Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in response to β1-integrin cross-linking as compared with insulin as previously emphasized for the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (44Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepard P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, in the present experiments we found that both β1-integrin cross-linking and insulin caused an increase in IRS-1-associated p85 protein in low density microsomes as well as an increase in the level of p85 protein associated with the enriched GLUT4-containing vesicle fraction (data not shown). The extent to which β1-integrin signaling caused these increases is proportional to the magnitude of its effect on total IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity compared with the effect of insulin. Taken together, these results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that generation of signaling complexes containing IRS proteins and PI 3-kinase are insufficient to mediate insulin's action on GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. Previous reports consistent with this conclusion include the finding that interleukin 4-mediated IRS-1 phosphorylation does not activate glucose transport (45Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), as well as reports that blocking IRS protein phosphorylation by insulin does not ablate insulin action on glucose transport (23Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, although PI 3-kinase activity is absolutely required for insulin to regulate glucose transport (20Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), there may be mechanisms alternative to IRS proteins by which PI 3-kinase is modulated by insulin. Another reasonable interpretation of our data is that a second insulin-stimulated signaling pathway operates in parallel to the IRS/PI 3-kinase pathway to generate the necessary process by which GLUT4 translocation is initiated. This concept is consistent with a recent report indicating that a cell permeable phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate species cannot mimic insulin action on glucose transport but can reverse the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on insulin action (46Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Those data suggest the hypothesis that insulin initiates both PI 3-kinase-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent signaling pathways that are necessary to regulate glucose transport. According to this model, β1-integrin signaling might fail to activate deoxyglucose uptake because it initiates only the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway but not the PI 3-kinase-independent mechanism. Further work will be required to rigorously test this concept and to identify potential alternative or additional mechanisms by which insulin is able to mediate its distinct effect on GLUT4 translocation.

Tryptase easily excised bradykinin from the synthetic heptadecapeptide, ISLMKRPPGFSPFRSSR, but was unable to produce significant amounts of kinin by proteolysis of kininogens. However, a mixture of tryptase and elastase released bradykinin from each protein with a yield comparable to that of human plasma kallikrein. Significantly, neither plasma nor tissue kallikrein was able to effectively process N-chlorosuccinimide-oxidized high molecular weight kininogen, an effect attributed to the oxidation of a methionine residue upstream from the N terminus of the kinin domain. In support of these results the model heptadecapetide, ISL(MO)KRPPGFSPFRSSR, was also resistant to hydrolysis by either kallikrein. In contrast, the release of bradykinin from oxidized peptide or protein substrates by the tryptase/elastase mixture was not altered. Because kininogen modification may occur at inflammatory sites, as a result of the oxidative burst of recruited neutrophils and macrophages, these results suggest an alternative pathway for kinin production and the necessity for the novel utilization of two specific proteinases known to be released from these cells during inflammatory episodes.

Mast cells are distributed in the body near surfaces exposed to the external environment. They are believed to contribute to the first line of host defense against bacterial or parasite infection through the release of an array of proinflammatory mediators after stimulation (1Galli S.J.

Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. Mediators of the Inflammatory Process. Elsevier, Amsterdam1989: 189-217Google Scholar, 20Proud D. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 2021-2031PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, BK is known to be produced during nasal allergen exposure (21Proud D. Togias A. Naclerio R.M. Crush S.A. Norman P.S. Lichtenstein L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1678-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 22Svensson C. Andersson M. Persson C.G.A. Venge P. Alkner U. Pipkorn U. J. Allergy Clin.

Shelhamer J.H. Kaliner M.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and evokes severe bronchoconstriction during asthma (24Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Page C.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 49-85PubMed Google Scholar). The bradykinin structure within the kininogen sequence …ISLMKRPPGFSPFRSSR… is characterized by two features. First, excision of BK clearly indicates the requirement for at least one trypsin-like activity to cleave at two sites, processes normally performed by the degradation of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) by plasma kallikrein; another, 1-residue-longer kinin, kallidin (Lys-BK), can be produced by tissue kallikrein from both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) (25Carretero O.A. Scicli A.G. Fritz H. Schmidt I. Dietze G. The Kallikrein-Kinin System in Health and Disease. Limbach-Verlag, Braunschweig1989: 63-78Google Scholar). Second, a methionine residue is present just upstream from the first cleavage sites shown above, which, if oxidized, could affect kinin production by either or both of the kallikrein enzymes. It is already well known that a third kinin, Met-Lys-BK, can be produced by the concerted action of kallikrein and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) so that the involvement of two enzymes to produce kinins is certainly possible (26Sato F. Nagasawa S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 269: 1009-1017Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Stewart J.M. Cheronis J.C. Repine J.E. Proteases, Protease Inhibitors and Protease-Derived Peptides. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 145-157Google Scholar). Recently, it was noted that tryptase could release kinins from both HMWK and LMWK, in addition to activating prekallikrein (18Imamura T. Dubin A. Moore W. Tanaka R. Travis J. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar), although the amounts of bioactive peptide produced were unlikely to be of physiological significance. Because oxidative processes are routinely occurring at inflammatory sites (28Berton G. Dusi S. Bellavite P. Sbarra A.J. Strauss R.R. The Respiratory Burst and Its Physiological Significance. Plenum Press, New York1988: 33-52Crossref Google Scholar), we hypothesize that because the presence of a methionine residue in the proximity of the cleavage site, normal kininogen processing may be affected, so that alternative pathways would have to be invoked to ensure kinin release. Functional changes have frequently been suggested to occur in proteins with oxidation-sensitive amino acid residues located at or near the sites of specific interaction with other proteins (29Vogt W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 18: 93-105Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Because mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils are recruited to such affected sites where they release oxidants and/or proteinases (30Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3865) Google Scholar, 31Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar), it is our contention that a mixture of such hydrolytic enzymes secreted by these cells could be used to maintain kinin production during inflammatory episodes. In this study, we describe the effective release of BK from both a model, kinin-containing peptide by tryptase and from HMWK or LMWK by mixtures of tryptase and HNE. In addition, we show that kinin production after substitution of methionine sulfoxide for methionine in the model peptide or by oxidation of kininogens is not affected with the tryptase/HNE mixtures, but it is markedly reduced when exposed to either plasma or tissue kallikrein. Model kinin-containing heptadecapeptides, ISL(M or MO)KRPPGFSPFRSSR (MO, methionine sulfoxide, the diastereoisomeric mixture), were synthesized at the Molecular Genetics Instrumental Facility (University of Georgia) using the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol with an Advanced ChemTech MPS350 automated synthesizer. BK, Lys-BK, and Met-Lys-BK were from Sigma; sequanal grade trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was from Pierce; and HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile were from Fisher. Single-chain HMWK was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN), and LMWK and human plasma kallikrein were from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Human lung tryptase (18Imamura T. Dubin A. Moore W. Tanaka R. Travis J. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar), HNE (32Baugh R.J. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and human neutrophil cathepsin G (32Baugh R.J. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. Human recombinant chymase was a gift of Axys Pharmaceutical (San Francisco, CA), and porcine pancreas kallikrein was graciously provided by Prof. Hans Fritz (University of Munich, Munich, Germany). HMWK (8.5 μm) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of N-chlorosuccinimide (33Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 97-103Google Scholar) for 2 h at 37 °C; the reaction was then quenched with 6 mm methionine for 0.5 h at 37 °C. Both methionine- and methionine sulfoxide-containing model peptides (M-pep and MO-pep, respectively), at a concentration of 50 μm, were treated with tryptase or kallikreins at various concentrations in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. The buffer was supplemented with heparin (2 units/ml) whenever tryptase was used. The reaction was stopped by mixing with a 0.1 volume of 6 nHCl. For following the time course of substrate decay and formation of major cleavage products, samples obtained after various incubation times were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Beckman liquid chromatograph consisting of two 110B pumps, 166 UV detector, 406 analog interface, and System Gold version 6.01 software. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min), and 50-μl aliquots were loaded onto a Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm) equipped with an Ultrasphere 5 μm ODS guard column (4.6 × 45 mm). Solvent A was 0.1% TFA in water, and solvent B was 0.08% TFA in 80% acetonitrile/water; both were filtered through Nylaflo 0.45-μm filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and vacuum-degassed before use. The separation was performed with a linear gradient from 10 to 100% solvent B, which was developed over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; the elution was monitored at 215 nm. The major cleavage products were identified by separation of the digestion mixtures (20 μl) on an Ashipac 5 μm ODP C18 column (1 × 200 mm; Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) with a gradient elution (solvent A, 0.1% TFA/water; solvent B, 0.1% TFA, 80% acetonitrile; 0–100% solvent B in 60 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min) using an Applied Biosystems liquid chromatograph (140B solvent delivery system and Applied Biosystems 759A absorbance detector) coupled to on-line atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry with a PE-Sciex API1 Plus mass spectrometer. This liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis was done at the Chemical and Biological Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility (University of Georgia). Native and oxidized forms of either HMWK (1 μm) or LMWK (3 μm) in 25 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated with selected proteinases or proteinase mixtures (each enzyme at 0.1 μm concentration) at 37 °C. Whenever tryptase or chymase was used, the buffer was supplemented with heparin (2 units/ml). To stop the reaction, aliquots of the incubation sample were mixed with 0.1 volume of 6 nHCl. For the detection of kinins, the samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using the Beckman chromatograph specified above, with isocratic elution in 0.1% TFA, 35% methanol/water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detection at 215 nm. In this solvent/column system, the three major kinins, BK, Lys-BK, and Met-Lys-BK, could be completely separated with retention times of ∼16.5, 12, and 19 min, respectively, and a lower detection limit of 10 ng for each compound. Some of the peptide peaks, which eluted within the kinin window,i.e. of retention times within the range 10–25 min, were collected and subjected to sequence analysis, which was performed at the Molecular Genetics Instrumental Facility using an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer. The proteolytic processing of the intact methionine-containing heptadecapeptide (M-pep), ISLMKRPPGFSPFRSSR, by plasma kallikrein was clearly biphasic. In the first stage, the substrate was rapidly cleaved after Arg14 releasing the kinin C terminus (Fig. 1 A), whereas the second cleavage after Lys5, which completed the BK excision, was much slower and required an increase of kallikrein concentration by 1 order of magnitude to be followed within a comparable time scale (Fig. 1 B). The substitution of methionine sulfoxide for methionine in the peptide substrate had no influence on the rate of cleavage at the Arg14-Ser15 peptide bond by plasma kallikrein (Fig. 1 C). However, this enzyme was, for all practical purposes, unable to complete the release of BK from MO-pep,i.e. to cleave the Lys5-Arg6 bond 1 residue downstream from the methionine sulfoxide residue (Fig.1 D). A similar picture, with a rapid accumulation of ISLMKRPPGFSPFR intermediate and its much slower processing to release Lys-BK, was obtained with tissue (pancreas) kallikrein (Fig.2 A). Indeed, the matching “intermediate” released from MO-pep was essentially trapped (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Time course for cleavage of kinin-containing heptadecapeptides ISLMKRPPGFSPFRSSR (A) and ISL(MO)KRPPGFSPFRSSR (B) by porcine pancreas kallikrein. Substrates (50 μm) were incubated with a 0.357 μm concentration of this tissue kallikrein (1:10 mass enzyme:substrate ratio).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The M-pep turned out to be an excellent synthetic substrate for tryptase, which could be used at 60 or 100 times lower molar concentration (15 or 25 times in terms of active site concentrations) than either plasma or tissue kallikrein, respectively, to complete the kinin release within the same time scale (Fig.3 A). Moreover, unlike kallikreins, tryptase began the processing of M-pep by initial cleavage after Lys5 to release the N terminus of BK. The alternative cleavage after Arg14, however, still proceeded at a considerable rate so that, besides accumulation of the predominating 6–17 peptide, a detectable amount of 1–14 peptide was also noted at the intermediate stages of the reaction. For the cleavage of MO-pep, hydrolysis after Lys5 by tryptase was moderately slower than that in M-pep (Fig. 3 B) so that both “intermediates” became equivalent. By continued processing of both forms, BK was produced with an overall rate slightly lower but a reaction yield of the same magnitude as with M-pep on a 3-h digestion time scale. As shown in Fig.4 A, the incubation of HMWK at a normal plasma concentration (34Müller-Ester W. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis: Proteins and Peptides. 9. VCH, Weinheim1986Google Scholar) under physiological conditions with a mixture of tryptase and HNE (enzyme:substrate ratio, 1:10) resulted in the release of at least two compounds which eluted within the kinin chromatographic window. The major component had a retention time strictly identical to that of a BK standard. When collected and subjected to automated Edman degradation this fraction was readily identified as RPPGFSPFR, an essentially uncontaminated BK. None of the other major kinins, Lys-BK or Met-Lys-BK, was detectable in the eluate. The formation of BK was attributed exclusively to the effects of the mixture of tryptase and HNE, because neither enzyme, alone, was able to release detectable amounts of BK (Fig. 4 A). Also, no kinin forms could be detected with the chromatographic method used when HNE was replaced by other major proteinases of mast cells (chymase) or neutrophils (cathepsin G) in the mixture with tryptase (results not shown). Within the limit of this HPLC-spectrophotometric detection, specified under “Experimental Procedures,” one can calculate that none of the other enzyme systems tested was able to generate kinins in a yield exceeding 10% of “productively” cleaved kininogen molecules. A similar picture was obtained with LMWK as a substrate (Fig. 4 B), with the BK formed by tryptase/HNE mixture again being identified by its retention time and sequence. Significantly, the production of BK from HMWK by the tryptase/HNE mixture was quite effective in comparison with the primary natural BK-releasing system, which used plasma kallikrein (Fig.5 A); although the rate was only 3–4 times slower, the yield of BK was comparable for both enzyme systems within a reasonable time scale. The effects of either variable tryptase or HNE concentration on BK release from HMWK when the other enzyme in the mixture was fixed at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:10 m are shown in Fig.5 B. Between 10 and ∼150 nm, the yield of BK was clearly dependent on the concentration of HNE rather than that for tryptase. After modification of HMWK withN-chlorosuccinimide, a reagent reported to preferentially oxidize methionine residues in proteins (33Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 97-103Google Scholar), the preparations that were obtained turned out to be a very poor source of kinin production in response to treatment with either plasma kallikrein (Fig.6 A) or tissue (pancreas) kallikrein (Fig. 6 B). However, and in sharp contrast, the tryptase/HNE mixture could readily release BK from oxidized HMWK and just as effectively as from the intact substrate (Fig.7).Figure 7Time course for BK release for native and oxidized HMWK by a mixture of tryptase and HNE. Substrate concentration: 1 μm; each enzyme at 0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although a previous report from our laboratory suggested that a considerable amount of BK could be released from both HMWK and LMWK (18Imamura T. Dubin A. Moore W. Tanaka R. Travis J. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar), by tryptase digestion, the present work indicates that the production of this kinin by this process does not exceed the yield of 10% “productively” cleaved kininogen molecules. However, tryptase easily excises BK from a model heptadecapeptide containing the kinin sequence, the result consistent with the well known preference of this enzyme for peptide rather than protein substrates (6Schwartz L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Pereira P.J.B. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It is thus very likely that once such peptides are formed as products of kininogen fragmentation by a non-trypsin-like proteinase functioning at the inflammatory site, tryptase can quickly process these fragments to release BK. The present model study clearly suggests HNE as a tryptase partner for the hypothetical collaborative kinin release from kininogens. Indeed, both enzymes in a mixture are capable of producing BK from HMWK and LMWK, with an efficiency not much lower than that of the kallikreins that were used as reference kinin-generating systems. Because BK is the only kinin detectable, tryptase must release the N terminus of this kinin with a rate much faster than that for the alternative upstream cleavages by HNE, which might result in the production of Lys-BK or Met-Lys-BK. These forms of kinins are likely to be formed in vivo by concerted action of HNE and kallikreins because kininogen degradation by elastase either does not affect (35Kleniewski J. Donaldson V. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1895-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or even possibly stimulates (26Sato F. Nagasawa S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 269: 1009-1017Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) kinin activity generation by plasma kallikrein. In this case, however, because of the relatively slow processing of kininogen fragments by kallikrein at the N terminus of the bradykinin sequence, apparent from our studies using the model heptadecapeptide, accumulation of Lys-BK and Met-Lys-BK would occur. Indeed, this assumption is confirmed by the presence of Met-Lys-BK in pathophysiological fluids (36Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 49-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In this regard HNE/kallikrein coupling may represent a backup system to generate kinin activity in an environment of elevated nonspecific proteolytic activity. From our present study it is apparent that similar function of kinin generation in specific pathological conditions may be carried on by the mixture of HNE and tryptase, the major mast cell proteinase. The currently emerging concept of a central role of mast cells in natural immunity as well as their significant contribution to acquired immunity (1Galli S.J. Wershil B.K. Nature. 1996; 381: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Mécheri S. David B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Abraham S.N.

Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) goes far beyond the traditional recognition of the rather detrimental action of these cells after activation by IgE-antigen complexes that occurs in the pathogenesis of asthma, anaphylaxis, and other allergic responses (4Schwartz L. Huff T. Middleton Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yunginger J.W. Busse W.W. Allergy: Principles and Practice. 4th Ed. Mosby, St. Louis1993: 135-168Google Scholar). The explosive, “anaphylactic” (38Dvorak A.M. Basophil and Mast Cell Degranulation and Recovery. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar) degranulation of mast cells as the primary event in these diseases leaves little to chance that neutrophil- or macrophage-derived proteinases could join with mast cell enzymes for the fruitful coprocessing of biological substrates freely available in the medium, particularly kininogens which, are ubiquitously distributed in body fluids. However, the slower reaction of mast cells, associated with a rather gradual, “piecemeal” (38Dvorak A.M. Basophil and Mast Cell Degranulation and Recovery. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar) degranulation, is well known and has been implicated as an important factor in some chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, stress-induced intestinal ulceration, interstitial cystitis, scleroderma, and Crohn's disease (3Abraham S.N. Malaviya R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these specific pathological conditions neutrophils are also abundant at the lesion sites (39Levis D.C.

Urol. 1992; 147: 1382-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and it is now apparent that mast cells may actively participate in phagocyte accumulation through their release of the neutrophil-attracting CXC chemokines, including interleukin 8 (46Moller A. Lippert U. Lessmann D. Kolde G. Hamann K. Welker P. Schadendorf D. Rosenbach T. Luger T. Czarnetzki M.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3261-3266PubMed Google Scholar). In this way the random degranulation of mast cells, which are long-lived and may experience several degranulation events during their life span (3Abraham S.N. Malaviya R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can occur simultaneously with chemokine-stimulated release of elastase from activated neutrophils. This event thus brings together both proteinases for concerted action on kininogens supplied in plasma exudate induced by increased vascular permeability originally caused by histamine release and perpetuated by locally generated kinins. Indeed, a vast body of literature indicates that at least in synovial fluid both elastase and tryptase coexist (47Lavery J.P. Lisse J.R. Ann.

Biol. 1988; 240: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) indicates that the HNE-catalyzed degradation of functional proteins can occur under in vivo conditions. The acute inflammatory lesions caused by bacterial infections represent another pathological environment where tryptase and elastase could be operating in concert. In this case innate defense reactions of the complement system activation pathways would lead to release of C5a anaphylatoxin, which is known to induce both neutrophil activation, accompanied by release of lysosomal enzymes, including elastase, as well as degranulation of mast cells (55Erdei A. Kerekes K. Pecht I. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 16-18PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of such a scenario is strongly supported by the presence of mast cells and neutrophil proteolytic enzymes in edema fluid, the inflammatory exudate at the site of bacterial infection (56Darany D.G. Beck F.M. Walters J.D. J. Periodontol. 1992; 63: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Cox S.W. Eley B.M. J. Clin.

Simultaneous degranulation of both types of cells must also occur in chronic inflammatory diseases, because both elastase and tryptase have been found in bronchial tissues and bronchial lavage fluid from patients with chronic bronchitis (60Walls A.F.

The efficacy of BK release by the HNE and tryptase pair depends on the relative concentration of both proteinases operating in this system. From results presented in Fig. 3 B it is apparent that at 0.1 μm elastase concentration, the effective tryptase concentration is as low as 1 nm. Tryptase, at this or even higher levels, has been found in several pathophysiological fluids, including allergic nasal lavages (64Proud D. Baily G.S. Naclerio R.M. Retnolds C.J. Cruz A.A.

In contrast to tryptase, which is not controlled by any of the endogenous proteinase inhibitors (66Alter S.C. Kramps A.J. Janoff A. Schwartz L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), HNE activity is tightly regulated by α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) (67Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), and, consequently, it is unlikely that under physiological conditions this enzyme concentration can reach high enough levels for effective collaboration with tryptase to release BK form HMWK. However, the active site methionine residue in α1-PI is very susceptible to oxidation to methionine sulfoxide, rendering the inhibitor inactive against its physiological target (68Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4022-4026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 69Matheson N.R. Wong P.S. Travis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Under in vivo conditions large amounts of oxidants are released from phagocytes at the inflammatory sites in the host-defense response against invading microorganisms. Most of this activity is attributed to macrophages and neutrophils (28Berton G. Dusi S. Bellavite P. Sbarra A.J. Strauss R.R. The Respiratory Burst and Its Physiological Significance. Plenum Press, New York1988: 33-52Crossref Google Scholar), but, recently, the mast cells have also been shown to be able to phagocytize bacteria (71Malaviya R. Ross E.A. MacGregor J.I. Ikeda T. Little J.R. Jakschik B.A. Abraham S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1907-1914PubMed Google Scholar, 72Katz H.R. Raizman M.B. Gartner C.S. Scott H.C. Benson A.C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 868-871PubMed Google Scholar) and to release reactive oxygen species (72Katz H.R. Raizman M.B. Gartner C.S. Scott H.C. Benson A.C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 868-871PubMed Google Scholar). All of these inflammatory oxidative processes are primarily used to kill foreign organisms. However, host proteins that are sensitive to oxidation, as exemplified by α1-PI and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, may also be affected so that they are no longer functional, and this can result in the exacerbation of the inflammatory response. From our studies kininogens appear as other proteins with functions that could be damaged by oxidative modification. We explain this by the fact that, at least in vitro, the HMWK susceptibility to oxidation, as measured by inability to be used as a source of kallikreins-generated kinins, is comparable with that for the oxidative inactivation of α1-PI (data not shown). Because the latter protein has been found in an oxidized form in both human rheumatoid synovial fluid (73Wong P.S. Travis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in lung washings from cigarette smokers (74Gadek J.E. Fells G.A. Crystal R.G. Science. 1979; 206: 1315-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it is assumed that oxidized HMWK could also be produced at local inflammatory sites. From comparative studies with the model kinin-containing heptadecapeptide with or without the methionine sulfoxide residue just upstream from the N terminus of kinin domain, it is easily demonstrated that processing at this site is markedly reduced with MO-pep, and we propose that this residue is also a subject of oxidative modification in HMWK. This decrease in the ability to cleave oxidized protein or peptide substrates by kallikreins is in keeping with the known requirement of plasma or tissue kallikrein for a hydrophobic residue at either the P2 or P1position, respectively. In summary, our results together with previously established data from the literature suggest that an alternative pathway for the generation of kinins by the cooperative action of mast cell tryptase and HNE may operate in vivo under the oxidative environment of inflammatory sites. This pathway is likely to compensate for the lost ability to release kinins from oxidized kininogens by the kallikrein system. Undisturbed, local kinin generation may have important physiological functions for control of the inflammatory reaction, because, through enhancement of vascular permeability, it allows increased extravasation of plasma proteinase inhibitors, including α1-PI, α1-anti-chymotrypsin, and α2-macroglobulin, which are instrumental for controlling excessive proteolytic activity and, therefore, protecting against connective tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2071726225,"The yeast Y′ element is a highly polymorphic repetitive sequence present in the subtelomeric regions of many yeast telomeres. The Y′ element is classed as either Y′-L or Y′-S, depending on its length. It has been reported that survivors arising from telomerase-deficient yeast mutants compensate for telomere loss by the amplification of Y′ elements. The totalSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome DNA data base was searched for Y′ elements, and 11 Y′-Ls and eight Y′-Ss were identified. As reported previously, many of the sequences were found to contain long open reading frames which potentially encode helicase. We examined the expression of the Y′ elements in telomerase-deficient Δtlc1survivors, in which the TLC1 gene encoding the yeast telomerase template RNA had been disrupted, and found that the Y′ element is highly expressed in the survivors, but not in the wild-type cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the survivors produce a Y′-encoded protein designated as Y′-Help1 (Y′-helicase protein 1), and that this protein possesses helicase activity. Therefore, we suggest that the Y′ element has a novel and potentially important role in trans, in addition to the well characterized role in cis, in telomerase-independent telomere maintenance in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2061023832,"Although it is known that calmodulin is involved in G1 progression, the calmodulin-dependent G1 events are not well understood. We have analyzed here the role of calmodulin in the activity, the expression, and the intracellular location of proteins involved in G1 progression. The addition of anti-calmodulin drugs to normal rat kidney cells in early G1 inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) and Cdk2 activities, as well as retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Protein levels of cdk4, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, p21, and p27 were not affected after CaM inhibition, whereas decreases in the amount of cyclin A and Cdc2 were observed. The decrease of Cdk4 activity was due neither to changes in its association to cyclin D1 nor to changes in the amount of p21 or p27 bound to cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Calmodulin inhibition also produced a translocation of nuclear cyclin D1 and Cdk4 to the cytoplasm. This translocation could be responsible for the decreased Cdk4 activity upon calmodulin inhibition. Immunoprecipitation, calmodulin affinity chromatography, and direct binding experiments indicated that calmodulin associates with Cdk4 and cyclin D1 through a calmodulin-binding protein. The facts that Hsp90 interacts with Cdk4 and that its inhibition induced Cdk4 and cyclin D1 translocation to the cytoplasm point to Hsp90 as a good candidate for being the calmodulin-binding protein involved in the nuclear accumulation of Cdk4 and cyclin D1.

The functions of CaM are mediated by its association with specific target proteins,i.e. CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs). CaMBPs include a great variety of proteins, some of which are located in the cell nucleus (e.g. kinases, such as CaM-dependent protein kinases II and IV and myosin light chain kinase, phosphatases, such as calcineurin, RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNP A2 and hnRNP C, and the autoantigen La/SSB), indicating that CaM regulates nuclear functions (1Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is now well established that CaM is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle (2Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). By using expression vectors capable of inducibly synthesizing CaM sense or antisense mRNAs, it has been shown that progression through G1 and mitosis exit is sensitive to changes in the intracellular concentration of CaM (3Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of specific anti-CaM drugs to cell cultures inhibits reentry of growth-arrested cells into the cell cycle (G0/G1 transition), progression into and through the S phase, and entry and exit from mitosis (4Chafouleas J.G.

Recent reports also give some suggestions of the role of CaM on G1/S transition, although some of the results are controversial. The addition of anti-CaM drugs to NRK cells during the early G1 inhibits the onset of DNA synthesis (9López-Girona A. Colomer J. Pujol M.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the CaMKII also blocks G1 progression in NIH 3T3 cells (11Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the contrary, calcineurin, but not CaMKII, has been shown to be essential for G1/S transition in Swiss 3T3 cells (12Tomono M. Toyoshima K. Ito M. Amano H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The activation or expression of several enzymes and proteins involved in DNA replication, such as DNA polymerases α and δ and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is inhibited after the addition of anti-CaM drugs during early G1 (9López-Girona A. Colomer J. Pujol M.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13López-Girona A. Bachs O. Agell N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, CaM has also been shown to be essential for retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation (15Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 138-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these results suggest that CaM is essential for the activation of the cell cycle regulatory machinery involved in progression from G1 to S phase. In mammalian cells, progression through the cell cycle is regulated by a family of serine/threonine protein kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). These kinases are formed by two subunits, a catalytic subunit that is present throughout the cell cycle and a regulatory subunit, called cyclin, that is present only at specific stages of the cell cycle. Cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin A-Cdk2, and cyclin B-Cdk1 are sequentially activated during G1, G1/S transition, S phase, and mitosis, respectively (16Morgan D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar, 17Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reed S.I. Annu. Rev.

The activity of the cdks is regulated by several mechanisms: cyclin binding, phosphorylation, and binding to specific Cdk-inhibitory proteins (20Morgan D. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar, 21Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Activating and inhibitory phosphorylation sites exist in the catalytic subunit (22Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 23Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To date, seven Cdk-inhibitory proteins have been identified in mammalian cells (21Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). They are divided into two major families: INK4 and CIP/KIP. The INK4 family includes p16, p15, p18, and p19, which interact specifically with Cdk4 and Cdk6. Addition of p16 to cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes results in the dissociation of the kinase complex, and binding of p16 to monomeric Cdk4 prevents cyclin D association (25Parry S.B. Bates S. Mann D.J. Peters G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The CIP/KIP family of inhibitors comprises three members: p21, p27, and p57. They have a broad range of specificity and can inhibit all of the G1 cdk-cyclin complexes. Moreover, they have higher affinity for the cyclin-Cdk complexes than for the monomeric cdk subunit (26Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar, 27Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). The major function of cyclin D-Cdk4 during G1 is the phosphorylation of the pRb family members (28Resnitzky D. Reed S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 29Dong F. Cress Jr., W.D. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6190-6195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transcription factor E2F is bound to the hypophosphorylated form of pRb, but after phosphorylation of pRb, E2F is released, and then it activates transcription of S-phase-specific genes (30Draetta G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Lam E. La Thangue N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Among the genes containing E2F-binding sites in their promoter regions are those encoding for enzymes and proteins that are essential for DNA replication, such as DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, cyclin A, and cyclin E (32Botz J. Zerfass-Thome K. Spitkovsky D. Delius H. Vogt B. Eilers M. Hatzigeorgion A. Jansen-Durr P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Dalton S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The activation of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and phosphorylation of pRb is thus a limiting step for G1 progression. Cdk2-cyclin E is also essential for G1/S transition. It also phosphorylates pRb and possibly some other proteins essential for the onset of DNA replication (18Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 37Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Despite the evidence indicating that CaM plays a role in G1progression, not much is known about the specific mechanisms regulated by CaM during this phase. Here, we analyzed the effect of the addition of an anti-CaM drug during G1 on the activation and regulation of G1 cyclin-cdk complexes. NRK cells were made quiescent by growing them to confluence in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS and then kept for 3 days in the same medium but with only 0.5% FCS. To allow them to reenter the cell cycle, quiescent cells were trypsinized and subcultured at a lower density in fresh medium supplemented with 5% FCS. Unless otherwise indicated, the anti-CaM drug W13 or the control drug W12 was added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml at 5 h after proliferative activation of the cells. Other anti-CaM drugs used were W7, J8, and calmidazolium. They were also added 5 h after proliferative activation. In vivo DNA synthesis was examined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into whole cell DNA. NRK cells (105 per 35-mm plate) were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [methyl-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 μCi/ml in medium supplemented with 5% FCS. Precipitation and solubilization of DNA were done as described previously (9López-Girona A. Colomer J. Pujol M.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10 mm EDTA. The extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels essentially as described in Ref. 38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207438) Google Scholar. Two-dimensional gels were run as described in Ref. 39O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P strips for 2 h at 60 V, for 20 h at 30 V in the case of pRb analysis, or for 1 h at 60 V in the case of CaM analysis. The sheets were preincubated in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% nonfat milk powder containing antibodies against Cdk2 (06-505, Upstate Biotechnology, 3 μg/ml), Cdc2 (06-194, Upstate Biotechnology, 3 μg/ml), Cdk4 (sc-260-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 0.5 μg/ml), cyclin A (06-138, Upstate Biotechnology, 7 μg/ml), cyclin E (sc-198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1 μg/ml), cyclin D (06-450, Upstate Biotechnology, 2 μg/ml), pRb (sc-50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2 μg/ml), p21 (sc-397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2 μg/ml), and p27 (1:500 dilution; gift from Dr. Massagué, New York, NY) polyclonal antibodies or CaM (06-45005-173, Upstate Biotechnology, 1:2000 dilution) monoclonal antibody. After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (three times, 10 min each), the sheets were incubated with either a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) or an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody (1:10000) (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sheets were washed twice in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and once in TBS. The reaction was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with BCIP/NBT (Promega). To detect proteins associated with cdk4, immunoprecipitations were performed as described in Ref. 40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-466Google Scholar. Cells (5–10 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). 3–5 mg of protein from the lysates were incubated with 4 μg of anti-Cdk4 (sc-260-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-cyclin D1 (06–137, Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies or with 3 μl of normal rabbit serum (controls) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein immunocomplexes were then incubated with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed three times in Buffer A. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. A lysate from NRK cells was always loaded in the same gel in order to have a control for the mobility of each protein. To analyze coimmunoprecipitation of CaM with Cdk4 or cyclin D1, cells were lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then incubated with the anti-Cdk4 antibodies as indicated above. In this case, the protein A-Sepharose used was previously blocked with a solution of bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml). For kinase assays, immunoprecipitations were performed similarly, but 5 × 106 cells were used per assay, and the lysates were first precleared by addition of 30 μl of normal rabbit serum and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed in kinase buffer (HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated in kinase buffer containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2–4 × 104 cpm/pmol) and 2.5 μg of histone H1 (for Cdk2) or 1 μg of pGST-Rb (379–792) fusion protein (for Cdk4 kinase) for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 35 μl (41Matsushime H.

Then, the samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. GST-Rb (379–792) fusion protein expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Graña (Philadelphia, PA). Quiescent cells were grown on glass coverslips. To detect Cdk4 or cyclin D, cells were fixed in cold methanol for 2 min. For nucleolin staining, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS (140 mm NaCl, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. In all cases, the nonspecific sites were subsequently blocked with 1% ovalbumin/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere, with the specific polyclonal antibodies anti-Cdk4 (sc-260-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50 dilution; C-18720, Transduction Laboratories 1:20 dilution), anti-cyclin D1 (06–194, Upstate Biotechnology, 1:50 dilution) or anti-nucleolin (1:200 dilution; a gift of Dr. Ghisolphi-Nieto). Coverslips were then washed three times (5 min each) in PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:100 dilution, Sigma). After two washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). The specificity of the antibody response was demonstrated by the preabsorption of the antibodies with the antigenic peptide. In order to quantify nuclear Cdk4 or cyclin D1 after anti-CaM drugs treatment, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used and visualized developing with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. The ratio of absorbance to area was obtained using KS 100 Kontron Imaging System software. Nuclei were considered stained when the ratio of absorbance to area was above 0.1. Quiescent cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 50–60% confluence and activated as described above. Coverslips were transferred into Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (HEPES modification) (Sigma) 5% FCS fresh medium just before injection, (5–8 h after proliferative activation). The CaM-dependent protein kinase II fragment 290–309 (42Payne M.E. Fong Y.L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) aqueous solution was mixed with molecular weight 155,000 rhodamine-dextran (Sigma) in PBS, to act as an injection marker (final concentrations, 240 μm peptide and 1% dextran). Microinjection of 1% dextran in PBS solution was used as a control. Cytoplasmic injections were carried out with a Zeiss automated injection system equipped with an Eppendorf 5246 transjector. After injection coverslips were placed into fresh Dulbecco's minimum essential medium 5% FCS medium and incubated for 1 h before fixation and immunocytochemical processing as described above to measure nuclear staining of Cdk4. To measure the labeling index with BrdUrd, coverslips were incubated until 21 h after proliferative activation, BrdUrd (3 μg/ml) was added to the medium at 19 h, and cells were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid (95:5) for 30 min. BrdUrd was detected with monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's procedures using fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (dilution 1:100, Boehringer Mannheim) as secondary antibodies. Microinjected cells were detected by the rhodamine cytoplasmic signal, and BrdUrd or cdk4 nuclear staining was detected by the fluorescein signal. Quantitation of nuclear cdk4 staining was performed with the KS 100 Kontron Imaging System software. The “meangreen” (mean densitometric value of channel green) of each nucleus was recorded. Nuclei were considered stained when meangreen was above 100 grey units. The results represent the average of at least two separate experiments. Minimum totals of 80 and 40 cells were measured for peptide/dextran- and dextran-injected cells, respectively. Cells (2 × 107) were lysed in 500 μl of Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μmNa3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 5 mm EGTA. Solubilized proteins (1 mg) were loaded to a 300-μl DEAE-Sephacel column preequilibrated with Buffer C. Proteins not bound to the column were collected. Under these conditions, endogenous CaM remains bound to the column, whereas Cdk4 is found in the flow-through fraction. An adequate volume of 100 mm CaCl2 was added to this fraction to obtain a final concentration of 7 mmCaCl2 and then was mixed with 300 μl of CaM-Sepharose 4B preequilibrated with Buffer C containing 2 mmCaCl2. The resin was subsequently washed with the same buffer, and finally, the CaMBPs were eluted three times with 300 μl of Buffer C containing 5 mm EGTA. Eluted fractions were subsequently analyzed by Western blot. For the pull-down experiments, flow-through from the DEAE-Sephacel (containing 5 mm EGTA) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of CaM-Sepharose or Sepharose alone in the same buffer (5 mm EGTA) or after the addition of 7 mm Ca2Cl. Samples were washed five times with lysis buffer C containing either EGTA or free Ca2+ and then extracted directly with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. When NRK cells were activated to proliferate from quiescence, they reenter the cell cycle and start DNA synthesis at 12 h, reaching a maximum at 18–20 h (9López-Girona A. Colomer J. Pujol M.J.

Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Addition of different anti-CaM drugs 5 h after activation (first half of G1) inhibited the entrance of the cells into S phase, the activation of DNA polymerases α and δ, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (9López-Girona A.

Addition of the same anti-CaM drugs later in G1 had much less effect. We first analyzed whether this inhibitory effect was reversible. The anti-CaM drug used was W13. W12 was used as a control because it is chemically very similar to W13 but it has much lower affinity for CaM. W13 has been extensively used to inhibit CaM in cell cultures, and it is known to be highly specific at the dosages used in this work (6Chafouleas J.G. Bolton W.E. Hidaka H. Boyd III, A.E. Means A.R.

W13 (15 μg/ml) or W12 (15 μg/ml) was added to the medium 5 h after proliferative activation of the cells. Drugs were removed 2 h later, and the cells were incubated with fresh media containing 5% FCS. Thymidine incorporation during 1 h was measured in nontreated and W13- and W12-treated cells at 18 h, 20 h, 22 h, and 24 h. Nontreated and W12-treated cells showed a maximum of thymidine incorporation at 20 h, whereas W13-treated cells reached the same level of thymidine incorporation but with a maximum at 22 h (Fig.1). Thus, inhibition of CaM for 2 h at mid G1 produced a reversible G1 arrest, and cells synchronously proceed into S phase upon removal of W13 with a delay of 2 h. One of the key events for G1 to S phase progression is Cdk4 and Cdk2 activation and consequently pRb hyperphosphorylation. Thus, the phosphorylation status of this protein upon anti-CaM drug addition was analyzed. The drug was always added 5 h after proliferative activation of the cells. Thus, they were added after the peak of Fos expression (data not shown). Hyperphosphorylated pRb has a reduced mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels; thus, it can easily be distinguished from the hypophosphorylated form (44Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, pRb was hypophosphorylated. At 5 h, the phosphorylated form was already detected, and at 20 h, in cells treated with control drug (W12), almost all pRb was hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 2 A). In W13-treated cells analyzed at 20 h, the hypophosphorylated form was the most abundant, indicating that the inhibition of CaM blocked the phosphorylation of pRb. To analyze whether the blockage of pRb phosphorylation by CaM inhibitors was due to the inhibition of Cdk4 or Cdk2, their activities upon W13 addition were measured. Quiescent cells did not show any Cdk4 or Cdk2 activity (Fig. 2 B). Cdk4 was already activated 5 h after proliferative stimulation, and its activity was maintained high during G1 (up to 10 h). Cdk2 was activated later than Cdk4. Its activity was low at 5 h, increased at 7 h, and was high at 15 h (S phase). The activities of both Cdk4 and Cdk2 in W13-treated cells were much lower than in control cells at all the times studied (Fig. 2 B). To study how CaM could regulate the activities of Cdks, we first measured the amount of cyclins and Cdks by Western blot analysis in extracts from quiescent and proliferating cells treated with either W12 or W13. Cdk4 and Cdk2 were detected in quiescent cells. After proliferative activation, the amount of Cdk4 was unchanged, whereas that of Cdk2 increased at 5 h and then remained constant until 20 h. The addition of W13 to the cultures at 5 h did not affect the amount of either Cdk4 or Cdk2 (Fig. 3). We further analyzed the levels of the different G1 cyclins in W13-treated cells. As shown in other cellular types, the levels of cyclins D1 and D2 were low, although detectable, in quiescent cells (45Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 46Won K.A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). After serum addition, the amount of both cyclins increased slightly, showing a faint peak at 5–7 h. Cyclin D3 was not detected in these cells by Western blot analysis. Addition of W13 to the cultures at 5 h after activation did not have any effect on the amount of any of the D type cyclins (Fig. 3). Cyclins E and A were not detectable in quiescent cells. Maximal levels of cyclin E were observed at 10–15 h, corresponding to G1-S transition, whereas cyclin A showed a large increase at 15–20 h. The treatment with W13 did not affect the amount of cyclin E, whereas the amount of cyclin A was clearly decreased (Fig. 3). Thus, the addition of W13 to cultures at 5 h after activation induced a decrease of the amount of cyclin A, whereas the levels of Cdk4, Cdk2, cyclin D, and cyclin E were not affected. The decrease of cyclin A could be responsible for the lower Cdk2 activity observed at 15 h in W13-treated cells (Fig. 2 B).

This process is strongly conserved in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to man and involves several proteins. NER consists of the following basic steps: (i) damage recognition, (ii) DNA unwinding around the lesion, (iii) dual incision on either side of the lesion, and (iv) template-dependent DNA synthesis followed by ligation of the remaining nick (1Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The factors involved in the NER reaction have been identified, and biochemical activities have been assigned to most of them. A detailed model for NER has been proposed, but the exact mechanism of DNA damage recognition is still poorly understood. Identification of the factors implicated in damage recognition is a prerequisite to gain insight in this first step of NER. Although some yeast proteins that bind damaged DNA have been identified, notably the Rad14 and Rad7·Rad16 proteins (2Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), other proteins may also be involved in DNA damage recognition. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins might have a function in this step. These proteins are associated (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

The Rad4·Rad23 complex is essential in a reconstituted NER reaction using purified yeast proteins (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although biochemical experiments suggest a role for Rad4 and Rad23 in the assembly and disassembly of NER complexes, their exact function is unknown (6Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 8Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3569-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have suggested a role for Rad4/XPC in damage recognition. In a rad4Δ strain, the genome overall is not repaired (10Verhage R.A. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); however, repair of photoproducts in the transcribed strand of rDNA genes is still observed (11Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Likewise, in human cells, XPC is not required for the repair of photolesions in RNA polymerase II-transcribed strands (12Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Apparently, in yeast and in humans, transcription can lead to Rad4 or XPC-independent repair, respectively. In addition, in vitro assays using human NER proteins have shown that repair of certain types of lesions, such as thymine dimers in locally unwound DNA as well as specific cholesterol moieties, can take place in the absence of XPC (13Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7570-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that the requirement for Rad4 or XPC in NER depends on the structure of the lesion, implicating a function in damage recognition by these proteins (see also Ref. 16Verhage R.A. Tijsterman M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. DNA Repair. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 12. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg1998: 157-172Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate a possible interaction of yeast Rad4 with DNA damage. We purified a tagged Rad4·Rad23 (tRad4·Rad23) complex and assayed its DNA damage binding properties using electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. We found a marked increase in DNA binding when tRad4·Rad23 complex was incubated with UV-irradiated or NA-AAF-treated DNA compared with untreated DNA. We therefore conclude that Rad4·Rad23 complex preferentially binds to damaged DNA and suggest that this complex may have a role in damage recognition. A clone containing full-length RAD4 behind a CUP1promoter was obtained via homologous recombination after co-transformation of linearized pCS28, containing the N-terminal portion of Rad4, together with a fragment of pCS31, containing the C-terminal part of Rad4 fused to a HA-epitope (both plasmids kindly provided by Dr. K. Madura, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey), into a rad4Δ strain. Complementation of the UV-sensitivity of this strain was used to verify functional tRad4 production. Plasmids (pRad4HA) were isolated from this yeast strain and transformed to the protease-deficient yeast strain JEL1 (genotype:MATα leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3Δhis3::PGAL10-GAL4, a gift of Dr. J. C. Wang, Harvard University). JEL1 containing pRad4HA was grown in selective medium overnight, diluted in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium containing 0.1 mm CuSO4 and grown overnight at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, washed, pelleted, and stored at −80 °C. Extract was prepared from 200 g of these pellets in E-buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.39m (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm MgSO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 500 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors (17Lombaerts M. Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using a bead beater (Biospec Products, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 100000 × g for 2 h, and protein was precipitated by addition of 301 mg/ml (NH4)2SO4. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 300 mg/ml benzamidine) containing 100 mm NaCl and dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialysate was fractionated by sequential chromatography on the following columns in buffer A with linear gradients of NaCl (the concentration of salt around which the peak of tRad4 eluted is indicated between brackets): P11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) [500 mm NaCl], Bio-Gel HTP hydroxylapatite (in this case, a linear gradient of KPO4pH7.4 in buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl was used; tRad4 peak around 240 mm KPO4), single-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma) [410 mm NaCl], Hi-Trap SP-Sepharose (1 ml) [500 mm NaCl], and finally either Resource Q (1 ml) or Mono Q (HR5/5) [350 mm NaCl], which both gave comparable results. Alternatively, 10 ml (7 mg protein) of the tRad4·Rad23 peak fractions from P11 was incubated overnight with 160 μg of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (anti-HA) and 160 μl of protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 under constant agitation. After extensive washing, tRad4·Rad23 was eluted in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with 2 mg/ml synthetic HA peptide (sequence YPYDVPDYA) overnight with constant agitation. Proteins were stored in small portions at −80 °C. During the purification, the presence of tRad4 was followed by immunoblot analysis using the 12CA5 antibody. The identity of Rad23 in the final fraction was confirmed using a Rad23-specific antiserum kindly provided by Dr. K. Madura. Activity of the tRad4·Rad23 complex was analyzed by in vitro NER assays. Yeast cell free extracts were prepared as described by He et al. (18He Z. Wong J.M.S. Maniar H.S. Brill S.J. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28243-28249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NER reactions were performed essentially as described (17Lombaerts M. Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 ng of purified tRad4·Rad23 was added for complementation. The DNA probe used in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was a 200-bp polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment from the yeast URA3 gene (251–451 bp downstream of the transcription start site). After amplification, the fragment was purified from acrylamide gel and was 5′-terminal labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) in 25 μl of kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. DNA was irradiated with UV in 15-μl droplets of water at 0–40 kJ/m2 at 254 nm. NA-AAF treatment of DNA was essentially performed as described (19Hansson J. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Kahn R. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21788-21792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of DNA was incubated with indicated concentrations of NA-AAF in 10 μl reactions containing 2.5 mm citrate and 19% ethanol for 3.5 h at 37 °C in the dark. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated twice with ethanol, and redissolved in water. Linear DNA fragments containing a single AAF adduct were constructed using a protocol based on Refs. 15Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and 20Visse R. de Ruijter M. Brouwer J. Brandsma J.A. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7609-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The DNA substrate consists of six oligonucleotides comprising a 146-bp fragment, −92 to +54 bp relative to the transcription start site from the Lytechinus variegatus 5S rDNA gene (21Lu A.L. Steege D.A. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1839-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each strand is derived from three oligonucleotides (from 5′ to 3′: top strand, 71, 19, and 56 bp; bottom strand, 48, 39, and 59 bp). The central 19-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTTAACTTCGAACAACCAA) in the top strand was treated with NA-AAF as described (19Hansson J. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Kahn R. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21788-21792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield near complete adduct formation at the single guanine residue. After purification via phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation of the damaged or mock treated 19-mer, 200–400 pmol of each oligonucleotide was 5′-phosphorylated in 200 μl of kinase buffer (see above) by using 40 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 2 mm ATP for 2 h at 37 °C. The six phosphorylated oligonucleotides were mixed together, NaCl was added to 100 mm, and the sample was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature to anneal the oligonucleotides. The DNA was ethanol precipitated, redissolved, and ligated in 50 μl containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 10 units T4-ligase (Fermentas) for 16 h at 14 °C. DNA was extensively purified by elution of full-length fragments from two subsequent 10% acrylamide-urea gels to remove unligated oligonucleotides. Purified fragments consist of two 146-mer strands, one of which contains an AAF adduct at position 81 from the 5′ terminus. These strands were rehybridized, and double-stranded fragments were purified on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel. After elution, the DNA was precipitated twice with ethanol and redissolved in water. Typical yield of full-length double-stranded substrate containing a single AAF lesion was about 1 pmol. The presence and position of the AAF lesion was verified by incubation with UvrABC endonuclease (20Visse R. de Ruijter M. Brouwer J. Brandsma J.A. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7609-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by restriction analysis (a TaqI recognition site is lost because of the presence of the damage) (data not shown). Samples of approximately 100 fmol of AAF substrate and its undamaged counterpart were 5′-terminal labeled in 25 μl of kinase buffer (see above) using 10 units of polynucleotide kinase and 4 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN; 7000 Ci/mmol) for 2 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated label was removed by a Sephadex G-50 spin column. DNA was ethanol precipitated and redissolved in water. 1 ng (7.5 fmol of double-stranded fragment) of a damaged or undamaged 200-bp fragment was mixed with 10 ng of tRad4·Rad23 complex in a 15-μl reaction containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5% glycerol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10–100 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or plasmid DNA (pIC20R linearized with BamHI) as carrier. Binding reactions on the 146-bp single lesion substrate were performed using 100 pg of DNA (1 fmol), 30 ng of tRad4·Rad23, and 10 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) carrier DNA. Addition of ATP was not required. Reaction mixtures were mixed on ice and incubated at 28 °C for 30 min. For supershift experiments, 2.4 μg of purified 12CA5 antibody was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 15 min at 28 °C. After incubation, 3 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added. Samples were loaded on 3.5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 37.5:1) gel and run in 25 mm Tris-Glycine, pH 8.5, 1 mmEDTA at 1 mA/cm for 30 min at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Fuji RX film. To characterize the Rad4·Rad23 complex, we purified these proteins from yeast cells overproducing Rad4 containing a HA epitope at its C terminus, here referred to as t(agged)Rad4. Full-length RAD4 sequences cannot be propagated in Escherichia coli (22Fleer R. Nicolet C.M. Pure G.A. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1180-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, two partially overlapping clones bearing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal part of the RAD4 gene (kind gifts from Dr. K. Madura) were co-transformed to yeast to obtain a full-length clone via homologous recombination. This clone complements the UV sensitivity of a rad4Δ strain, indicating that a functional protein is produced (data not shown). The gene is under the control of aCUP1 promoter, which is inducible by Cu2+ions. We have purified tRad4 in two distinct ways: first by sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, single-stranded DNA-cellulose, SP-Sepharose, and Resource Q columns; second, we used a two-step immuno-affinity purification protocol in which phosphocellulose fractions were immuno-purified using 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (anti-HA) and elution with synthetic HA-peptide. Both procedures yield a complex of two proteins, with some minor contaminants as shown by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresed gels (Fig.1 A). The band corresponding to a protein of apparent molecular mass of around 120 kDa (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was shown to be tRad4 by Western blotting using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). A protein of 57 kDa co-purifies with tRad4, and in agreement with previous reports (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), this protein was shown to be Rad23 using anti-Rad23 antiserum and immunoblotting (not shown). Rad23 is not overproduced in these cells, but the endogenous level of Rad23 exceeds natural Rad4 levels (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As immuno-affinity purification of tRad4·Rad23 proceeds via the HA-epitope of tRad4, Rad23 is co-purified via direct binding to tRad4, once more confirming a direct interaction between these proteins. To determine whether our purified tRad4·Rad23 preparations are still functional in NER, we attempted to rescue the defective repair activity of cell-free extracts ofrad4, rad23, and rad4rad23 deletion strains. In vitro NER was assayed by means of measuring DNA synthesis in AAF-damaged plasmids incubated with cell-free extracts (23Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 24Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The in vitro NER deficiency of cell free extracts from rad4, rad23, and rad4rad23disruption mutants (see also Refs. 5Wang Z. Wei S.

This indicates that the complex is functional in NER. Using the purified functional tRad4·Rad23 complex, we have characterized its DNA damage binding properties. We conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a 32P-labeled 200-bp linear DNA fragment that runs as a single band when no protein was added (not shown). DNA binding by tRad4·Rad23 protein is observed as the appearance of slower migrating forms of DNA. When the DNA is irradiated with UV, tRad4·Rad23-DNA complex formation is markedly increased (Fig.2). Binding of tRad4·Rad23 complex is specific for damaged DNA because complexes persist in the presence of a large excess of competitor DNA, whereas binding to undamaged DNA is strongly decreased (Fig. 2 A). Complex formation increases with increasing UV dose (Fig. 2 B) and was observed using independent protein preparations. In addition, we conducted a similar experiment using a DNA-probe containing adducts induced by NA-AAF. Also using this substrate, we found preferential binding by tRad4·Rad23 to damaged DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A), showing that damage-induced binding of Rad4·Rad23 is not confined to DNA containing UV-induced lesions. To further validate the damaged DNA binding by tRad4·Rad23, we assayed complex formation on a more defined DNA substrate. To this purpose, we constructed a linear 146-bp double-stranded DNA fragment containing a single positioned AAF adduct. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using this single AAF-adduct substrate also showed a clear enhancement of complex formation compared with undamaged DNA (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that even a single DNA damage induces DNA binding by tRad4·Rad23. Therefore, preferential binding is not confined to DNA fragments containing multiple damaged sites.Figure 3tRad4·Rad23 binding to NA-AAF-treated DNA. A, dose-dependent binding of NA-AAF-treated DNA. 10 ng of tRad4·Rad23 is incubated with DNA treated with increasing doses of NA-AAF as indicated (in μm). Reaction mixtures contained excess competitor. After polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the reaction mixtures, the gel was dried and autoradiographed to visualize protein·DNA complexes (labeled as C) and the free unbound DNA (labeled asF). B, tRad4·Rad23 complex binds to DNA containing a single AAF lesion. 30 ng of tRad4·Rad23 was incubated with a 146-bp fragment with (+) or without (−) a single positioned AAF adduct in the presence of excess competitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In all experiments performed, at least two protein·DNA complexes were observed. Because these complexes are also observed using undamaged DNA or DNA containing a single lesion, the existence of more than one complex cannot be explained solely by the presence of multiple lesions per DNA fragment. To determine whether the protein·DNA complexes contained tRad4, we used 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA-epitope. Addition of this antibody to the binding reactions resulted in a supershift of the labeled fragment (Fig.4), indicating that tRad4 is present in the observed protein·DNA complexes. In this study, we report the preferential binding of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rad4·Rad23 complex to damaged DNA. We have purified the complex and assayed its binding characteristics to damaged DNA by mobility shift analysis. Previous reports suggest a role for Rad4 in damage recognition. Rad4-independent repair in vivo exists in yeast (11Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Likewise, repair in human cells can take place in the absence of XPC (12Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the human homolog of RAD4. In addition, in vitro NER is observed in the absence of XPC for some DNA lesions (13Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7570-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Apparently the lesion structure may circumvent the need for XPC in humans or Rad4 in yeast, suggesting a role for these proteins in recognition of DNA lesions. Our data provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, as we observe preferential binding of tRad4·Rad23 to damaged DNA. Two structurally distinct types of NER substrates (i.e. UV-induced photoproducts and AAF adducts) induce binding of tRad4·Rad23 to DNA. Recently Sugasawa et al. (25Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) have shown by competition assays that human NER is initiated by XPC-hHR23B. Furthermore, they provide direct evidence that purified human XPC-hHR23B preferentially binds to DNA damage by means of an immuno-pull down assay and by DNase I footprinting. Our results of damaged DNA binding by yeast Rad4·Rad23 are consistent with and extend these data, using different methodology and proteins from a different eukaryotic origin. These observations again underscore the homology between human and yeast NER. Rad23 is in complex with Rad4 but might also have functions independent of Rad4. Repair of rDNA that is independent from Rad4 (11Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), does depend on functional Rad23 (26Verhage R.A. Zeeman A.-M. Lombaerts M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, biochemical experiments have shown that purified Rad23 interacts with Rad14 and TFIIH and promotes complex formation between these proteins (8Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the NER complex can be linked to the 26 S proteasome via Rad23 (6Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These observations point to a possible role for Rad23 in NER complex assembly and disassembly. Rad4·Rad23 may therefore act as an intermediate in damage binding and NER complex formation. We observe a moderate enhancement of DNA binding by tRad4·Rad23 induced by DNA damage. Because a number of factors have now been implicated in damage recognition in yeast, it is possible that a coordinate action of different proteins, such as Rad14 (2Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Rad7·Rad16 complex (3Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and Rad4·Rad23 (this study) is needed to gain the specificity required at the genomic level. Interactions between Rad4 and Rad7 (5Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S.H. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as well as between Rad23 and Rad14 (8Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), have been reported, pointing to a link between these damage-recognizing proteins. Along this line, it has recently been suggested that human NER complex formation at the site of the damage only occurs when XPC-hHR23B, XPA, replication protein A (RPA), TFIIH, and XPG are present together, indicating a cooperative mode of binding to the damage (27Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). On the basis of the evidence we present in this report, we suggest that Rad4·Rad23 acts early in the formation of the NER complex by directly binding to DNA damage, possibly in concert with other NER factors. We are indebted to Dr. Kiran Madura for providing RAD4 clones and anti-Rad23 antiserum and to Dr. J.C. Wang for the protease deficient yeast strain. We thank Tineke de Ruijter for excellent technical assistance, Rob Visse and David Fischer for helpful suggestions, and members of our group for discussion. Drs. Kaoru Sugasawa and Jan Hoeijmakers are acknowledged for communicating results prior to publication."
https://openalex.org/W1969562652,"Neural cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily mediate not only cell aggregation but also growth cone guidance and neurite outgrowth. In this study we demonstrate that two neural CAMs, L1-CAM and TAG-1, induce the homophilic aggregation of Drosophila S2 cells but are unable to interact with each other when expressed on different cells (trans-interaction). However, immunoprecipitations from cells co-expressing L1-CAM and TAG-1 showed a strong cis-interaction between the two molecules in the plane of the plasma membrane. TAG-1 is linked to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and therefore is unable to directly interact with cytoplasmic proteins. In contrast, L1-CAM-mediated homophilic cell adhesion induces the selective recruitment of the membrane skeleton protein ankyrin to areas of cell contact. Immunolabeling experiments in which S2 cells expressing TAG-1 were mixed with cells co-expressing L1-CAM and TAG-1 demonstrated that the homophilic interaction between TAG-1 molecules results in the cis-activation of L1-CAM to bind ankyrin. This TAG-1-dependent recruitment of the membrane skeleton provides an example of how GPI-anchored CAMs are able to transduce signals to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, such interactions might ultimately result in the recruitment and the activation of other signaling molecules at sites of cell contacts.

Furthermore, such interactions might ultimately result in the recruitment and the activation of other signaling molecules at sites of cell contacts. The navigation of growth cones to their targets in the developing embryonic nervous system is a critical step in the patterning of neuronal projections. Substantial evidence suggests that axonal guidance depends in part on cell surface and on extracellular matrix molecules, which are expressed along the path of the advancing growth cones (1Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Science. 1988; 242: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Axonal extension and pathway choices are influenced by membrane receptors to these molecules, which are expressed on the growth cone.One group of such molecules are cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Ig, immunoglobulin; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; Ng-CAM, neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule; TAG-1, transiently expressed axonal surface glycoprotein-1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Ig, immunoglobulin; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; Ng-CAM, neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule; TAG-1, transiently expressed axonal surface glycoprotein-1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are expressed by advancing growth cones and are able to recognize and transduce environmental signals (3Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ig domain CAMs have been implicated to act both as receptors as well as substrates for growing axons (4Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For example, members of the L1 family of neural CAMs, such as mammalian L1-CAMs and chicken Ng-CAM, not only exhibit a strong Ca2+-independent homophilic adhesive activity (6Lemmon V. Farr K.L. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 7Grumet M. Hoffman S. Chuong C.-M. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7989-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), they also promote neurite outgrowth in culture, probably by the activation of neuronal FGF receptors (8Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Through the interaction with the cytoplasmic linker protein ankyrin, L1 family members are also connected to the membrane skeleton (9Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human L1-CAM and the Drosophila L1 homologue neuroglian both recruit ankyrin and other components of the membrane skeleton to cell contact sites in Drosophila S2 cell aggregates (10Dubreuil R.R.

Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 61-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction strictly depends on the extracellular L1 adhesive activity, and ankyrin binding in turn stabilizes the L1 adhesive interaction (12Hortsch M. Homer D. Dhar Malhotra J. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Members of another subgroup of Ig domain neural CAMs are anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. These include TAG-1 in mammalian species and its chicken homologue axonin-1 (13Furley A.J. Morton S.B. Manalo D. Karagogeos D. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 157-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 14Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Schroeder A. Kalousek M.B. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Osterwalder T. Inan C. Stoeckli E.T.

TAG-1/axonin-1 has been shown to mediate homophilic cell adhesion and is able to promote neurite outgrowth in culture (13Furley A.J. Morton S.B. Manalo D. Karagogeos D. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 157-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,15Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Duc C.O. Ruegg M.A. Sonderegger P. J.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, TAG-1-induced neurite growth is not only mediated by but also requires other neuronal membrane proteins, such as L1- or β1 integrin-type molecules (17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TAG-1/axonin-1 interacts with a number of different heterophilic binding partners, including several members of the L1 family, NCAM, nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and several extracellular matrix molecules (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Milev P. Maurel P. Haring M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15716-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that some of these heterophilic interactions might enable TAG-1 to induce or influence intracellular signaling processes (5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Axonin-1 and Ng-CAM expressed in the same plasma membrane engage in a strong cis-interaction, forming larger multimeric complexes that are also associated with several intracellular protein kinase systems (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This cis-interaction between TAG-1/axonin-1 and L1-type molecules is essential for the stimulation of neurite outgrowth on TAG-1/axonin-1 substrates in culture, and homophilic TAG-1 cell adhesion appears to activate TAG-1-associated L1-CAM molecules (16Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although several lines of evidence suggest that the interaction of TAG-1 with L1-CAM is an important link in TAG-1-initiated signal transduction, a direct demonstration that TAG-1 is capable of altering the functional state of L1-CAM has been missing. In our present study we demonstrate that TAG-1-mediated homophilic cell adhesion induces an intracellular restructuring of the membrane skeleton by the cis-activation of human L1-CAM.DISCUSSIONComplex homo- and heterophilic interactions between different adhesion molecules within the plane of the plasma membrane and between adjacent cells have been proposed to play an important role in regulating the growth and guidance of axons during embryonic neurogenesis (5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our present in vitro study addresses how two different CAMs, human TAG-1 and human L1-CAM, interact and functionally regulate each other. Some groups of CAMs are transmembrane proteins and therefore potentially able to directly influence intracellular processes, e.g. by activating second messenger signaling cascades and/or by reorganizing components of the cytoskeleton. However, other CAM families, such as the TAG-1/axonin-1 and the F3/F11 groups, are anchored in the plasma membrane by a GPI moiety and therefore lack the means to interact with cytoplasmic proteins without additional linker proteins. Nevertheless, GPI-anchored CAMs are also able to operate as signal-transducing molecules during neuronal development. Although TAG-1/axonin-1 is fully functional as a homophilic CAM without engaging in any heterophilic cis-interactions, its ability to associate with other membrane proteins, especially L1-CAM, appears to be essential for its neurite outgrowth-promoting function (17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Bleiker A.J. Groscurth P. Sonderegger P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Several models similar to the one displayed in Fig.6 have been proposed in which TAG-1/axonin-1 associates with other membrane proteins expressed in the same plasma membrane in a cis-interaction to form a signal-transducing, multimeric protein complex (17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar model has also been suggested to explain the adhesion-dependent activation of neuronal FGF receptors by L1-CAM, NCAM, and N-cadherin (8Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell.

L1-CAM/Ng-CAM not only can be co-immunoprecipitated with TAG-1/axonin-1, but cross-linking experiments suggest that both molecules directly bind to each other (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The part of the axonin-1 molecule responsible for this cis-interaction has been mapped to its amino-terminal Ig protein domains (32Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the homophilic adhesive activity of TAG-1/axonin-1 is mediated by its fibronectin type III domains (23Tsiotra P.C. Theodorakis K. Papamatheakis J. Karagogeos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29216-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein domains of L1-CAM that mediate TAG-1 recognition and binding have not been identified yet. Also whether the homophilic adhesive activities of L1-CAM and TAG-1 regulate their cis-interaction is currently unknown. However, co-capping experiments reported by Buchstaller et al. (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the quantity of L1-CAM that co-immunoprecipitated with TAG-1 in our experiments suggest that a significant fraction of L1-CAM molecules forms heterodimeric complexes with TAG-1 before the two CAMs engage in cell adhesion and L1-CAM binds to the membrane skeleton. After L1-CAM interacts with ankyrin, it becomes resistant to Triton X-100 extraction as used in our immunoprecipitation experiments and is unavailable for precipitation with antibodies (10Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).TAG-1/axonin-1 and L1-CAM/Ng-CAM are co-expressed in several locations during nervous system development, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant (31Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Bleiker A.J. Groscurth P. Sonderegger P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Honig M.G. Kueter J. Dev.

In cultures of chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons Ng-CAM and axonin-1 protein are found in overlapping areas on growth cone membranes, and axonin-1 expression by these cells is required for neurite outgrowth on both axonin-1 and Ng-CAM substrata (31Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Bleiker A.J. Groscurth P. Sonderegger P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, in other developing neurons,e.g. in the rat embryonic spinal cord, TAG-1 and L1-CAM expression appear to be locally and temporally segregated (22Dodd J. Morton S.B. Karagogeos D. Yamamoto M. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 105-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 35Karagogeos D. Morton S.B. Casano F. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Development. 1991; 112: 51-67PubMed Google Scholar). This finding indicates that TAG-1/axonin-1 and L1-CAM/Ng-CAM are not obligatory co-receptors but are able to function independently. It might mean either that the signaling capabilities of TAG-1/axonin-1 are limited in certain areas of the developing nervous system or at certain developmental time points or that TAG-1/axonin-1 associates with other membrane proteins than L1-CAM/Ng-CAM to form functionally active protein complexes.Although the cis-activation of neuronal FGF receptors by L1-CAM is thought to be the initial step in adhesion-induced neurite outgrowth, processes such as the recruitment of other signaling molecules to cell contact sites might also have an important, more indirect role. Our findings presented here would support the hypothesis that TAG-1 homophilic adhesion might also activate neuronal FGF receptor activity via L1-CAM. Other cellular changes that appear to be regulated by the TAG-1/axonin-1 interaction with L1-CAM/Ng-CAM are the recruitment and the release of several different protein kinase activities that are associated with the two CAMs in chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons (20Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of integrin- and cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, interactions with cytoskeletal elements induce the assembly of signal-generating and -processing multiprotein complexes at the cytoplasmic aspect of the adhesion contact site. This makes the observed assembly of membrane skeleton components in response to TAG-1-mediated homophilic cell adhesion especially significant. However, the most tantalizing aspect of the results reported here is the observation that TAG-1 homophilic cell adhesion directly regulates the functional status of L1-CAM. These findings suggest a mechanism that explains how GPI-anchored CAMs might actively participate in regulating the growth, organization, and differentiation of neuronal cells during development. The navigation of growth cones to their targets in the developing embryonic nervous system is a critical step in the patterning of neuronal projections. Substantial evidence suggests that axonal guidance depends in part on cell surface and on extracellular matrix molecules, which are expressed along the path of the advancing growth cones (1Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Science. 1988; 242: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Axonal extension and pathway choices are influenced by membrane receptors to these molecules, which are expressed on the growth cone. One group of such molecules are cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Ig, immunoglobulin; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; Ng-CAM, neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule; TAG-1, transiently expressed axonal surface glycoprotein-1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Ig, immunoglobulin; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; Ng-CAM, neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule; TAG-1, transiently expressed axonal surface glycoprotein-1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are expressed by advancing growth cones and are able to recognize and transduce environmental signals (3Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ig domain CAMs have been implicated to act both as receptors as well as substrates for growing axons (4Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For example, members of the L1 family of neural CAMs, such as mammalian L1-CAMs and chicken Ng-CAM, not only exhibit a strong Ca2+-independent homophilic adhesive activity (6Lemmon V. Farr K.L. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 7Grumet M. Hoffman S. Chuong C.-M. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7989-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), they also promote neurite outgrowth in culture, probably by the activation of neuronal FGF receptors (8Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Through the interaction with the cytoplasmic linker protein ankyrin, L1 family members are also connected to the membrane skeleton (9Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human L1-CAM and the Drosophila L1 homologue neuroglian both recruit ankyrin and other components of the membrane skeleton to cell contact sites in Drosophila S2 cell aggregates (10Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Hortsch M. O'Shea K.S. Zhao G. Kim F. Vallejo Y. Dubreuil R.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 61-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction strictly depends on the extracellular L1 adhesive activity, and ankyrin binding in turn stabilizes the L1 adhesive interaction (12Hortsch M. Homer D. Dhar Malhotra J. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Members of another subgroup of Ig domain neural CAMs are anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. These include TAG-1 in mammalian species and its chicken homologue axonin-1 (13Furley A.J. Morton S.B. Manalo D. Karagogeos D. Dodd J. Jessell T.M.

TAG-1/axonin-1 has been shown to mediate homophilic cell adhesion and is able to promote neurite outgrowth in culture (13Furley A.J. Morton S.B. Manalo D. Karagogeos D. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 157-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,15Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Duc C.O. Ruegg M.A. Sonderegger P. J.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, TAG-1-induced neurite growth is not only mediated by but also requires other neuronal membrane proteins, such as L1- or β1 integrin-type molecules (17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TAG-1/axonin-1 interacts with a number of different heterophilic binding partners, including several members of the L1 family, NCAM, nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and several extracellular matrix molecules (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Milev P. Maurel P. Haring M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15716-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that some of these heterophilic interactions might enable TAG-1 to induce or influence intracellular signaling processes (5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Axonin-1 and Ng-CAM expressed in the same plasma membrane engage in a strong cis-interaction, forming larger multimeric complexes that are also associated with several intracellular protein kinase systems (18Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This cis-interaction between TAG-1/axonin-1 and L1-type molecules is essential for the stimulation of neurite outgrowth on TAG-1/axonin-1 substrates in culture, and homophilic TAG-1 cell adhesion appears to activate TAG-1-associated L1-CAM molecules (16Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Felsenfeld D.P. Hynes M.A. Skoler K.M. Furley A.J. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 675-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although several lines of evidence suggest that the interaction of TAG-1 with L1-CAM is an important link in TAG-1-initiated signal transduction, a direct demonstration that TAG-1 is capable of altering the functional state of L1-CAM has been missing. In our present study we demonstrate that TAG-1-mediated homophilic cell adhesion induces an intracellular restructuring of the membrane skeleton by the cis-activation of human L1-CAM. DISCUSSIONComplex homo- and heterophilic interactions between different adhesion molecules within the plane of the plasma membrane and between adjacent cells have been proposed to play an important role in regulating the growth and guidance of axons during embryonic neurogenesis (5Sonderegger P. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our present in vitro study addresses how two different CAMs, human TAG-1 and human L1-CAM, interact and functionally regulate each other. Some groups of CAMs are transmembrane proteins and therefore potentially able to directly influence intracellular processes, e.g. by activating second messenger signaling cascades and/or by reorganizing components of the cytoskeleton. However, other CAM families, such as the TAG-1/axonin-1 and the F3/F11 groups, are anchored in the plasma membrane by a GPI moiety and therefore lack the means to interact with cytoplasmic proteins without additional linker proteins. Nevertheless, GPI-anchored CAMs are also able to operate as signal-transducing molecules during neuronal development. Although TAG-1/axonin-1 is fully functional as a homophilic CAM without engaging in any heterophilic cis-interactions, its ability to associate with other membrane proteins, especially L1-CAM, appears to be essential for its neurite outgrowth-promoting function (17Felsenfeld D.P.

Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Several models similar to the one displayed in Fig.6 have been proposed in which TAG-1/axonin-1 associates with other membrane proteins expressed in the same plasma membrane in a cis-interaction to form a signal-transducing, multimeric protein complex (17Felsenfeld D.P.

Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar model has also been suggested to explain the adhesion-dependent activation of neuronal FGF receptors by L1-CAM, NCAM, and N-cadherin (8Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Although several molecular details of the TAG-1 interaction with L1-CAM have been elucidated, its regulatory and functional aspects are not well understood.

Ziegler U. Bleiker A.J. Groscurth P. Sonderegger P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, in other developing neurons,e.g. in the rat embryonic spinal cord, TAG-1 and L1-CAM expression appear to be locally and temporally segregated (22Dodd J. Morton S.B. Karagogeos D. Yamamoto M. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 105-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 35Karagogeos D. Morton S.B. Casano F. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Development. 1991; 112: 51-67PubMed Google Scholar). This finding indicates that TAG-1/axonin-1 and L1-CAM/Ng-CAM are not obligatory co-receptors but are able to function independently. It might mean either that the signaling capabilities of TAG-1/axonin-1 are limited in certain areas of the developing nervous system or at certain developmental time points or that TAG-1/axonin-1 associates with other membrane proteins than L1-CAM/Ng-CAM to form functionally active protein complexes. Although the cis-activation of neuronal FGF receptors by L1-CAM is thought to be the initial step in adhesion-induced neurite outgrowth, processes such as the recruitment of other signaling molecules to cell contact sites might also have an important, more indirect role. Our findings presented here would support the hypothesis that TAG-1 homophilic adhesion might also activate neuronal FGF receptor activity via L1-CAM. Other cellular changes that appear to be regulated by the TAG-1/axonin-1 interaction with L1-CAM/Ng-CAM are the recruitment and the release of several different protein kinase activities that are associated with the two CAMs in chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons (20Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the case of integrin- and cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, interactions with cytoskeletal elements induce the assembly of signal-generating and -processing multiprotein complexes at the cytoplasmic aspect of the adhesion contact site. This makes the observed assembly of membrane skeleton components in response to TAG-1-mediated homophilic cell adhesion especially significant. However, the most tantalizing aspect of the results reported here is the observation that TAG-1 homophilic cell adhesion directly regulates the functional status of L1-CAM. These findings suggest a mechanism that explains how GPI-anchored CAMs might actively participate in regulating the growth, organization, and differentiation of neuronal cells during development.

However, interaction with the tumor suppressor gene p53 and inhibition of p53-dependent cellular functions, including nucleotide excision repair, could be central to this process. We studied the levels of global repair (removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts) and transcription-coupled repair (removal of CPDs in both strands of the dihydrofolate reductase gene) in primary wild-type and p53-null mouse hepatocytes. We show that global repair of CPDs appears to be more efficient in mouse hepatocytes than in other commonly studied rodent cells and approaches the levels of human cells and that p53 is required for global genomic DNA repair of CPDs but not for transcription-coupled repair. We then investigated the effect of HBx expression on hepatocyte nucleotide excision repair. We demonstrate that HBx expression affects DNA repair in a p53-dependent manner. Transient HBx expression reduces global DNA repair in wild-type cells to the level ofp53-null hepatocytes and has no effect on the repair of a transfected damaged plasmid. Therefore, in viral hepatitis, the hepatitis B virus could inhibit thep53-dependent component of global repair leading, over time, to accumulation of genetic defects and fostering carcinogenesis.

There is compelling epidemiological evidence that chronic hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) 1The abbreviations used are: HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HBx, hepatitis B x protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among the four viral proteins produced, the small protein hepatitis B x (HBx) is thought to be important in causing HCC, although the mechanism of its involvement has not been defined clearly. Some strains of mice carrying HBx as a transgene show a direct correlation between the level of HBx expression and the likelihood to develop HCC (1Kim C.M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jay G. Nature. 1991; 351: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 2Koike K. Moriya K. Yotsuyanagi H. Lino S. Kurokawa K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In others, HBx expression increases susceptibility to the development of HCC after exposure to the liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (3Slagle B.L. Lee T.H. Medina D. Finegold M.J. Butel J.S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Lee T.-H. Finegold M.J. Shen F.-M. DeMayo J.L. Woo S.L.C. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of HBx in hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx stimulates the transcription of many genes (for review, see Ref. 5Yen T.S.B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 30: 20-30Google Scholar), including transcription factors and oncogenes, and interacts with many cellular proteins (for review, see Ref. 6Cromlish J.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 270-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One important target of HBx believed to be related to promotion of carcinogenesis is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Several lines of evidence suggest that functional inactivation of p53 without mutation can occur in preneoplastic liver and that, in these circumstances, p53 mutation and allele loss are later events (7Tanaka S.

Indeed, accumulation of wild-type p53 has been observed in hepatocytes of patients with cirrhosis and liver cell dysplasia, both associated with high risk for HCC development, particularly in patients infected with HBV (10Greenblatt M.S.

Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have suggested that HBx interacts and inactivates p53, possibly by cytoplasmic sequestration (10Greenblatt M.S. Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Jones R. Borkowski A. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 426-432PubMed Google Scholar, 18Takada S. Kaneniwa N. Tsuchida N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1898-1901Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice (17Ueda H. Ullrich S.J. Gangemi J.D. Kappel C.A. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), this functional inactivation of p53 is associated topographically with subsequent development of HCC. Moreover, HBx and p53 can be coprecipitated from liver samples of patients with HCC (19Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Duan L.X. London W.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar), supporting this idea. It is important to identify the functions of p53 which HBx could target and so promote carcinogenesis. p53 is critical for the maintenance of genomic fidelity. Current models hold that cells respond to DNA damage by stabilization of p53 leading either to checkpoint arrest, allowing repair, or to p53-dependent apoptosis, eliminating a potentially mutated cell from the population. Work from our laboratory has established the existence of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in hepatocytes after DNA damage but also indicates that hepatocytes do not undergo apoptosis readily in response to DNA damage (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, effective DNA repair, also shown to be partially p53-dependent in these cells (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), must be critical to prevent development of mutations because the hepatocytes do not self-delete in the presence of a low, but significant, level of DNA damage. Therefore, a functional blockage of p53 by HBx could be a critical event in cells sustaining DNA damage, leading to inhibition of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but also alteration of p53-dependent DNA repair (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HBx binding to p53 was reported recently to inhibit the interaction between p53 and the two DNA repair proteins XPB and XPD, part of the TFIIH complex (22Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G.W. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, a direct effect upon DNA repair by HBx is suggested by the ability of HBx to bind damaged DNA in vitro (23Capovilla A. Carmona S. Arbuthnot P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to interact directly with at least three DNA repair proteins: XAP-1/UV-DDB (24Lee T.-H. Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), XPB, and XPD (25Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Therefore, alteration of DNA repair, either directly or indirectly through inhibition of p53, could be a major contribution of HBx in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we have used wild-type and p53-null primary hepatocytes to investigate the effect of HBx expression on p53-dependent and -independent DNA repair in the liver. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from adult wild-type or p53-null male mice (26Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar) 6–10 weeks of age by a two-step EDTA/collagenase retrograde perfusion protocol and cultured as described previously (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed using Tfx-50 (Promega Biotech). Briefly, plasmid DNA (3 μg) and Tfx-50 (15.5 μg) in 300 μl of warm culture medium were incubated for 15 min at room temperature before laying the complex over the cells in culture in 12-well plates for 24 h. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the DNA-containing medium was replaced by fresh medium, and experiments were performed 24–72 h later. Using this technique about 80% of hepatocytes were transfected. The p53 reporter plasmid pRGCΔFosLacZ contains two copies of the RGC p53-specific binding site placed upstream of a nonfunctionalfos promoter and a lacZ gene (27Frebourg T. Barbier N. Kassel J. Ng Y.S. Romero P. Friend S.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6976-6978PubMed Google Scholar). The HBx expression vector (15Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) pCMV-x1 encoded for the entire HBx open reading frame under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). Efficient expression from the HBx expression vector was monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two different sets of primers. The plasmids used for the host cell reactivation assay are the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid pOP13 CAT (Stratagene) and the LacZ-expressing plasmid pβCMV (CLONTECH). Primary hepatocyte monolayers on chamber slides (LabTek) were transfected with pCMV-x1 or a control plasmid, cultured for a further 30–36 h, then UV-C irradiated (10 J/m2) and fixed at the indicated times in acetone:methanol (1:1 v/v). Immunocytochemistry for p53 protein was performed by a standard avidin-biotin peroxidase technique using a primary monoclonal anti-p53 antibody pAb 421 (Oncogene Science; 1/1,000 dilution) as described previously (28Bellamy C.C. Prost S. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 h in fibronectin-coated 12-well plates (0.3 × 105 cells/cm2) were transiently cotransfected with a p53 reporter plasmid, pRGCΔFosLacZ, and either the HBx expression vector (pCMV-x1) or a control plasmid (pBR322) (ratio of 10:3). 36 h after transfection cells were UV-C irradiated (10 J/m2) or not; cultured for a further 4, 8, 14, or 24 h; and then lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega Biotech). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using ano-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate assay (Promega Biotech) and is expressed relative to the amount of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) recovered from each well, as described previously (28Bellamy C.C. Prost S. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes transfected with pCMV-x1 or a control plasmid were cultured for 48 h, irradiated with the indicated doses of UV-C, and incubated for a further 3 h in medium supplemented with 10 μCi/ml tritiated thymidine. The radioactive medium was removed, and cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 1 mm nonradioactive thymidine for an additional hour. The cultures were then fixed in Boum's fixative, counterstained with Feulgen, then dipped in LM-1 autoradiographic emulsion (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Processing and grain counting were performed as described previously (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For each culture, 10 high power (× 400) fields were assessed, each field containing 20–40 nuclei. The grain density within nuclei was corrected for background (non-nuclear) labeling by subtraction and expressed per surface area of nuclei (= nuclear grain index). The results shown are histograms of the nuclear grain index for one typical experiment. For the calculation of the mean nuclear grain index, only values smaller than 40 were considered in order to exclude cells in DNA synthesis. The experiment was performed twice (two wild-type and twop53-null mice) with similar results. Primary hepatocytes were transfected with either pCMV-x1 or the control plasmid as described above. 36 h later, a second transfection was performed using the pOP13 CAT reporter plasmid treated with UV-C at various doses and undamaged pβCMV in a 1:1 ratio. 24 h after transfection the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer. The CAT activity in transfected cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting assay as described previously (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results were corrected for the transfection efficiency, given by the β-galactosidase activity resulting from the undamaged pCMVβ expression/μg of protein. The relative number of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts in total genomic DNA was determined using an immunoblot assay as described previously (29Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes in culture for 8 h were UV irradiated (10 J/m2) and collected 2, 6, 12, or 24 h later and lysed, and the DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. During this period of time, freshly isolated primary hepatocytes show no replicative DNA synthesis (30Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 31Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and so it was not necessary to eliminate newly replicated DNA. DNA was then denatured by boiling for 5 min and placing on ice, and equal amounts of genomic DNA from each sample were fixed to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) in triplicate using a slot-blot apparatus (0.1 and 1 μg of DNA/slot for detection of CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts, respectively). Genomic DNA from unirradiated cells was used as a control for nonspecific DNA binding of the monoclonal antibodies. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for either CPDs (TDM-2) or 6-4 photoproducts (64M-2), at a dilution of 1/2,000 in phosphate-buffered saline. Detection of primary antibody was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Corp.). After antibody detection, equal DNA loading to each slot of the membrane was confirmed by scintillation spectrophotometry. Two separate slot blots were performed, in triplicate, using DNA from three wild-type, one heterozygous, and two p53-null mice. Repair of CPDs within the transcribed and nontranscribed strand of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was performed as described previously (30Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 31Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) using a Southern-based method. Primary hepatocytes were lysed at various times after UV irradiation (10 J/m2), and DNA was extracted. After digestion with BamHI, DNA samples were treated with T4 endonuclease V or not, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a membrane. After hybridization with a 32P-labeled strand-specific probe to the murine DHFR gene (plasmid supplied by Isabel Mellon) and autoradiography, the ratio of full-length restriction fragments in the T4 endonuclease V-treated and untreated samples was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Bio-Rad model GS-363) and was used to calculate the average number of CPDs/fragment using the Poisson expression. DNA samples from each mouse (two wild-type, one heterozygous, and one p53-null) were used for two independent Southern blots, each probed for both the transcribed and the nontranscribed strand of the DHFR gene. The role of p53 in the repair of CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts in overall genomic DNA and in the repair of CPDs in individual strands of the DHFR gene was examined using primary hepatocytes isolated from wild-type,p53 heterozygous, and p53-null mice. First, the global repair of UV-induced DNA damage was determined using monoclonal antibodies against CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts. Both wild-type and p53 heterozygous primary hepatocytes exhibit efficient global repair of both lesions (Fig.1). By contrast, p53-null cells show a strong reduction in the repair of CPDs, whereas removal of 6-4 photoproducts remains normal. Second, the repair of CPDs was studied in both the transcribed and the nontranscribed strand of the DHFR gene. The repair of the transcribed strand of DHFR was proficient and similar in both cell types, whereas the repair of the nontranscribed strand, although still measurable, was found to be slower in p53−/− cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2). Taken together with our previous results in mouse primary hepatocytes (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in human fibroblasts (29Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Ford J.M. Baron E.L. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 599-603PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests that p53 is required for efficient global nucleotide excision repair but not for transcription-coupled repair. By contrast to other mouse cell types, which inefficiently repair CPDs in bulk DNA (33Madhani H.D. Bohr V.A. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1986; 45: 417-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Vreeswijk M.P.G. van Hoffen A. Westland B.E. Vrieling H. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31858-31863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found the global repair of CPDs in primary hepatocytes to be very efficient and to approach the levels observed in human cells. This finding suggests that nuclear excision repair is a critical process in the liver. Independently of UV treatment, transient expression of pCMV-x1 had no effect on the level of cell death in either wild-type orp53−/− cells. The rate of apoptotic cell death was 1–5%. In the absence of DNA-damaging treatment, the prevalence of p53 immunopositivity in HBx-transfected cells was similar to that of control cells (5–10% of cells) (Fig.3 A). After UV irradiation, the proportion of p53-immunopositive cells increased in both normal and transfected hepatocytes. Interestingly, the proportion of hepatocytes showing nuclear immunopositivity was significantly smaller in HBx-transfected hepatocytes compared with controls (Fig. 3,A and B). This difference between HBx-transfected cells and controls was transient, lasting no longer than 24 h after irradiation (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with this result, we also found that HBx expression reduces significantly the rise in p53 transactivation activity which normally follows UV irradiation, especially during the first 12 h after it (Fig. 3 C). The absence of a difference between transfected and control cells at later time points after irradiation reflects the kinetics of expression of the transiently transfected plasmid; expression decreases rapidly after about 60 h (28Bellamy C.C. Prost S. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of HBx expression on DNA repair. First, we tested the ability of wild-type and p53-null hepatocytes transiently transfected with the HBx expression vector to repair a reporter plasmid damaged by various doses of UV-C. There was a dose-dependent impairment of the recovery of the reporter expression, and this was not affected by the p53 genotype (Fig. 4), as noted previously (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No differences were observed between cells transfected with pCMV-x1 or with the control plasmid, suggesting that HBx does not affect this type of repair (Fig. 4). Second, we quantified the unscheduled DNA synthesis in these cells, transiently transfected or not with the HBx expression vector. This was measured by image analysis of grain density after autoradiography of cultures treated with different doses of UV and subsequently allowed to incorporate tritiated thymidine. In the absence of UV irradiation the majority of the cells presented a low nuclear grain index (between 0 and 5), and a second group of cells exhibited a nuclear grain index >40, representing cells undergoing DNA synthesis. After UV irradiation, the grain index was increased in hepatocyte nuclei regardless of genotype, showing that the cells were initiating unscheduled DNA synthesis (Fig. 5). However, the grain index of irradiated p53−/− cells was significantly less than wild-type cells (mean ± S.E. are 23.5 ± 1.08 and 10.6 ± 0.47 for wild-type andp53-null hepatocytes, respectively). Transfection of the HBx-expressing plasmid in p53-null cells had no significant effect (mean ± S.E. are 10.6 ± 0.47 for untransfectedversus 11.6 ± 0.50 for pCMV-x1-transfected hepatocytes), whereas in wild-type cells, expression of HBx resulted in a decreased grain index (10.9 ± 0.57 and 23.5 ± 1.08 for transfected and nontransfected, respectively) to a level similar to that found in p53-null cells. Hence, HBx expression reduces unscheduled DNA synthesis of wild-type cells to the level ofp53-null cells but does not further alter the unscheduled DNA synthesis activity of p53-null cells. Taken together, these results indicate that HBx affects p53-dependent repair, i.e. global repair, especially the repair of the CPDs. Interspecies differences in the level of DNA repair are well described; mouse fibroblasts typically show a lower efficiency of global repair than human fibroblasts (33Madhani H.D. Bohr V.A. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1986; 45: 417-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Vreeswijk M.P.G. van Hoffen A. Westland B.E. Vrieling H. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31858-31863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present observation that DNA repair efficiency is relatively high in mouse hepatocytes, indeed approaching the level of human fibroblasts, suggests that nuclear excision repair is particularly important in this cell type. This observation, in association with our previous demonstration that hepatocytes do not readily undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggests an emphasis on repair mechanisms rather than self-deletion after DNA damage. This is consistent with known detoxifying roles of hepatocytes during which genotoxic metabolites are likely to be generated. Indeed, mice deficient in the nucleotide repair protein XPA (35De Vries A. van Oostrom C.T. Dortant P.M. Beems R.B. Van Kreijl C.F. Capel P.J. van Steeg H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 19: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) develop spontaneous HCC, and ERCC1 (forexcision repaircross-complementing 1) deficiency causes mice to die soon after birth with an unusual liver pathology associated with nuclear p53 accumulation (36McWhir J. Selfridge J. Harrison D.J. Squires S. Melton D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The p53 protein is important in regulating various responses to DNA damage, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and these responses differ among cell types. We have reported previously that in DNA-damaged hepatocytes, p53 regulates cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We show here, in agreement with reports in human fibroblasts (29Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Ford J.M. Baron E.L. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 599-603PubMed Google Scholar), that p53 is required for efficient global repair, especially the repair of the CPDs, but not for transcription-coupled repair. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that DNA repair is a critical process in hepatocytes and, at least partially, depends on p53. Interestingly, although the precise mechanisms by which the carcinogenic viral protein HBx promotes the development of HCC remain unclear, there is good evidence that interaction with and functional disruption of p53 are important. The present data show that HBx expression reduces p53 transactivation of a reporter plasmid after irradiation, and this is direct evidence that HBx alters endogenous p53 responses to DNA damage in liver cells. Moreover, we showed that the p53-dependent component of hepatocyte DNA repair is also inhibited by HBx. Indeed, HBx expression in wild-type cells reduces global DNA repair to the level of untransfected p53-null hepatocytes. By contrast, HBx expression did not further affect global repair in p53-null cells or the repair of a damaged plasmid (host cell reactivation assays) which we previously demonstrated to be p53-independent in hepatocytes (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which HBx interferes with p53-dependent regulation of repair was not evaluated here but may involve direct binding of HBx to p53 (17Ueda H. Ullrich S.J. Gangemi J.D. Kappel C.A. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Takada S. Kaneniwa N. Tsuchida N. Koike K.

A. 1997; 94: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This interaction was identified in vivo by coprecipitation of HBx and p53 from liver tumors (19Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Duan L.X. London W.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar) and could produce cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 (17Ueda H. Ullrich S.J. Gangemi J.D. Kappel C.A. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Takada S. Kaneniwa N. Tsuchida N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1898-1901Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Elmore L.W.

A. 1997; 94: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or interference with p53 transcriptional regulation of other downstream proteins involved in nuclear excision repair (25 and references therein). The interaction of HBx with p53 could also inhibit p53 binding to the repair proteins XPB and XPD as was seen previously using cell extracts (25Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that direct interaction of HBx with p53 is central to the p53-dependent effect of HBx on DNA repair observed here. In a recent report, Becker et al. (38Becker S.A. Lee T.-H. Butel J.S. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used several HBx deletion mutants to identify regions of HBx required for impairment of DNA repair. They found a minimal region that correlates with the region interacting with the repair protein XAP-1/UV-DDB. However, this part of HBx protein is also required for p53 binding (39Lin Y. Nomura T. Yamashita T. Dorjsuren D. Tang H. Murakami S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5137-5142PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore difficult to rule out the possibility that the inhibition of DNA repair observed in their study was dependent on HBx interaction with p53. Clearly, if HBx alters p53-dependent DNA repair through binding to p53, it could affect other p53-regulated functions such as p53-dependent apoptosis. Indeed, HBx expression inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis in hepatocytes when apoptosis was produced by microinjection of a p53-overexpressing vector (37Elmore L.W. Hancock A.R. Chang S.F. Wang X.W. Chang S. Callahan C.P. Geller D.A. Will H. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 40Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W. Yeh H. Forrester K. Sturzbecher H.W. Hoeijmakers J.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar). Under the present culture conditions where apoptosis is not p53-dependent (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), transient expression of HBx has no effect on hepatocyte apoptosis, as might be expected. Direct binding of HBx to p53 could also explain the inhibition of p53 transactivation function, either by sequestering p53 protein in the cytoplasm (37Elmore L.W. Hancock A.R. Chang S.F. Wang X.W. Chang S. Callahan C.P. Geller D.A. Will H. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or by altering p53 binding to DNA (15Wang X.W.

Inhibition of p53 transactivation function by HBx has been reported in cells coinjected or cotransfected with p53 and HBx expression vectors (15Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 16Truant R. Antunovic J. Greenblatt J. Prives C. Cromlish J.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report extends these studies to show interference by HBx with the transactivation responses to a physiological level of endogenous p53. Numerous biological properties for HBx have been described which could account for its role in hepatocarcinogenesis. The present work supports the idea that dysfunction of the p53 protein through interaction with HBx is of biological and pathological significance for early events leading to carcinogenesis. In our experiments, HBx expression mimics a state of p53 deficiency or of inactivating p53 mutation. Hencep53 mutation may be unnecessary for carcinogenesis in HBV-infected hepatocytes that express HBx. Indeed, clinical studies have shown an association between HBx expression and the absence of mutation in p53 (8Unsal H. Yakicier C. Marcais C. Kew M. Volkmann M. Zentgraf H. Isselbacher K.J. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Henkler F. Waseem N. Golding M.H.C. Allison M.R. Koshy R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6084-6091PubMed Google Scholar), and by contrast, HCC carryingp53 mutations does not express HBV products (8Unsal H. Yakicier C. Marcais C. Kew M. Volkmann M. Zentgraf H.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar), and HBV-associated HCC has a low frequency of p53 mutation in non-AFB1-exposed populations (8Unsal H. Yakicier C. Marcais C. Kew M. Volkmann M.

These observations, together with others suggesting that the p53 mutation and loss of allele are late events in this type of cancer (7Tanaka S. Toh Y. Adachi E. Matsumata T. Mori R. Sugimachi K.

Maeda A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 231-235PubMed Google Scholar), strongly support the in vitro data suggesting that HBx inactivation of p53 functions is an authentic alternative mechanism top53 mutation in early carcinogenesis. Chronic viral hepatitis is characterized by a regenerative necroinflammatory process, typically sustained for several years. Hepatitis-related cycles of cell death and regeneration in an inflammatory environment, conditions that favor the generation of reactive oxygen species, could be critical for a progressive accumulation of genetic defects. If, as suggested here, HBx impairs p53-dependent DNA repair, then two predictions can be made. First, mutation incidence should be increased by HBx expression. Second, because p53 affects global repair but not transcription-coupled repair, an increased incidence of mutation in the nontranscribed strand would be expected in patients with HBV infection. Interestingly, HBx infection further increases the mutation rate in patients from areas with high dietary exposure to aflatoxin (46Lunn R.M. Zhang Y.-J. Wang L.-Y. Chen C.J. Lee P.-H. Lee C.-S. Tsai W.-Y. Santella R.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3471-3477PubMed Google Scholar), and furthermore,p53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas of patients from regions where HBV is endemic show a strong bias toward the nontranscribed strand (47Greenblatt J. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the present demonstration that DNA repair is a very efficient process in normal hepatocytes, these data indicate that alteration by HBx of p53-dependent DNA repair could promote hepatocarcinogenesis. This has implications for our understanding of the ways in which HCC arises in chronic inflammatory liver disease and possibly for the investigation of new treatments. Indeed, there are additional properties of both HBx and p53 which will be interesting to evaluate in hepatocytes: we have shown that p53 maintains hepatocyte sensitivity to cytokines that promote growth and survival (20Bellamy C.C. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There are reports that HBx expression alters hepatocyte responses to cytokines (48Kiso S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3831-3836PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that these observations also reflect an effect through p53. This possibility together with our finding that deficiency in IRF-1 (21Prost S. Bellamy C.C. Cunningham D.S. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a regulator of cellular responses to cytokines, leads to a reduction in DNA repair, could have implications for how antiviral treatments with cytokines might alter hepatocyte repair efficiency.

In addition, modulation of post receptor components of the receptor-effector pathway, such as the level of G protein expression (31Edwards R.J. MacDermot J. Wilkins A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), can also underlie desensitization. In the present study, we examined the mechanism(s) underlying the desensitization of sst receptor-mediated responses in the neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15, which has been shown to express the sst2B receptor (2Vanetti M. Vogt G. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have chosen to study endogenous sst receptor desensitization rather than use a receptor expression system for two reasons: first, because we wished to study this process in an environment in which the level of expression of all of the components was controlled by the cell, thus avoiding potentially misleading interactions that may arise when one or more components are overexpressed; second, having characterized the desensitization, we wished to genetically manipulate the cells to block out mechanisms that could potentially be responsible for desensitization. The maintenance of both wild-type NG108-15 cells and cells stably transfected with plasmid conferring resistance to the antibiotic geneticin and incorporating a dominant negative mutant GRK2 construct, or cells transfected with plasmid alone, has previously been described (34Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the calcium channel current experiments, cells were differentiated to enhance their neuronal phenotype. For this, cells were replated onto 13-mm diameter glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 μm prostaglandin E1, and 1% fetal calf serum (with or without 200 μg ml−1 geneticin, depending on cell type). Cells were maintained in this medium for 3 days before experimentation. Cells were viable for electrophysiological recording for a further 7 days. Voltage-sensitive calcium channel currents were recorded using the amphotericin-perforated patch technique (35Rae J. Cooper K. Gates G. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In some experiments where membrane-impermeable agents were applied to the inside of cells, whole cell patch clamp recordings were made, and the drug was added to the pipette filling solution. In these experiments, recording took place at least 15 min after establishment of the whole cell configuration to allow adequate dialysis of the agents into the cells. Cells were superfused (3 ml min−1) at room temperature (19–23 °C) with a solution containing 132.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm CsCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 50 mm sucrose. During patch clamp recordings to isolate the voltage-dependent calcium channel current from other voltage-dependent currents, the superfusing solution was changed to one in which NaCl and CaCl2 were replaced with 121 mm tetraethylammonium chloride and 10 mmBaCl2, respectively. Borosilicate glass electrodes with resistances of 3–5 megaohms were lightly fire-polished, and for whole cell recordings they were filled with a solution containing 120 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm BAPTA, 5 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm NaGTP, and 25 mm HEPES. For perforated patch recordings, the electrodes were filled with a solution containing 120 μg ml−1 amphotericin B and 20 mm CsCl, 140 mm cesium methyl sulfonate, and 20 mm HEPES. The pH of all the internal and external solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. A junction potential offset of −8 mV has been accounted for in all results shown. In whole cell recordings, the average access resistance was 10 ± 1 megaohms (n = 78). For perforated patch recordings, the average access resistance was 15 ± 1 megaohms (n = 108). Calcium channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments). Currents were sampled at 5 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and recorded onto disk for subsequent analysis. Voltage command protocols were generated using pClamp version 5.5 software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed off-line using pClamp version 6.0 software. For comparison of data from different cells, the amplitude of the calcium channel current was normalized to that of the initial current amplitude in each cell, taken as the mean current evoked by 10 successive depolarizing steps, recorded at the start of each experiment. Calcium channel currents were evoked from a holding potential of −98 mV by 200-ms step depolarizations to +2 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Under our recording conditions, these maximal amplitude currents did not run down appreciably over the period of the experiment, which was normally 20 min. Differentiated NG108-15 cells express T-, L- and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel currents (36Docherty R.J. J. Physiol. 1988; 398: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that only the N type current is sensitive to modulation by SRIF (32Hepworth M.B. Henderson G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 321PGoogle Scholar). In order to maximize observed current inhibition, L-type current was removed in all experiments by continuous superfusion with nimodipine (3 μm). Where required, drugs were added directly to the culture medium for varying times. Cells were harvested in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 1 min. The resulting pellets were washed twice in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −70° until required. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured by a protein binding assay (37Brown B.L. Albano J.D.M. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Tampion W. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were thawed and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer containing ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). A 40-μl sample of homogenate was then added to 30 μl of premix buffer (final assay concentration: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg2+, 1 mm ATP, 1 μm GTP, 250 μm4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)imidazolidin-2-one (Ro201724) as phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 130 units ml−1 creatine phosphokinase) and 30 μl of drug at the relevant concentration. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, and the tubes were placed on ice for 10 min. Precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 2900 ×g for 20 min at 4°, and 50 μl of the resulting supernatant was added to 50 μl of 1 m NaOH and 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA (TE buffer); 50 μl of this solution was then added to fresh tubes containing 100 μl of TE buffer, 100 μl of [3H]cyclic AMP in TE buffer (about 20,000 cpm) and 100 μl of binding protein in TE buffer (to give a final concentration of ∼750 μg of protein ml−1, prepared from bovine adrenal cortex). Tubes containing 100 μl of standard concentrations of cyclic AMP (0.125–20 pmol) were used to construct a standard curve. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, 200 μl of TE buffer containing charcoal (Norit GSX; 50 mg ml−1 final concentration) and bovine serum albumin (2 mg ml−1 final concentration) were added, and 15 min later the tubes were centrifuged at 2900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was transferred into vials for liquid scintillation counting. Standard curve data were fitted to a logistic expression (GRAPHpad), and the unknowns were read off. Protein content of homogenates was determined (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar), and adenylyl cyclase activity was expressed as pmol of cyclic AMP min−1mg−1 protein. The percentage of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was calculated as follows: 100 − [(iloprost-stimulated activity in the presence of SRIF/iloprost-stimulated activity in the absence of SRIF) × 100]. The percentage of desensitization in adenylyl cyclase experiments was calculated as: (1 − (inhibition of iloprost-stimulated activity by SRIF following SRIF pretreatment/inhibition of iloprost-stimulated activity by SRIF with no pretreatment)) × 100. We have been unable to measure sufficient levels of specific binding of either125I-BIM-23027, an sst2 receptor-specific ligand, or 125I-SRIF in either intact NG108-15 cells or membrane preparations made from these cells. 2V. Beaumont and G. Henderson, unpublished observations. Thus, the following experiments utilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing sst2A receptors. Confluent flasks of CHO cells stably transfected with epitope-tagged sst2 receptors (obtained from the Glaxo Institute of Applied Pharmacology, Cambridge, UK) were washed twice in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and subsequently incubated for 5 min at room temperature with calcium channel current recording solution with or without either phenylarsine oxide (80 μm) or concanavalin A (0.3 mg ml−1). Cells were then washed a further two times in serum-free medium, and membranes were prepared as described previously (39Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cell membranes (1 μg of final protein) were incubated with 30 pm125I-labeled BIM-23027 (K d ∼ 55 pm) at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold BIM-23027 (10–500 pm). Under these conditions, 8 ± 1% of total radioactive ligand bound to membranes, and 78 ± 7% of that binding was specific. IC50 values for the displacement of specific binding by the cold ligand were calculated, and an estimation of theK i of the cold ligand was obtained using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (using GRAPHpad software). Two 28-mer peptides corresponding to the βγ binding domains of GRK2 and GRK3 (Trp643–Ser670) were synthesized at the Molecular Recognition Center at the University of Bristol. For use in electrophysiological experiments, the peptides were dissolved in internal recording solution at a concentration of 100 μm. At this concentration, after 15 min of dialysis of pipette solution into the cells, we estimate that the intracellular concentration of the peptides would be between 25 and 42 μm (see Ref. 40Pusch M. Neher E. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar for details of how the concentration of the peptides inside the cell was calculated). The pH of the peptide-containing solution was maintained at 7.4, which was essential to retain their biological activity (41Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the responses of at least five cells in electrophysiological experiments or at least three separate experiments for adenylyl cyclase assays. For electrophysiological experiments, concentration-inhibition curves were fitted to the data by logistic (Hill equation), nonlinear regression analysis (GRAPHpad). Log concentration-effect data for SRIF-mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and other data by Student's unpaired ttest. In all cases, a probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Application of SRIF (1 nm to 1 μm) to wild type cells produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the calcium channel current, which was maximal within 20 s of the drug reaching the bath (Figs. 1 and2 C). The IC50 for calcium channel current inhibition was 36 nm (95% confidence limits, 13–96 nm). The maximum inhibition of the calcium channel current was approximately 50% (Fig.2 C). At the higher concentrations of SRIF, the inhibition was not maintained in the continued presence of SRIF but declined to a lower level (Figs. 1 and 2 A). If this desensitization was occurring during the onset of the inhibition of the calcium channel current, then at higher concentrations of SRIF we may have underestimated the true extent of calcium channel current inhibition. Upon washout of the drug, calcium channel current amplitude returned to predrug levels within 80 s. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (200 ng ml−1 for 24 h) completely prevented the inhibition of the calcium channel current by SRIF (300 nm,n = 5).Figure 2Concentration dependence of both the amount and rate of desensitization of calcium channel current inhibition by SRIF. A, the time course of inhibition of calcium channel current amplitude during a 5-min application of SRIF (300 nm) to a single cell. The percentage of desensitization was calculated as 100((x − y)/x), where x corresponds to the maximum inhibition of calcium channel current and y corresponds to the inhibition remaining after 3 min of drug application. B, calcium channel currents recorded from a single cell prior to (a), 40 s after (b), and 3 min after (c) the onset of SRIF (300 nm) superfusion and after washout of SRIF (d). C, the maximum current inhibition (○) and the degree of desensitization (•) have been plotted against the concentration of SRIF. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of 5–20 cells. Significant desensitization occurred at concentrations of SRIF below 300 nm, the concentration required to elicit maximal calcium channel current inhibition. D, thet 12 for the on rate of desensitization, measured as the time taken for 50% desensitization of the maximum inhibition (b in A) to occur, is plotted against the concentration of SRIF. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of 5–20 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The time course of the desensitization induced by SRIF (300 nm) is illustrated in Fig. 2 A. The amount of desensitization has been calculated as the fraction of the maximum inhibition lost after 3 min of drug application. The decay of the SRIF inhibition was not well fitted by one or two exponentials, and therefore the rate of desensitization has been calculated as the time to reach half-maximal desensitization (t 12). The amount of desensitization increased as the concentration of SRIF was increased (Figs. 1 and 2 C) with an EC50 of 33 nm (95% confidence limits, 24–47 nm), and a maximum desensitization of approximately 50% was produced by 1 μm SRIF. Thus, SRIF inhibition of the calcium channel current and the SRIF induction of desensitization occurred over exactly the same concentration range, and therefore significant desensitization occurred at concentrations of SRIF below that required to induce maximal calcium channel current inhibition. The rate of desensitization also increased as the concentration of SRIF was increased (Fig.2 D). To induce desensitization, SRIF (300 nm) was applied for 3 min and then washed out of the recording chamber. A second application of SRIF (300 nm) after 2 min of washout inhibited the current by only 22 ± 3% (n = 4) (Fig.3 A), indicating little reversal of desensitization at this time point. In control cells, the δ-opioid agonist DPDPE (300 nm) inhibited the calcium channel current by 58 ± 6% (n = 5). When desensitization to SRIF (300 nm) applied for 3 min had been induced and SRIF had been washed out for 2 min, then application of DPDPE (300 nm) still inhibited the calcium channel current by 56 ± 4% (n = 4) (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that no cross-desensitization had occurred. NG108-15 cells have previously been shown to express substantial amounts of GRK2 (50–100 ng mg−1 whole cell protein) and smaller amounts of GRK3 (about 10 ng mg−1; Ref. 34Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To assess the possible involvement of GRK2 in SRIF-induced desensitization, we used NG108-15 cells stably expressing a dominant negative mutant construct (K220R) of GRK2 (DNM GRK2) (34Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNM GRK2 expression was 30–60-fold greater than that of endogenous GRK2. In concomitant experiments in our laboratory, it has been demonstrated that agonist-induced desensitization at the Gs-coupled adenosine A2A and A2Breceptors was markedly attenuated in these same DNM GRK2-expressing NG108-15 cells, but desensitization at IP prostanoid and secretin receptors, other Gs-coupled receptors, was unaffected (34Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In NG108-15 cells transfected with plasmid minus the DNM GRK2 insert, there was no change from wild type cells in either the degree of inhibition of the calcium channel current by SRIF or in the amount of desensitization (compare Figs. 2 C and4, A and B). In the DNM GRK2-transfected cells, the inhibition of the calcium channel current by SRIF was unchanged in comparison with plasmid-transfected control cells. Furthermore, the amount of desensitization was not reduced; surprisingly, there appears to be a shift to the left of the SRIF concentration-response curve for desensitization, but by analysis of variance this was not statistically significant (Fig.4 B). The rate of SRIF desensitization was also not significantly reduced in DNM GRK2-transfected cells from that observed in control or wild type cells (Fig. 4 C). Two 28-amino acid peptides that correspond to the βγ binding domains of GRK2 and GRK3 have previously been used to inhibit α2-adrenoceptor desensitization in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons (41Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They are thought to inhibit the translocation of GRK2 and GRK3 to the plasma membrane, which is a prerequisite for phosphorylation of membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors (43Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the whole cell conformation of the patch clamp technique, wild type NG108-15 cells were dialyzed with 100 μm of either of the blocking peptides against GRK2 or GRK3 for periods in excess of 15 min before applying SRIF. Dialysis of the cells with either GRK-blocking peptide failed to alter either the inhibition of the calcium channel current by submaximal and maximally desensitizing concentrations of SRIF (100 and 300 nm) or the amount and rate of desensitization induced by SRIF (TableI). Furthermore, increasing the concentration of GRK2-blocking peptide in the pipette to 300 μm did not alter the level of desensitization induced by 100 nm SRIF, being 32 ± 3% in control cells and 28 ± 6% in cells dialyzed with GRK2-blocking peptide (n = 10).Table IThe effect of GRK2- and GRK3-blocking peptides on the desensitization of SRIF-evoked inhibition of calcium channel current100 nm SRIF300 nm SRIFMaximum inhibitionDegree of desensitization at 3 mint 1/2 desensitizationMaximum inhibitionDegree of desensitization at 3 mint 1/2 desensitization%%s%%sControl (no peptides)37 ± 732 ± 372 ± 934 ± 254 ± 1042 ± 4GRK2-blocking peptide (100 μm)38 ± 524 ± 668 ± 438 ± 454 ± 1155 ± 8GRK3-blocking peptide (100 μm)36 ± 530 ± 780 ± 835 ± 446 ± 948 ± 11 Open table in a new tab SRIF-induced desensitization was unaffected by exposure of cells before and during SRIF application to H-89, which at the concentration used (10 μm) should inhibit protein kinase A, protein kinase C and cGMP-dependent protein kinase; the specific protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (1 μm); or the specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (300 μm, applied in the pipette) (Fig. 5). Furthermore, SRIF-induced desensitization was unaffected by activation of either protein kinase A by Sp-8-Br-cAMPS (300 μm, applied in the pipette), protein kinase C by the phorbol ester PMA (1 μm) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase by Sp-8-Br-cGMPS (300 μm, applied in the pipette) (Fig.5). By irreversibly cross-linking membrane proteins, the lectin concanavalin A (ConA) is thought to interfere with the translocation of membrane receptors to their sites of endocytosis (44Ng G.Y.K.

Nutr. 1995; 15: 323-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In humans, in addition to those tissues, the D2 mRNA or activity has been identified in thyroid, cardiac and skeletal muscle, and skin (3Salvatore D. Bartha T. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R.

Invest. 1996; 98: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because of its wide expression in humans, T3 production by D2 may contribute significantly to the plasma T3 as well as generate intracellular T3 as it does in the rat (3Salvatore D. Bartha T.

We and others have previously sequenced and transiently expressed a human D2 cDNA, Genethon clone Z44085, an EST clone in GenBank first identified as D2 by virtue of its sequence similarity to the Rana catesbiana D2 (3Salvatore D.

Expression of a functional D2 enzyme required the addition of a heterologous SECIS element in the 3′-UTR, because the EST clone itself does not contain a SECIS element. When the rat D2 cDNA was expressed alone only a 15-kDa protein without any activity could be detected, which raised some questions about the authenticity of this cDNA (8Leonard J.L. Safran M. Farwell A.P. 79th Annual Meeting of the American Endocrine Society. Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD1997: 2-36Google Scholar). Herein we report the sequence of the 3′-untranslated region of the human D2 cDNA and show that it contains a functional Form 2 SECIS element just upstream of the polyadenylation signal.DISCUSSIONWe report the sequence of the 5.3-kb 3′-UTR of the hD2 cDNA, which is validated by Northern analysis and a 3′-RACE. The 6.5- and 7.5-kb mRNAs contain both coding sequence and a SECIS element. Computer analyses of the 3′-UTR EST sequences predicted the presence of a Form 2 SECIS element about 300 bp 5′ to the poly(A) tail, which is strikingly similar to that of the hD3 SECIS element (15Salvatore D. Low S.C. Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Croteau W. St. Germain D.L. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2421-2430Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The potency of the hD2 SECIS element is virtually identical to that of the rat D1 SECIS element. The fact that a single nucleotide change abolishes SECIS activity confirms the specificity of the element as predicted from recent mutagenesis studies (18Martin G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). The 5.4-kb distance between the SECIS element and the first UGA codon in hD2 is 4-fold greater than the longest distance previously found between a UGA codon and a SECIS element (1.2 kb in selenoprotein P) (1Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that an increase in UGA/SECIS spacing from 1.2 up to 2.7 kb had no effect on the activity of the rat D1 SECIS element (17Janssen O.E. Chen B. Buettner C. Refetoff S. Scriba P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28234-28238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, when we placed this element 4 kb 3′ to the UGA codon of D1, close to the distance in the full-length hD2 mRNA, it retained only 25% of its potency. The potent activity of the hD2 SECIS element in a transient expression system at a distance of 5.4 kb from the UGA codon redefines the spacing boundaries for SECIS function and supports the looping model for eukaryotic SECIS function proposed by Berry et al. (19Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the control construct hD2 Sel P is expressed at a 100-fold lower level in Xenopus oocytes than in mammalian cells, suggesting that the latter system is not optimal for D2 expression studies. This may explain the earlier failure to express D2 activity by poly(A) RNA injection from tissues rich in D2 activity (20Berry M.J. Kates A.L. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The 3′-UTR of the hD2 message contains 10 AUUUA motifs, one UUAUUUAUU motif, and several A/U-rich regions, all of which are located between the coding region and the SECIS element. These AU-rich elements (AREs) are present in the 3′-UTRs of mRNAs from genes, the expression of which can be rapidly regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms such as cytokines, hormones, and hormone receptors (for review see Ref. 21Belasco J. Braverman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). We recently found that the D2 mRNA in a rat pituitary tumor cell line has a half-life of only 2 h (22Kim S.W. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Regulation of D2 mRNA by control of its stability may be one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms by which hD2 expression is modulated. Given the probability that T3 derived from D2-catalyzed monodeiodination of T4 appears in the plasma of euthyroid, hypothyroid, or iodine-deficient humans, these AREs offer potential regulatory points to explain the rapid decrease in plasma T3 during illness (23LoPresti J.S.

EST clones of hD2 are found in thyroid, skin, placenta, retina, and brain libraries consistent with earlier reports of D2 activity in such tissues (4Salvatore D. Tu H. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J.

In addition, hD2 EST clones are found in libraries from two sets of pooled tissues, fetal liver, spleen, fetal testis, B-cell, and lung as well as prostate, breast, and uterus, none of which have been reported to express D2. These and the recent surprise that D2 mRNA is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and thyroid suggest a more general expression of the gene in human tissues than previously supposed.

The cDNAs of D1 and D3 both contain an in-frame TGA codon and aselenocysteine insertionsequence (SECIS) element in the 3′-UTR, which establishes them as selenoproteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Low S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2147385203,"The 80/40-kDa CD98 protein complex was purified using an anti-CD98 heavy chain monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose beads. Eluted proteins were subjected to preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein corresponding to the 40-kDa CD98 light chain was excised. Following proteolysis with trypsin, a peptide fragment was sequenced by mass spectrometry. The nine residues obtained were identical to established C-terminal sequences of the human E16 and rat TA1 proteins, suggesting that TA1/E16 protein is the CD98 light chain. Consistent with this, anti-TA1/E16 antibodies specifically immunoblotted the approximately 35-40-kDa light chain present upon immunoprecipitation of the human CD98 complex. Furthermore, anti-CD98 heavy chain antibody specifically co-immunoprecipitated hemagglutinin-tagged light chain from cells transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged E16 cDNA. In conclusion, the CD98 light chain is identical to the TA1/E16 protein, based on partial amino acid sequence identity, antibody cross-reactivity, genetic reconstitution evidence, similar molecular size, and comparable cell distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1537684840,"Adenosine is an important mediator of the endogenous defense against ischemia-induced injury in the heart. Adenosine can achieve cardioprotection by mediating the effect of ischemic preconditioning and by protecting against myocyte injury when it is present during the infarct-producing ischemia. A novel adenosine A3 receptor can mediate this protective function. One approach to achieve cardioprotection is to enhance myocardial sensitivity to the endogenous adenosine by increasing the number of adenosine receptors instead of administering an adenosine receptor agonist. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether genetic manipulation of the cardiac myocyte, achieved by gene transfer and overexpression of the human A3 receptor cDNA, renders the myocytes resistant to the deleterious effect of ischemia. Prolonged hypoxia with glucose deprivation, causing myocyte injury and adenosine release, was used to simulate ischemia in cultured chick embryo ventricular myocytes. During simulated ischemia, cultured myocytes with enhanced expression of the human A3 receptor and showed significantly higher ATP content, fewer cells killed, and less creatine kinase released into the medium than either control or mock-transfected myocytes. Also, increased expression of the A3 receptor caused an enhanced cardioprotective effect by the preconditioning ischemia. Overexpressing the adenosine A1 receptor also led to increased protection against ischemia-induced myocyte injury as well as an enhanced preconditioning effect. Thus, increasing the receptor level improves the myocyte sensitivity to the endogenous adenosine, which in turn causes all of the cardioprotective effects found for exogenously administered adenosine agonists. The study provides the first proof for the new concept that an increased expression of the human A3 receptor in the cardiac myocyte can be an important cardioprotective therapeutic approach.—Dougherty, C., Barucha, J., Schofield, P. E., Jacobson, K. A., Liang, B. T. Cardiac myocytes rendered ischemia resistant by expressing the human adenosine A1 or A3 receptor. FASEB J. 12, 1785–1792 (1998)"
https://openalex.org/W1542370090,"We report here the identification of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, an enzyme that is essential for the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The yeast gene YLR284C was identified in an in silico screen for genes that contain an oleate response element, a transcription factor-binding site common to most fatty acid-induced genes. Growth on oleic acid resulted in a significant increase inYLR284C mRNA, demonstrating that it is indeed an oleate-induced gene. The deduced product of YLR284Ccontains a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal-like sequence at its C terminus and localizes to the peroxisome in aPEX8-dependent manner. Removal ofYLR284C from the S. cerevisiae genome eliminated growth on oleic acid, but had no effect on peroxisome biogenesis, indicating a role for YLR284C in fatty acid metabolism. Cells lacking YLR284C had no detectable Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity, and a bacterially expressed form of this protein catalyzed the isomerization of 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA with a specific activity of 16 units/mg. We conclude thatYLR284C encodes the yeast peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase and propose a new name, ECI1, to reflect its enoyl-CoA isomerase activity."

Here we show that the yeast ER localization machinery recognizes determinants in TMDs that are very similar to those identified previously in mammalian cells. These determinants are recognized in post-ER compartments and recycled back to the ER, thus acting as ER retrieval signals. Moreover determinants in TMDs are inefficiently sorted in several previously characterized yeast mutants with defects in the ER retrieval machinery. Similar ER retrieval signals are also recognized in the TMDs of polytopic integral membrane proteins, apparently by the same sorting machinery. The isolation of new mutants defective in sorting of membrane determinants might provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.

The isolation of new mutants defective in sorting of membrane determinants might provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. In many type I and II transmembrane proteins, transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; GPI, glycophosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; COP, coat protein; endo H, endoglycosaminidase H; pep4, vacuolar protease PrA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are composed of approximately 20 hydrophobic amino acid residues, which form a helix spanning the lipid bilayer (1Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Besides their structural role as membrane spanning domains, TMDs of type I transmembrane proteins can contain complex determinants (hereafter referred to as membrane determinants), which play a key role in the assembly and intracellular transport of many oligomeric membrane receptors. For example, specific interactions between TMDs are essential for the assembly of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, CD8 molecules, the T-cell receptor, and the human high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcεRI) (2Cosson P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For several of these multisubunit receptors (T-cell receptor, CD8, FcεRI, B-cell receptor), membrane determinants also ensure retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of unassembled chains, thus participating in quality control at the level of the ER (3Hennecke S.

Today. 1991; 12: 196-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the observed ER localization results from continuous recycling from post-ER compartments, or from true ER retention. A usual feature of membrane determinants for ER retention is the presence of one or several hydrophilic residues within the hydrophobic TMD. These residues can be potentially charged residues, strongly hydrophilic residues, or several weakly hydrophilic residues (9Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 840-842Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar,10Reth M. Hombach J. Wienands J. Campbell K.S. Chien N. Justement L.B. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 196-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 2P. Cosson, unpublished observations. The introduction of one or several polar amino acid residues in the hydrophobic segment of a type I transmembrane protein normally transported to the cell surface is sufficient to cause its localization in the ER. Strongly hydrophilic residues are more efficient than weakly hydrophilic residues, and their effect is strongest when they are localized toward the middle of the TMD (9Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 840-842Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar).2 Longer and more hydrophobic transmembrane domains require the insertion of more hydrophilic residues to be able to cause ER retention (11Lankford S.P. Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4814-4820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar membrane determinants are also involved in the ER retention of the precursors of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. The precursors of GPI-anchored proteins are generally composed of an extracellular domain, a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring segment (referred to as a TMD) and a very short or no cytoplasmic domain. Shortly after their synthesis, precursors are cleaved at a lumenal site near the TMD and attached to a GPI anchor. When the cleavage site is mutated, the precursor is retained in the ER by signals contained in its TMD (12Delahunty M.D. Stafford F.J. Yuan L.C. Shaz D. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12017-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system participates in the quality control of GPI-anchored proteins by allowing transport to the cell surface of mature GPI-anchored proteins while unprocessed precursors are selectively retained in the ER. In many cases Saccharomyces cerevisiae has provided a convenient model to analyze the cellular mechanisms regulating intracellular traffic, but to date it is not clear if yeast cells make use of sorting determinants in TMDs analogous to those identified in mammalian cells. It has been shown that the TMD of Sec12p causes ER localization by continuous retrieval to the ER, and this was shown to be dependent on Rer1p and coatomer (13Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the TMD of Ufe1p was shown to cause ER localization in a Rer1p-independent manner (14Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we characterize extensively membrane determinants for ER localization in yeast cells, and show that they are very similar to those characterized previously in mammalian cells. Localization in the ER is achieved by continuous retrieval from post-ER compartments, and is affected in Δrer1 and other ER retrieval mutants. The same sorting machinery can also be used to achieve selective ER localization of polytopic membrane proteins. Yeast media have been described (17Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains used in this study are listed in TableI.

Riezman Open table in a new tab The original SUC2/GAS1 fusion was obtained from C. Nuoffer and H. Riezman by fusing the sequence coding for the last 159 amino acid residues of Gas1p at the C terminus of the invertase (SUC2) gene. The chimeric gene is under the control of a constitutive PRC1 promoter. The cleavage/attachment site of wild-type Gas1p (N506) is mutated to glutamine in Gas1Q as well as in all the invertase-Gas1Q fusion proteins presented here. When indicated the sequence RRSMEQKLISEEDLN corresponding to a fragment of the Myc protein (16Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was added as a cytoplasmic domain to the Inv-GasQ fusion protein. The mutant forms of the GAS1 gene were created using standard polymerase chain reaction protocols (17Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Entire subcloned fragments were sequenced after subcloning. Antisera to Gas1p (18Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and invertase (19Gaynor E.C. Heesen S.T. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 636-647Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Standard genetic methods for mating of haploid yeast strains, complementation analysis, and tetrad analysis were employed (15Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid propagation and purification. Plasmid DNA was purified using the alkaline lysis method (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Procedures for transformation of DNA into yeast (21Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and E. coli (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) have been described previously. DNA sequencing was carried out using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). MATa Δste2 cells expressing Ste2p-P290D were obtained and their mating ability determined as described (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Briefly, a patch of MATa cells expressing Ste2p-P290D (FLY276, FLY272 … ) was grown on YPD plates, then replica-plated to a lawn of MATα cells (RH311–3D) and incubated at 30 °C for 6 h. The cells were then replica-plated to SD plates where only diploid cells can grow. To isolate mutants, yeast cells expressing Ste2p-P290D were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate (50% cell death) and plated at high density on YPD plates as described (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Three days later, they were replica-plated to a lawn of MATα cells, allowed to mate for 6 h at room temperature, and replica-plated to SD plates. The diploid cells that grew were sporulated, and following tetrad dissection mutant cells expressing Ste2p-P290D and capable of mating were isolated. Analysis of the intracellular transport of Gas1p and Inv-Gas1Qp was performed as described previously (19Gaynor E.C. Heesen S.T. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 636-647Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing Inv-Gas1Q fusion protein were preincubated for 45 min at the indicated temperature, pulse-labeled for 10 min with Tran35S-label, and chased for 0 or 60 min. Equal amounts of cells were removed, and the fusion protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation, treated with endo H to remove N-linked oligosaccharides, and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation of Gas1p or Inv-Gas1Qp with an antipeptide antiserum to Gas1p or invertase, respectively, were done as described (23Zanolari B. Raths S. Singer-Krüger B. Riezman H. Cell. 1992; 71: 755-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For reprecipitation Inv-Gas1Qp was eluted from the beads at 90 °C and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with antisera to α1,6-mannose, or α1,3-mannose (a gift from R. Duden). Reprecipitation of Gas1p could not be performed, as antisera to α1,6-mannose strongly cross-react with Gas1p (data not shown). Methods for SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), immunoblotting (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and immunodetection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) have been described. Subcellular fractionation by velocity sedimentation on sucrose density gradients was carried out as described previously (26Schröder S. Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 OD600 equivalent units of cells were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 20 min and chased for 40 min before adding 20 mm NaN3 and 20 mm NaF. Cells were then spheroplasted in a volume of 2 ml and lysed by at least 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle after adding protease inhibitors. The lysate was cleared twice for 5 min at 500 × g in 2-ml reaction tubes. The supernatant (1 ml) was confirmed by microscopy to be devoid of unbroken cells and loaded onto an 11-ml sucrose gradient made up from 1-ml steps of 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, and 60% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2. The gradients were spun for 140 min at 4 °C in a SW41Ti rotor at 37,000 rpm. They were then fractionated from the top into 12 equal fractions, the pellet being resuspended in the last fraction. Aliquots of the fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with various antibodies as described. The Gas1 protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast cells as a membrane-bound precursor with a TMD and no cytoplasmic domain. Shortly after its synthesis, the precursor is cleaved at a site near the TMD, and the hydrophobic extension is replaced with an inositol-containing glycolipid that anchors the protein to the membrane (18Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). During transport of GPI-anchored Gas1p to the cell surface, maturation of Gas1p in the Golgi apparatus due to extensions of N- andO-linked carbohydrate chains decreases its mobility in SDS-PAGE, from 105 to 125 kDa (Refs. 18Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and 27Horvath A. Sütterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; see also Fig.1 B). When the anchor attachment site (asparagine in wild-type Gas1p) is mutated to a glutamine residue (Gas1Q), the resulting protein retains its TMD and is localized in the ER (Ref. 28Nuoffer H. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1 C). As mentioned above, hydrophilic residues are a usual feature of membrane determinants for ER localization in mammalian cells, and the TMD of Gas1p contains several serine and threonine residues. When several of these (three serine residues and one threonine) are mutated to leucine, the resulting Gas1Q[L] protein retains its TMD, but is transported out of the ER, albeit less efficiently than the wild-type Gas1p (Ref.27Horvath A. Sütterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1). This suggests that the TMD of Gas1p plays a critical role in retaining the uncleaved precursor in the ER, and that hydrophilic residues are elements of the membrane determinant for ER localization. To test whether the transmembrane domain of Gas1p can act as a determinant for localization in the ER, the C-terminal segment of Gas1Q or of Gas1Q[L] was transferred to the COOH terminus of invertase (Inv-Gas1Q[ST] and Inv-Gas1Q[L], respectively; Fig.2 A). For all the constructs used here, the main characteristic of the TMD is indicated in brackets ([ST] for a TMD containing serine and threonine residues, [L] for a TMD where they are mutated to leucine residues, etc.). Upon transport to the Golgi apparatus, the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to invertase are processed extensively by the Golgi mannosyltransferases and secreted invertase migrates as a very high molecular mass heterogeneous smear on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To characterize the glycosylation state of the invertase-Gas1Q fusion proteins, yeast cells expressing either Inv-Gas1Q[ST] or Inv-Gas1Q[L] were pulse-labeled for 10 min with Tran35S-label, and equal aliquots of cells were harvested after 0 or 1 h of chase. The immunoprecipitated fusion proteins were split into equal aliquots, and one aliquot was treated with endo H to remove N-linked sugars. Before the chase, Inv-Gas1Q[ST] migrated as a 130-kDa band (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), and after a 1-h chase, it showed only a slight increase in apparent molecular mass, as observed commonly for invertase when it is retained in the ER (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Endo H treatment removed N-linked sugars and converted the 130-kDa band to a 95-kDa band (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1 and 2), the expected size of the unglycosylated fusion protein. Inv-Gas1Q[L] also migrated as a 130-kDa band after the pulse, although a fraction migrated as a very high molecular mass species (>200 kDa) (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). After the chase, the protein migrated as a heterogeneous smear at 130–200 kDa (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). Upon endo H treatment, a doublet at 95 and 115 kDa was observed after the pulse (Fig. 2 C,lane 3), while after the chase a unique 55-kDa band was seen (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Thus, during the chase, the Inv-Gas1Q[L] undergoes proteolytic cleavage and a fragment corresponding to the size of wild-type invertase is generated. To check if this proteolytic processing took place in the vacuole, we expressed the invertase-Gas1Q fusion proteins in a protease-deficient Δpep4 strain. The PEP4 gene encodes the vacuolar hydrolase proteinase A (PrA), which is required for the activation of several protease zymogens within the vacuole. The proteolytic processing of the Inv-Gas1Q[L] was almost completely abolished in Δpep4 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). In these cells, the fusion protein accumulated as a very high molecular mass species (>200 kDa), and upon endo-H treatment migrated as a 115 kDa band. These results demonstrate that, following transport through the Golgi apparatus, Inv-Gas1Q[L] reaches the vacuole where it is processed by vacuolar proteases. This is similar to the intracellular fate of other previously described membrane-bound invertase fusion proteins, which are also transported to the vacuole when they exit from the early secretory pathway (19Gaynor E.C. Heesen S.T. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 636-647Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The conversion to a 115-kDa form upon transport out of the ER presumably results from the elongation of endo H-resistantO-linked sugars in the Golgi apparatus. Indeed the Gas1 protein has been reported to be heavily O-glycosylated and many potential O-glycosylation sites are found in the membrane-proximal segment of Gas1p (18Nuoffer C. Jenö P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the 115-kDa form exhibits α1,3-mannose sugars (see below), indicating that it has reached late Golgi compartments. Detailed analysis of the processing of N-linked sugars can provide information on the intracellular compartments reached by a glycoprotein. Addition of α1,6-mannose occurs in an early Golgi compartment, while elongation of α1,6-mannose sugar chains and addition of α1,3-mannose occurs in later Golgi compartments. After a 1-h chase, both Inv-Gas1Q[ST] and Inv-Gas1Q[L] could be quantitatively reprecipitated with an antiserum to α1,6-mannose (Fig.3 B), indicating that both fusion proteins get access to an early Golgi compartment. However, only Inv-Gas1Q[L] acquired α1,3-mannose sugars, indicating that it is transported to later compartments of the Golgi apparatus. Insec18 mutant cells at 37 °C, vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi was blocked and no acquisition of α1,6- or α1,3-mannose was observed (data not shown). This confirms that the addition of these sugars is due to vesicular transport of invertase-Gas1Q fusion proteins to the Golgi apparatus. Together, these experiments demonstrate that Inv-Gas1Q[ST] is retained in early secretory compartments (ER and/or cis-Golgi) but they do not allow to determine precisely the site of accumulation. Inv-Gas1Q[ST] could accumulate in an early Golgi compartment, or it could be retrieved from this compartment back to the ER. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed the intracellular localization of Inv-Gas1Q[ST] by subcellular fractionation. Metabolically labeled cells expressing Inv-Gas1Q[ST] were lysed, and the supernatant of a 500 × g spin was fractionated by velocity sedimentation on a sucrose gradient. The presence of Golgi (Emp47p) and ER (Wbp1p) markers in the gradient fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Inv-Gas1Q[ST] was detected by immunoprecipitation with an antibody to invertase, and one aliquot was further reprecipitated with antibodies to α1,6-mannose (Fig. 4). Inv-Gas1Q[ST] cofractionated with Wbp1p (fractions 8–11), and was mostly absent in fractions containing Emp47p (fractions 2–5). Inv-Gas1Q[ST] from ER fractions was quantitatively reprecipitated with antibodies to α1,6-mannose (Fig. 4) but not with antibodies to α1,3-mannose (data not shown), demonstrating that after acquisition of α1,6-mannose in early Golgi compartments, Inv-Gas1Q[ST] is retrieved selectively from early Golgi compartments to the endoplasmic reticulum. To ascertain that the determinant for ER retrieval of Inv-Gas1Q was solely comprised in its TMD, we constructed a chimeric protein where only the TMD was derived from Gas1, while the lumenal domain was derived from invertase and Wbp1p (19Gaynor E.C. Heesen S.T. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 636-647Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this construct the anchor attachment site of Gas1p is also deleted. The transmembrane domain of the Gas1p precursor caused ER localization of this chimeric protein, and substituting the hydrophilic residues in this TMD with leucine residues restored transport out of the ER and to the vacuole (data not shown). Thus, the ER retrieval determinant in the precursor of Gas1p is entirely contained in its TMD. To better define the membrane determinants for ER retrieval in yeast cells, we introduced various polar residues in the TMD of invertase-Gas1Q constructs. The presence of a single hydrophilic residue in the TMD of Inv-GasQ ensured its localization in the ER (Fig.5), but with variable efficiency: aspartic acid (D) was more efficient than arginine (R), and glutamine (Q) was the least efficient. This is reminiscent of experiments in mammalian cells, where aspartic acid residues in TMDs were found to be more effective than arginine residues at causing ER retention (9Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 840-842Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar), while glutamine residues were even less effective.2 When the TMD was lengthened by the addition of two hydrophobic residues ([long]), only an aspartic acid in the TMD could still cause ER localization, while constructs with an arginine or a glutamine residue in the TMD were transported efficiently to the vacuole (Fig. 5). Thus, when the TMD is longer, only the most potent membrane determinants ([ST] or [D]) can still cause ER localization. This is similar to observations in mammalian cells, where it was shown that longer TMDs require the insertion of more hydrophilic residues to cause ER retention (11Lankford S.P. Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4814-4820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by all criteria tested here, membrane determinants recognized by the ER localization machinery are very similar in yeast and in mammalian cells. To determine the role of various gene products in the sorting and ER retrieval of membrane determinants, we analyzed the intracellular transport of Inv-Gas1Q[ST] in various mutant cells. Coatomer is a protein complex composed of seven subunits, α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε- and ζ-COP, which forms a coat around vesicles budding from the Golgi apparatus (29Bednarek S.Y. Orci L. Schkman R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 468-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coatomer mutants are defective in retrograde transport of dilysine-tagged proteins from the Golgi to the ER at 30 °C (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 30Cosson P. Démollière C. Hennecke S. Duden R. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All the experiments presented below were done at 30 °C to avoid the complete block of transport observed in many mutants at 37 °C. No vacuolar processing of Inv-Gas1Q[ST] was observed in any of the mutants tested (sec7, sec12, sec13, sec14, sec16, sec17, sec18, sec19, sec20, tip20, sec21, sec23, ret1, ret2, ret3; Fig.6 A and data not shown). We also observed no accumulation of invertase activity at the cell surface (data not shown). Thus, in all the mutants tested, Inv-Gas1Q[ST] did not escape from the ER-Golgi system. To determine more precisely the intracellular fate of Inv-Gas1Q[ST], we analyzed its glycosylation state by reprecipitation with antibodies to α1,3-mannose. Contrary to what was observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3), in ret1–1(α-COP) and ret2–1 (δ-COP) mutant cells, Inv-Gas1Q[ST] acquired α1,3-mannose, as shown by reprecipitation with antibodies to α1,3-mannose (Fig.6 B). Acquisition of α1,3-mannose was also observed in ret1–2 (α-COP) mutant cells as well as in sec21–3 (γ-COP, 31) mutants (data not shown). No noticeable acquisition of α1,3-mannose was evident in other mutants tested (sec21–1, sec21–2,sec27, ret3, tip20, sec20,sec7, sec12, sec18, sec23; Fig. 6 B and data not shown), although a minor effect could easily be overlooked. Upon subcellular fractionation, the bulk of the Inv-Gas1Q[ST] was still present in the ER in ret1–1cells, and a fraction of it could be reprecipitated with antibodies to α1,3-mannose (data not shown) suggesting that in these cells at least a fraction of Inv-Gas1Q[ST] was transported further into the Golgi apparatus before being retrieved to the ER. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that acquisition of α1,3-mannose was due to a partial redistribution of the α1,3-mannosyltransferase from the late Golgi compartments to the cis-Golgi or the ER. It is noteworthy, however, that all the mutants exhibiting this putative defect in ER retrieval of Inv-Gas1Q[ST] are mutants of coatomer subunits. The coatomer complex has already been implicated in ER retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins, and this result suggests that the same retrieval pathway is followed by proteins bearing membrane determinants. We also tested the role of Rer1p, another protein previously implicated in ER retrieval in yeast cells (13Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Nishikawa S.I. Nakano A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8179-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Boehm J. Ulrich H. Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3696-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1459-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Δrer1mutant cells, Inv-Gas1Q[ST] was transported to the vacuole where it was processed (Fig. 7). Other invertase-Gas1Q fusion proteins (Inv-GasQ[R], -[D], and -[Q]) were also transported efficiently to the vacuole in Δrer1 mutant cells (data not shown). The retention defect was corrected by transforming the cells with a wild-type copy of RER1 (Fig. 7). Thus, Rer1p is involved in ER retrieval of membrane determinants present in type I transmembrane proteins. Polytopic membrane proteins, exhibiting several membrane-spanning segments, can also be localized in the early secretory apparatus. For example, the KDEL receptor cycles between the ER and early Golgi compartments, and mutating a single aspartic acid residue to leucine in the seventh TMD abolishes its retrieval to the ER (35Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However it remains to be seen if a single polar residue in one TMD can cause ER localization of a polytopic membrane protein. To test this, we introduced an aspartic residue at an equivalent position in the seventh TMD of Ste2p (P290D). Ste2p is normally expressed at the surface of MATa yeast cells and is essential for mating. The wild-type STE2 was deleted in MATa cells, and replaced with the P290D mutant. The cells were unable to mate, indicating that functional Ste2p was not expressed at the cell surface. Efficient mating was restored in Δrer1mutant cells expressing Ste2-P290D, as well as in various mutant cells with defects in ER retrieval (ret1, ret2, ret3, sec27, sec20, tip20; Fig.8 and data not shown). No significant mating was observed in sec23, sec13, sec16, andsec17 mutant cells (Fig. 8 and data not shown). These results strongly suggest that a single polar amino acid residue can cause ER localization of a polytopic membrane protein if it is placed in a TMD at an appropriate position, and that this sorting is dependent on Rer1p and the retrograde transport machinery. This system also allows the isolation of new mutant cells defective for intracellular retention of determinants contained in TMDs. Using a strategy identical to that previously described (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), we isolated new mutants unable to ensure the intracellular localization of Ste2-P290D. None of the 14 mutants isolated was thermosensitive for growth. Theretx mutant exhibited the most efficient mating (Fig. 8) and was not complemented with RET1, RET2, RET3, SEC21, or RER1. This suggests that it is mutated in a non-essential gene or that it represents a new, non-thermosensitive mutant allele of an already identified gene. This work demonstrates that determinants in the transmembrane domains of type I membrane proteins can cause ER localization in yeast cells. These determinants are essentially composed of one or several hydrophilic residues in the membrane-spanning segment and are very similar to membrane determinants for ER localization identified previously in mammalian cells. Various features of mammalian membrane determinants (relative potency of various amino acid residues, effect of the length of the TMD) are also observed for yeast membrane determinants. This strongly suggests that a similar mechanism is involved in the recognition of these determinants in yeast and mammalian cells. However, one major difference should be noted; in contrast to what was observed in mammalian cells (9Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Shah N. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 840-842Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar), ER retrieval signals in TMDs do not lead to non-lysosomal degradation in yeast cells. This suggests that these two events (ER localization and non-lysosomal degradation) can be distinguished mechanistically, and that some element of the targeting or degradation machinery is different in yeast cells. Continuous retrieval to the ER is apparently crucial for the ER localization of proteins with membrane determinants. This is suggested by the fact that these proteins are localized in the ER but acquire sugar modifications typical of the early Golgi compartment. It is further confirmed by the fact that both coatomer and Rer1p are necessary for efficient ER localization of ER membrane determinants. Both coatomer and Rer1p were implicated previously in ER retrieval. Coatomer was shown to play an essential role in ER retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins from the Golgi to the ER (22Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Démollière C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Rer1p was initially identified as a protein involved in the ER localization of Sec12p, a type II transmembrane protein involved in ER-to-Golgi transport (32Nishikawa S.I. Nakano A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8179-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Boehm J. Ulrich H. Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3696-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1459-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that Rer1p participates in ER retrieval of Sec12p from the Golgi to the ER, a process critically dependent of the TMD of Sec12p (13Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Though the targeting determinant in the Sec12p TMD remained elusive, it contains two hydrophilic residues (one asparagine and one glutamine) that are essential for ER retrieval of Sec12p (13Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It seems likely that similar features are recognized in the TMDs of type I membrane proteins studied here and of the type II membrane protein Sec12p. Our results also suggest that similar determinants can be recognized in the TMDs of polytopic membrane proteins, and that the same cellular machinery is involved, as suggested by the fact that Rer1p is essential for ER retrieval in both cases. Most polytopic proteins contain numerous charged residues within their predicted transmembrane spans, and evidently the positioning of the residue must be critical for its action as a sorting determinant. In the case of the KDEL receptor, it has been proposed that the polar residue critical for ER retrieval is exposed to the lipid bilayer, and thus in a position to be recognized by a membrane sorting machinery. It also remains to be determined whether a polar residue in any of the TMDs, or only in a subset of TMDs of a polytopic membrane protein can lead to ER retrieval. These results stand in apparent contradiction with the recent report that the TMD of Ufe1p causes ER retention in a Rer1p-independent manner (14Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Note, however, that our results do not exclude the possibility that membrane determinants also cause inefficient transport out of the ER. It is possible that some membrane determinants (e.g. Ufe1p) are more apt at causing true ER retention, while others act mostly by causing ER retrieval. The isolation of more mutants defective for ER localization of membrane determinants could lead to the identification of new components involved of the sorting machinery. We thank J. A. Garcia-Sanz and Jean Pieters for discussion and comments on the manuscript, and Corinne Démollière and Chantal Guiet for technical assistance."

It was demonstrated recently that AA can activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are crucial for transducing signals initiating cell growth and apoptosis. Here we studied the effect of AA on the induction of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and found that AA stimulated induction of MKP-1 mRNA and proteins in VSMCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-, lipoxygenase-, and cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism did not affect AA-induced MKP-1 expression, indicating that eicosanoid biosynthesis was not involved in this process. The glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, abolished AA-stimulated MKP-1 gene expression, whereas inhibition of protein kinase C by calphostin C had no influence on MKP-1 induction. VSMC pretreatment with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, completely blocked AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction. MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 did abolish AA-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases but not MKP-1 induction. Furthermore, agonists that increase AA release stimulated MKP-1 induction and activation of MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases or stress-activated protein kinases.

Thus, the balance between MAPK activation and MKP-1 induction should be an important point in determining the fate of cells stimulated by environmental insults. Arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites are critical to a variety of biological processes, such as chemotaxis, inflammation, and signal transduction (15Hanahan D.J. Annu. Rev.

In addition to these functions, several investigators in recent years have reported that some peptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factors stimulate AA production in a number of cell types (17Peppelenbosch M.P.

However, no data exist as to whether AA induces MKP-1 expression, which is important in regulating MAPK activity during cell proliferation. In the present study, we evaluated the potential effects of AA on MKP-1 induction in VSMCs using Western and Northern blot analyses and demonstrated that AA stimulation results in MKP-1 mRNA expression followed by increased protein induction. The mechanism appears to involve AA-stimulated superoxide generation, which activates tyrosine kinases and is independent of downstream eicosanoid biosynthesis and of protein kinase C (PKC) signal pathways.

(Plymouth Meeting, PA). Genistein, herbimycin A, andN-acetylcysteine were from Calbiochem-Novaniochem International (La Jolla, CA). H2O2 was purchased from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Indomethacin, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, bradykinin, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB were purchased from Sigma and PD 98059 from AlexisTM Biochemicals (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). VSMCs were isolated by enzymatic digestion of rat aortas according to the procedure of Ross and Kariya (28Ross R. Kariya B. Bohr D.F. Somlyo A.P. Sparks H.V. Handbook of Physiology: Circulation, Vascular Smooth Muscle. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1980: 69-91Google Scholar) with a slight modification (29Xu Q. Li D. Holbrook N.J. Udelsman R. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and cultured in medium RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged by treatment with a solution of 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Experiments were conducted on VSMCs that had just achieved confluence. VSMCs were serum starved for 4 days and incubated with AA in the presence or absence of inhibitors at 37 °C for the times indicated in figure legends. After two washes with cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, cells were harvested on ice in buffer A containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 400 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min with vortexing every 5 min. Cellular debris were then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge, Osterode, Germany) at 4 °C, supernatants collected, and protein concentration measured by the Bio-Rad assay. Fifty μg of total VSMC proteins was separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA85; Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk (Sigma) for 1 h, the blots were probed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against MKP-1 (1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk) or monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 for 2 h. The reaction was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) at a 1:3,000 dilution. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, specific antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL Western blot Detection Kit (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK) as described previously (30Xu Q. Hu Y. Kleindienst R. Wick G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Graphs of the blots were obtained in the linear range of detection and were quantified for the levels of specific induction or blocking by scanning laser densitometry (Power-Look II, UMAX Data System Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan) of graphs. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was isolated, denaturated with formaldehyde (Merck), electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Zeta Probe; Bio-Rad), and UV cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). Hybridizations were performed using a fluorescein-labeled (Amersham Corp.) cDNA probe for MKP-1, as described previously (31Xu Q. Fawcett T.W. Gorospe M. Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed, detected with anti-fluorescein alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5,000) (Amersham Corp.), and exposed to ECL films (Amersham Corp.). Graphs of the blots were obtained in the linear range of detection. Accuracy of loading and transfer as well RNA integrity were confirmed by quantitative analysis of the 28 S and 18 S RNA. VSMCs were serum starved for 4 days, stimulated with AA, and harvested with buffer A. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was harvested and protein concentration measured with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein A-Sepharose 4B suspension (Sigma) was added to the supernatant (100 μl/ml) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was harvested. For kinase assays, 0.5 ml of the supernatant containing 0.5 mg of proteins was incubated with 10 μl of antibodies against mammalian ERK2 or JNK1/SAPK for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. These antibodies have been shown to recognize specifically mammalian ERK2p42 and JNK1p54. Subsequently, 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B suspension was added, and rotation continued for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by centrifugation and washed twice with buffers A, B (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6), and C (20 mmMOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2), respectively. ERK2 activities in the immunocomplexes were measured as described previously (32Xu Q. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Kokkonen G.C. Mock Y.D. Roth G.S. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, immunocomplexes were incubated with 35 μl of buffer C supplemented with 6 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm MgCl2, and 30 μm ATP for 20 min at 37 °C with vortexing every 3 min. To stop the reaction, 15 μl of 4 × Laemmli buffer was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Proteins in the kinase reaction were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel) and subjected to autoradiography. The assay for JNK/SAPK activity was performed as described above using GST-c-Jun as substrate (the plasmid was provided by Dr. J. Woodgett) produced in E. coli and isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B RediPack Columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) per the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins in the kinase reaction were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) and subjected to autoradiography (6Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of variance was performed when more than two groups were compared. An unpaired Student'st test was used to assess differences between two groups. Ap value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Growth-arrested VSMCs were exposed to 20 μm AA for varying times, and protein extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of proteins from control and experimental samples were used to test MKP-1 induction using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, exposure of cells to AA resulted in a time-dependent induction of MKP-1 which was evident at 20 min, peaked at 1 h, and declined thereafter. Fig.1 B summarizes MKP-1 induction as determined by quantification of optical densities from autoradiograms of three experiments. Exposure of cells to AA produced 10–20-fold changes in MKP-1 after 1 or 2 h in protein extracts of VSMCs. AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction was also dose-dependent in that an increment in the proteins was observed at 2 μm and was maximal at 20 μm (Fig. 1 C). In addition, other fatty acids, including linoleic acid and stearic acid, did not significantly stimulate MKP-1 induction (data not shown). MKP-1 mRNA levels in AA-treated VSMCs were analyzed by Northern blots. As shown in Fig. 2, AA treatment resulted in significantly increased MKP-1 mRNA in VSMCs. Kinetic analysis of the response revealed that AA-induced MKP-1 mRNA expression occurred as early as 20 min (Fig. 2 A), with maximum levels (10-fold greater than untreated control) achieved between 20 min and 1 h after treatment and a return to basal levels thereafter. To establish further the relationship between AA treatment and MKP-1 expression, we performed a dose-response analysis of AA-induced MKP-1 mRNA accumulation. As shown in Fig.2 B, MKP-1 mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner between 3 and 80 μm. The lower halves of Fig. 2 (Aand B) show the amount of 28 S and 18 S RNA from the corresponding blot. In most mammalian cells, AA is oxidized through the cyclooxygenase and/or cytochrome P450 pathways to yield eicosanoids that mediate biological effects. To evaluate the contributions of these metabolic pathways, VSMCs were treated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, the lipoxygenase inhibitor cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-a-cyanocinnamate, or the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole for 30 min followed by stimulation with 20 μm AA. Indomethacin (20 μm) effectively inhibited 6-keto prostaglandin F1α production stimulated by exogenous AA in VSMCs (data not shown) and did not significantly stimulate MKP-1 induction (Fig.3, upper panel). Two other inhibitors did not stimulate MKP-1 production at doses known to abrogate eicosanoid biosynthesis in mammalian cells (36Civan M.M. Coca-Prados M. Peterson-Yantorno K. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2876-2886PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hata Y. Ota S. Nagata T. Uehara Y. Terano A. Sugimoto T. Prostaglandins. 1993; 45: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Capdevila J.

These inhibitors did not block the MKP-1 induction in AA-stimulated VSMCs but moderately enhanced this induction (Fig. 3). There is evidence that ketoconazole could effectively block ERK activation and calcium mobilization, but not JNK/SAPK activation, after AA stimulation (27Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3771-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 39Madhun Z.T. Goldthwait D.A. McKay D. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggested that AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction in VSMCs did not require subsequent eicosanoid biosynthesis. Early studies demonstrated that AA activates PKC (40Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Shearman M.S. Ase K. Sekiguchi K. Naor Z. Ido M. Nishizuka Y. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Philos. Trans. R.

J. 1989; 258: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the PKC agonists PMA induces MKP-1 gene expression in several cell types. To determine whether PKC mediates AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction in VSMCs, PKC was either depleted by exposing VSMCs to 1 μm PMA for 24 h or inhibited by incubating the cells with calphostin C before AA stimulation. PMA pretreatment did not reduce MKP-1 or mRNA levels but enhanced the induction by AA (Fig.4). Similar findings were obtained with the PKC specific inhibitor, calphostin C, i.e. no significant inhibition of AA-induced expression (Fig. 4). Together, these results indicate that the AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction is independent of PKC. Because it has been demonstrated that AA stimulation results in superoxide generation, independent of PKC, in phagocytes (42Henderson L.M. Moule S.K. Chappell J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 43Sakata A. Ida E. Tominaga M. Onoue K. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4353-4359PubMed Google Scholar) and VSMCs (44Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar), we assessed whether AA-induced MKP-1 expression was mediated by released free radicals via AA-activated NADPH oxidase. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, shown to be a superoxide anion scavenger, blocked H2O2-induced ERK activation in HeLa cells (45Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). When N-acetylcysteine was added to the culture with adjusting pH of the medium, AA-stimulated MKP-1 production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). More than 50% of AA-stimulated protein induction was inhibited at a concentration of 40 mm(Fig. 5, A and B), whereas 20 mmabolished the MKP-1 mRNA induction by AA (Fig. 5, C andD). Moreover, VSMCs treated with H2O2 resulted in MKP-1 gene expression and MKP-1 induction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6), supporting the involvement of a redox mechanism of MKP-1 induction.Figure 6H2O2 stimulates MKP-1 induction. Panel A, Western blot analysis for the induction of MKP-1 by H2O2. After treatment with H2O2 in the indicated concentrations for 1 h, VSMCs were harvested for protein extracts and Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, Northern blot analysis for MKP-1 mRNA expression. Quiescent VSMCs were treated with H2O2 at 37 °C for 30 min and harvested for RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The lower panel shows 28 S and 18 S RNA.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, we pretreated VSMCs with genistein or herbimycin A to inhibit different types of tyrosine kinases. As shown in Fig.7, genistein treatment completely blocked AA-stimulated MKP-1 induction of both proteins and mRNA in VSMCs, whereas herbimycin A had a moderate influence in this induction (Fig.7). In addition, genistein alone stimulated a modicum of MKP-1 mRNA induction in VSMCs (Fig. 7 D), although the mechanism of this induction remains unknown. Our data support the involvement of genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases in AA-induced MKP-1 expression. Both ERK and JNK/SAPK can be activated by AA (25Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E.

Native u-PA purified from urine induced a mitogenic response in quiescent IF6 and M14 cells that ranged from 25 to 40% of the mitogenic response obtained by fetal calf serum. The half-maximum response in M14 and IF6 cells was reached at u-PA concentrations of approximately 35 and 60 nm, respectively. Blocking the proteolytic activity of u-PA resulted in a 30% decrease of the mitogenic effect, whereas inhibition of plasmin activity did not alter the mitogenic effect. No mitogenic response was elicited by low molecular weight u-PA, lacking the growth factor domain and the kringle domain. The ATF domain of u-PA induced a mitogenic response that was similar to complete u-PA. Defucosylated ATF and recombinant u-PA purified from Escherichia coli lacking all post-translational modifications did not induce a mitogenic response. Blocking the interaction of u-PA with u-PAR, using a specific monoclonal antibody, did not alter the mitogenic effect induced by u-PA. The binding of radiolabeled u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells was characterized by high affinity binding mediated by u-PAR and low affinity binding to an unknown binding site. These results demonstrate that proteolytically inactive u-PA is able to induce a mitogenic response in quiescent melanoma cells in vitro by a mechanism that involves the ATF domain but is independent of high affinity binding to u-PAR.

Plasminogen activators are multi-domain serine proteases that are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (1Duffy M.J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolys. 1990; 1: 681-687PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schmitt M.

Two types of plasminogen activators have been described, tissue-type (t-PA) 1The abbreviations used are: t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; u-PAR, u-PA receptor; ATF, amino-terminal fragment; LMW u-PA, low molecular weight form of u-PA; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1. 1The abbreviations used are: t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; u-PAR, u-PA receptor; ATF, amino-terminal fragment; LMW u-PA, low molecular weight form of u-PA; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1. and urokinase-type (u-PA) plasminogen activator. Both t-PA and u-PA contain a serine-protease catalytic domain and are able to activate plasminogen into plasmin by proteolytic cleavage and are secreted from various cell types in the single chain form. Whereas single chain t-PA is an active enzyme, single chain u-PA is a pro-enzyme and is activated by plasmin cleavage resulting in two-chain u-PA. Further limited plasmic degradation of two-chain u-PA results in the release of the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of u-PA and the formation of a low molecular weight form of u-PA (LMW u-PA) that contains the fully active catalytic domain. u-PA and t-PA both have a growth factor domain in the amino-terminal part of the molecule. This growth factor domain is structurally similar to the receptor binding region of epidermal growth factor and is involved in the binding of u-PA to a high affinity cell surface receptor (5Vassalli J.-D. Baccino D. Belin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This u-PA receptor (u-PAR) was cloned (6Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R.

Previously it was demonstrated that u-PA bound to its cellular receptor u-PAR could contribute to the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma cells (22Quax P.H.A. van Muijen G.N.P.

In this study we focus on the signal transduction properties of u-PA on melanoma cells and the possible involvement of u-PAR. We demonstrate that u-PA has a mitogenic effect on two human melanoma cell lines and that this effect is independent of binding to u-PAR. Antigen levels of u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 were determined in culture medium by enzyme immunoassays (22Quax P.H.A. van Muijen G.N.P. Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Lund L.R. Danø K. Ruiter D.J. Verheijen J.H.

Native u-PA purified from urine (Serono, Coinsins, Switzerland), recombinant u-PA purified from Escherichia coli (a gift from Dr. Günzler, Grünenthal, Germany) and LMW u-PA containing amino acids 136–411 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. DFP (Sigma) dissolved in dry isopropanol (0.1 m) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The u-PA solutions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h at 4 °C, and the u-PA activity was measured using the synthetic substrate S-2444 (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) as described by the manufacturers. The catalytic activity of DFP-treated native u-PA and recombinant u-PA preparations was less than 0.1% of the original activity, whereas DFP-treated LMW u-PA demonstrated a residual activity of approximately 5%. Human M14 (26Katano M. Saxton R.E. Cochran A.J. Irie R.F. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1984; 108: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and IF6 (27Van Muijen G.N.P. Cornelissen I.M.A.H.

Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar) melanoma cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% air for 72–96 h. Prior to mitogenic experiments, cells were detached from the culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) by incubation with 0.05% (w/v) EDTA followed by the addition of 5 volumes of DMEM/FCS. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 250 × g and subsequently suspended in DMEM/FCS to a concentration of 105 cells/ml. One ml of these suspensions was added to 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The wells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM medium and incubated for 20 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated by replacing the serum-free medium by 1.0 ml of serum-free DMEM containing urine-derived u-PA, recombinant u-PA, t-PA purified from melanoma cells (28Kluft C. van Wezel A.L. van der Velden C.A.M.

Maximum mitogenic stimulation was achieved by adding DMEM containing 5% FCS to the cells, whereas the basal level of [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by incubation with serum-free DMEM medium. The effect of 100 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml Trasylol (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany), 10 μg/ml anti u-PAR monoclonal antibody H2 (a gift from Dr. U. Weidle, Boehringer Mannheim, Penzberg, Germany), and 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma) was measured by preincubation of the cells with these components for 30 min before u-PA was added. Cells were stimulated with the mitogenic agonists for 22 h at 37 °C and labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/well for the last 5 h. After stimulation the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in 1.0 ml of 1 mNaOH, and the [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured. The mitogenic effect of the different agonists was expressed as a percentage of the mitogenic effect that was induced by 5% FCS and was calculated as described earlier (15Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P.

Urine-derived u-PA and recombinant u-PA were radiolabeled with Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the iodogen method (Pierce) resulting in a specific activity of 0.77 and 1.9 mCi/nmol, respectively. Binding was performed on 70–90% confluent cells in 24-well tissue culture plates that were cultured in serum-free DMEM medium containing 0.05% human serum albumin (Bio Products Laboratory, Elstree, UK) for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated on ice for 1 h in serum free-medium or serum-free medium supplemented with anti u-PAR mAb H2 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml.125I-Labeled u-PA was mixed with different amounts of the corresponding unlabeled u-PA and added to the cells to give final concentrations that ranged from 0.3 to 200 nm. The cells were incubated on ice for 2 h and subsequently washed two times with serum-free culture medium containing 0.05% human serum albumin and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were dissolved in 0.2 m NaOH, and the radioactivity bound to the cells was measured. Specific binding to the cells was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific adsorption of radiolabeled u-PA to the tissue culture plates, which was measured for each u-PA concentration used. The mRNA expression levels of t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, and u-PAR were determined in M14 and IF6 cells, which were cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h. The mRNA levels of the proliferation markers c-fos and c-myc were determined in M14 and IF6 cells that were cultured as described under “mitogenic experiments” except that no [3H]thymidine was added. Total RNA was extracted as described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62872) Google Scholar), and 10 μg was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% (w/v) denaturing agarose gel containing 0.75% (w/v) formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham) using a Vacugene system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cDNA fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham) using the random primer method (Multiprime, Amersham), and membranes were hybridized with 1 ng of32P-labeled cDNA/ml in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 7% (w/v) SDS and 10 mm EDTA at 65 °C and subsequently washed twice with 2× SSC containing 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Fuji Phosphor-imager screens for 16–48 h, and relative intensities of the bands were quantified by a Fuji Bas 1000 Phosphor-imager. Neither cell line demonstrated detectable expression of u-PA and PAI-1 mRNA in the cells (Fig.1 A), and no u-PA or PAI-1 antigen was found in the culture medium after 24 h (TableI). In contrast both cell lines showed high expression of t-PA mRNA (Fig. 1 A), and t-PA antigen amounted to 600–700 ng in culture medium after 24 h of 106 M14 cells and IF6 cells. Northern blotting and cross-linking experiments demonstrated that both M14 and IF6 cells expressed similar amounts of u-PAR mRNA (Fig. 1 A) and u-PAR antigen on the cell surface (Fig. 1 B).Table IAntigen levels of u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 in M14 and IF6 cellsM14IF6ngu-PA<0.1<0.1t-PA677623PAI-1<0.1<0.1u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 antigen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the 24-h culture medium of M14 and IF6 cells. The results are expressed as ng of protein synthesized in 24 h by 106 cells. Open table in a new tab u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 antigen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the 24-h culture medium of M14 and IF6 cells. The results are expressed as ng of protein synthesized in 24 h by 106 cells. The mitogenic effect in response to increasing u-PA concentrations on M14 and IF6 cells was determined by measuring the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation after a 22-h incubation period using u-PA purified from urine. The mitogenic effect of u-PA was expressed as a percentage of the effect obtained by incubation with 5% v/v FCS. The increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation after stimulation of the cells with 5% FCS was approximately 4–6-fold as compared with unstimulated cells. Native u-PA elicited a mitogenic response in both M14 and IF6 cells reaching half-maximum stimulation of DNA synthesis at u-PA concentrations of approximately 35 and 60 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The maximum response in M14 was 30–40% of the mitogenic response obtained with FCS, whereas the maximum response in IF6 cells was 25–30% of the FCS response. To determine whether plasmin activity was involved in the mitogenic effect observed with u-PA, the plasmin inhibitor Trasylol® was added 30 min prior to the addition of u-PA and was present in the medium during the 16-h incubation period with u-PA. The addition of Trasylol® had no effect on the mitogenic stimulus of u-PA (Fig.3), demonstrating that plasmin activity did not contribute to the mitogenic effect induced by u-PA on M14 and IF6 cells. These results suggest that the growth factor-like properties of u-PA are independent of its plasminogen activating properties. To confirm this, t-PA was also tested for its ability to elicit a mitogenic response in the M14 and IF6 cells. In contrast to u-PA, the addition of up to 200 nm of t-PA did not show any mitogenic effect on these cells (Fig. 1). This indicates that the mitogenic effect on M14 and IF6 cells is specific for u-PA and is independent of plasminogen activation. To determine whether u-PA activity per se was involved in the mitogenic effect we used DFP-treated u-PA that had less than 0.1% of its original enzymatic activity. The mitogenic signal in M14 and IF6 cells decreased approximately 31 and 36%, respectively (Fig. 3), indicating that a part of the mitogenic signal was dependent on u-PA activity, whereas the major part of the mitogenic effect was independent of the enzymatic activity of u-PA. LMW u-PA that lacks the growth factor domain and the Kringle domain but contains the full proteolytic activity of u-PA had no mitogenic effect at all (Fig. 4). Purified ATF domain of u-PA, containing the growth factor domain and Kringle domain but lacking any proteolytic activity, induced a mitogenic response that was similar to that of intact native u-PA. To determine whether post-translational modifications were involved in the mitogenic effects observed in the M14 and IF6 cells, a defucosylated form of ATF and a recombinant form of u-PA lacking all post-translational modifications were used. Both had no mitogenic effect on M14 and IF6 cells (Fig. 4), indicating that post-translational processing of u-PA was essential to the mitogenic effect observed in M14 and IF6 cells. The addition of a 5-fold molar excess of recombinant u-PA over native u-PA resulted in a decrease of the mitogenic effect of native u-PA in both M14 and IF6 cells (Fig.5). A 5-fold molar excess of DFP-treated LMW u-PA did not influence the mitogenic effect of native u-PA (Fig.5). This indicates that recombinant u-PA is capable of competing with native u-PA for the interactions, mediated by the ATF domain, that are involved in the signal transduction pathways. Because the mitogenic effect of u-PA on M14 and IF6 cells is largely independent of its enzymatic activity, is mediated by the ATF domain, and therefore most likely involves the interaction with a cell surface receptor, we determined whether the high affinity binding of u-PA to u-PAR was pivotal to mitogenesis induced by u-PA. The mitogenic effect of u-PA on M14 and IF6 cells was measured in the presence of the anti-u-PAR mAb H2 that specifically blocks binding of u-PA to u-PAR. Surprisingly, the results of these experiments show that the mitogenic effect of u-PA on the M14 and IF6 cells was not affected by the presence of mAb H2 (Fig. 6), indicating that the mitogenic effect is not mediated by u-PA-u-PAR interaction. Binding of the mAb H2 antibody to u-PAR in the absence of u-PA did not induce any mitogenic signal. The binding to M14 and IF6 melanoma cells of DFP-treated u-PA was measured in the presence and absence of the anti-u-PAR mAb H2 to confirm that this antibody completely blocked the high affinity binding to u-PAR. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that the binding of DFP-treated u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells in the absence of anti-u-PAR mAb H2 was characterized by a biphasic Scatchard plot (Fig.7). This is in agreement with the presence of two different classes of binding sites on the M14 and IF6 cells. The high affinity binding site on M14 cells has aK d of ∼1.5 nm and approximately 5 × 104 binding sites/cell, and the low affinity binding site is characterized by a K d of ∼90 nm and 3 × 105 binding sites/cell. The binding to IF6 cells was very similar to that of M14 cells with a high affinity K d of ∼1 nm and ∼6 × 104 binding sites/cell, whereas the low affinity binding site on IF6 cells had a K d of ∼70 nmwith ∼4 × 105 binding sites/cell. Scatchard analysis of binding data in the presence of the anti-u-PAR mAb H2 demonstrated that the high affinity binding on both M14 and IF6 cells was completely blocked (Fig. 7), whereas the low affinity binding was not affected, thus proving that the high affinity binding of u-PA to these cells is due to interaction with u-PAR and that the low affinity binding is not mediated by u-PAR. The binding of recombinant u-PA treated with DFP on M14 and IF6 cells was similar to the binding of DFP-treated native u-PA to these cells (data not shown) and was characterized by a high affinity K d of ∼1.8 nm and a low affinity K d of ∼70 nm in M14 cells, whereas for IF6 cellsK d values were ∼1.0 nm and ∼50 nm for high and low affinity binding, respectively. This indicates that the post-translational modifications in native u-PA did not influence the binding of u-PA to both cell types. Previously it was shown that mRNA levels of the proliferation markers c-fos and c-myc are induced in OC-7 cells in response to u-PA (17Kanse S.M. Kost C. Benzakour O. Kanthou C. Kost C. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2848-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.-D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was also the case in M14 and IF6 cells, mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting after different periods of incubation with u-PA. The addition of u-PA to both M14 and IF6 cells did not increase c-fos mRNA levels. In these experiments we found that c-fos mRNA expression is extremely sensitive to changes in the composition of the culture medium, e.g. the addition of as little as 10% fresh medium without any mitogenic agonist increased the c-fos mRNA approximately 3-fold in M14 and IF6 cells. c-myc mRNA was increased approximately 2-fold in M14 cells and 1.2-fold in IF6 cells by the addition of u-PA. To determine the involvement of G-proteins in the signal transduction pathway induced by u-PA, pertussis toxin was added to M14 and IF6 cells prior to stimulation by u-PA. The mitogenic effect of DFP-treated u-PA on both M14 and IF6 cells was completely blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig. 8), indicating that a cell surface receptor linked to G-proteins was involved. Using [3H]thymidine incorporation as a measure for DNA synthesis, we demonstrated that the multi-domain serine protease u-PA has a mitogenic effect on two human melanoma cells in vitro. These results are in agreement with reports that demonstrated the induction of mitogenesis by u-PA in neural cells (32Baron-Van Evercooren A. LePrince P. Rogister B. Lefebre P.P. Delree P. Selak I.

Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 208-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The structural and functional characteristics of u-PA that are pivotal to the mitogenic properties of this protease vary between the different studies that have been reported and are most likely related to the different cell types studied. Our results demonstrate that the mitogenic effect of u-PA on the melanoma cells M14 and IF6 is not mediated by plasmin formation. Blocking u-PA activityper se resulted in a 30–35% decrease of the mitogenic effect, which might be related to the proteolytic activation of inactive growth factors as transforming growth factor-β (33Odekon L.E. Blasi F. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or hepatocyte growth factor (34Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) by u-PA. However, the major pathway that leads to induction of DNA synthesis by u-PA in M14 and IF6 cells is independent of u-PA activity. Both the activity-dependent and -independent mitogenic effect are mediated through the ATF domain, suggesting that the binding of u-PA to u-PAR is involved. Moreover, the involvement of u-PAR in signal transduction by u-PA leading to a mitogenic effect has been either proven (16De Petro G. Copeta A. Barlati S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or suggested (15Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I. Henkin J. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14151-14156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously. Surprisingly, blocking of the u-PA high affinity binding site on u-PAR, with a specific monoclonal antibody, did not change the mitogenic response induced by u-PA in M14 and IF6 cells. This indicates that the mitogenic effect of u-PA in these cells is not mediated by high affinity binding to u-PAR. The fact that the mitogenic effect of u-PA on M14 and IF6 cells is independent of both u-PA activity and binding to the high affinity binding site on u-PAR suggests that u-PA is able to interact with the cell surface of these cells by an alternative mechanism. Binding experiments demonstrated that the binding of u-PA to the melanoma cells M14 and IF6 was characterized by the presence of a high affinity binding site and a low affinity binding site. The binding of u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells, with a K d of 1–1.5 nm, was mediated by the high affinity binding site on u-PAR, whereas the low affinity binding with a K d of 70–90 nm was not. This suggests that the low affinity binding of u-PA to the cell surface could be involved in the mitogenic effect instead of the high affinity binding mediated by u-PAR. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that half-maximum stimulation of DNA synthesis was observed at u-PA concentrations of approximately 35 and 60 nm, values that are compatible with aK d of 70–90 nm as measured for the low affinity binding on M14 and IF6 cells. The low affinity u-PA binding site on M14 and IF6 cells has not yet been characterized and could consist of a novel membrane protein or of a complex between u-PAR and additional proteins creating a secondary low affinity binding site on u-PAR. The characteristics of the low affinity binding of u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells are very similar to the ones reported for binding to platelets (35Vaughan D.E. Van Houtte E. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 4: 141-146Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Jiang Y. Pannel R. Liu J.-N. Gurewich V. Blood. 1996; 87: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently smooth muscle cells were found to have a mitogenic response to u-PA by a mechanism presumably independent of u-PAR (17Kanse S.M. Kost C. Benzakour O. Kanthou C. Kost C. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2848-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the presence of an unidentified u-PA binding protein on the cell surface of smooth muscle cells was suggested. The maximum stimulation on smooth muscle cells was reached at concentrations of u-PA in the same order of magnitude as observed in the melanoma cells. This indicates that the K d of the binding that is responsible for the mitogenic effect is similar in smooth muscle cells and in M14 and IF6 cells. Whether low affinity u-PA binding to platelets, smooth muscle cells, and melanoma cells is mediated by the same protein is still unknown. The fucosyl group linked to threonine 18 in the ATF domain of u-PA is needed to elicit mitogenesis in the M14 and IF6 cells but is not involved in the binding of u-PA to these cells. These results are compatible with the findings that in SaOs2 cells the mitogenic effect of u-PA was also dependent on the fucosyl group (15Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I. Henkin J. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14151-14156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the binding of u-PA was independent of this post-translational modification. The possibility exists that the fucosyl group by itself is able to induce a mitogenic effect and that u-PA functions merely as a carrier or presenter of the fucosyl group. However, t-PA, carrying an identical fucosyl group attached to a threonine residue (37Harris R.J. Leonard C.K. Guzzetta A.W. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2311-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that is surrounded by amino acids similar to the ones that surround the fucosylated threonine residue in u-PA, does not induce any mitogenic effect in M14 and IF6 cells at a concentration up to 200 nm. This indicates that both the u-PA protein moiety and the fucosyl group are essential for the induction of mitogenic stimuli in M14 and IF6 cells. The pathway of signal transduction that is induced by u-PA and the changes in cellular phenotype or response to these signals show a high degree of diversity in the different cell types. In M14 and IF6 cells the pathway of signal transduction induced by u-PA involves G-proteins, indicating that the unknown binding protein on the cell surface could be a G-protein-linked receptor. No changes in the mRNA levels of c-fos were observed in M14 and IF6 cells after incubation with u-PA, which is different from the results obtained with OC-7 cells (31Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.-D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (17Kanse S.M. Kost C. Benzakour O. Kanthou C. Kost C. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2848-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In conclusion, proteolytic inactive u-PA is able to induce a mitogenic response in quiescent human melanoma cells in vitro, which is independent of u-PA binding to the classical u-PA receptor. Low affinity binding of u-PA to the cell membrane of the melanoma cells suggests that u-PA-induced signal transduction could be mediated by a hitherto unidentified membrane-associated protein. Studies are in progress to establish the identity of this new u-PA binding protein and to determine whether these mitogenic properties of u-PA contribute to the aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells in vivo. We thank Dr. Weidle for supplying the anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibody, Dr. Günzler for the recombinant u-PA, and Drs. Mazar and Henkin for ATF and defucosylated ATF."
https://openalex.org/W2016524636,"The efflux of protons through a H+ channel acts as the charge compensation pathway for the electrogenic generation of superoxide (O⨪2) by human neutrophil NADPH oxidase. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal 230 amino acids of the product of the X-linked chronic granulomatous gene gp91phox contain all that is required for it to function as the arachidonate-activable, NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel (Henderson, L. M., Thomas, S., Banting, G., and Chappell, J. B. (1997) Biochem. J. 325, 701–705). To identify functionally important amino acids, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were constructed that expressed point mutations in the N terminus of gp91phox. No H+ flux was observed in CHO cell lines expressing the N-terminal gp91phox mutants H111L, H115L, and H119L, or H115L, or H115K. Partial retention of H+ channel function was, however, observed in the H115D CHO cell line. The addition of arachidonic acid to R91E,R92E CHO cells elicited a full H+ channel response. The buffering capacity and response of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein to H+ were the same in all cell lines. Therefore, it can be concluded that His-115 is important to the ability of gp91phoxto function as the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel and that the mechanism of H+ conduction involves protonation and deprotonation of an amino acid with an appropriate pKvalue. The efflux of protons through a H+ channel acts as the charge compensation pathway for the electrogenic generation of superoxide (O⨪2) by human neutrophil NADPH oxidase. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal 230 amino acids of the product of the X-linked chronic granulomatous gene gp91phox contain all that is required for it to function as the arachidonate-activable, NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel (Henderson, L. M., Thomas, S., Banting, G., and Chappell, J. B. (1997) Biochem. J. 325, 701–705). To identify functionally important amino acids, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were constructed that expressed point mutations in the N terminus of gp91phox. No H+ flux was observed in CHO cell lines expressing the N-terminal gp91phox mutants H111L, H115L, and H119L, or H115L, or H115K. Partial retention of H+ channel function was, however, observed in the H115D CHO cell line. The addition of arachidonic acid to R91E,R92E CHO cells elicited a full H+ channel response. The buffering capacity and response of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein to H+ were the same in all cell lines. Therefore, it can be concluded that His-115 is important to the ability of gp91phoxto function as the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel and that the mechanism of H+ conduction involves protonation and deprotonation of an amino acid with an appropriate pKvalue. An integral membrane component of the NADPH oxidase, gp91phox (phagocyte oxidase), has previously been demonstrated to function as the oxidase-associated H+ channel (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) generates superoxide (O⨪2) as part of the cellular immune response of the body. Electrons, donated by cytosolic NADPH, are utilized by the oxidase to perform the single electron reduction of O2 to O⨪2 (an oxygen free radical) on the external face of the membrane. The activity of the NADPH oxidase has been shown to be electrogenic (2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Schrenzel J. Serrander L. Banfi B. Nusse O. Fouyouzi R. Lew D. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and is associated with a rapid depolarization of the membrane potential (ΔΨ = −60 to −15 mV) (2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and a slight fall in pHi (4Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that an efflux of H+ ions (oxidation of NADPH) through a channel provides the necessary charge compensation for the activity of the oxidase and prevents a large and rapid fall in pHi (2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 4Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This H+ conduction pathway is termed the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel (5Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pHi of unactivated phagocytes, like that of most eukaryotic cells, is between pH 7.3 and 7.4. Therefore, the membrane of phagocytes is relatively impermeable to H+ ions, i.e. the channel is normally closed. Henderson and Chappell (5Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have previously shown that, like the oxidase itself, the channel is opened following the addition of arachidonic acid (AA). 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid (sodium salt); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid (sodium salt); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin. In the presence of AA, the direction of H+ flux is dictated by the proton-motive force (Δp (ΔΨ − RTIn[H+]o/F[H+]i)).Patients with chronic granulomatous disease are highly susceptible to infection. This has been demonstrated to be due to an inherited inability of their phagocytes to generate O⨪2 (6Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Åhlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the genetic lesions found in chronic granulomatous disease patients has demonstrated that the NADPH oxidase is composed of at least four proteins: a heteromeric, integral membrane cytochromeb 558 (gp91phox and p22phox) and two cytosolic proteins, p47phox and p67phox (6Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Åhlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, additional proteins have been proposed to contribute to the functioning of the oxidase: a small GTP-binding protein, Rac2 (7Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar,8Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and an additional cytosolic protein, p40phox, with sequence similarities to both p47phox and p67phox (9Wientjes F.B.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Assembly of an active oxidase involves the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to the membrane, where they interact with the cytochrome b, forming a functional oxidase.Through the use of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocyte cell lines from chronic granulomatous disease patients and the construction of a stable CHO cell line, Henderson et al. (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that gp91phox, the product of the X-linked chronic granulomatous disease gene (11Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Bachner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), functions as the AA-activable, NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel. The hydropathy plot for gp91phox (11Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Bachner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggests that the protein contains multiple (four to six) transmembrane domains located at the N terminus and a large hydrophilic C-terminal domain that contains the predicted FAD- and NADPH-binding sites and is therefore assumed to be on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Henderson et al. (12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal 230 amino acids of gp91phox (gp91N) contains all that is required for the protein to function as the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel.The mutagenesis of amino acids, both man-made and inherited, has been used to investigate and identify functionally important amino acid residues in a range of proteins and multiprotein complexes, including ion transporters, carriers, and channels. For example, the selectivity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel has been reported to be altered from Ca2+ to Na+ by the mutation of two Glu residues to either Gln or Lys in the predicted mouth of the channel (13Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien E.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The flux of H+ ions associated with the activity of the NADH:NADPH transhydrogenase is absent when His-91 is changed to Ser, Thr, or Cys (14Holmberg E. Olausson T. Hultman T. Rydström J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7691-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this paper, the measurement of the AA-activated H+ flux in CHO cell lines expressing point mutations in gp91phox identifies His-115 as an amino acid important to the functioning of the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo understand the mechanism(s) by which the N-terminal 230 amino acids of gp91phox act as a pathway for the conduction of H+ ions, I attempted to identify regions and individual amino acids that are required for function. The amino acid sequence of gp91phox does not hold a high degree of similarity to any other protein, and the very high degree of homology between different species (20Dinauer M.C. Orkin S.H. Brown R. Jesaitis A.J. Parkos C.A. Nature. 1987; 327: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Teahan C. Rowe P. Parker P. Totty N. Segal A.W.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) makes it nearly impossible to identify conserved and, by implication, important residues. However, amino acids implicated in H+ conduction by other types of ion transporter have been described. The conduction through F0 of the F0F1-ATPase has been described as requiring an acidic residue (Asp or Glu) located within a hydrophobic sequence of amino acids. Similarly, an Asp residue has been implicated in H+ transfer in cytochromebo 3-ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli (24Garcia-Horsman J.A. Puustinen A. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4428-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The conduction of H+ ions into the endosome by the M2 coat protein of the influenza A virus is important to the uncoating of the virus and its subsequent infection of the cell. Within the single transmembrane domain of this protein, Ser-31 and His-37 have been demonstrated to be important in pH-dependent activation and the conduction of H+ ions (25Sansom M.S.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys.

Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Similarly, βHis-91 (His-664 in the bovine enzyme) plays an important role in the proton pumping associated with the activity of the nicotinamide-nucleotide transhydrogenase from mitochondria (14Holmberg E. Olausson T. Hultman T. Rydström J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7691-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Within the N-terminal fragment of gp91phox, no candidate acidic residue located in hydrophobic sequence could be identified; however, three histidines (residues 111, 115, and 119) predicted to be contained within a transmembrane domain were identified. I therefore investigated the role of these three histidine residues in the functioning of the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel.Cellular Expression of N-terminal MutantsA CHO cell line was constructed in which His-111, His-115, and His-119 where all mutated to Leu (CHO-N3Leu). The expression of the protein was driven by an inducible metallothionein promoter (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Reaves B. Banting G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with a HA epitope tag included at the C terminus of the protein to assist determination of expression and cellular localization (12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 a, anti-HA antibody detected a prominent broad band running at an apparent meridian molecular mass of 37.5 kDa in CHO-N3Leu cells treated with Cd2+. That this expression is regulated is demonstrated by the lower intensity of this protein band detected in CHO-N3Leu cells in the absence of Cd2+ (Fig. 1 a). The molecular mass of 37.5 kDa is higher than that of 26.9 kDa predicted from the sequence of 230 amino acids plus 39 for the epitope tag. However, gp91phox is a highly glycosylated protein traveling as a broad band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the high molecular mass and the broad appearance of the band suggest that this mutated N-terminal gp91phox may be partially glycosylated in these cells. Immunostaining of Cd2+-treated CHO-N3Leu cells with anti-HA antibody gave an annular pattern of fluorescence when imaged on a confocal microscope (Fig. 1 b, panel i), which was not observed in CHO-N3Leu cells not treated with Cd2+(panel ii) and in untransfected CHO cells (panel iii). This pattern of staining is similar to those already observed for CHO cells expressing full-length gp91phox (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and just the N-terminal 230 amino acids (12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and implies that the expressed antigen is located at or in the plasma membrane of the cell. From the facts that the protein is expressed, is probably glycosylated, and is located at the plasma membrane of the cell, I suggest that the introduced mutations have not resulted in a major disruption of the folding and three-dimensional structure of the protein. All CHO cell lines constructed demonstrated an annular pattern of immunostaining when observed on the confocal microscope.AA-activable H+ Channel Activity in CHO-N3Leu CellsThe flux of H+ ions was monitored as a change in pHi as recorded by the fluorescent pH-sensitive indicator BCECF. In Na+ medium, a strong inward Δp is established following the addition of valinomycin (ΔΨ-negative) and Hepes (pHo < pHi) (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing non-mutated N-terminal gp91phox (CHO-N) demonstrated a rapid fall in pHi upon the addition of AA, as described previously (12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicative of an influx of H+ ions (Fig.2 a). The addition of AA to CHO-N3Leu cells treated with Cd2+ failed to elicit the expected fall in pHi (Fig. 2 b). However, the predicted fall in pHi was observed following the addition of the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 2 b). The level of response observed in CHO-N3Leu cells was comparable to that observed in untransfected control CHO cells (Fig. 2 c) and previously reported (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the failure to observe an AA-activated H+ flux in CHO-N3Leu cells suggests that the mutation of His-111, His-115, and His-119 to Leu severely inhibits the ability of the N terminus of gp91phox to function as a H+conduction pathway.Figure 2Arachidonate-induced pHichanges in CHO-N, CHO-N3Leu, CHO-NLeu, and CHO cells.The cells suspended in Na+ medium in the presence of 2.7 μm valinomycin (Val) and 5 mmHepes (pHo 6.8) were exposed to an inward Δp favoring the influx of H+. The arachidonate (8 μm)-induced changes in pHi were monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures” in CHO-N (a), CHO-N3Leu (b), CHO-NLeu (c), and untransfected control CHO (d) cells. 53 μm CCCP was added where indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It could be argued that the inhibition of conduction through the H+ channel observed in CHO-N3Leu cells was the consequence of alterations to the folding of the local region of the protein due to the replacement of three positively charged amino acids with hydrophobic uncharged substitutes. To further investigate the role of histidine residues in the H+ channel and in attempt to minimize disruption to the protein folding, I mutated only the central of the three histidines (His-115) to leucine. The resulting CHO cell line (CHO-NLeu), when treated with Cd2+, failed to demonstrate a rapid fall in pHi following the addition of AA to cells suspended in Na+ medium (Fig. 2 d). As shown in Fig. 2 d, the addition of AA elicited a slightly greater acidification response in CHO-NLeu compared with CHO-N3Leu cells under the same assay conditions (Fig. 2 b), suggesting that CHO-NLeu cells express a small residual H+ channel activity. However, the sharp contrast in response to that observed in CHO-N cells (non-mutated) indicates that the introduction of H115L severely reduces that ability of the N terminus of gp91phox to function as a H+ conduction pathway.Mutation to Restore H+ ConductionIf His-115 plays a direct role in the ability of gp91phox to conduct H+ ions, it should be possible to introduce a substitute that retains the ability of the protein to function. It could be suggested that the amino acid residue(s) involved must be capable of both accepting and donating H+ ions across a membrane at physiological pH. The side chain of histidine, consisting of an imidazole ring with a pK of 6.5 (in solution), is therefore well suited for the role. The side chain of aspartic acid has a pK of 4.5 for its negatively charged carboxyl group (COO−), whereas that of lysine has a positively charge (NH3+) amino group that has a pK of 10. To investigate the contribution of pKand/or the charge of the side chain to the ability of gp91phoxto function as a H+ channel, I constructed two CHO cell lines: N-terminal gp91phox H115D (CHO-NAsp) and N-terminal gp91phox H115K (CHO-NLys). The conduction of H+ions in both CHO-NAsp and CHO-NLys cells was assessed. Following the addition of AA to CHO-NAsp cells, a fall in pHi was observed (Fig. 3 a), indicative of an AA-activated influx of H+ ions. The extent of the acidification observed in CHO-NAsp cells (Fig. 3 a) was greater than that observed in either CHO-N3Leu or in CHO-NLeu cells (Fig. 2, b and d), but smaller than that observed in cells expressing the non-mutated N-terminal fragment (Fig.2 a). The full pHi response was observed following the addition of CCCP (Fig. 3 a). Therefore, the N-terminal fragment in which Asp is substituted for His-115 results in a protein that is partially capable of functioning as a H+ conduction pathway. From the failure to observe a similar AA-induced acidification in CHO-NLys cells (His to Lys) (Fig.3 b), it can be concluded that the substitution of histidine with an alternative positively charged amino acid is insufficient to facilitate H+ conduction. Therefore, the retention of activity observed in CHO-NAsp cells (Fig. 3 a) is probably determined by the pK value and not by the charge or form of the amino acid side chain.Figure 3Arachidonate-induced pHichanges in CHO-NAsp and CHO-NLys cells. pHichanges were monitored in BCECF-loaded CHO-NAsp (a) and CHO-NLys (b) cells suspended in Na+ medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 53 μm CCCP was added where indicated. CHO-NLys cells (c) suspended in K+ medium were exposed to an outward Δp favoring the efflux of H+ ions (2.7 μm valinomycin (Val) and 5 mm Tris (pHo 8.2)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An efflux of H+ ions (rise in pHi) following the addition of AA has previously been reported for both CHO-91 cells (expressing full-length gp91phox) and CHO-N cells suspended in K+ medium in the presence of valinomycin and Tris (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no efflux of H+ ions was observed in CHO-NLys cells (Fig. 5 c), CHO-NLeu cells (data not shown), and CHO-N3Leu cells (data not shown). The expected rise in pHi was observed in all cases following the addition of CCCP. Therefore, point mutations of His-115 restrict both the arachidonate-activated efflux and influx of H+ ions,i.e. conduction in both directions.Figure 5Buffering capacity of CHO cell lines.The response of pHi to the addition of NaAc was recorded in BCECF-loaded CHO-NLeu (a), CHO-NAsp (b), CHO-N (c), and CHO-NLys (d) cells suspended in Na+ medium. All cell lines were treated for 24 h with 10 μm Cd2+ prior to the assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Calibration of BCECF Response in All Cell TypesThe failure of some of the CHO cell lines to show a large fall in pHi despite the presence of AA and a large inward Δp could be argued to be due to differences in the properties of BCECF in the different cell lines. The failure to observe a response could also be accounted for by variations in the initial pHi of the different cell lines. This is unlikely, as the addition of CCCP elicited the fully expected pHi response in all cell lines (Figs. 2 and 3). However, to eliminate this possible explanation, the response of BCECF to pH was calibrated in CHO-NLeu, CHO-NAsp, CHO-NLys, and non-mutated control CHO-N cells. Fig. 4 ashows the response of BCECF-loaded CHO-NLys cells to changes in pH. The plot of the change in BCECF fluorescence versus pH (Fig. 4 b) for all four cell lines is very similar. All cell lines were observed to have an initial pHi similar to that shown for CHO-NLys cells: pH 7.32 (Fig. 4 a). Therefore, the failure to observe a response (Figs. 2 and 3) was not due to the acidity of the resting pHi or to alterations in the response of BCECF to pH.Figure 4Calibration of BCECF response in CHO cell lines. For cells suspended in K+ medium in the presence of nigericin (Nig; 10 μm), pHi = pHo. a, fluorescence response of BCECF-loaded CHO-NLys cells (treated for 24 h with 10 μm Cd2+) to changes in pHo following addition of HCl. b, a graph of the change in fluorescenceversus pHo (calibration curve) for BCECF loaded into CHO-N (small squares), CHO-NLeu (large squares), CHO-NAsp (stars), and CHO-NLys (diamonds) cells. All cell lines were treated for 24 h with 10 μmCd2+ prior to the assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Buffering CapacityAn increased capacity of CHO-N3Leu, CHO-NLeu, and CHO-NLys cells to buffer H+ ions could result in failure to observe H+ flux, i.e. AA induces an influx of H+ ions, but the cellular cytosol buffering obscures the change in pHi. As shown in Fig.5, CHO-NLeu, CHO-NLys, CHO-NAsp, and CHO-N cells all showed a similar fall in pHi in response to the addition of NaAc. Therefore, they all have a similar buffering capacity.R91E,R92E MutationThe mutations introduced above have altered amino acid charge. Therefore, I investigated whether the change of charge alone is sufficient to alter the ability of gp91phoxto conduct H+ ions. A CHO cell line with both Arg-91 and Arg-92 mutated to Glu was constructed (CHORR). The addition of AA to CHORR cells suspended in Na+ medium resulted in a large acidification of pHi (Fig.6 a), which was comparable to that observed for cells expressing non-mutated gp91phox (Fig.2 a) (1Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As efflux of H+ ions was observed in cells suspended in K+ medium, the H+ channel is functional in both directions (Fig. 6 b). Therefore, despite the major alteration in the charge of the amino acid side chains, there is no major change in the ability of gp91phox to act as a H+ conduction pathway.Figure 6Arachidonate-induced pHi changes in CHORR cells. pHi changes were monitored in BCECF-loaded CHORR cells suspended in either Na+ (a) or K+ (b) medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 2.7 μm valinomycin (Val), 5 mm Hepes, 5 mm Tris, 8 μm AA, and 53 μm CCCP were added where indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)I have demonstrated that mutation of His-111, His-115, and His-119 to Leu and of His-115 to Leu and to Lys significantly reduced the ability of the N-terminal fragment of gp91phox to function as the AA-activable H+ channel. In contrast, gp91phox in which His-115 was replaced with Asp retained some H+conduction. That gp91phox R91E,R92E retained a fully function H+ channel is indicative that not all alterations in amino acid charge alter function. Therefore, it can be concluded that His-115 is important to the ability of gp91phox to function as the AA-activable, NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel.CONCLUSIONSHenderson et al. (1Henderson L.M.

In this paper, I have demonstrated that to function as a H+ conduction pathway, the N-terminal fragment of gp91phox requires His-115. The expression of the protein(s) in response to Cd2+ and their observed cellular location at or within the plasma membrane strongly suggest that the mutations introduced in this paper do not drastically alter the folding and three-dimensional conformation of the protein(s), although this possibility cannot be completely eliminated. The identification, in this study, of a histidine residue as being important to the conduction of H+ ions across a membrane is in keeping with similar roles for histidine, previously described, in the mitochondrial transhydrogenase (14Holmberg E.

The three analogs efficiently inhibit melibiose transport and bind to MelB in a sodium-dependent fashion. Their dissociation constants (K d) are in the micromolar range in the presence of NaCl and an order of magnitude higher in its absence. In the presence of NaCl and Dns2-S-Gal, sample excitation at 335 or 297 nm gives rise to a fluorescent signal at around 465 nm, whereas Dns3-S-Gal or Dns6-S-Gal emits a fluorescence light at 490 or 506 nm, respectively. Detailed study of the Dns2-S-Gal signal elicited by a 297 nm illumination indicates that a tryptophan-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon is involved in the response. All fluorescence signals below 500 nm are prevented by addition of melibiose in excess, and the kinetic constants describing their dependence on the probe or NaCl concentrations closely correlate with the probe binding constants. Finally, the Dns2-S-Gal signal recorded in sodium-free medium is red shifted by up to 25 nm from that recorded in the presence of NaCl. Taken together, these results suggest (i) that the fluorescence signals below 500 nm arise from Dns-S-Gal molecules bound to MelB, (ii) the presence of a highly hydrophobic environment close to or at the sugar-binding site, the polarity of which increases on moving away from the sugar-binding site, and (iii) that the interaction of sodium ions with MelB enhances the hydrophobicity of this environment. These results are consistent with the induction of a cooperative change of the structure of the sugar-binding site or of its immediate vicinity by the ions.

It consists of 473 amino acids (molecular mass, 53 kDa), 70% of which are apolar (4Yazyu H. Shiota-Niiya S. Shimamoto T. Kanazawa H. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24883-24889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and studies of MelB chimeras (15Hama H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest that Na+, Li+, and H+ share a common binding site buried, at least in part, in the N-terminal membrane domain of the transporter. This site contains several acidic and polar residues that may be involved in the coordination of either monovalent ions or H3O+(rather than H+) (11Pourcher T. Zani M.L. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3209-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, intrinsic fluorescence studies of a purified His-tagged transporter suggest that cosubstrate binding induces cooperative modifications in MelB conformation (16Mus-Veteau I. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas MelB fluorescence emission is slightly quenched by the monovalent ions or moderately enhanced by adding the sugar in a sodium- or lithium-free medium, addition of both substrates induces a large fluorescence change. Subsequent studies have shown that Trp299 and Trp342, located on helices IX and X of MelB, respectively, contribute most of the α-galactoside-induced fluorescence signal increase (17Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One or more tryptophans from the N-terminal domain are also involved in the fluorescence response on adding a β-galactoside. Interestingly, the polarity of Trp299 or Trp342 environment decreases upon sugar binding, suggesting that they become less accessible to the solvent. Altogether, these data suggest that the structure of the sugar-binding site, hypothetically located in the C-terminal domain, is directly modified by the sugar and is further modified in a cooperative and indirect fashion upon the binding of the coupling ion to the N-terminal domain.Further insight into the cosubstrate-induced change of MelB structure can be obtained by probing more directly the sugar-binding site properties with sugar analogs carrying an appropriate reporter. Fluorescent galactosides, such as (N-dansyl)aminoalkyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosides (Dns-S-Gal), seem particularly suited as the dansyl fluorescence properties depend on solvent polarity, providing a means to assess the physicochemical properties of the substrate binding site (or of its immediate proximity) and their variation during catalysis. Previous of the spectroscopic analyses of Dns-S-Gal derivative-Laccarrier interactions in E. coli membranes illustrate this approach (18Schuldiner S. Kerwar G.K. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schuldiner S. Kung H. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol.

Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that several Dns-S-Gal derivatives are high affinity ligands of MelB in native membranes or of purified MelB in proteoliposomes. The overlap between protein tryptophan fluorescence emission and Dns-S-Gal absorbance has been exploited to investigate specific aspects of the MelB-cosubstrate interaction using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy. The results provide information on the environment of Dns-S-Gal molecules bound to MelB. It is shown that the polarity of this environment is modified in a sodium-dependent fashion. Together with cosubstrate-induced intrinsic fluorescence variation data (16Mus-Veteau I. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), these results are used to speculate on the structural properties of the sugar-binding site of MelB.DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported in the present study show that additional insight into the cosubstrate-induced structural change of the MelB transporter of E. coli can be obtained by analyzing the spectral properties of different fluorescent 2′-(N-dansyl) aminoalkyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosides interacting with MelB in membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes. The results suggests that on interacting with MelB, the activating sodium ion modifies the hydrophobicity of the immediate environment of the transporter sugar-binding site, probably as a result of structural change occurring in domains close to or forming this sugar-binding site.The dansylated sugars Dns2-S-Gal, Dns3-S-Gal, and Dns6-S-Gal fulfill all of the criteria required for being considered high affinity substrates of MelB. At the micromolar level, they inhibited active transport of melibiose (Fig.1 A) or competed with the high affinity ligand α-NPG for binding on MelB in deenergized RSO membrane vesicles (Fig.1 B). In addition, they bound to MelB in a sodium-dependent fashion (Table I) and were displaced by melibiose in a competitive-like fashion. The affinity of MelB for the Dns-S-Gal analogs is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the physiological substrate melibiose (around 0.5 mm) but is comparable to that of α-NPG (0.6 μm). In agreement with previous contention, the data suggest that although the specificity of the sugar-MelB interaction is primarily dictated by the galactosyl configuration, grafting an aromatic group on the glycosidic linkage strongly stabilizes the sugar-transporter interaction (see Ref. 1Pourcher T. Bassilana M. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and references therein). Overall, these data strongly support the contention that Dns-S-Gal analogs bind specifically to the sugar-binding site of MelB.Two lines of evidence indicate that Dns-S-Gal molecules specifically bound to the transporter are responsible for the generation of the fluorescence signal with λem[max] below 500 nm recorded on irradiating membrane vesicles or MelB proteoliposomes at either 335 or 297 nm. The first is kinetic and is illustrated by the close correlation existing between the spectral and binding properties of Dns2-S-Gal. Both processes are sodium-dependent, progressively titrated by increasing concentration of melibiose, and described quantitatively by using similar kinetic constants. As selective inactivation of the substrate translocation activity of MelB has no significant effect on sugar binding or on the fluorescence response means that the fluorescence signal monitors events occurring at the stage of substrate binding to the permease. The spectral characteristics of the sodium-dependent fluorescence signal also suggest a direct relationship between the spectroscopic and Dns-S-Gal binding to MelB. Thus, the λem[max] value recorded in the presence of Dns2-S-Gal (465 nm) or even that of Dns3-S-Gal (490 nm), is far below that attributed to the same analog interacting nonspecifically with E. colimembranes or lipids (514–520 nm) (21Overath P. Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also, one would not expect much change in the emission maximum of different sugar analogs nor a strong dependence on the presence of NaCl if the fluorescent signal were to arise from dansyl galactosides partitioned into the membrane lipid core or not specifically interacting with MelB. Incidentally, it should be noted that the λem[max] of the fluorescence signal emitted by Dns2-S-Gal bound to E. coliLac permease is around 493 nm rather than 465 nm as for MelB (18Schuldiner S. Kerwar G.K. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Overath P. Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that the signal is specific to the transporter studied. Finally, the concomitant and reciprocal variation of Trp and Dns2-S-Gal fluorescence signals in proteoliposomes illuminated at 297 nm and the appearance of the 280-nm component in the dansylated sugar excitation spectrum support the conclusion that the fluorescence signal recorded at 465 nm results from a fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon ((Trp → Dns)-FRET)) between the tryptophan residues of MelB and the probe. Emission of Dns2-S-Gal at about 465 nm in the presence of NaCl suggests that the dansyl reporter is located in a highly hydrophobic microenvironment with an apparent dielectric constant equivalent to that of cyclohexane (ε= 2.1, (28Chen R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 609-620Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar)). As the alkyl linker bridging the galactoside and the dansyl reporter of Dns2-S-Gal is short (2 carbons), the microenvironment probed should be in the immediate vicinity of the galactosyl binding site. On using analogs with increasing alkyl bridge lengths (Dns3-S-Gal or Dns6-S-Gal), the signal λem[max] was progressively shifted toward higher wavelengths, suggesting that the dansyl is progressively displaced toward a less hydrophobic environment. In this context, Zaniet al. (14Zani M.L. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24883-24889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a structural model of MelB consisting of a well-like structure open toward the periplasmic space and closed at the bottom by the cosubstrate binding and/or translocation domain in close contact with the cytoplasm. The data reported here might indicate that the pathway becomes less polar near the bottom of the well. Such a polarity gradient could vanish over a restricted distance and could partially shield the sugar ligands in the site from the solvent. Interestingly, a similar situation seems to prevail at the metal binding site of metaloprotroteins (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or at the H+ binding site in the membrane sector of H+-transporting ATPases (30Fillingame R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yamashita et al. (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) pointed out that the metal ion binding sites of most metaloproteins are surrounded by an hydrophobic environment and introduced the concept of hydrophobic contrast. They derived an hydrophobic contrast function that can be used to predict the location of the metal binding site in metaloproteins structures. Importantly, they considered that the function describing the hydrophobic contrast in metal ion sites “may indirectly represent electrostatic and hydration components of the free energy of metal binding” (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Extrapolating this notion to the binding of any hydrophilic substrate, we speculate that the hydrophobic contrast between the MelB sugar-binding site and its surroundings that is illustrated in this study has an analogous functional implication.The Dns2-S-Gal signal amplitude is small and has a λem[max] of about 490 nm in a nominally sodium-free medium, whereas the signal is much larger and has a λem[max] of 465 nm in NaCl-containing media. The shift of λem[max] toward a lower wavelength observed on adding NaCl suggests that the activating monovalent cation enhances the hydrophobicity of the microenvironment of Dns2-S-Gal bound to MelB. The resulting increase of the probe quantum yield accounts for at least part of the signal amplitude enhancement. The NaCl-induced change in Dns2-S-Gal microenvironment polarity most likely reflects a variation of MelB structure close to or at the sugar-binding site. This suggestion is consistent with previous evidence indicating that the structure of MelB is modified in the presence of Na+ ions (8Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar),(16, 17). Another interesting finding is that the ratio of the (Trp → Dns)-FRET and direct fluorescence signal is twice as large in the presence as in the absence of Na+ ion, suggesting that more light is absorbed by the acceptor when Na+ ions rather than H+ are bound to the transporter. This effect may be due to a change in the orientation of donor Trp(s) and/or of the acceptor Dns2-S-Gal caused by modification of their respective local environment and/or structure. Ion-induced modification of MelB structure could also change the donor(s)-acceptor distance. Better understanding of these spectroscopic events and possible structural implications requires the prior identification of the tryptophanyl residues acting as energy donors in the (Trp → Dns)-FRET phenomenon.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33198-33202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to assess the participation of each of the eight Trps of MelB to the (Trp → Dns)-FRET signal.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all suggest that Na+, Li+, and H+ share a common binding site buried, at least in part, in the N-terminal membrane domain of the transporter. This site contains several acidic and polar residues that may be involved in the coordination of either monovalent ions or H3O+(rather than H+) (11Pourcher T. Zani M.L. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3209-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, intrinsic fluorescence studies of a purified His-tagged transporter suggest that cosubstrate binding induces cooperative modifications in MelB conformation (16Mus-Veteau I. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas MelB fluorescence emission is slightly quenched by the monovalent ions or moderately enhanced by adding the sugar in a sodium- or lithium-free medium, addition of both substrates induces a large fluorescence change. Subsequent studies have shown that Trp299 and Trp342, located on helices IX and X of MelB, respectively, contribute most of the α-galactoside-induced fluorescence signal increase (17Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One or more tryptophans from the N-terminal domain are also involved in the fluorescence response on adding a β-galactoside. Interestingly, the polarity of Trp299 or Trp342 environment decreases upon sugar binding, suggesting that they become less accessible to the solvent. Altogether, these data suggest that the structure of the sugar-binding site, hypothetically located in the C-terminal domain, is directly modified by the sugar and is further modified in a cooperative and indirect fashion upon the binding of the coupling ion to the N-terminal domain. Further insight into the cosubstrate-induced change of MelB structure can be obtained by probing more directly the sugar-binding site properties with sugar analogs carrying an appropriate reporter. Fluorescent galactosides, such as (N-dansyl)aminoalkyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosides (Dns-S-Gal), seem particularly suited as the dansyl fluorescence properties depend on solvent polarity, providing a means to assess the physicochemical properties of the substrate binding site (or of its immediate proximity) and their variation during catalysis. Previous of the spectroscopic analyses of Dns-S-Gal derivative-Laccarrier interactions in E. coli membranes illustrate this approach (18Schuldiner S. Kerwar G.K. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schuldiner S. Kung H. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol.

Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that several Dns-S-Gal derivatives are high affinity ligands of MelB in native membranes or of purified MelB in proteoliposomes. The overlap between protein tryptophan fluorescence emission and Dns-S-Gal absorbance has been exploited to investigate specific aspects of the MelB-cosubstrate interaction using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy. The results provide information on the environment of Dns-S-Gal molecules bound to MelB. It is shown that the polarity of this environment is modified in a sodium-dependent fashion. Together with cosubstrate-induced intrinsic fluorescence variation data (16Mus-Veteau I. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), these results are used to speculate on the structural properties of the sugar-binding site of MelB. DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported in the present study show that additional insight into the cosubstrate-induced structural change of the MelB transporter of E. coli can be obtained by analyzing the spectral properties of different fluorescent 2′-(N-dansyl) aminoalkyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosides interacting with MelB in membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes. The results suggests that on interacting with MelB, the activating sodium ion modifies the hydrophobicity of the immediate environment of the transporter sugar-binding site, probably as a result of structural change occurring in domains close to or forming this sugar-binding site.The dansylated sugars Dns2-S-Gal, Dns3-S-Gal, and Dns6-S-Gal fulfill all of the criteria required for being considered high affinity substrates of MelB. At the micromolar level, they inhibited active transport of melibiose (Fig.1 A) or competed with the high affinity ligand α-NPG for binding on MelB in deenergized RSO membrane vesicles (Fig.1 B). In addition, they bound to MelB in a sodium-dependent fashion (Table I) and were displaced by melibiose in a competitive-like fashion. The affinity of MelB for the Dns-S-Gal analogs is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the physiological substrate melibiose (around 0.5 mm) but is comparable to that of α-NPG (0.6 μm). In agreement with previous contention, the data suggest that although the specificity of the sugar-MelB interaction is primarily dictated by the galactosyl configuration, grafting an aromatic group on the glycosidic linkage strongly stabilizes the sugar-transporter interaction (see Ref. 1Pourcher T. Bassilana M. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and references therein). Overall, these data strongly support the contention that Dns-S-Gal analogs bind specifically to the sugar-binding site of MelB.Two lines of evidence indicate that Dns-S-Gal molecules specifically bound to the transporter are responsible for the generation of the fluorescence signal with λem[max] below 500 nm recorded on irradiating membrane vesicles or MelB proteoliposomes at either 335 or 297 nm. The first is kinetic and is illustrated by the close correlation existing between the spectral and binding properties of Dns2-S-Gal. Both processes are sodium-dependent, progressively titrated by increasing concentration of melibiose, and described quantitatively by using similar kinetic constants. As selective inactivation of the substrate translocation activity of MelB has no significant effect on sugar binding or on the fluorescence response means that the fluorescence signal monitors events occurring at the stage of substrate binding to the permease. The spectral characteristics of the sodium-dependent fluorescence signal also suggest a direct relationship between the spectroscopic and Dns-S-Gal binding to MelB. Thus, the λem[max] value recorded in the presence of Dns2-S-Gal (465 nm) or even that of Dns3-S-Gal (490 nm), is far below that attributed to the same analog interacting nonspecifically with E. colimembranes or lipids (514–520 nm) (21Overath P. Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also, one would not expect much change in the emission maximum of different sugar analogs nor a strong dependence on the presence of NaCl if the fluorescent signal were to arise from dansyl galactosides partitioned into the membrane lipid core or not specifically interacting with MelB. Incidentally, it should be noted that the λem[max] of the fluorescence signal emitted by Dns2-S-Gal bound to E. coliLac permease is around 493 nm rather than 465 nm as for MelB (18Schuldiner S. Kerwar G.K. Kaback H.R. Weil R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Overath P. Teather R.M. Simoni R.D. Aichele G. Wilhelm U. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that the signal is specific to the transporter studied. Finally, the concomitant and reciprocal variation of Trp and Dns2-S-Gal fluorescence signals in proteoliposomes illuminated at 297 nm and the appearance of the 280-nm component in the dansylated sugar excitation spectrum support the conclusion that the fluorescence signal recorded at 465 nm results from a fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon ((Trp → Dns)-FRET)) between the tryptophan residues of MelB and the probe. Emission of Dns2-S-Gal at about 465 nm in the presence of NaCl suggests that the dansyl reporter is located in a highly hydrophobic microenvironment with an apparent dielectric constant equivalent to that of cyclohexane (ε= 2.1, (28Chen R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 609-620Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar)). As the alkyl linker bridging the galactoside and the dansyl reporter of Dns2-S-Gal is short (2 carbons), the microenvironment probed should be in the immediate vicinity of the galactosyl binding site. On using analogs with increasing alkyl bridge lengths (Dns3-S-Gal or Dns6-S-Gal), the signal λem[max] was progressively shifted toward higher wavelengths, suggesting that the dansyl is progressively displaced toward a less hydrophobic environment. In this context, Zaniet al. (14Zani M.L. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24883-24889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a structural model of MelB consisting of a well-like structure open toward the periplasmic space and closed at the bottom by the cosubstrate binding and/or translocation domain in close contact with the cytoplasm. The data reported here might indicate that the pathway becomes less polar near the bottom of the well. Such a polarity gradient could vanish over a restricted distance and could partially shield the sugar ligands in the site from the solvent. Interestingly, a similar situation seems to prevail at the metal binding site of metaloprotroteins (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or at the H+ binding site in the membrane sector of H+-transporting ATPases (30Fillingame R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yamashita et al. (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) pointed out that the metal ion binding sites of most metaloproteins are surrounded by an hydrophobic environment and introduced the concept of hydrophobic contrast. They derived an hydrophobic contrast function that can be used to predict the location of the metal binding site in metaloproteins structures. Importantly, they considered that the function describing the hydrophobic contrast in metal ion sites “may indirectly represent electrostatic and hydration components of the free energy of metal binding” (29Yamashita M.M. Wesson L. Eisenman G. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5648-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Extrapolating this notion to the binding of any hydrophilic substrate, we speculate that the hydrophobic contrast between the MelB sugar-binding site and its surroundings that is illustrated in this study has an analogous functional implication.The Dns2-S-Gal signal amplitude is small and has a λem[max] of about 490 nm in a nominally sodium-free medium, whereas the signal is much larger and has a λem[max] of 465 nm in NaCl-containing media. The shift of λem[max] toward a lower wavelength observed on adding NaCl suggests that the activating monovalent cation enhances the hydrophobicity of the microenvironment of Dns2-S-Gal bound to MelB. The resulting increase of the probe quantum yield accounts for at least part of the signal amplitude enhancement. The NaCl-induced change in Dns2-S-Gal microenvironment polarity most likely reflects a variation of MelB structure close to or at the sugar-binding site. This suggestion is consistent with previous evidence indicating that the structure of MelB is modified in the presence of Na+ ions (8Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar),(16, 17). Another interesting finding is that the ratio of the (Trp → Dns)-FRET and direct fluorescence signal is twice as large in the presence as in the absence of Na+ ion, suggesting that more light is absorbed by the acceptor when Na+ ions rather than H+ are bound to the transporter. This effect may be due to a change in the orientation of donor Trp(s) and/or of the acceptor Dns2-S-Gal caused by modification of their respective local environment and/or structure. Ion-induced modification of MelB structure could also change the donor(s)-acceptor distance. Better understanding of these spectroscopic events and possible structural implications requires the prior identification of the tryptophanyl residues acting as energy donors in the (Trp → Dns)-FRET phenomenon. In the accompanying paper (32Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33198-33202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to assess the participation of each of the eight Trps of MelB to the (Trp → Dns)-FRET signal.

Activation of inward Ca2+ currents by store depletion has been reported in a number of different cell types (4Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar, 5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that this current is mediated by a channel. However, the current appears to vary in different cell types. The most well studied of these currents is ICRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current) which has some unique characteristics, including very low single channel conductance, high Ca2+selectivity, inward rectification, reversal at very positive potentials, and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 7Hoth M. Penner R. J.

Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism(s) that activates and inactivates SOCE is not yet known. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for the activation. (i) The status of the internal Ca2+ store is relayed to the plasma membrane via a physical interaction between the Ca2+store membrane and the plasma membrane. (ii) A diffusible messenger either released from the store during depletion or activated in response to depletion transmits the signal from ER to the plasma membrane. Two different inactivation mechanisms have been described that are either dependent on the refilling internal Ca2+store or independent of store refilling. We have previously shown that refilling of internal Ca2+ stores in salivary gland cells inactivates agonist-stimulated Ca2+ and Mn2+influx (10Mertz L.M. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15010-15014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ influx which is independent of internal Ca2+ store has also been described by us and others in parotid acinar cells (11Foskett J.K. Wong D.C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C284-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Matsumoto Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 69: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and also for ICRAC in T-lymphocytes (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We and others (12Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C284-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have reported that in rat parotid acinar cells Ca2+ influx is inactivated by the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A, and pretreatment of cells with staurosporine, a relatively nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor, prevents the inactivation. We have recently reported (14Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that the staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase is involved in the Ca2+-induced feedback inhibition of Ca2+ influx in rat parotid acinar cells. Importantly, this kinase does not appear to be involved in the refill-dependent inactivation of SOCE, i.e.refill-dependent inactivation was not prevented by staurosporine (14Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, we had hypothesized that Ca2+, via a protein kinase, modulates SOCE in store-depleted rat parotid acinar cells. HSG cells, a human submandibular gland cell line, have been used to study muscarinic receptor-activated Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ influx (15He X. Wu X. Turner R.J. Baum B.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.D. Taylor S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that emptying of the Ca2+ store by CCh, IP3, or the Ca2+ pump inhibitor TG (or BHQ) activates an SOCE-type Ca2+ influx mechanism in these cells (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was previously monitored by measuring fura2 fluorescence or the Ca2+- dependent K+ current (KCa) (16Kaplan M.D. Taylor S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand further the mechanism of Ca2+influx in HSG cells, we have now directly measured the store-operated Ca2+ current. We report here the activation of an inward Ca2+ current by internal Ca2+ store depletion (ISOC) in HSG cells. This is the first report of a Ca2+ influx current in a salivary gland cell. ISOC is Ca2+-selective and is regulated by a Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition, which is determined by the [Ca2+]i in the region of the channel and a protein kinase activity. By using the KCacurrent as a readout for Ca2+ influx, we had previously reported that in HSG cells, [Ca2+]i at the site of Ca2+ influx is maintained at a very low level (i.e. below that required for activation of KCa) by the intracellular Ca2+ pump (SERCA) activity. The present data demonstrate that SERCA modulates the Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of the store-operated Ca2+ influx channel. HSG cells were cultured as described earlier (15He X. Wu X. Turner R.J. Baum B.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.D. Taylor S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were detached from the tissue culture dish with 0.25% trypsin, 1.0 mm EDTA (Biofluids). A single cell suspension was seeded on coverslips, kept in a 35-mm culture dish (Corning, NY), and used after 24 h. All reagents were of the highest available grade. Patch clamp in a whole cell configuration was performed on single HSG cells attached to coverslips (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes were made from 1.0-mm borosilicate glass tubing with filament (BF-100–50-10, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The resistance of the pipette was typically between 3 and 6 MΩ when filled. The chamber was connected with an Ag-AgCl pellet through a 150 mm NaCl-containing agar bridge. Cell membrane and pipette capacitative transients were subtracted from the records by the amplifier circuitry before sampling. Voltages have not been compensated for liquid junction potentials. Membrane currents were measured with an Axopatch 200A amplifier in conjunction with pClamp 6.1 software and a Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The currents were filtered at 2 kHz (low-pass bessel filter) and sampled at an interval of 10 ms. In the step protocol, the cell was held at 0 mV and stepped from −100 mV to −40 mV in 20 mV steps. The cells were held at each step for 200 ms and at the holding potential for 312 ms. In the ramp protocol, the holding potential was +35 mV, and during the ramp the membrane potential was changed from −120 mV to +60 mV within 500 ms. The leakage subtraction function was used with either ramp or step protocol to minimize the leak currents. The currents were digitized and recorded directly onto the hard drive of a Dell Pentium computer. The peak currents measured in the ramp, step, and gap-free protocol were used for analysis. The I-V relationship was calculated using the peak amplitude of the current during the ramp protocol and exported to the Origin 4.1 (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) for further analysis. Coverslips with cells were cut to an approximately 0.5 × 0.5-mm piece that was placed in a chamber (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) that was perfused at a rate of approximately 5 ml/min while the bath solution was continuously removed by a vacuum line. Complete solution changes were achieved within 10 s. The standard extracellular solution contained (mm) 135 sodium glutamate, 1 MgCl2, 10 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette was filled with (mm) 135 NMDG glutamate, 10 CsCl, 10 BAPTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 ATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). 10 μm inositol 1,4,5,trisphosphate (IP3), or its non-metabolizable analog F-IP3, was included in the pipette solution (all experiments shown here were performed with F-IP3). 10 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mmBaCl2 or Ca2+-free medium as indicated in some experiments. Tg, BHQ, or CCh was continuously administered in the cell medium by perfusion. All experiments were performed at room temperature. [Ca2+]i in HSG cells was determined by measuring fura2 fluorescence as described previously (12Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C284-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.D. Taylor S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other experimental conditions are described in the text. All the values given below are the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. The Student'st test or analysis of variance test, as indicated, was used for statistical analysis of the data. To measure directly SOCE in HSG cells, we have used the whole cell patch clamp protocol described by Hoth and Penner (6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar), with some modifications (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 mm) was included in the patch pipette and high [Ca2+] (10 mm) in the external medium. The inclusion of BAPTA into the cell has been shown to prevent intracellular Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of the inward Ca2+ current, and thus facilitate detection of this current (6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 7Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This was also true for HSG cells. The inward current was not detected when BAPTA was omitted from the pipette solution or low concentrations of EGTA, 0.5–1.0 mm, were used (data not shown). Stimulation of HSG cells by CCh, or direct activation of internal Ca2+ release by IP3, caused activation of an inward current (Fig. 1, which shows a continuous recording of the current at 0 mV using the gap-free configuration of pClamp 6.0. The current recording was initiated as soon as the whole cell configuration was established. Consistent with previous ICRAC measurements (6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 7Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar), the IP3-induced current had a shorter onset (15.3 ± 5.4 s, n = 7) of activation as compared with that of the CCh-stimulated current (30.6 ± 7.3 s,n = 4, including the perfusion time, <10 s). We have shown previously that in rat parotid acinar cells peak [Ca2+]i due to internal Ca2+ release is reached within 6 s after CCh stimulation of cells, whereas Ca2+ influx is detected after a lag of about 10 s (19Hiramatsu Y. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similar lag times have also been reported in pancreatic acinar cell (20Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8528-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IP3-stimulated inward currents were detected in 70.2% (52/74) of the cells tested while CCh-stimulated currents were detected in 53.8% (7/13) of the cells. The maximum steady state current activated by IP3 at 0 mV in the continuous recording protocol had an average amplitude of 14.5 ± 5.2 pA (n = 7). A similar pattern of current was seen with 1,4,5-IP3 and its non-metabolizable analog, F-IP3. All the studies described here, including the results in Fig. 1, were carried out with F-IP3, to rule out possible effects due to hydrolysis or metabolism of IP3. For convenience we refer to this analog as IP3. Note that control cells (i.e. loaded with solution that did not contain IP3) displayed currents in 20% of the cells (4/20) with an average amplitude of 5 ± 2 pA and an onset time of 312 ± 50 s. The ramp protocol was also used to record the IP3-induced inward current and to determine the I-V curve (Fig.2). The IP3-induced inward Ca2+ current increased at negative membrane potentials, up to −120 mV, and showed inward rectification with a reversal potential more positive than +10 mV. Tg, or BHQ, also activated a similar inward current although with a different temporal profile (further discussed below), suggesting that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores activates a cation channel in HSG cells. In some cells stimulated by IP3, CCh, or Tg, but not in unstimulated cells, a small inward current was detected at higher (+40 mV to +60 mV) membrane potentials (Fig. 2, A and B). The nature of this inward current is not presently clear. It should be noted that the internal and external solutions used blocked the Ca2+-activated K+ current, which has been previously described in these cells (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+-activated Cl− currents are not detected in HSG cells, but only a volume-regulated outwardly rectifying Cl− current has been described (21Ishikawa T. Cook D.I. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 427: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine the permeability of the store depletion-activated channel to other cations, IP3-induced inward current was measured in cells perfused with Ca2+-free medium, i.e.with Na+ as the only cation in the medium. This condition decreased the amplitude of the inward current by 41% (n = 4, Fig. 2 A). Under these conditions, the estimated permeability of Na+, relative to that of Ca2+, was 0.59 and 0.66 at −120 and 0 mV, respectively. However, when [Ca2+]e was replaced by Ba2+, the inward current was only slightly less than that obtained with 10 mm Ca2+. Furthermore, when 1 mm Ca2+ was used (see Fig. 4 A), the peak amplitude of the current (53 ± 5.1 pA) was significantly less (p < 0.05, n = 3 to 5) than that measured with 10 mm Ca2+ (127 ± 10.8 pA), 10 mm Ba2+ (109 ± 7.9 pA), or Na+ (75 ± 5.6 pA) in the medium. Thus, the store depletion-activated cation channel appeared to conduct Ba2+and Na+ when Ca2+ ion was not present in the external medium and demonstrated cation permeability in the order Ca2+ > Ba2+ > Na+. Importantly, these data suggest that with a normal physiological external solution, (i.e. containing 1 mm[Ca2+]e and about 140 mmNa+), the channel is relatively more permeant to Ca2+ than Na+. This is further illustrated by the data in Fig. 2 B showing the IV curves of the Ca2+, Ba2+, and Na+ currents. The IV curve of the IP3-induced Ca2+ current was significantly different from that of the Na+ current (p < 0.05, analysis of variance analysis). Additionally, in the presence of La3+, the Ca2+current was almost completely inhibited and did not show any voltage sensitivity. Previously we have shown that Ca2+ channel antagonists La3+ and Gd3+, but not Zn2+, blocked SOCE in HSG cells (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, IP3 failed to evoke inward currents in the presence of 1 mm La3+ (Fig. 2 B). Fig.3 shows continuous recordings of the inward current (at 0 mV and 10 mm Ca2+). The IP3-activated current was greatly reduced by perfusion of La3+ into the medium, and the reduction was reversed when La3+ was removed (Fig. 3 A). A similar inhibition was also seen with Gd3+ (Fig. 3 B) but not with Zn2+ (data not shown). Furthermore, La3+ (1 mm) also reversibly blocked IP3-induced activation of Na+ and Ba2+ (n = 5). In aggregate the data in Fig. 2 suggest that Ba2+, Na+, and Ca2+ pass through the same store-operated Ca2+ channel in HSG cells. Furthermore, the divalent cation sensitivity of the inward Ca2+ current is similar to that of SOCE which we have previously reported (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrate the activation of a store-operated Ca2+-permeable cation channel in HSG cells. Although this current exhibits several characteristics similar to those of ICRAC, it is not inhibited by Zn2+ (5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Thus, we have referred to this current as ISOC. A ramp protocol was used to record ISOC with 1 mm Ca2+ in the external medium and then repeated to record another trace in the same cell after [Ca2+]e was increased to 10 mm (Fig.4 A). The average peak amplitude of the current with 1 mm Ca2+ was 40.3 ± 10.5% (n = 3) of that with 10 mm Ca2+ in the same cell. Similar effects were seen in a continuous recording of ISOC at 0 mV (Fig.4 B). The amplitude of the IP3-stimulated inward current decreased significantly with reduction of [Ca2+]e concentration from 10 to 1 mmand increased again when [Ca2+]e was changed back to 10 mm. However, with subsequent shifts in [Ca2+]e from 10 to 1 mm andvice versa, the amplitude of the current with either 10 or 1 mm Ca2+ gradually decreased, and after the third exposure to 10 mm Ca2+, the current at 1 mm Ca2+ was not detectable above basal levels. The current seen with 10 mm Ca2+ was decreased by about 50%. These data demonstrate that the amplitude of ISOC is dependent on [Ca2+]e as was previously observed for Ca2+ influx (17Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mertz L.M. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Chauthaiwale J.V. Sakai T. Taylor S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 432: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These data also show that ISOC inactivates, either as a function of time after activation or due to exposure of cells to high [Ca2+]e. However, the inhibition did not appear to be dependent on the presence of high [Ca2+]e per se, since it was observed even after the 10 mm Ca2+-containing medium was replaced with 1 mm Ca2+ medium. To examine further the apparent inhibition of ISOC by Ca2+ in HSG cells, we used a step protocol to measure IP3-generated ISOC at various times after the whole cell configuration was established (<30 s and 1–5 min). During the first sequence (Fig. 5 A), at each holding potential from −100 to −40 mV, the inward current evoked by IP3, via internal Ca2+ release, was biphasic, with a rapid initial increase followed by a relatively slower decay. However, the amplitude of the initial current at each holding potential gradually decreased in the subsequent sequences. Two to three minutes after stimulation (Fig. 5, C and D), the peak current at any membrane potential was reduced by about 50%, and 5 min after stimulation the current could not be detected even at −100 mV (Fig. 5 E). A similar time-dependent inhibition of the inward Ca2+ current was observed using repeated ramp protocols (<30 s and 1, 3, 5, and 10 min, see Fig.6). The IP3-induced inward Ca2+ current (with 10 mm[Ca2+]e) was significantly reduced at 3 and 5 min (traces II and III, respectively) after stimulation as compared with the initial response (trace I). Five minutes after stimulation, the inward current was reduced to 47 ± 3.5% (n = 3) of the initial current, while 10 min after stimulation, the current was barely detectable. However, the inactivation of the current was significantly delayed when the cell was in a low, more physiological, [Ca2+]e (1 mm, Fig. 6 B). The peak amplitudes of the inward current at 5 (trace II) and 10 (trace III) min after stimulation were 64 ± 6.7 and 54.5 ± 7.3% (n = 4), respectively, of the initial current. In aggregate these data indicate that the Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of ISOC depends on [Ca2+]e, and although it is detected at physiological Ca2+ levels, it occurs more rapidly at higher [Ca2+]e. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 4 B strongly indicate that this inhibition is not due to [Ca2+]e per se. We hypothesized that the inactivation of ISOC was determined by the rate (and thus the amount) of Ca2+entering the cell, i.e. when cells are pulsed at more negative membrane potentials in the presence of high [Ca2+]e, Ca2+ influx is greater and thus the rate of inactivation is also higher than seen with lower [Ca2+]e and membrane potentials closer to 0 mV. To demonstrate this, we used the continuous recording protocol and stimulated the cells with IP3 at a holding potential of −80 mV, instead of 0 mV. Whereas the amplitude of the initial current at −80 mV was higher than that at 0 mV, the current was transient and inactivated rapidly (in <20 s) to a level close to the resting current (Fig. 7, compare with trace in Fig. 1). This result demonstrates that the driving force for Ca2+, thus the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell, modulates the inactivation of ISOC. Based on our previous studies, we have suggested that the Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of SOCE in rat parotid gland cells is mediated via a staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase (12Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C284-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sakai T. Ambudkar I.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have also observed that other protein kinase inhibitors are ineffective in preventing the Ca2+-induced inhibition of Ca2+ influx in these cells. 2T. Sakai and I. S. Ambudkar, unpublished data. To determine whether SOCE in HSG cells is also affected by modulators of protein phosphorylation, we studied the effects of okadaic acid and calyculin A on thapsigargin-stimulated [Ca2+]ichanges in fura2-loaded HSG cells. Similar to our results with rat parotid acinar cells, both these inhibitors induced a significant inhibition of thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ influx but not internal Ca2+ release (TableI). We also examined the inhibition of Ca2+ influx with 5 mm[Ca2+]e since the patch clamp protocol uses high [Ca2+]e. Calyculin A was more effective in blocking Ca2+ influx at this higher [Ca2+]e. The inhibition by either phosphatase inhibitor was prevented when cells were pretreated with staurosporine (data not shown). The effect of staurosporine and calyculin A was further tested on ISOC in HSG cells. Consistent with the data shown in Table I, calyculin A induced a partial, but reversible, inhibition of the IP3-induced Ca2+ current (Fig. 8 A), whereas staurosporine (500 nm) enhanced this current in an irreversible manner (Fig. 8 B). Thus, the response of SOCE in HSG cells and rat parotid gland cells to modulators of protein phosphorylation is similar. Furthermore, these data also demonstrate that the effects of these agents on SOCE are not indirectly induced via effects on t"

The key to preservation of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding sites in the presence of increasing concentrations of CHAPS was the addition of phosphatidylcholine. This assay was used to characterize the equilibrium and kinetic properties of [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels and the effects on binding of physiological modulators including ATP, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Both RyR1 and RyR2 had a single high affinity ryanodine binding site and low affinity sites, but [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant RyR2 was not sensitive to ATP activation or Ca2+ inactivation and was less sensitive to Mg2+ inhibition. The [3H]ryanodine binding assay was used to estimate the expression level of recombinant RyR2 and RyR1, and to show that RyR2 can be expressed at very high levels in HEK-293 cells. Analysis of the properties of recombinant RyR2 and RyR1 by measurement of intracellular Fura-2 fluorescence revealed that the different properties of RyR2 and RyR1 are retained in the recombinant expressed proteins.

Both RyR1 and RyR2 had a single high affinity ryanodine binding site and low affinity sites, but [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant RyR2 was not sensitive to ATP activation or Ca2+ inactivation and was less sensitive to Mg2+ inhibition. The [3H]ryanodine binding assay was used to estimate the expression level of recombinant RyR2 and RyR1, and to show that RyR2 can be expressed at very high levels in HEK-293 cells. Analysis of the properties of recombinant RyR2 and RyR1 by measurement of intracellular Fura-2 fluorescence revealed that the different properties of RyR2 and RyR1 are retained in the recombinant expressed proteins. Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors or RyR) 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; AMPPCP, β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-trisphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MCS, multiple cloning site. 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; AMPPCP, β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-trisphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MCS, multiple cloning site. from sarcoplasmic reticulum are formed as homotetramers of 565,000-Da subunits (1Franzini-Armstrong C.

The activities of native Ca2+ release channels from skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac muscle (RyR2) are modulated by a variety of physiologically relevant agents and by a series of pharmacological compounds (for details, see Refs. 3Coronado R.

Ryanodine binds to Ca2+ release channels with high affinity and was used in the original identification of Ca2+ release channel proteins (6Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At concentrations below 10 μm, ryanodine locks the channel into a subconductance state and at concentrations above 10 μm it blocks conductance. Ryanodine is often used as a probe of conformation to indicate the open state of the channel. A major goal in studies of ryanodine receptors is to understand structure/function relationships through expression and analysis of mutant forms of both skeletal muscle (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) isoforms. In order to carry out such studies, a series of useful assays for ryanodine receptors expressed in homologous cell culture have been developed, including planar bilayer assays (7Chen S.R.

Casida J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) which makes it useful for microscale analyses of expressed ryanodine receptors. We also describe the expression of a rabbit cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) clone in HEK-293 cells and we characterize some of its properties through use of the [3H]ryanodine binding assay and through Ca2+ photometry.

Chem. 1981; 256: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes were suspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −70 °C. The expression of cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 was described previously (7Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H.

A polymerase chain reaction fragment containing nucleotide 12351–13140 (pBS-CRR9) was synthesized from a cardiac library. These nine clones were used for construction of full-length expression plasmid pcDNA-CRR as follows. The SacII (−53)-EcoRI (1590) fragment from pBS-CRR1 and the EcoRI (1590)-EcoRI (4387 to vector) fragment of pBS-CRR2 were ligated intoSacII-EcoRI sites of pBluescript vector to form pBS-CRR12. The HindIII (2959)-EcoRI (5443) fragment from pBS-CRR3 and the EcoRI (5443)-EcoRI (8270 to vector) fragment from pBS-CRR4 were ligated intoHindIII-EcoRI sites of the vector to yield pBS-CRR34. The EcoRI (7950 to vector)-EcoRI (10075) fragment of pBS-CRR5 and the EcoRI (10075)-NdeI (11072) fragment from pBS-CRR6 were ligated into the EcoRI-NdeI sites of the modified pBluescript vector (pBS2) (9Tong J.

The NdeI (11072)-SmaI (MCS, 12649) fragment from pBS-CRR7 were ligated into pBS-CRR6 cut with NdeI (11072)-EcoRV (MCS, of the vector to form pBS-CRR67. The AvaII (13008)-ClaI (MCS) 16225) fragment from pBS-CRR9 and the fragment PstI (12346)-AvaII (13008) from pBS-CRR8 were ligated to the PstI and ClaI sites of the vector to form pBS-CRR89. The XbaI (3111)-AhdI (8191) fragment from pBS-CRR34 and the fragment AhdI (8191)-BamHI (10563) from pBS56 were ligated into XbaI-BamHI sites in the vector to form pBS-CRR3–6. The fragment BamHI (10563)-PstI (12346) from pBS-CRR67 was ligated into pBS-CRR89 digested with BamHI (MCS)-PstI (12346) to form pBS-CRR6–9. The SacII (−53)-BglI (3954) fragment from pBS-CRR12 and the fragment BglI (3954)-SalI (MCS, 10563) fragment from pBS-CRR3–6 were ligated intoSacII–SaII sites in the vector to form pBS-CRR1–6. The SacII site in pBS-CRR1–6 was changed toNotI by blunt-ending with Klenow fragment and ligated into the blunt-ended fragment with a NotI linker to from pBS-CRR1–6a. The NotI (linker)-NdeI (8553) fragment from pBS-CRR1–6a and the NdeI (11072)-BstBI (15355) fragment from pBS-CRR6–9 were ligated into NotI-BstBI sites of pBS2 to yield pBS-CRRa, and the NdeI (8553)-NdeI (11072) fragment from pBS-CRR56 was inserted into pBS-CRRa to yield pBS-CRR. Finally, the entire cDNA sequence encoding RyR2 from pBS-CRR was excised withNotI and BstBI (blunt-ended with Klenow) and subcloned into the NotI-HindIII (blunt-ended with Klenow) sites of pcDNA 3.1(−). HEK cells were maintained and DNA transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method described previously (8Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells transfected withRyR1 cDNA or RyR2 cDNA were stained with mAb 34C and mAb C3-33 to detect recombinant RyR2 or RyR1 protein in the cells according to the procedures described previously (7Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and p-nitrotetrazolium chloride blue were used to develop color. Proteins from 25 μl of cell lysate, obtained from one 35-mm plate using 100 μl of detergent solution (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and RyR proteins were detected by immunoblotting (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) as described previously (7Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK-293 cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged again. Unless otherwise indicated, the cell pellet from a single 100-mm dish was then solubilized in 1 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, 1% CHAPS, 5 mg/ml PC, and a mix of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml E64) on ice for 45 min. Solubilized proteins were obtained by removing the debris through centrifugation at 4000 rpm, at 4 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of 25 μl of solubilized proteins were diluted into binding buffer B (a total of 0.25 ml) containing various concentrations of [3H]ryanodine, 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm free Ca2+, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.1, and the protease inhibitor mix. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 2 h at 37 °C, aliquots of the samples were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 0.25 m KCl) and placed on Whatman GF/B membrane filters pre-soaked with 1% polyethyleneimine in washing buffer. Filters were washed three times with 6 ml of washing buffer. The radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. All binding assays were carried out in duplicate. To assess the effects of modulators on high affinity ryanodine binding, cell lysates (25 μl) were incubated with 2.5 nm[3H]ryanodine in the presence or absence of each modulator or in the presence or absence of different concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+ in a final volume of 0.25 ml at 37 °C for 2 h. Free Ca2+ was calculated using the apparent binding constants described by Fabiato (18Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The rate of association of [3H]ryanodine binding was measured by terminating the reaction by rapid filtration at times ranging from 30 s to 300 min after addition of solubilized proteins into binding buffer B with 10 nm [3H]ryanodine and incubation at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Dissociation of [3H]ryanodine from the equilibrium complex was determined by equilibrating 10 nm[3H]ryanodine with solubilized proteins in buffer B for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of aliquots of the incubation mixture into a 50-fold excess of buffer B, without added ATP and Ca2+ or with 40 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Determination of specific binding was made at times ranging from 1 to 300 min following dilution. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Fluorescence measurement was described previously (9Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For the generation of EC50 values in caffeine response curves, incremental concentrations of caffeine were added gently with a Pipetman directly on top of the selected cells. Between the peak amplitudes of caffeine response, washing was carried out over 1–2 min, beginning shortly after the plateau was reached. To obtain peak amplitude (ratio (340/380 nm)) and mean half-rise time (t 1/2) in the 20 mm-caffeine responses, the solution changing system was used in order to minimize inaccuracy, especially for thet 1/2 measurements. Values for peak amplitudes, in arbitrary 340/380 nm ratio units, were calculated by measuring the peak ratio minus the basal ratio, while t 1/2values (s) were calculated from measurements of the time required from the onset of the response to the half point of the response for 20 mm caffeine-induced transients. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm from about 30 cells in a specific region selected with an adjustable aperture was measured with dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, alternating at 50 Hz. The emission ratio at 340 and 380 nm was calculated using PTI Felix software and presented as the index of [Ca2+]i. No systematic attempt was made to convert ratio to apparent [Ca2+]i. Scatchard analysis was used to determine the dissociation constant (K d) and maximal binding capacity (B max) from equilibrium binding data. The pseudo-first-order association rate constant (k 1) was calculated as described previously (19Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B. Life Sci. 1981; 29: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 20McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Pessah I.N. Zimanyi I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 679-689PubMed Google Scholar), based on the observed association rate constant (k obs), which was calculated from the slope of the first-order plot of the data obtained in the association kinetics experiments, in which: ln(SB0/(SB0−SB))=Kobst.Equation 1 SBo is the specific binding at equilibrium and SB is the specific binding at timet. The dissociation rate constant (k −1) was measured from the slope of the first-order plot of the data in the dissociation kinetics experiments as described previously (19Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B. Life Sci. 1981; 29: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 20McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Pessah I.N. Zimanyi I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 679-689PubMed Google Scholar), in which: k−1t=ln(SB/SB0).Equation 2 SB is the specific binding at time t, andSB0 is the specific binding at time 0. All data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software Ltd., Northampton, MA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A paired Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values between paired groups. An unpaired Student's ttest was used for evaluation of the mean values between groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. EC50 or IC50 values were obtained by fitting the curves with an equation for logistic dose response using Microcal Origin software. As we were interested in analyzing [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant RyR1 and RyR2, full-length RyR1 andRyR2 cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−), and transfected into HEK 293 cells (8Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The characteristics of recombinant RyR1 have been described (8Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the characteristics of recombinant RyR2 have not been so clearly defined. Immunostaining of transfected cells using mAb 34C and mAb C3-33 for RyR1 and RyR2 respectively was used to demonstrate the expression of both proteins and their absence in pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1). High transfection efficiency (up to 60%) could be observed around the edges of clusters of cells (9Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). There was no apparent difference in transfection efficiency between RyR1 and RyR2cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1, A–C). We also used these two monoclonal antibodies to detect the presence of the expressed proteins in the lysates of transfected HEK-293 cells, using heavy cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations as controls. Antibody 34C detected both RyR1 and RyR2 proteins in transfected cells (Fig. 1 D). Recombinant RyR2, like native RyR2, had a slightly higher mobility than recombinant and native RyR1 in SDS-PAGE. This result is consistent with previous reports for native RyR proteins (22Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15637-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lai F.A. Anderson K. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Imagawa T. Takasago T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but does not agree with the deduced molecular weights (14Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody C3-33 detected only native and recombinant RyR2 (Fig. 1 E). Western blotting of non-transfected cells did not detect any trace of a protein with a similar size with either of these two monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1,D and E), demonstrating that HEK-293 cells do not contain detectable amount of endogenous RyR proteins. We measured Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells in which RyR2 was expressed, using Fura-2 fluorescence as an assay (9Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Caffeine and ryanodine are the standard pharmacological tools for demonstrating the activation and inactivation of the ryanodine receptor (25Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that 20 mm caffeine caused a rapid Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells transfected with RyR2 cDNA. This response could be obtained repeatedly, provided that previously applied caffeine was washed out. Subsequent addition of 50 μm ryanodine did not cause significant intracellular Ca2+ release in three of four experiments over a period of 2–3 min. The first application of 20 mm caffeine after the addition of ryanodine induced a release phase that was similar to the previous one, indicating that ryanodine did not have any direct effect on caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. Further caffeine challenges greatly diminished and eventually could not stimulate any Ca2+ release from the internal store, even in the absence of ryanodine in the extracellular solution (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were also obtained in HEK-293 cells transfected withRyR1 cDNA for caffeine and ryanodine (data not shown). In untransfected cells, 20 mm caffeine and 50 μm ryanodine did not cause any significant Ca2+ release (data not shown). The results illustrate that recombinant RyR2 is sensitive to these two agents and that ryanodine binds only to open-state channels, induced by caffeine. Ryanodine then blocks those channels that were responsive to caffeine. Thapsigargin is a potent and specific inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases. Ca2+ is probably released from intracellular stores, through endogenous leaks that become apparent following Ca2+ pump inhibition (26Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 27Du G.G. Ashley C.C. Lea T.J. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In untransfected HEK-293 cells, 1 μm thapsigargin caused a slow phase of Ca2+ release (n = 3, data not shown). In HEK-293 cells transfected with RyR2 cDNA, in which caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was evident, application of 1 μm thapsigargin induced Ca2+release similar to that observed in untransfected cells, and abolished caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Fig. 3 (A andB) shows representative fluorometric recordings for intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to incremental applications of caffeine (0.03–30 mm) in HEK 293 cells transfected with RyR2 and RyR1 cDNA. Caffeine up to 30 mm did not cause any significant Ca2+release in pcDNA-transfected cells (not shown). Transient traces in Fig. 3 (A and B) showed that RyR2cDNA-transfected cells responded to lower concentrations of caffeine than RyR1 cDNA-transfected cells. Threshold values ranged from 0.052 to 0.1 mm for RyR2 and from 0.3 to 0.52 mm for RyR1, indicating that the sensitivity to caffeine in recombinant RyR2 is higher than that in recombinant RyR1. EC50 values for RyR2 and RyR1 were calculated by measuring the peak amplitude in each caffeine application and normalized to the peak amplitude for maximal Ca2+ release induced by 30 mm caffeine. The EC50 values, generated from fitting the caffeine dose-response curves with an equation for logistic dose response, were 0.99 mm for RyR2 and 2.77 mm for RyR1 with Hill coefficients of 1.08 for RyR2 and 1.66 for RyR1 (Fig. 3C). Since 20–30 mm caffeine can release all of the Ca2+ from caffeine-sensitive stores (28Endo M. Physiol. Rev. 1977; 57: 71-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), the response of RyR2 and RyR1 to caffeine was reflected in the peak amplitude (ratio (340/380 nm)) and the mean half-rise time (t 1/2) in the 20 mm caffeine responses. These two values, calculated from independent transients, are presented in Table I. Significant differences in both peak and t 1/2 betweenRyR2 and RyR1 cDNA-transfected cells indicate that recombinant RyR2 and RyR1 have different kinetics of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release.Table IComparison between the properties of caffeine-induced Ca2+release from RYR1 and RYR2 cDNA transfected HEK-293 cellsRYR2nRYR1np valueThreshold value0.03–0.1 mm160.3–0.52 mm16EC50aAveraged from individual experiments.1.05 ± 0.10 mm162.75 ± 0.24 mm16<0.05SlopeaAveraged from individual experiments.1.29 ± 0.10161.91 ± 0.1216<0.05t½0.44 ± 0.02 s60.86 ± 0.08 s25<0.05Peak amplitude0.89 ± 0.05220.55 ± 0.0332<0.05a Averaged from individual experiments.

Equilibrium binding experiments were carried out following 10-fold dilution with 0.1% CHAPS in the binding buffer, and results were compared with controls with no CHAPS in the binding buffer. Scatchard plot analysis showed that B max for the solubilized protein was significantly lower than that for controls (3.6 versus 7.7 pmol of ryanodine/mg of protein) (p < 0.05) with no alteration of K d (Fig.4 A and TableII). Although 0.1% CHAPS in binding buffer has been reported to stabilize [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR (30Needleman D.H. Hamilton S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), our observation of a decrease in the number of high affinity binding sites suggested that endogenous lipid molecules were stripped away from the solubilized RyR protein and replaced by CHAPS molecules (31Hulme E.C. Receptor Biochemistry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press/Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar). To avoid the formation of a preponderance of CHAPS:RyR protein micelles, we tested the effect of addition of exogenous phospholipids, since PC has been used to stabilize the cardiac ryanodine receptor during its purification from dog heart sarcoplasmic reticulum in the presence of CHAPS (22Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15637-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of 5 mg/ml PC in the solubilization buffer led to a higher recovery of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding sites. We observed aB max of 11.8 pmol/mg of protein with an unchanged K d (Fig. 4 A and Table II), indicating that the ryanodine binding function could be preserved by increasing the phospholipid concentration to form mixed micelles (detergent:protein:phospholipid).Table II[3H]Ryanodine binding to native and recombinant RyR1RyR1B maxK dpmol/mg proteinnmNativeControl7.7 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.5+CHAPS3.6 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 when compared with control.

https://openalex.org/W2066680593,"In the accompanying paper, we demonstrated the presence of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the tryptophans of the melibiose permease (MelB) of Escherichia coli and a fluorescent sugar, 2′-(N-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)aminoethyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Dns2-S-Gal) bound at the sugar-binding site (Maehrel, C., Cordat, E., Mus-Veteau, I., and Leblanc, G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 33192–33197). To identify the tryptophans that transfer their energy to the fluorescent sugar, we analyzed the FRET properties of MelB mutants carrying the replacement of each of the eight MelB tryptophans by a phenylalanine. The data indicate that Trp64, localized in loop 2–3 from the N-terminal domain, and Trp299, localized in helix IX in the C-terminal domain, are responsible for up to 80% of the FRET signal. Moreover, by assuming that only Trp299 transfers energy to Dns2-S-Gal in mutant W64F, whereas only Trp64transfers energy to Dns2-S-Gal in mutant W299F, we calculated that Trp299 and Trp64 are about 14 and 20 Å away from the probe, respectively. In addition, we observed that mutating Trp342, localized in helix X of the C-terminal domain, produces a significant increase of the polarity of the fluorescent sugar environment, suggesting its proximity to the sugar-binding site. Taken together, these data provide additional support for the suggestion that (i) the sugar-binding site is localized in the C-terminal part of the transporter, probably close to membrane segments IX and X, and (ii) the N-terminal domain, and particularly cytoplasmic loop 2–3, is also close to the sugar-binding site.

Leclercq S. Brandolin G. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy studies have already been used to show that binding of sodium ion and sugar to purified MelB reconstituted in proteoliposomes induces selective and cooperative changes of the transporter conformation (3Mus-Veteau I.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a useful tool for detecting structural changes and also for determining the relative distance between intrinsic and/or extrinsic chromophores within soluble or membrane proteins (8Chabbert M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this approach was used to analyze the cosubstrate-induced structural change of MelB in inverted membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes by looking at the binding and spectroscopic properties of the fluorescent sugar 2′-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Dns2-S-Gal) or two related analogs (15Maehrel C.

We reported that on irradiating MelB tryptophan residues at 297 nm, a Dns2-S-Gal-dependent fluorescence signal at around 465 nm is recorded upon addition of sodium ions. The data suggest that at least part of the MelB structure variation induced by the ions takes place at or close to the sugar-binding site, a change that results in an increase of the hydrophobicity of the environment of this catalytic domain of MelB. In the present study, we extend the analysis of the FRET signal that occurs when MelB interacts with Dns2-S-Gal with the aims of identifying the tryptophanyl residues acting as donors in the FRET phenomenon and of localizing more precisely the sugar-binding region of the transporter. To this end, a systematic mutagenesis of the transporter tryptophans was undertaken, and the FRET signal recorded from the different mutants was compared with that of wild-type permease. This analysis led to the evaluation of the distances separating the two main donor tryptophans and the fluorescent sugar. The relationship between the position of these Trp residues and the localization of the sugar in the transporter is discussed. p-Nitrophenyl α-d-6-[3H]galactopyranoside (α-[3H]NPG) was synthesized by Dr. B. Rousseau in our department. Dodecyl maltoside was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin was from Qiagen, Inc. Bio-Beads SM-2 were from Bio-Rad. Total E. coli lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. The dansyl galactoside Dns2-S-Gal was provided by H. R.

Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Primers (27–31 nucleotides) complementary to the sense strand of melB harboring the appropriate codon substitution (TGG → TTT) were used to replace each of the eight Trp residues with a phenylalanine. AnEcoRI-KpnI DNA fragment from pBS95HB DNAs harboring the appropriate substitution was subcloned in pK95ΔAHB, and its sequence was verified by dideoxy sequencing (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R.

They were then resuspended in a medium containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) and 10 mm NaCl or LiCl, and incubated at 20 °C for 1 min under a stream of oxygen. Transport reactions were initiated by the addition of either [3H]melibiose (20 mCi/mmol) or [14C]TMG (3 mCi/mmol) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The reactions were terminated after 10 min by a rapid dilution followed by immediate filtration (19Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 31: 698-709Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sugar binding was assayed on inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer containing α-[3H]NPG (0.8 Ci/mmol) (15Maehrel C. Cordat E.

(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C with a LS50B Perkin Elmer spectrofluorometer. Experiments were carried out with inverted membrane vesicles (400 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol or with briefly sonicated proteoliposomes (20 μg of protein/ml) resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) and 10 mmNaCl as described in Ref. 15Maehrel C.

Energy transfer efficiency (E) was calculated by measuring the integrated area of the Trp emission peak between 310 and 400 nm for a donor/acceptor ratio of 1. The distance between donor (Trp) and acceptor (Dns2-S-Gal) (R), is related with the energy transfer efficiency (E) by the equations, R=R0(1/E−1)1/6Equation 1 E=(FD−FDA)/FDEquation 2 where F D and F DA are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the acceptor (Dns2-S-Gal), respectively (21Lakowicz J.R. Hercules D.M. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). R 0is the Förster critical distance at which E = 0.5 and is calculated from the equation, R0=9786(κ2n−4QDJ)1/6Equation 3 where n is the refractive index of the medium between donor and acceptor, which was taken to be 1.4 for proteins in water (21Lakowicz J.R. Hercules D.M. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). κ2 describes the orientation of the donor and acceptor; the generally accepted value of 23 was used on the basis of the assumption of random tumbling of fluorophores (9Chapman E.R. Alexander K. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Q D is the quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor and was determined for each mutant protein, W64F and W299F, using (22Epps D.E. Poorman R. Hui J. Carlson W. Heinrikson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10570-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the equation, QD=QRF(ID/IRF)(ARF/AD)Equation 4 where I D and I RF are the fluorescence intensities of the donor (the protein) and reference compound (solution of l-Trp), respectively.A D and A RF are the absorbances of the donor and reference compound, respectively. Q RFis the quantum yield of the reference compound l-tryptophan and was taken to be 0.14 (8Chabbert M. Lukas T.J. Watterson D.M. Axelsen P.H. Prendergast F.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7615-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The overlap integral J was calculated from the degree of overlap between tryptophan emission and Dns2-S-Gal absorbance spectra using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the equation, J=ΣF(λ)ɛ(λ)λ4Δλ/ΣF(λ)ΔλEquation 5 where F(λ) is the donor emission spectrum, ε(λ) is the extinction coefficient of acceptor, and λ is the wavelength in centimeters. We previously showed that replacing the two C-terminal Trp residues, 299 (in helix IX) and 342 (in helix X) (Fig.1), is without effect on the transport or sugar-binding activity of MelB (7Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Their implication in the FRET between Trp and dansyl galactoside Dns2-S-Gal was analyzed in IMVs containing MelB carrying the mutations W299F, W342F, or W299F/W342F, or wild-type MelB as a control (Fig.2). The IMVs were incubated in a medium containing 50 mm NaCl and Dns2-S-Gal at a concentration corresponding to 5 times its correspondingK d value. The samples were excited at 297 ± 5 nm, and the emission signal was recorded between 400 and 570 nm (15Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in the accompanying study (15Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the specific Dns2-S-Gal emission signals from each permease can be obtained from the difference between the spectra recorded before and after addition of melibiose at 60 mm. Meaningful comparison of the specific FRET signal recorded from each mutant or wild-type MelB were normalized for variation in the amount of permeases occupied by Dns2-S-Gal molecules. This was achieved by first measuring the fluorescence signal in response to a direct probe excitation at 335 nm in each sample to get an estimate of the Dns2-S-Gal/transporter complexes formed. Then, the mutant to wild-type signal ratios were used as a normalizing factor to correct the specific FRET signal recorded from each sample excited at 297 nm.Figure 2Contribution of the two C-terminal Trp residues of MelB to the FRET phenomenon. E. coli DW2-R cells transformed with the given plasmids were used to prepare IMVs harboring wild-type, W299F, W342F, or W299F/W342F permease (15Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). IMVs (0.4 mg/ml), equilibrated in a Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 50 mm NaCl, were illuminated at 297 ± 5 nm. The Dns2-S-gal emission fluorescence spectra (400–570-nm interval) were recorded first before and after addition of Dns2-S-Gal at a concentration of 5 times the calculatedK d value and then after the addition of 60 mm melibiose as dry powder. Each specific Dns2-S-Gal signal was calculated from the difference between the spectra recorded before and after addition of melibiose and normalized for variations of the fraction of MelB-Dns2-S-Gal complexes as explained in the text. Each corrected spectrum is the mean of three spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 2 shows that IMVs carrying mutant W299F and irradiated at 297 nm give a Dns2-S-Gal FRET signal about 60% of that recorded from wild-type vesicles. As the signal λem[max] is not changed on mutating Trp299, it may be concluded that this residue contributes 40% of the FRET phenomenon observed in wild-type permease. Mutation of Trp342 has a more drastic effect (Fig. 2). The FRET signal recorded from W342F is only 30% of that measured on wild-type MelB and the signal λem[max]value recorded from this mutant is shifted from 470 to 500 nm. Thus, replacing Trp342 with a phenylalanine enhances the polarity of the Dns2-S-Gal environment. The difference in the emission properties (λem[max], quantum yield) of the probe interacting with W342F or wild-type MelB makes hazardous any comparison of the wild-type and mutant FRET signal intensities. Finally, a significant Dns2-S-Gal signal was still observed (30%) in the W299F/W342F mutant without the two C-terminal Trp residues (Fig. 2). This observation suggests that some Trp residues of the N-terminal domain also contribute to the FRET phenomenon. In order to identify which of the six N-terminal Trp residues are responsible for the residual signal observed after replacement of the two C-terminal Trps, MelB mutants carrying a single replacement of the Trp at position 54, 64, 73, 79, 116, or 128 by a phenylalanine were engineered. Immunoblot analyses indicated that the permease content of IMVs harboring the mutants or wild-type MelB did not vary by more than 20% (data not shown). Transport assays in the presence of either H+, Na+, or Li+ first showed that all mutant cells retain the capacity to accumulate melibiose. In addition, none of the mutations significantly modifies the ionic selectivity profile of MelB (Fig. 3). It was also observed that all cells except W128F kept the ability to transport TMG (data not shown). Studies of the binding of the high affinity ligand αNPG demonstrated that W54F, W64F, W73F, W79F, or wild-type IMVs had similar sugar binding constants (K D = 0.8–1.3 μm) or maximal number of active sites (0.3–0.4 nmol/mg of protein). In contrast, theK D values measured with W116F or W128F IMVs were either higher (3 times) or impossible to estimate. Similar reduction of affinity for Dns2-S-Gal was also observed and makes these two mutants useless for subsequent fluorescence studies. Replacing Trp116 or Trp128 with a tyrosine also impairs αNPG binding (data not shown). As the mutagenesis of Tyr120 produces a similar change (23Zani M.L. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24883-24889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we are currently investigating the functional significance of this common defect. The FRET signal was then recorded from IMVs containing W54F, W64F, W73F, or W79F mutations. W64F permease gave a specific FRET signal 40% smaller than IMVs carrying wild-type MelB (Fig.4). As no change in λem[max] signal was observed, it is concluded that this residue contributes about 40% of the FRET process recorded in wild-type permease. On the other hand, mutation of Trp73 (Fig. 4), Trp54, or Trp79(not illustrated) did not significantly modify either the amplitude or the Dns2-S-Gal signal λem[max]. Overall, these data suggest that of the six N-terminal tryptophans, Trp64 is the only tryptophanyl residue of the N-terminal domain that significantly contributes to the FRET phenomenon. Direct evidence for an energy transfer between either Trp64 or Trp299 and the fluorescent sugar Dns2-S-Gal was investigated on proteoliposomes containing the single mutant W64F or W299F. To this end, we recorded the concomitant decrease (or quenching) of tryptophan fluorescence between 310 and 400 nm and increase in Dns2-S-Gal emission signal between 400 and 570 nm that take place in samples incubated in the presence of 10 μmDns2-S-Gal and excited at 297 nm. The specific tryptophan quenching spectrum and specific fluorescent emission spectrum of Dns2-S-Gal were calculated from the difference between the spectra recorded before and after addition of NaCl and/or addition of melibiose and then normalized to set constant the fraction of permeases occupied by Dns2-S-Gal in all samples. Fig.5 shows that both the Trp quenching signal (left panel) and Dns2-S-Gal signal (right panel) from proteoliposomes containing either W64F or W299F permease were approximately 0.6 times the corresponding signal recorded from wild-type proteoliposomes. This observation confirms that Trp64 or Trp299 individually contributes to 40% of the FRET phenomenon. Thus, Trp residues 64 and 299 appear to donate as much as 80% of the fluorescence energy received by Dns2-S-Gal. Finally, it was observed that the Trp quenching recorded from proteoliposomes containing mutant W342F (Fig. 5) is only 25% that of wild-type permease and that, as previously observed on membrane vesicles, the Dns2-S-Gal signal is also small (25% of the wild-type) and red-shifted. The shift in λem[max] in this mutant makes the comparison with the other single mutants complex. In any case, the reduction of the Trp quenching signal suggests that the amount of fluorescence energy transferred to Dns2-S-Gal is lower in this mutant. Förster energy transfer has been useful for measuring distances in the 10–50-Å range (12Lankiewicz L. Malicka J. Wiczk W. Acta Biochim.

Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). The data from the FRET experiments carried out on the purified mutant W64F (in which the FRET is due to Trp299) or W299F (in which it is due to Trp64) (see Fig. 5) can be used to calculate approximately the distance separating Trp299 or Trp64 from Dns2-S-Gal using the equations given under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental data were taken from three independent FRET experiments in which the protein concentration was varied. From the quenching of the tryptophan emission signal, the efficiency of energy transfer (E) for each Trp-Dns2-S-Gal pair is 92 ± 6% for Trp299 (calculated from the W64F mutant quenching) and 59 ± 9% for Trp64 (calculated from the W299F mutant quenching). The quantum yields of mutants W64F and W299F were calculated, and they averaged 0.105. The overlap integral (J) between the donors and acceptor is 6.25.10−15 cm3m−1. Using a refractive index value (n) of 1.4, generally admitted for proteins, and an orientation factor κ2 of 2/3, the Forster critical distance (R 0) separating Trp and Dns2-S-Gal in MelB was evaluated at 21.5 Å. Using these values, the average distance between Trp299and Dns2-S-Gal was estimated to 13.5 ± 2 Å and that between Trp64 and Dns2-S-Gal to 20 ± 1.5 Å. The present study further documents the fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon taking place between the Trp residues of MelB and a dansyl galactoside (Dns2-S-Gal) on irradiating MelB in native membrane vesicles or in proteoliposomes at 297 nm (15Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tryptophanyl residues acting as energy donors in the FRET process were identified by recording the spectroscopic properties of MelB mutants harboring individual replacement of the eight Trps of the transporter. Overall, the data indicate that two Trp residues contribute most to the fluorescence transfer phenomenon: one is Trp64, located in the N-terminal half of MelB, and the other is Trp299, located in its C-terminal half. Another salient feature is the reduction of hydrophobicity of the Dns2-S-Gal environment that arises on mutating Trp342, located on helix X in the C-terminal region of MelB. Comparison of the Trp contribution to the Trp→Dns-S-Gal FRET phenomenon observed in wild-type MelB is based on individual mutagenesis of MelB Trps and is valid only if the individual Trp substitution has neither a drastic effect on the catalytic properties of MelB nor multiple effects on the FRET process. The two most interesting mutants had a single substitution of Trp64 or Trp299, located in the N- or C-terminal half of MelB, respectively. The corresponding mutants W64F and W299F have sugar binding and transport properties similar to those of wild-type MelB (Fig. 3). They also display specific FRET signals with a maximal emission wavelength (λem[max]) close to that of the wild-type signal (Figs. 2 and 5). More important, the specific Trp quenching signal (interval, 310–400 nm) and the specific Dns2-S-Gal signal recorded from each mutant are both reduced by 40% with respect to that of wild-type MelB (Figs. 2, 4, and5). These data demonstrate a nonradiative transfer of the quanta from the donors Trp64 and Trp299 to the acceptor Dns2-S-Gal, implying a close proximity between each Trp and the probe (10Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4908) Google Scholar, 13Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). They also indicate that Trp64 and Trp299 are the major energy donors in the Trp→Dns-S-Gal FRET process and together account for up to 80% of the observed FRET signal in the native transporter. From the above conclusion, it follows that some of the remaining five residues should be responsible for 20% of the FRET signal. The Dns2-S-Gal emission signal of mutants W54F, W73F, and W79F was at the most only 10% lower than that recorded from wild-type MelB. These three Trps from the N-terminal domain are therefore not significantly participating in the FRET process observed on native MelB. The contribution of the three last Trps of MelB, namely Trp116, Trp128, and Trp342, could not be ascertained either because W116F and W128F have reduced affinities for the probe or because mutagenesis of Trp342leads to too complex effects on the Dns2-S-Gal signal. The existence of a fluorescence energy transfer between Trp64 and Dns2-S-Gal or Trp299 and Dns2-S-Gal implies that the tryptophanyl residues are at a distance varying from 10 to 50 Å from the fluorescent sugar reporter (10Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4908) Google Scholar, 13Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). By assuming that Trp299 is the sole energy donor in mutant W64F and that Trp64 was alone in transferring energy to Dns2-S-Gal in mutant W299F, we calculated a Trp64-probe distance of about 20 Å and a Trp299-probe distance of about 14 Å. In our study, however, the calculated distances should be taken as approximations as they rely on the assumption that only Trp299 and Trp64 are responsible for the fluorescence energy transfer phenomenon and were computed by using averaged values for quantum yields Q D and κ2. In this respect, the data from the literature suggest that the error in the distance approximation should not exceed 20% (12Lankiewicz L. Malicka J. Wiczk W. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1997; 44: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The observation that Trp64 in the cytoplasmic loop connecting helices II and III is 20 Å away from the probe suggests that this N-terminal loop is close to the sugar-binding site. Similarly, the 14 Å distance between Trp299 (on helix IX) and the probe suggests that this C-terminal helix may be even closer to it. In this context, the specific change of environment of the fluorescent sugar observed on mutating Trp342 is also of interest for the identification of the MelB domains forming or close to the sugar-binding site. Thus, the signal λem[max] of mutant W342F is about 30 nm higher than that of wild-type permease (Figs. 2 and 5), suggesting that the dansyl moiety of the fluorescent probe in this mutant is surrounded by a more polar environment than in the wild-type MelB (26Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Taking into account that Trp342 is located on helix X (27Pourcher T. Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4161-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that in the probe, the dansyl and sugar are separated by a 2-carbon spacer, we conclude that helix X, like helix IX, lines the sugar site or is very close to it. Taken together, these data are consistent with earlier conclusions drawn from intrinsic fluorescence studies of MelB suggesting that the sugar-binding site is preferentially located in the C-terminal part of the transporter. At the same time, cytoplasmic loop 2–3 appears to be one of the N-terminal domains that we concluded are close to the sugar site (7Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12053-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Raymonde Lemonnier for skillful technical assistance and Umberto Banderali for assistance with the calculation of the FRET distances and helpful discussions."

Despite rapid advances in our understanding of cytokine biology in recent years, definitive knowledge of the cytokine cell signaling pathways remains elusive due to the enormous complexity of these pathways and the lack of specific biological tools and reagents. Using highly specific antisense oligonucleotides that target the mRNA encoding c-Raf kinase and Ha-Ras, we show here that inhibition of c-raf and Ha-ras expression blocks the up-regulation of E-selectin and vascular adhesion molecule-1 induced by TNFα in endothelial cells. Induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was also reduced, although to a much lesser extent, by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides. We also show that inhibition of c-raf kinase expression decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase stimulation by TNFα. Furthermore, antisense inhibition of JNK2 also blocked TNFα-mediated induction of E-selectin, whereas PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor) had no effect on this process. These results indicate that TNFα induction of E-selectin and vascular adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells occurs through signaling pathways that are, at least in part, dependent on c-Raf kinase, Ha-Ras, and JNK2.

Cytokines represent a diverse group of regulatory proteins with numerous biological functions including cell differentiation, cell growth, and cytotoxity. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFRI and -II, TNF receptor I and II, respectively; HMVEC-d, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; ICAM-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; AP1, activating protein 1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. and interleukin-1 have been shown to play pivotal roles in immune and inflammatory responses (for a review, see Ref. 1McIntyre T.M. Modur V. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One of the most important effector functions of these cytokines is their ability to induce profound changes of the vascular endothelium (for a review, see Ref.2Introna M. Mantovani A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Central to the process of inflammation is the induction of cell adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface that contributes significantly to the adherence and recruitment of circulating leukocytes to inflammatory sites. Upon exposure to TNFα or interleukin-1, which are produced in response to injury or infection, cytokine receptors on endothelial cells activate a variety of intracellular signaling molecules. These signaling events result in the activation of specific transcription factors such as NF-κB and up-regulate the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and other molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 1McIntyre T.M.

E-selectin has been shown to mediate initial attachment and rolling of leukocytes, whereas ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are involved in firm adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes through the vessel walls. E-selectin is rapidly and transiently induced by cytokines, with peak expression occurring approximately 4–6 h after exposure and returning to basal levels approximately 24 h postexposure. In contrast, induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by cytokines is slower and persists for 24 h or longer (for reviews, see Refs. 3Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vecchi A. Introna M. Allavena P. Thromb.

Responses to TNFα are mediated through interactions with two distinct membrane receptors, termed TNFα receptor I (TNFRI) and TNFα receptor II (TNFRII). The two receptors share similar cysteine-rich motifs in their extracellular domains (for a review, see Ref. 6Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). However, the fact that their intracellular regions share little sequence homology suggests the existence of distinct signaling mechanisms and biological functions for the two receptors. TNFα has been shown to be able to activate a variety of intracellular protein kinases, phosphatases, phospholipases, proteases, reactive oxygen intermediates, and other signaling proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 2Introna M.

The lack of enzymatic motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of TNFα receptors suggests that receptor-associated proteins are involved in downstream signal transduction. During the past few years, two distinct families of adaptor proteins associated with TNFα receptors have been identified. The death domain-containing proteins appear to couple the receptors to programmed cell death (7Fiers W. Beyaert R. Boone E. Cornelis S. Declercq W. Decoster E. Denecker G. Depuydt B. De Valck D.

Among the six members of the TNF receptor-associated factor family that have been identified so far, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 has been reported to be important for TNFα-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as two major transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) (9Hsu H.

Both transcription factors play pivotal roles in the regulation of multiple genes including those involved in immune and inflammatory responses. AP-1 is activated by various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK, and p38 MAPK (for reviews, see Refs. 7Fiers W. Beyaert R. Boone E.

NF-κB, a heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits, is constitutively present in the cytosol of endothelial cells and kept inactive by association with inhibitory IκB family proteins. Upon exposure to TNFα, IκB kinase phosphorylates IκB and initiates its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The released NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and participates in transcriptional activation (15Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T.

In this report, we have investigated the roles of ras andraf kinase in TNFα signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Using highly specific antisense oligonucleotides that target the mRNA encoding c-Raf and Ha-Ras, we show that inhibition of c-Raf and Ha-Ras expression blocks the up-regulation of E-selectin and VCAM-1 induced by TNFα in endothelial cells. Induction of ICAM-1 by TNFα was also inhibited by c-raf and Ha-ras antisense oligonucleotides, although the magnitude of inhibition was reduced relative to E-selectin and VCAM-1. c-Raf inhibition also blocked the activation of both ERK and JNK by TNFα, whereas it had little effect on p38 MAPK activity. Furthermore, antisense inhibition of JNK2 also blocked TNFα-mediated induction of E-selectin, whereas PD98059 (MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor) had no effect on this process. These results indicate that cytokine stimulation of E-selectin and other cell adhesion molecules occurs through signaling pathways that are at least partially dependent on c-Raf, Ha-Ras, and JNK2.

Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (31Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bennett C.F. Chiang M. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was quantified and normalized to G3PDH mRNA levels using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) PhosphorImager (31Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol.

For determination of protein levels by Western blot, cellular extracts were prepared using 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay extraction buffer/100-mm dish. The protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad kit. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel (Novex, San Diego, CA). Once transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the membranes were then treated for a minimum of 2 h with specific primary antibody followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (New England Biolabs). In some experiments, the blots were stripped in stripping buffer (2% SDS, 12.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 50 °C. After extensive washing, the blots were blocked and blotted with different primary antibody. Cells were treated with oligonucleotides and induced with cytokines as described under “Results.” At the indicated time, cells were lysed on ice, and debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Lysate containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with primary antibody-agarose conjugates (ERK and p38 assay), or with JNK1-specific or JNK2-specific antibodies (JNK assay) overnight at 4 °C. For isoform-specific JNK assays, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with agarose beads was added to cell extracts following JNK antibody treatment and wash steps and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer and kinase buffer, the pelleted beads were incubated with 1 μg of substrate (Elk-1 for ERK, ATF-2 for p38, and c-Jun for JNK MAPK) and 100 μm of ATP for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer followed by boiling. The samples were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Western blot with antibodies specific for phosphorylated substrates (New England Biolabs) was carried out. The results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Following oligonucleotide treatment, cells were detached from the plates and analyzed for surface expression of cell adhesion molecules using a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) FACScan as described previously (33Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surface expression was calculated using the mean value of fluorescence intensity using 3000–5000 cells stained with the appropriate antibody for each sample and time point. Results are expressed as a percentage of control (cell surface expression induced by TNFα in cells that were not treated with oligonucleotides) based upon mean fluorescence intensity. Basal expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 is undetectable in the absence of TNFα, whereas a low level of basal expression is detectable for ICAM-1. ISIS 12854 is a 2′-O-methoxyethyl mixed backbone chimeric antisense oligonucleotide designed to hybridize with 3′-untranslated sequences contained within human c-Raf mRNA. It has previously been shown to inhibit c-Raf mRNA and protein expression in human tumor cells (30Monia B.P. Anti-cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this antisense oligonucleotide is effective as a c-Raf inhibitor in endothelial cells, HMVEC-d were treated with ISIS 12854. c-Raf mRNA and protein expression was examined by Northern and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment of HMVEC-d with the c-Raf antisense inhibitor resulted in dramatically reduced c-Raf mRNA levels. Reduction of c-Raf mRNA levels was dose-dependent in the range of 0.5–200 nm. The IC50 for c-Raf mRNA reduction was approximately 2.5 nm (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 C, reduction of c-Raf protein levels also occurred following oligonucleotide treatment. Reduction in protein expression was first detectable 24 h after treatment, and maximal reduction of c-Raf protein levels was achieved 48 h after treatment with 150 nm oligonucleotide. Reduction of c-Raf protein levels persisted up to 72 h following initial treatment. The inhibition of c-Raf expression by ISIS 12854 was specific, since a-rafprotein expression was largely unaffected when the same blot was stripped and blotted with antibody against a-raf. The control oligonucleotide did not exhibit any effect on c-Raf mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 1). ISIS 15168 is a 2′-O-methoxyethyl mixed backbone chimeric antisense oligonucleotide designed to hybridize with sequences contained within the human Ha-Ras mRNA. The sequence of ISIS 15168 is the same as ISIS 2503, a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide that has previously been described (31Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ISIS 15168 on Ha-ras expression in endothelial cells, HMVEC-d were treated with oligonucleotide, and Northern blot was performed to measure Ha-Ras mRNA levels. Reduction of Ha-Ras mRNA levels in HMVEC-d was observed following oligonucleotide treatment and was found to be target-specific, sequence-specific, and dose-dependent (IC50 < 5 nm) (Fig.2). Levels of Ki-ras mRNA were not affected by treatment with ISIS 15168. To examine the effect of ISIS 15168 on Ha-Ras protein levels, total ras protein was immunoprecipitated using a pan-ras monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Ha-Ras protein levels were determined by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody specific for Ha-Ras. Dose-dependent reduction of Ha-Ras protein expression was observed 48 h following treatment with the Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 C). This reduction persisted up to 72 h following initial treatment. The kinetics of Ha-Ras reduction was slower than that of c-Raf. A control oligonucleotide had no effect on Ha-Ras protein level. The same blot was stripped and blotted a second time with a Ki-ras-specific antibody. No effect on Ki-ras protein levels was observed in cells treated with either the Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotide or the control oligonucleotide. To study the role of c-Raf kinase and Ha-Ras in cytokine signaling in endothelial cells, the effect of c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotide treatment on the induction of E-selectin by TNFα was examined. HMVEC-d were treated with either the c-Raf or Ha-Ras antisense compound under dose-response conditions or over time at a single dose level followed by stimulation of E-selectin expression by TNFα for 5 h. The cell surface expression of E-selectin was determined by flow cytometry analysis. Dose-dependent inhibition of E-selectin cell surface expression was observed in cells treated with both antisense compounds (Fig. 3 A). Maximal inhibition of E-selectin induction for the two antisense compounds was approximately 80% for the c-Raf oligonucleotide and 60% for the Ha-Ras oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A). Control oligonucleotides exhibited little to no effect on E-selectin induction. These results suggest that reduction of c-Raf or Ha-Ras protein levels blocked the induction of E-selectin by TNFα in HMVEC-d. To provide further support for the conclusion that inhibition of E-selectin induction by c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotides was dependent on the reduction of c-Raf and Ha-Ras protein levels, the effects of c-Raf, Ha-Ras, and an E-selectin antisense oligonucleotide (33Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540PubMed Google Scholar) on TNFα-induced E-selectin cell surface expression under kinetic conditions were examined. If the inhibition of E-selectin induction by the c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense compounds were truly dependent on the reduction of c-Raf and Ha-Ras protein levels, the kinetics of inhibition of E-selectin induction by the antisense compounds should correlate with suppression of c-Raf and Ha-Ras protein levels (which is dependent on the half-lives of the proteins in cells). In contrast, inhibition of E-selectin induction using the E-selectin antisense oligonucleotide should occur much more quickly, since this inhibitor blocks E-selectin induction directly. To test this, cells were treated with the three antisense oligonucleotides separately and allowed to recover prior to TNFα treatment. TNFα was added at different time points between 12 and 72 h following oligonucleotide treatment. E-selectin cell surface expression was measured by flow cytometry analysis after 5 h of TNFα treatment. Treatment of cells with the E-selectin antisense oligonucleotide effectively inhibited the induction of E-selectin 8 h after the initiation of oligonucleotide treatment (data not shown). Concentrations as low as 20 nm of the E-selectin oligonucleotide were found to block 80% of E-selectin cell surface expression 12 h following treatment (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, maximal inhibition of E-selectin induction by c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense compounds was observed 48 h following antisense treatment. Some inhibition of E-selectin induction was observed at 12 h following treatment, but this inhibition was clearly not maximal. No inhibition of E-selectin induction was observed at earlier time points following c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense treatment (data not shown). Considering that the half-life of c-Raf has been reported to be approximately 14 h (35Mandiyan S. Schumacher C. Cioffi C. Sharif H. Yuryev A. Lappe R. Monia B. Hanson S. Goff S. Wennogle L. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it is not surprising to observe relatively inefficient inhibition of E-selectin induction at early time points following treatment with the c-Raf antisense oligonucleotide. These results strongly suggest that inhibition of E-selectin induction by TNFα in HMVEC-d following treatment with c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotides is a consequence of reduced c-Raf and Ha-Ras protein levels. The results discussed above indicate that c-Raf and Ha-Ras activities are important for the induction of E-selectin by TNFα. TNFα induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in cells treated with c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotides was also examined to further define the roles of c-Raf and Ha-Ras in cytokine signaling. As shown in Fig.4, induction of ICAM-1 by TNFα was also blocked by c-Raf and Ha-Ras antisense oligonucleotides, although to a much lesser extent with maximal inhibition below 50%"

The present studies were designed to evaluate how acquisition and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides play a role in the functional maturation of human TSHR. A glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, which inhibits the first step of N-linked glycosylation (acquisition of N-linked oligosaccharides), and a series of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-Lec cells defective in the different steps of glycosylation processing were used. Inhibition of acquisition of N-linked oligosaccharides by tunicamycin treatment in CHO cells stably expressing TSHR produced nonglycosylated TSHR, which was totally nonfunctional. In contrast, all of the TSHRs synthesized in mutant CHO-Lec1, 2, and 8 cells (mannose-rich, sialic acid-deficient, and galactose-deficient oligosaccharides, respectively) bound TSH and produced cAMP in response to TSH with an affinity and an EC50 similar to those in TSHR expressed in parental CHO cells (CHO-TSHR; sialylated oligosaccharides). However, Lec1-TSHR and Lec2-TSHR were not efficiently expressed on the cell surface, whereas the expression levels of Lec8-TSHR and CHO-TSHR were essentially identical. All of the TSHRs expressed in CHO-Lec cells cleaved into two subunits. Finally, anti-TSHR autoantibodies from Graves' patients interacted with all of the TSHRs harboring different oligosaccharides to a similar extent. These data demonstrate that acquisition and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides of TSHR appear to be essential for correct folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and for cell surface targeting in the Golgi apparatus. We also show that complex type carbohydrates are not crucially involved in the interaction of TSHR with TSH and anti-TSHR autoantibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2151060925,"Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) are homodimeric enzymes that NADPH-dependently convertl-arginine to nitric oxide andl-citrulline. Interestingly, all NOS also require (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4Bip) for maximal activity although the mechanism is not fully understood. Basal NOS activity, i.e. that in the absence of exogenous H4Bip, has been attributed to enzyme-associated H4Bip. To elucidate further H4Bip function in purified NOS, we developed two types of pterin-based NOS inhibitors, termed anti-pterins. In contrast to type II anti-pterins, type I anti-pterins specifically displaced enzyme-associated H4Bip and inhibited H4Bip-stimulated NOS activity in a fully competitive manner but, surprisingly, had no effect on basal NOS activity. Moreover, for a number of different NOS preparations basal activity (percent ofV max) was frequently higher than the percentage of pterin saturation and was not affected by preincubation of enzyme with H4Bip. Thus, basal NOS activity appeared to be independent of enzyme-associated H4Bip. The lack of intrinsic 4a-pterincarbinolamine dehydratase activity argued against classical H4Bip redox cycling in NOS. Rather, H4Bip was required for both maximal activity and stability of NOS by binding to the oxygenase/dimerization domain and preventing monomerization and inactivation duringl-arginine turnover.

Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), is catalyzed by a family of NO synthases (NOS). So far, three NOS isoforms have been isolated, cloned, and characterized as follows: a neuronal (NOS-I), an inducible (NOS-II), and an endothelial (NOS-III) isoform (4Förstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In view of the multifaceted signaling roles of NO in biology, the molecular mechanisms by which NOS activity is regulated is of primary interest. The different NOS isoforms primarily differ in their mechanisms of activation and expressional regulation (4Förstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, all three NOS isoforms are self-sufficient cytochrome P450-type enzymes containing an intramolecular P450 reductase domain in the C terminus. The latter enables the calmodulin-triggered electron transfer from NADPH via enzyme-bound flavins (FAD and FMN) to the N-terminal heme of the NOS oxygenase domain where the oxidation of l-arginine tol-citrulline and NO, or a derivative, takes place (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to other cytochrome P450/cytochrome P450 reductase systems, all NOS isoforms require in addition to NADPH the presence of another redox-active cofactor, H4Bip (6Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this has remained unclear (8Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and has prevented a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NO synthesis (9Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Clues pertaining to the role of H4Bip may be derived from the catalytic and allosteric roles H4Bip and other pterins play in nature. For example, H4Bip acts catalytically as the sole oxygen acceptor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); for NOS, this role is already fulfilled by the cytochrome P450-type heme (10McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clarke J.E. Masters B.B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study (12Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 299-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) it was shown that heme iron reduction can take place independently of the pterin ring oxidation state. Although this would indicate a requirement for fully reduced pterin at a reaction step beyond heme iron reduction, recent evidence (13Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggests that the reduction of the oxyferroheme complex may be the main function of H4Bip in NOS catalysis. However, if H4Bip participates in the NOS reaction mechanism similar to aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, namely as an electron donating cofactor, one would expect accessory pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) to augment the reaction of H4Bip to quinoid-H2Bip (q-H2Bip) or H4Bip to be recycled by accessory dihydropteridine reductase. Alternatively, NOS may contain intrinsic PCD and dihydropteridine reductase activity. Indeed, some dihydropteridine reductase activity of NOS has been described but requires unphysiologically high concentrations of q-H2Bip, has a low yield (14Witteveen C.F.B. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4143-4147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and is therefore unlikely to take place under physiological conditions.H4Bip can also allosterically regulate the activity of other enzymes (15Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In radioligand binding studies, H4Bip was shown to lower the K D (16Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L.

Schmidt, unpublished observations. 2P. Kotsonis, M. La, A. Reif, and H. H. H. W. Schmidt, unpublished observations.H4Bip was shown to stabilize the axial ligand geometry of the NOS heme iron in NOS-I and NOS-II (17Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, NOS-II requires the presence of H4Bip, heme, andl-arginine for dimer assembly in recombinant protein expression systems (18Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). However, in the case of recombinant NOS-I and NOS-III, dimer formation appears to be pterin-independent and regulated solely by the intracellular availability of heme (19Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Related structural effects of H4Bip that have been described include an increase in temperature stability of NOS-I dimers in the presence of the protein denaturant SDS (16Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and reassembly of urea-dissociated dimers (12Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 299-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, the function of H4Bip in NOS catalysis has remained unclear. In order to address this issue, we have developed a photoaffinity label for the NOS pterin-binding site and pharmacologically characterized novel pterin-derived inhibitors of NOS both in vitro and in intact cells (anti-pterins; see Ref.21.Groehn, V., Faculty of Biology, Ph.D. thesis, 1997, University Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.Google Scholar). NOS-associated H4Bip and the dimerization state of NOS was compared with basal NOS activity. In addition, we investigated the possible PCD dependence or intrinsic PCD activity of NOS.DISCUSSIONThe present study investigates the function of H4Bip in NO synthesis. We developed pterin-derived inhibitors of NOS to characterize the pterin-binding site of native NOS and the mechanism of activation by H4Bip. Enzyme kinetic studies revealed two distinct inhibitor profiles. Type I anti-pterins inhibited the H4Bip-stimulated NOS activity without inhibiting basal NOS activity, i.e. the activity that is observed in the absence of exogenous H4Bip. Previously, basal NOS activity had been generally accepted to be due to tightly bound, endogenous H4Bip that co-purifies with NOS and cannot be readily displaced (43Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Wachter H. Werner-Feldmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the type I anti-pterin PHS-32 under different conditions effectively displaced endogenous pterin (>80%) without any effect on basal enzyme activity. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the basal activity of NOS is H4Bip-independent. The possibility that PHS-32 (a non-aromatic pterin) acted as partial agonist was ruled out by recent studies with pterin-free NOS which is not activated by PHS-32.2In several native and recombinant NOS-I preparations, no correlation between the endogenous H4Bip content and basal initial l-citrulline formation was found. We propose that purified NOS-I is comprised of two conformational states as follows: one is responsible for a H4Bip-independent, basally active enzyme (NOS*), the remaining enzyme (NOS°) is inactive or immediately inactivates in the absence of exogenous H4Bip.In a subsequent series of preincubation experiments, we observed that NOS° cannot be converted to NOS* by a short exposure to H4Bip prior to the activity assay. This excluded again the possibility that binding of H4Bip alone modifies the enzyme and is sufficient to induce basal activity or NOS*. Moreover, since NOS°-specific anti-pterins like PHS-32 were also effective inhibitors of NO synthesis in intact cells, NOS° is not a purification artifact and is physiologically co-expressed with NOS*. The cellular regulation of NOS* and NOS° may be an important mechanism of physiologically controlling NOS activity and may explain some clinical observations. For example, in some patients with phenylketonuria, the underlying cause of this disease is an impaired ability to synthesize H4Bip (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, as these patients do not show symptoms that might be expected if H4Bip deficiency led to decreased NOS activity with consequent impairment in immune function, blood pressure, and neuronal regulation, NOS in these patients might be at least partly independent of H4Bip.In addition, in all enzymes utilizing H4Bip as an electron donor and oxygen acceptor, the intermediate 4a-hydroxypterin is converted to the q-H2Bip. This conversion occurs spontaneously (with some side-reactions to 7,8-H2Bip) and is augmented by PCD. In the present study using NOS-I, PCD failed to increase basal NOS activity, V max, or the affinity for H4Bip. Moreover, NOS-I does not contain PCD activity itself.Since all our above findings collectively suggested that endogenous H4Bip alone is not sufficient to account for basal NOS activity, we investigated other possible roles of H4Bip. When we examined the effect of H4Bip on the native quaternary structure of catalytically active NOS-I, a stabilizing function of H4Bip was revealed.

A. 1991; 88: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and monomerization was only described to occur under denaturing conditions, i.e. in the presence of 4% SDS (16Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) or 5 m urea (12Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 299-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, we observed monomerization to occur also during l-arginine turnover, i.e.under physiological conditions. NOS-I was found to rapidly dissociate into inactive monomers in a time-dependent manner2 correlating with a dramatic loss of activity after 3 min of incubation. The addition of H4Bip prevented both the dissociation into inactive monomers as well as the corresponding loss in activity during turnover. Although dimer stabilization may not explain all of the actions of H4Bip on NOS, it may contribute to the prevention of activity loss after several rounds ofl-arginine turnover, and it is, thus, conceivable that H4Bip is not essential from the start of NOS catalysis. A stabilizing effect of H4Bip is further supported by a recent report showing that H4Bip prevented monomerization of the NOS-IIox domain (44Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The dependence of NOS* on H4Bip after 3 min of incubation may explain why expression of NOS under pterin-free conditions has resulted in less stable enzymes with reduced activity requiring H4Bip from the start (17Wang J.

Most likely, the expression of NOS under these conditions predominantly yields NOS°.In agreement with a stabilizing effect of H4Bip within the catalytic center of NOS, we localized the NOS-I pterin-binding site to a 341-amino acid sequence of the oxygenase/dimerization domain (NOSox; see Ref. 46Siddhanta U.

Interestingly, the N terminus of NOS-I, specific for this isoform, appears to modulate pterin binding. The inclusion of heme in this fragment agrees with an intimate H4Bip-heme-arginine interaction. Recently, the crystal structure of the monomeric NOS-II oxygenase domain (35Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and, while this manuscript was being prepared, additional structural information on the dimeric, pterin-containing oxygenase domain of NOS-II became available (36Crane B.R.

The localization of the pterin-binding site in this domain is in excellent agreement with all our present findings. Taken together, a role of H4Bip in electron transfer and classical H4Bip cycling appears to be unlikely. However, a more recent study suggests that electron transfer, i.e. the reduction of the oxyferroheme complex, is indeed a main function of H4Bip during NOS catalysis although direct heme to heme electron transfer remains a possibility (13Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are needed to resolve this controversy.In summary, H4Bip may act by preventing monomerization during l-arginine turnover without having an essential role in basal NOS activity. This finding contrasts the previously well characterized function of H4Bip as a redox-active cofactor and oxygen acceptor in aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and other enzymes. A PCD-like activity in NOS or PCD-augmented step in NOS catalysis is unlikely. In addition, we provide the first comprehensive report of anti-pterins as a new class of pharmacological lead compounds to modulate cellular NO formation with therapeutic potential in conditions of pathologically high NO formation. Pteridines are widespread cofactors in mammalian cells (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in lower life forms (2Chan M.K. Mukund S. Kletzin A. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), where they generally function as co-substrates or allosteric regulator molecules. For example, the biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-imethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propansulfonate; H2Bip, dihydrobiopterin; H4Bip, 5,6,7,8-l-tetrahydro-l-biopterin; H2Pte, dihydro-pterin; H4Pte, tetrahydro-pterin; N+ NOSox, NOS-I N terminus + oxygenase domain; NOS, NO synthase; NOS*, basally active NOS; NOS°, basally inactive NOS; NOSox, NOS-I oxygenase domain; NOSred, NOS-I reductase domain; PCD, pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase; PHS, anti-pterin code number; Pte, pterin; q-H2Bip, quinoid-H2Bip; TEA, triethanolamine. 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-imethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propansulfonate; H2Bip, dihydrobiopterin; H4Bip, 5,6,7,8-l-tetrahydro-l-biopterin; H2Pte, dihydro-pterin; H4Pte, tetrahydro-pterin; N+ NOSox, NOS-I N terminus + oxygenase domain; NOS, NO synthase; NOS*, basally active NOS; NOS°, basally inactive NOS; NOSox, NOS-I oxygenase domain; NOSred, NOS-I reductase domain; PCD, pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase; PHS, anti-pterin code number; Pte, pterin; q-H2Bip, quinoid-H2Bip; TEA, triethanolamine. an important messenger molecule with multiple biological functions in blood vessels, neurons, macrophages, and other cells (3Schmidt H.H.H.W. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), is catalyzed by a family of NO synthases (NOS). So far, three NOS isoforms have been isolated, cloned, and characterized as follows: a neuronal (NOS-I), an inducible (NOS-II), and an endothelial (NOS-III) isoform (4Förstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In view of the multifaceted signaling roles of NO in biology, the molecular mechanisms by which NOS activity is regulated is of primary interest. The different NOS isoforms primarily differ in their mechanisms of activation and expressional regulation (4Förstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, all three NOS isoforms are self-sufficient cytochrome P450-type enzymes containing an intramolecular P450 reductase domain in the C terminus. The latter enables the calmodulin-triggered electron transfer from NADPH via enzyme-bound flavins (FAD and FMN) to the N-terminal heme of the NOS oxygenase domain where the oxidation of l-arginine tol-citrulline and NO, or a derivative, takes place (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other cytochrome P450/cytochrome P450 reductase systems, all NOS isoforms require in addition to NADPH the presence of another redox-active cofactor, H4Bip (6Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this has remained unclear (8Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and has prevented a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NO synthesis (9Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Clues pertaining to the role of H4Bip may be derived from the catalytic and allosteric roles H4Bip and other pterins play in nature. For example, H4Bip acts catalytically as the sole oxygen acceptor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); for NOS, this role is already fulfilled by the cytochrome P450-type heme (10McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clarke J.E. Masters B.B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study (12Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 299-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) it was shown that heme iron reduction can take place independently of the pterin ring oxidation state. Although this would indicate a requirement for fully reduced pterin at a reaction step beyond heme iron reduction, recent evidence (13Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggests that the reduction of the oxyferroheme complex may be the main function of H4Bip in NOS catalysis. However, if H4Bip participates in the NOS reaction mechanism similar to aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, namely as an electron donating cofactor, one would expect accessory pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) to augment the reaction of H4Bip to quinoid-H2Bip (q-H2Bip) or H4Bip to be recycled by accessory dihydropteridine reductase. Alternatively, NOS may contain intrinsic PCD and dihydropteridine reductase activity. Indeed, some dihydropteridine reductase activity of NOS has been described but requires unphysiologically high concentrations of q-H2Bip, has a low yield (14Witteveen C.F.B. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4143-4147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and is therefore unlikely to take place under physiological conditions. H4Bip can also allosterically regulate the activity of other enzymes (15Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In radioligand binding studies, H4Bip was shown to lower the K D (16Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, in enzyme kinetic experiments, the K m of NOS forl-arginine. 2P. Kotsonis, M. La, A. Reif, and H. H. H. W. Schmidt, unpublished observations. 2P. Kotsonis, M. La, A. Reif, and H. H. H. W. Schmidt, unpublished observations.H4Bip was shown to stabilize the axial ligand geometry of the NOS heme iron in NOS-I and NOS-II (17Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, NOS-II requires the presence of H4Bip, heme, andl-arginine for dimer assembly in recombinant protein expression systems (18Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). However, in the case of recombinant NOS-I and NOS-III, dimer formation appears to be pterin-independent and regulated solely by the intracellular availability of heme (19Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Related structural effects of H4Bip that have been described include an increase in temperature stability of NOS-I dimers in the presence of the protein denaturant SDS (16Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and reassembly of urea-dissociated dimers (12Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 299-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the function of H4Bip in NOS catalysis has remained unclear. In order to address this issue, we have developed a photoaffinity label for the NOS pterin-binding site and pharmacologically characterized novel pterin-derived inhibitors of NOS both in vitro and in intact cells (anti-pterins; see Ref.21.Groehn, V., Faculty of Biology, Ph.D. thesis, 1997, University Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.Google Scholar). NOS-associated H4Bip and the dimerization state of NOS was compared with basal NOS activity. In addition, we investigated the possible PCD dependence or intrinsic PCD activity of NOS. DISCUSSIONThe present study investigates the function of H4Bip in NO synthesis. We developed pterin-derived inhibitors of NOS to characterize the pterin-binding site of native NOS and the mechanism of activation by H4Bip. Enzyme kinetic studies revealed two distinct inhibitor profiles. Type I anti-pterins inhibited the H4Bip-stimulated NOS activity without inhibiting basal NOS activity, i.e. the activity that is observed in the absence of exogenous H4Bip. Previously, basal NOS activity had been generally accepted to be due to tightly bound, endogenous H4Bip that co-purifies with NOS and cannot be readily displaced (43Werner E.R. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Wachter H. Werner-Feldmayer G. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the type I anti-pterin PHS-32 under different conditions effectively displaced endogenous pterin (>80%) without any effect on basal enzyme activity. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the basal activity of NOS is H4Bip-independent. The possibility that PHS-32 (a non-aromatic pterin) acted as partial agonist was ruled out by recent studies with pterin-free NOS which is not activated by PHS-32.2In several native and recombinant NOS-I preparations, no correlation between the endogenous H4Bip content and basal initial l-citrulline formation was found. We propose that purified NOS-I is comprised of two conformational states as follows: one is responsible for a H4Bip-independent, basally active enzyme (NOS*), the remaining enzyme (NOS°) is inactive or immediately inactivates in the absence of exogenous H4Bip.In a subsequent series of preincubation experiments, we observed that NOS° cannot be converted to NOS* by a short exposure to H4Bip prior to the activity assay. This excluded again the possibility that binding of H4Bip alone modifies the enzyme and is sufficient to induce basal activity or NOS*. Moreover, since NOS°-specific anti-pterins like PHS-32 were also effective inhibitors of NO synthesis in intact cells, NOS° is not a purification artifact and is physiologically co-expressed with NOS*. The cellular regulation of NOS* and NOS° may be an important mechanism of physiologically controlling NOS activity and may explain some clinical observations. For example, in some patients with phenylketonuria, the underlying cause of this disease is an impaired ability to synthesize H4Bip (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, as these patients do not show symptoms that might be expected if H4Bip deficiency led to decreased NOS activity with consequent impairment in immune function, blood pressure, and neuronal regulation, NOS in these patients might be at least partly independent of H4Bip.In addition, in all enzymes utilizing H4Bip as an electron donor and oxygen acceptor, the intermediate 4a-hydroxypterin is converted to the q-H2Bip. This conversion occurs spontaneously (with some side-reactions to 7,8-H2Bip) and is augmented by PCD. In the present study using NOS-I, PCD failed to increase basal NOS activity, V max, or the affinity for H4Bip. Moreover, NOS-I does not contain PCD activity itself.Since all our above findings collectively suggested that endogenous H4Bip alone is not sufficient to account for basal NOS activity, we investigated other possible roles of H4Bip. When we examined the effect of H4Bip on the native quaternary structure of catalytically active NOS-I, a stabilizing function of H4Bip was revealed. Purified NOS-I exists as a stable homodimer (27Schmidt H.H.H.W. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Gorsky L.D. Förstermann U. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A stabilizing effect of H4Bip is further supported by a recent report showing that H4Bip prevented monomerization of the NOS-IIox domain (44Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The dependence of NOS* on H4Bip after 3 min of incubation may explain why expression of NOS under pterin-free conditions has resulted in less stable enzymes with reduced activity requiring H4Bip from the start (17Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,20List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem.

A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Most likely, the expression of NOS under these conditions predominantly yields NOS°. In agreement with a stabilizing effect of H4Bip within the catalytic center of NOS, we localized the NOS-I pterin-binding site to a 341-amino acid sequence of the oxygenase/dimerization domain (NOSox; see Ref. 46Siddhanta U.

Interestingly, the N terminus of NOS-I, specific for this isoform, appears to modulate pterin binding. The inclusion of heme in this fragment agrees with an intimate H4Bip-heme-arginine interaction. Recently, the crystal structure of the monomeric NOS-II oxygenase domain (35Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and, while this manuscript was being prepared, additional structural information on the dimeric, pterin-containing oxygenase domain of NOS-II became available (36Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The localization of the pterin-binding site in this domain is in excellent agreement with all our present findings. Taken together, a role of H4Bip in electron transfer and classical H4Bip cycling appears to be unlikely. However, a more recent study suggests that electron transfer, i.e. the reduction of the oxyferroheme complex, is indeed a main function of H4Bip during NOS catalysis although direct heme to heme electron transfer remains a possibility (13Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are needed to resolve this controversy. In summary, H4Bip may act by preventing monomerization during l-arginine turnover without having an essential role in basal NOS activity. This finding contrasts the previously well characterized function of H4Bip as a redox-active cofactor and oxygen acceptor in aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and other enzymes. A PCD-like activity in NOS or PCD-augmented step in NOS catalysis is unlikely.

Fluorescence signals of β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 substituted in catalytic sites were used to determine nucleotide binding parameters. Azide brought about small decreases inKd(MgATP) andKd(MgADP). Notably, under MgATP hydrolysis conditions, it caused all enzyme molecules to assume a state with three catalytic site-bound MgATP and zero bound MgADP. These results rule out the idea that azide inhibits by “trapping” MgADP. Rather, azide blocks the step at which signal transmission between catalytic sites promotes multisite hydrolysis. Aurovertin bound with stoichiometry of 1.8 (mol/mol of F1) and allowed significant residual turnover. Cycling of the aurovertin-free β-subunit catalytic site through three normal conformations was indicated by MgATP binding data. Aurovertin did not change the normal ratio of 1 bound MgATP/2 bound MgADP in catalytic sites. The results indicate that it acts to slow the switch of catalytic site affinities (“binding change step”) subsequent to MgATP hydrolysis. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide shifted the ratio of catalytic site-bound MgATP/MgADP from 1:2 to 1.6:1.4, without affectingKd(MgATP) values.

F1-ATPase is the catalytic moiety of F1F0-ATP synthase, the membrane enzyme that carries out ATP synthesis in mitochondria, bacteria, and chloroplasts and also ATP-driven proton pumping in bacteria. It contains three catalytic sites, located primarily on β-subunits, which show strong binding cooperativity with substrates MgATP and MgADP and show strong positive catalytic cooperativity. The recent discovery of ATP-driven rotation of the central γ-subunit relative to the α3β3 subunit hexagon proved that the catalytic sites act in sequential manner during catalysis and gave strong impetus to studies of the catalytic mechanism (for reviews see Refs. 1Nakamoto R.K.

Their exact modes of action are not yet clear, so it is of interest to study them further for the purpose of understanding the inhibitory mechanisms. We have developed substituted Trp probes that specifically report binding of nucleotides to catalytic sites in Escherichia coli F1-ATPase under true equilibrium conditions and during catalysis. One is β-Trp-331. It has a very large fluorescence signal, which is totally quenched upon binding of MgATP or MgADP in catalytic sites (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

It can be used to measure parameters such as nucleotide binding stoichiometry and affinity under a wide variety of conditions. A second probe is β-Trp-148, whose fluorescence signal changes depending upon whether nucleoside di- or triphosphate is bound in the catalytic sites, thereby allowing discrimination of catalytic site-bound MgATP from MgADP (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Combined use of these two Trp probes has led to a proposal for the catalytic mechanism of F1-ATPase (2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in which enzyme molecules cycle through four states, each containing two or three bound nucleotides, with the bound nucleotide species (MgATP or MgADP) in each of the three catalytic sites defined for each state. In this paper, we have studied the effects of the inhibitors azide, DCCD, and aurovertin on nucleotide binding properties of F1-ATPase using these two Trp probes. The results provide improved understanding of the mechanism of action of the inhibitors, and in the case of azide, the results are in clear contradiction of a current school of thought. Wild-type F1 was from strain SWM1 (8Rao R. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5569-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), βY331W mutant F1 from strain SWM4 (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and βF148W mutant F1 from strain CB1 (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purification of F1 was as described by Weber et al. (9Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, the enzymes were passed twice through 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0 as described (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to effectively remove catalytic site-bound nucleotide. Nucleotide-depleted F1 (depleted of both catalytic site-bound and noncatalytic site-bound nucleotide) was prepared as described by Senior et al. (10Senior A.E. Lee R.S-F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All manipulations were done at room temperature. Enzyme (20 μg/ml, 52 nm) was preincubated in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, in the presence or absence of 10 mm sodium azide or 10 μm aurovertin for 15 min. (Nucleotide additions during preincubation are described below.) NaATP (10 mm) and MgSO4 (4 mm) were added to start the reaction, which was terminated after 4 min by the addition of an equal volume of 10% (w/v) SDS. Pi released was assayed colorimetrically (11Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Covalent modification with DCCD was as described by Weber et al. (5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay of activity was as above except that DCCD-modified F1 was added to buffer containing Tris/SO4, NaATP, and MgSO4 to start the reaction. We used the same conditions for fluorescence measurements as for ATPase assay, namely room temperature, 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, and an enzyme concentration of 50–100 nm. A SPEX Fluorolog 2 or Aminco-Bowman 2 spectrofluorometer was used. Excitation wavelength was 295 nm. For MgATP titration, two different conditions were used. Either NaATP and MgSO4 were added simultaneously in a concentration ratio of 2.5:1 to buffer containing enzyme and 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0 (to mimic the ATPase assay conditions above), or the buffer contained 2.5 mmMgSO4, 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, and enzyme, and NaATP was added. For free ATP titration, the buffer contained 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.0, and enzyme, and NaATP was added. For MgADP titration, the buffer contained 2.5 mmMgSO4, 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, and enzyme, and NaADP was added. Background signals (buffer) were subtracted, and inner filter and volume effects were corrected for by performing parallel titrations with wild-type F1. With MgATP as ligand, maximally two data points were acquired in a single experiment, to avoid interference by hydrolysis product MgADP. Nucleotide binding parameters were analyzed by fitting theoretical curves to the measured data points, assuming theoretical models with one, two, or three binding sites, as described in detail previously (12Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MgATP and MgADP concentrations were calculated using stability constants from Ref. 13Pecoraro V.L. Hermes J.D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5262-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar. With the β-Trp-331 enzyme, the fluorescence emission at 360 nm was used as the signal (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculation of stoichiometry of enzyme-bound MgATP and MgADP in the β-Trp-148 enzyme was determined from the fluorescence signals at 325 and 350 nm (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Aurovertin B was from Sigma (catalog no. A5297). The enzymes used in this work were the βY331W and βF148W purified mutant F1-ATPases from E. coli, which we shall call the β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 enzymes, respectively. Both have been characterized previously and shown to have normal catalytic properties (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). β-Trp-331 F1contains all nine wild-type Trp residues in addition to the three β-Trp-331 residues; β-Trp-148 F1 has no wild-type Trp residues, and the three β-Trp-148 are therefore the only Trp residues present. β-Trp-331 is used to determine nucleotide binding stoichiometry and affinities; β-Trp-148 is used to differentiate total bound nucleotide into MgATP and MgADP components. The enzymes were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 mm sodium azide, and then NaATP (10 mm) and MgSO4 (4 mm) were added to start the ATPase reaction (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The concentration ratio of ATP/Mg2+ was 2.5:1, which is known to be optimal for hydrolysis (14Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As TableI shows, both mutant enzymes were potently inhibited by azide. There was a small residual activity, which could be due to a small percentage of F1 molecules with no bound azide (which it should be emphasized is a noncovalent ligand) or to residual turnover of azide-complexed molecules.Table IInhibition of β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 enzymes by azideF1Additions during preincubationInhibition of ATPase%β-Trp-331Azide96β-Trp-331Azide plus 0.7 μm MgATP97.5β-Trp-331Azide plus 0.4 μm MgADP99.5β-Trp-148Azide92β-Trp-148Azide plus 0.7 μm MgATP96β-Trp-148Azide plus 0.4 μm MgADP97The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, F1 (52 nm) was preincubated in the presence or absence of nucleotide as indicated with 10 mm sodium azide.

Open table in a new tab The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, F1 (52 nm) was preincubated in the presence or absence of nucleotide as indicated with 10 mm sodium azide. After 15 min, MgATP was added to initiate the reaction. Results are the average of duplicate experiments. Fluorescence measurements, performed in the absence of nucleotide, but otherwise under exactly the conditions of buffer and enzyme concentration as used for enzyme assay above, demonstrated that the fluorescence spectra of the β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 enzymes were unchanged in the presence of azide (data not shown; the fluorescence spectra have been published in Refs. 4Weber J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations were carried out to determine binding characteristics for MgATP and MgADP in presence of 10 mm sodium azide. In all cases, enzyme and azide were preincubated together at least 15 min before nucleotide was added. Thus, the enzyme would in all cases be potently inhibited. In the presence of azide, upon the addition of nucleotide the fluorescence signal decreased within 2 min or less to a value that remained stable for at least 30 min. Titration with MgATP was first carried out under exactly the same conditions as the ATPase assay, with an ATP/Mg2+concentration ratio of 2.5:1, which as noted above is optimal for activity. Fig. 1 A shows the results. The data were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 1. A binding model with three types of site with different affinities gave a good fit to the data, as seen previously (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the absence of azide (Fig.1 A, open symbols), three catalytic sites were filled by MgATP, with K d1 ≤ 50 nm, K d2 = 2.5 μm and K d3 = 33 μm, very similar to previous results (4Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Löbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In presence of azide (Fig. 1 A, filled symbols), three sites were also filled, with K d1≤ 50 nm, K d2 ≤ 100 nm, and K d3 = 16 μm. The major effect of azide was clearly to increase MgATP binding stoichiometry at low MgATP concentrations, by decreasingK d2, and possibly alsoK d1. However, under these experimental conditions it is difficult to calculate low MgATP concentrations exactly, which introduces uncertainty for K d values below micromolar level. We therefore carried out titration with MgATP in the presence of excess (2.5 mm) MgSO4 and azide. This allows accurate calculation of low MgATP concentrations, since one can assume that all ATP is complexed with Mg2+. In addition, nucleotide-depleted F1 (10Senior A.E. Lee R.S-F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was used in these experiments to prevent any MgATP released from noncatalytic sites from interfering with calculation of MgATP concentration. The results are shown in Fig.1 B. The data again fit well to a model assuming three sites of different affinities. In absence of azide (open symbols), the following values were calculated:K d1 = 53 nm,K d2 = 1.8 μm, andK d3 = 42 μm. In the presence of azide (filled symbols), the values were as follows: K d1 = 21 nm, K d2 = 0.39 μm, and K d3 = 49 μm. Therefore, azide had the effect of increasing MgATP binding affinity at site one (by 2.5-fold) and at site two (by 5-fold). It is apparent that azide had greater effect on nucleotide binding at low MgATP concentrations in Fig. 1 A than it did in Fig.1 B. This could be due to effects of azide on free ATP binding, since free ATP would be present under the conditions of Fig.1 A but not those of Fig. 1 B. In Fig.2, free ATP binding in presence and absence of azide was measured, and it is clear that azide did enhance binding of free ATP at low concentrations of the nucleotide. For this reason we feel that the data from Fig. 1 B give the more reliable estimates of the effects of azide on MgATP binding. Titration with NaADP in presence of 2.5 mmMgSO4 is shown in Fig. 3. In absence of azide, two types of site were evident, with one site of higher and two sites of lower affinity, as has been seen previously (6Löbau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,15Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This pattern was retained in presence of azide. CalculatedK d values were as follows. Without azide,K d1 = 0.11 μm andK d2 = 37 μm; with azide,K d1 = 0.04 μm andK d2 = 20 μm. These results indicated that azide increased the affinity for MgADP binding at all three catalytic sites, although by relatively modest factors, namely by 3-fold at site one and by 2-fold at sites two and three. When the experiment was repeated with nucleotide-depleted F1 (10Senior A.E. Lee R.S-F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the same results were obtained. Previous work (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has established that the β-Trp-148 enzyme shows a reduction in fluorescence at 350 nm upon binding of MgADP and an enhancement of fluorescence at 325 nm upon binding of MgAMPPNP or MgADP-beryllium fluoride complex (which is also an MgATP analog). We established first that similar fluorescence responses were seen when 10 mm sodium azide was added along with saturating concentration of the relevant nucleotide. In Fig. 4, we carried out titration with NaATP/MgSO4 at constant 2.5:1 concentration ratio in presence or absence of azide, under the same conditions as used for ATPase assay. Fig. 4 A shows total bound nucleotide (MgATP plus MgADP) in presence of azide (filled symbols) as compared with its absence (open symbols). Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, stoichiometry of total bound nucleotide at saturation was 3 mol of nucleotide/mol of enzyme, and it can also be seen that at the lower MgATP concentrations, azide yielded higher binding stoichiometries due to higher affinity of the enzyme for MgATP. Fig. 4 B shows bound MgATP in the presence (filled symbols) or absence (open symbols) of azide, as a function of increasing MgATP concentration. It is immediately apparent that azide induced a major shift toward an increased level of bound MgATP. This is amply confirmed by Fig. 4 C, in which bound MgADP is presented as a function of added MgATP concentration, and it is seen that in the presence of azide, there was essentially no bound MgADP. The conclusion from Fig. 4is that, at saturation with added MgATP, the distribution of bound nucleotide changed from “one MgATP plus two MgADP” in the absence of azide to “three MgATP plus zero MgADP” in the presence of azide, under conditions in which potent inhibition of ATPase was achieved. The sequence of additions was then altered such that 2.5 mmNaATP, 1.0 mm MgSO4 was first added to β-Trp-148 F1 in the fluorescence cuvette to initiate hydrolysis turnover of the enzyme, and then azide (10 mm) was added after 15 s or 1 min, and the fluorescence signals at 325 and 350 nm were followed to determine bound MgATP and MgADP as a function of time. These experiments showed that immediately after the addition of MgATP, the enzyme within seconds assumed the “one MgATP plus two MgADP bound” state as seen in Fig. 4 and previous work (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After the addition of azide, this changed to 2.8 ± 0.1 MgATP bound per F1 (mol/mol) and 0.1 ± 0.2 MgADP bound per F1 (mol/mol) (means of six experiments ± S.E.). The change to the new “three MgATP plus zero MgADP bound” state occurred within 5 min and then remained stable for at least 30 min. If azide was not added, the enzyme remained in the one MgATP plus two MgADP bound state. We had previously shown that covalent modification and inhibition by DCCD of β-Trp-331 F1 had little effect on MgATP binding. After DCCD modification to yield ≥99% inhibition of ATPase,K d values for MgATP at all three catalytic sites remained essentially unchanged (5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we used β-Trp-148 F1 to determine if, after the addition of saturating MgATP to DCCD-modified enzyme, the stoichiometry of enzyme-bound MgATPversus MgADP changed. We first demonstrated that, when β-Trp-148 F1 was modified by DCCD as described in Ref. 5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, ATPase activity was inhibited by ≥99%, indicating incorporation of 2 mol of DCCD/mol of F1 (16Tommasino M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3972-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When 2.5 mm NaATP, 1.0 mm MgSO4 was added to the modified enzyme the fluorescence spectrum indicated the following nucleotide distribution: bound MgATP = 1.6 ± 0.2 mol/mol of F1; bound MgADP = 1.4 ± 0.3 mol/mol of F1 (means of five experiments ± S.E.). The effect of DCCD modification therefore was to shift the ratio of bound MgATP/MgADP from 1:2 in normal enzyme toward higher MgATP/lower MgADP in inhibited enzyme. It is interesting that a similar shift was seen previously when the slowly hydrolyzed nucleotide analog MgATPγS was substituted for MgATP (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Aurovertin binds noncovalently to wild-type E. coli F1 with K d of 1 μm (14Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Satre M. Bof M. Vignais P.V. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 768-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we used 10 μm aurovertin and found that it inhibited the ATPase activity of β-Trp-331 F1 by 87% (wild type = 74%). It has been noted before (18Linnett P.E. Beechey R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 472-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that aurovertin, an uncompetitive inhibitor of F1-ATPase from E. coli and mitochondria, does not achieve total inhibition of hydrolysis, and the residual activity could be due to enzyme molecules with bound aurovertin showing slowed turnover or to enzyme molecules with no aurovertin bound. Aurovertin quenched the fluorescence signal of β-Trp-331 F1 by 30% (mean of 12 experiments) at 360 nm and had no effect (except for a strong inner filter effect) on the fluorescence signal of wild-type F1. The quenching is expected, due to Förster resonance energy transfer, since the β-Trp-331 fluorescence emission spectrum extensively overlaps the aurovertin absorption spectrum (λmax = 368 nm). The x-ray structure of mitochondrial F1 complexed with aurovertin (19Van Raaij M.J. Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6913-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) shows two molecules of aurovertin bound per enzyme molecule, one to the βTP and one to the βE subunit, in the cleft between the nucleotide domain and the C-terminal domain of the respective β-subunit. The conjugated double bond system of each aurovertin molecule comes within 10 Å of the β-331 residue of the β-subunit to which aurovertin is bound and is around 55 Å from the two other β-331 residues. Assuming a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.13 for each β-Trp-331 residue and a value of κ2 = 0.667, then the R 0 value for the donor-acceptor pair β-Trp-331 and aurovertin is calculated to be 30.5 Å. We can therefore conclude that the fluorescence of β-Trp-331 residues on the two aurovertin-containing β-subunits is completely quenched and that the remaining β-Trp-331 on the aurovertin-free β-subunit would not be quenched to a significant extent. In β-Trp-331 mutant F1, the introduced β-Trp-331 residues account for 50% of the total fluorescence. The 30% quenching of the total fluorescence seen with 10 μm aurovertin (above) therefore corresponds to 60% quench of the β-Trp-331 fluorescence and indicates that the stoichiometry of bound aurovertin was 1.8 mol/mol of F1, consistent with the x-ray structure. We used the residual fluorescence signal to analyze nucleotide-binding parameters in the presence of 10 μm aurovertin. Fig.5 A shows the MgATP titration curve, carried out at a constant ATP/Mg2+ concentration ratio of 2.5:1. Two fits to the data are shown; the solid line is a fit to a model assuming three types of site, and the dotted line is a fit to a model assuming two types of site. The former model yields the better fit, and the calculated K d values areK d1 ≤ 50 nm,K d2 = 0.47 μm, andK d3 = 20 μm, with total apparent stoichiometry n = 1.2. Since 1.8 of the β-Trp-331 residues are expected to be spectroscopically silent due to quenching by the bound aurovertin (1.8 mol/mol), the maximumapparent nucleotide binding stoichiometry expected from the remaining signal is 1.2 mol/mol. Thus, it is interesting that with MgATP, three different types of binding site are indicated, withK d values similar to the uninhibited enzyme. Our conclusion is that, in the aurovertin-inhibited enzyme, there is residual ATPase turnover, and the β-Trp-331 residue on the aurovertin-free β-subunit is continuously cycling between three different affinities or conformations, consistent with the rotational enzyme mechanism. Fig. 5 B shows the MgADP titration curve, which indicates the presence of a single type of MgADP binding site withK d = 12.4 μm and n = 0.86. β-Trp-148 mutant F1 ATPase activity was inhibited by 71% in presence of 10 μm aurovertin, and the fluorescence signal of the β-Trp-148 residues was quenched by 15%. Again, this quenching can be ascribed to Förster resonance energy transfer, given that the distance in the x-ray structure of aurovertin from residue β-148 on the same β-subunit is 28.5 Å (19Van Raaij M.J. Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6913-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). The residual fluorescence signal was used to measure nucleotide binding parameters. A titration was carried out on β-Trp-148 F1 with MgATP in the presence and absence of 10 μm aurovertin, following the procedure described for Fig. 4. The results obtained in either presence or absence of aurovertin were the same as for theopen symbols of Fig. 4. The open symbols in Fig. 4 show data obtained with β-Trp-148 F1 in the absence of an inhibitor. Therefore, in the presence of 10 μm aurovertin, at saturation with MgATP, all three catalytic sites were filled with nucleotide, and the ratio of bound MgATP/bound MgADP was 1:2, just as in normal, uninhibited enzyme. The goal of this work was to study the mechanism of inhibition of F1-ATPase by azide, DCCD, and aurovertin, exploiting the use of two specific fluorescent probes of catalytic site nucleotide binding developed in this laboratory, namely β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148. DCCD reacts with residue β-Glu-192 in wild-type E. coliF1 (21Yoshida M. Allison W.S. Esch F.S. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10033-10037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at full inhibition of ATPase, the stoichiometry of labeling is 2 mol/mol (16Tommasino M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3972-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to its potent inhibition of steady-state (multisite) ATP hydrolysis, single turnover hydrolysis (unisite catalysis) is inhibited to a significantly lesser extent (16Tommasino M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3972-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both the β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 enzymes were fully inhibited by DCCD (≥99%). Earlier work from our laboratory using the β-Trp-331 probe had established that the DCCD-inhibited enzyme showed normal MgATP binding, with no change in binding stoichiometry or affinity at each of the three catalytic sites (5Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that DCCD acts subsequent to MgATP binding, at a step or steps involved in positive catalytic cooperativity. The results with the β-Trp-148 enzyme reported here show that DCCD-inhibited enzyme follows the normal catalytic pathway for MgATP hydrolysis as described in the catalytic mechanism in Fig.6 (2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In normal enzyme, under steady-state hydrolysis conditions, the most populous state of the enzyme molecules is one with one MgATP and two MgADP bound, corresponding to “State C,” resulting from the fact that release of MgADP is the overall rate-limiting step. In DCCD-inhibited enzyme there was a shift toward a higher ratio of bound MgATP/bound MgADP, demonstrating a higher population of molecules in “State A.” In Fig. 6, immediately after binding of MgATP to the loosest (L) of the three catalytic sites (D →A) there is intersubunit signal transmission (A→ B), which promotes hydrolysis of MgATP at the highest affinity site (H), which in turn triggers the “binding change,” whereby the three sites switch their affinities (arrows in State B). In previous work using MgATPγS as substrate, we also saw accumulation of State A (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This can be readily explained as due to slowing of the actual hydrolysis step by the nucleotide analog, which has been demonstrated to occur under both multisite and unisite hydrolysis conditions (22Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because DCCD inhibits unisite hydrolysis to a significantly lesser extent than multisite hydrolysis, and because its binding site is remote from the catalytic sites as shown by the x-ray structure (20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar), we conclude that the step in the mechanism that is slowed by DCCD is the conformational change that occurs immediately after binding of MgATP to the loosest site on the enzyme, which is relayed to the high affinity site and which signals the high affinity site to hydrolyze its bound MgATP rapidly. Aurovertin was found to be less inhibitory than DCCD in both β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 mutant enzymes, consistent with previous literature. Stoichiometry of aurovertin binding could be measured using the β-Trp-331 F1 fluorescence and was close to 2 mol/mol F1, as was seen in the x-ray structure of mitochondrial F1 (19Van Raaij M.J. Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6913-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). There was significant quenching of Trp fluorescence by bound aurovertin in both mutant enzymes, due to Förster resonance energy transfer, also consistent with and expected from the x-ray structure. Nevertheless, we were able to use the residual Trp fluorescence signals to obtain information about nucleotide binding. The interesting result with aurovertin-inhibited β-Trp-331 enzyme was that the MgATP binding curve indicated cycling of one β-subunit through each of three different states, corresponding in MgATP binding affinity to the three different β-subunit conformations seen in normal enzyme, whereas with MgADP only one state was seen. This is consistent with the conclusion that the aurovertin-inhibited enzyme carries out normal rotational catalysis but at a reduced rate. With aurovertin-inhibited β-Trp-148 enzyme, we showed that upon the addition of MgATP, the ratio of bound MgATP/MgADP in the enzyme population remained at 1:2, as in normal enzyme. Thus, the step that is slowed in the presence of aurovertin could be any of those steps subsequent to the hydrolytic step, namely the “binding change” of the catalytic sites, the release of product Pi, or the release of product MgADP (see Fig. 6). From the x-ray structure analysis, van Raaij et al. (19Van Raaij M.J. Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6913-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggested that it is the “binding change” that is impeded by aurovertin. Our data (K d values and MgATP/MgADP distribution) support this conclusion. Azide is a much studied inhibitor of F1-ATPase. It is well established that it inhibits steady-state hydrolysis (apparentK i in wild-type E. coli F1 = 25 μm, Ref. 23Takeda K. Miki J. Kanazawa H. Tsuchiya T. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but does not inhibit single turnover (unisite) catalysis, which led previous workers to conclude that it does not affect the hydrolytic step of catalysis per se, but rather that it interferes with subunit interactions and cooperativity (24Wise J.G. Latchney L.R. Ferguson A.M. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1426-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a second school of thought holds that azide “traps” MgADP permanently at a catalytic site, thus preventing product release and leading to a population of inactive molecules (e.g. Refs. 27Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Murataliev M.B. Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochemisty. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28818-28824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Most of the evidence for “trapping” of MgADP comes from studies of inhibition kinetics of steady-state hydrolysis. Analysis of bound catalytic site nucleotides, e.g. by high pressure liquid chromatography, was also reported, but since this is not a true equilibrium technique it does not quantitatively report nucleotide binding parameters under the actual conditions of enzyme assay. Hyndman et al. (29Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the stoichiometry of “trapping” of adenine nucleotide by azide in E. coli F1 and found that at full inhibition of ATPase the trapped catalytic site nucleotide amounted to just 0.38 mol/mol of F1, which is inconsistent with the idea that azide brings about inhibition by trapping MgADP in a catalytic site. Importantly, where corroboration was sought from the use of other techniques, the evidence has been ambiguous or contrary. For example, Mueller et al. (31Mueller D.M. Indyk V. McGill L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) found that in yeast mitochondrial F1, azide had no significant effect on eitherK d(MgADP) or on the dissociation or association rate constants for MgADP at the highest affinity catalytic site. Since the Trp fluorescence technique measures true equilibrium binding of nucleotide in catalytic sites, it seemed the ideal way to establish whether azide brings about changes in nucleotide binding affinity or changes in the ratio of bound MgATP/MgADP. Azide was found to inhibit both β-Trp-331 and β-Trp-148 enzymes potently, and it did not interfere with their fluorescence signals. We found that azide caused a small increase in the affinity for MgADP at all three catalytic sites (Fig. 3), with the largest effect being a 3-fold increase at the highest affinity site. This effect might well be due to decreased rate of MgADP dissociation, but it seems too small to account for the degree of inhibition seen. When enzyme was titrated with MgATP, we found that the binding affinity at sites one and two was somewhat higher in the presence of azide than in its absence (Fig. 1,A and B), similar to what was seen with MgADP. Fig. 2 showed that azide increased the affinity for free ATP at site one. The surprising finding, however, was that when MgATP was added to F1 in the presence of azide, the bound nucleotides on the enzyme at saturation consisted of three MgATP and zero MgADP (Fig. 4). Next, we carried out experiments where we added azide to F1that was already hydrolyzing MgATP. Immediately after the addition of MgATP to initiate hydrolysis, the ratio of bound MgATP/bound MgADP was 1:2, as reported before (7Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but after the addition of azide it changed to three bound MgATP/zero bound MgADP. These experiments completely rule out the idea that azide inhibits by trapping MgADP at a catalytic site; obviously, inhibition occurred in the absence of any MgADP bound on the enzyme catalytic sites. As noted above, the residual ATPase activity seen in the presence of azide (Table I) could be due to a small fraction of F1molecules with no bound azide or to residual turnover of azide-complexed molecules. We favor the first alternative. Calculation shows that 3–4% of fully active F1 molecules (with one MgATP/two MgADP bound in catalytic sites) would yield a total bound MgADP stoichiometry of 0.06–0.08 MgADP per F1, averaged over the whole population, which is clearly within the experimental variation seen in Fig. 4 C. Also, it is germane to consider the potential effects of unisite catalysis, which is unaffected by azide as noted above. If one assumes a value of 1.0 for the equilibrium constant (K 2) of the reaction F1·MgATP ↔ F1·MgADP·Pi in unisite catalysis (which is representative of the value measured in several laboratories), then catalytic site one (highest affinity site) would be expected to contain, on average, 0.5 MgADP per F1. This was clearly not seen (see “Results,” Fig. 4 and text). Under conditions where the three catalytic sites were filled (and in the presence of azide), the reaction equilibrium at site one was clearly shifted toward F1·MgATP. As to the mechanism of inhibition by azide, it is clear that the enzyme species that accumulates in the presence of azide and MgATP (containing three bound MgATP plus zero bound MgADP) is not a normal catalytic intermediate state (see Fig. 6). The catalytic sites appear to be in free equilibrium with medium nucleotide, because the complement of three bound MgATP plus zero bound MgADP reflects the ambient concentrations of medium MgATP and MgADP, taking into account the respective K d values for these nucleotides at the three catalytic sites. Our results strongly support the conclusion that azide blocks the conformational signal transmission between the catalytic sites that leads to normal positive catalytic cooperativity (and hydrolysis of bound MgATP in multisite conditions). DCCD acts upon the same step, but less effectively, as judged by the complement of bound catalytic site nucleotides. The higher inhibition of ATPase seen with DCCD as opposed to azide can be explained as due to the fact that DCCD is a covalent and azide a noncovalent inhibitor.

We show that binding of JNK to c-Jun in vivo does not require JNK catalytic activity or the presence of the potential phosphoacceptor sites within c-Jun and that JNK retains the capacity to bind to a pseudo-phosphorylated mutant of c-Jun where these sites are replaced by phospho-mimetic aspartic acid residues.

Experiments using purified recombinant c-Jun and JNK proteins show that the c-Jun DNA-binding domain harbors an auxiliary interaction domain that has the potential to bind to JNK independently.

It is generally assumed that specific cellular responses are achieved by coupling individual MAPK pathways to distinct effector molecules, although how substrate targeting is determined is poorly understood.

Two major serine phosphoacceptor sites have been mapped within the c-Jun transactivation domain at positions 63 and 73 (Ser63–Ser73) (14Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M.

Additionally, two threonine residues at positions 91 and 93 (Thr91–Thr93) are thought to be modified by JNK under certain circumstances (17Black E.J. Catling A.D. Woodgett J.R. Kilbey A. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2363-2368PubMed Google Scholar, 18Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but regulation of their phosphorylation is less well characterized. Phosphorylation of N-terminal c-Jun phosphoacceptor sites by JNK probably stimulates c-Jun transcriptional activity by facilitating recruitment of the p300/CBP coactivator (13Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). JNK binds to c-Jun, and it seems likely that this is a primary determinant of signal transduction specificity, because regulatory phosphorylation is thought to depend on this interaction (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Binding of JNK depends on a small region in the N-terminal half of c-Jun (the delta region) (18Derijard B.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 849-855PubMed Google Scholar). This region is thought to act as a docking site for JNK, which, although physically distinct from the phosphoacceptor sites, exerts a major influence on the efficiency with which these residues in c-Jun are phosphorylated in vitro, most probably by increasing the effective local concentration of kinase (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 24Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, a recent model proposes that association of JNK with the delta region facilitates subsequent translocation of the adjacent phosphoacceptor region into the kinase catalytic cleft, leading to catalysis and subsequent dissociation of the kinase from its substrate (24Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Despite its potential functional importance, the physical basis of the interaction between c-Jun and JNK is relatively poorly understood, because the kinase docking site is currently defined solely by a natural deletion found in the oncogenic derivative, v-Jun (6Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 659-663PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bohmann D. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the extent and amino acid sequence of the interaction domain per se has not been defined. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether binding of JNK to c-Jun is modulated by regulatory phosphorylation and whether it has functional significance over and above facilitating catalysis. To gain further insight into these issues, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to analyze the structural requirements for and influence of JNK catalytic activity and substrate phosphorylation on the interaction between c-Jun and JNK in vivo. The results of this analysis suggest that JNK associates with c-Jun through multiple contactsin vivo and, after activation, can phosphorylate its substrate without necessarily dissociating from the complex. Routine manipulations of nucleic acids were performed as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Vectors used to construct in frame fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain (BD) or the activation domain (AD) of yeast GAL4 were pGBT9 and pGAD424, respectively (CLONTECH) (27Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding BD-JNK, BD-c-Jun, BD-c-Jun4ala, AD-c-Jun, and AD-v-Jun have been described (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A catalytically inactive JNK derivative containing alanine in place of lysine at amino acid 55 in the ATP-binding site (JNK K→A) (28Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR and cloned into pGBT9. Fragments encoding the basic region-leucine zipper domains of Fra-2 (amino acids 107–200) or c-Jun (amino acids 186–314) were generated by PCR and cloned into pGBT9. c-Jun deletion variants were created by PCR and cloned into pGAD424 to generate AD-c-Jun 1–280, AD-c-Jun 1–256, AD-c-Jun 1–182, AD-c-Jun 31–59, AD-c-Jun 186–314, and AD-c-Jun Δ 183–256. A c-Jun mutant containing aspartic acid residues in place of Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 (c-Jun4asp) was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM system (Stratagene). Subsequently the N-terminal halves of AD-c-Jun in pGAD424 and BD-c-Jun in pGBT9 were replaced with corresponding fragments from c-Jun4ala or c-Jun4asp to generate AD-c-Jun4ala, AD-c-Jun4asp, and BD-c-Jun4asp, respectively. The authenticity of all PCR-generated coding regions and, where appropriate, the presence of desired mutations were verified by sequencing. The sequences of the PCR primers used for these constructions are available on request. Throughout this manuscript the numbering of c-Jun amino acids is based on the sequence of avian c-Jun. Yeast strain SFY526 has been described previously (27Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown and transformed using the lithium acetate method as described (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar), except that 5 μg of plasmid DNA was used. β-Galactosidase activity in liquid yeast cultures was quantified as described (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). c-Jun, Δ N c-Jun (amino acids 186–314), and bZIP Fos proteins were expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (30Oehler T. Pintzas A. Stumm S. Darling A. Gillespie D. Angel P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding rat stress-activated protein kinase α1 (corresponding to human JNK2) was generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1. GST, GST-JNK, GST-c-Jun 1–79 (a kind gift of I. Morgan), and GST-ERK (pGEX-WT-ERK2; a kind gift of C Marshall) were expressed and purified from E. coli using conventional procedures (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were performed by incubating purified Jun proteins (100 ng) with 1 ng of 32P-labeled collagenase TRE oligonucleotide probe (colTRE) (32Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4 °C as described previously (30Oehler T. Pintzas A. Stumm S. Darling A. Gillespie D. Angel P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated the DNA binding reactions were supplemented with purified GST, GST-JNK, or GST-ERK (200 ng), or 3 μl of polyclonal anti-Jun (730) antiserum and incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to addition of the colTRE probe. To generate Jun-bZIP Fos heterodimer complexes, binding reactions were supplemented with purified bZIP Fos (200 ng) prior to addition of probe and/or GST proteins. For GST pull-down experiments, 4 μg of GST-c-Jun 1–79 protein was bound to 40 μl of glutathione beads and incubated with 1000 μg of cell extract prepared from avian fibroblasts treated with 10 mg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) for 15 min to activate JNK (33Kilbey A. Black E.J. Unlu M. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2409-2418PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the reaction was split in half, and in vitro kinase assays in the presence or absence of 50 μm ATP were performed (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Subsequently, each reaction mixture was separated into bead-bound and soluble fractions and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. JNK, GST, and c-Jun proteins were visualized by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated, active form of JNK (New England Biolabs), a polyclonal serum raised against an unrelated GST fusion protein, or an antibody specific for phosphorylated c-Jun (KM1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. To determine whether phosphorylation of Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 in c-Jun modulates binding of JNKin vivo, we first evaluated the effect of JNK catalytic activity on the interaction between the proteins using a yeast two-hybrid approach (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). JNK can be active in yeast because it can both complement a null mutation of the yeast Hog1 gene, which encodes a MAPK homologue required for growth in high osmolarity medium (34Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and stimulate c-Jun transcriptional activity via phosphorylation (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we expressed hybrid proteins containing the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and JNK3 (BD-JNK) or a mutant JNK lacking catalytic activity (BD-JNK K→A; see “Experimental Procedures” for details), together with GAL4 activation domain-tagged c-Jun (AD-c-Jun) (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 a, AD-c-Jun interacted equally well with both BD-JNK and BD-JNK K→A, demonstrating that JNK catalytic activity is dispensable for binding to c-Jun in vivo. Furthermore, a mutant derivative of c-Jun in which the Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 phosphoacceptor sites were replaced with nonphosphorylatable alanine residues (AD-c-Jun4ala) (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) interacted with BD-JNK at least as strongly as wild-type AD-c-Jun (Fig.1 b). Thus, neither JNK catalytic activity nor the presence of the JNK target sites in the c-Jun activation domain are required for binding of the kinase to its substrate in vivo. Active JNK that has been captured from cell extracts by an affinity matrix consisting of an N-terminal fragment of c-Jun has been reported to be released when Ser63–Ser73 (and to a lesser extent Thr91–Thr93) become phosphorylated (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), suggesting that catalysis leads to dissociation of the kinase from its substrate in vitro. To determine whether modification of Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 would prevent or weaken the interaction with JNK in vivo, we constructed a mutant in which all four of these residues were replaced with negatively charged aspartic acid residues to mimic phosphorylation (c-Jun4asp). Mutants containing aspartic acid in place of Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 have been shown to acquire many of the physical and functional characteristics that result from authentic phosphorylation of these sites (19Papavassiliou A.G. Treier M. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Peverali F.A. Isaksson A. Papavassiliou A.A. Plastina P. Staszewski L.M. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To verify that this was the case in yeast, we fused c-Jun4asp to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and compared transactivation by the resulting protein with BD-c-Jun and BD-c-Jun4ala (Fig. 1 c). As expected, the aspartic acid substitutions resulted in a marked increase (approximately 6–7-fold) in transactivation activity, indicating that these mutations mimic at least some attributes of phosphorylated c-Jun in yeast. We subsequently fused c-Jun4asp to the GAL4 activation domain and found that this mutant retained the capacity to interact with BD-JNK (Fig.1 b), indicating that phospho-mimetic mutations do not prevent binding of JNK in vivo. The aspartic acid mutations did not enhance transactivation in the two-hybrid assay, because in this case activation is primarily attributable to the heterologous GAL4 activation domain (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To resolve the apparent discrepancy between the effects of regulatory phosphorylation or phospho-mimetic amino acid substitutions on binding of JNK to c-Jun in vitro (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Fig.1, b and c), we decided to analyze JNK-c-Jun interaction in vitro. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were treated with anisomycin to activate JNK (33Kilbey A. Black E.J. Unlu M. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2409-2418PubMed Google Scholar), and the activated kinase was captured from cell extracts using an affinity matrix consisting of the N-terminal 79 amino acids of c-Jun fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST-c-Jun 1–79) and immobilized on glutathione beads (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the capture reaction was split in half, and kinase reactions were performed in the presence and absence of ATP. The reaction mixtures were separated into bead-bound and free fractions and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for active, phosphorylated JNK (anti-P-JNK), GST, or phosphorylated c-Jun (KM-1). As shown in Fig.2, under these conditions sufficient JNK could be captured to catalyze essentially quantitative phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun 1–79 matrix as judged by (a) reduced electrophoretic mobility and (b) a large increase in reactivity with KM-1. Despite this, the majority of the JNK remained associated with the matrix both in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 2, lanes P). On longer exposures it was evident that a small amount of JNK was released in each case (Fig. 2, lanes S). However, this was not affected by the modification state of the matrix. This result is consistent with the ability of JNK to interact with pseudo-phosphorylated c-Jun and indicates that JNK can remain bound to phosphorylated c-Jun. It is well established that binding of JNK to c-Jun in vitrodepends on a short peptide termed the delta domain that is deleted from the v-Jun oncoprotein and that is thought to constitute a specific docking site for the kinase. This is also true in vivobecause unlike AD-c-Jun, AD-v-Jun did not interact with BD-JNK (Fig.3 b) (22May G.H. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), even though both interacted equally with the leucine zipper domain of Fra-2 (Fig.3 c). To determine whether the delta docking site is sufficient for interaction in vivo as it is in vitro, we tested interaction between BD-JNK and an N-terminal segment of c-Jun spanning amino acids 1–182 (AD-c-Jun 1–182). This mutant contains the delta domain and would therefore be expected to interact with JNK in vitro. Unexpectedly, however, AD-c-Jun 1–182 did not interact measurably with BD-JNK (Fig. 3 b). Western blotting experiments indicated that this was not due to lack of expression of AD-c-Jun 1–182 (data not shown). Thus, although the delta region is necessary for interaction with JNK in yeast it is not sufficient, because sequences within the C-terminal half of c-Jun are also required for JNK binding in this context. The segment of c-Jun deleted from AD-c-Jun 1–182 provides both DNA binding and dimerization functions. It has been proposed on the basis of in vitro experiments (24Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) that dimerization stabilizes the interaction between JNK and c-Jun in vitro. To determine whether defective dimerization explained the failure of AD-c-Jun 1–182 to interact with JNK, additional c-Jun mutants with shorter C-terminal deletions that removed either part (AD-c-Jun 1–280) or all of the leucine zipper (AD-c-Jun 1–256) were constructed (see Fig.3 a). Both of the resulting hybrid proteins retained a proline- and glutamine-rich (P-Q) domain and were capable of interacting with BD-JNK, although their apparent affinity for JNK was markedly decreased (approximately 8–10-fold) in comparison with full-length AD-c-Jun (Fig. 3 b). To confirm that these C-terminally deleted c-Jun proteins exhibited the predicted dimerization properties, we examined their capacity to interact with the leucine zipper domain of Fra-2 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD-FraZip, Fig. 3 c). Both c- and v-Jun interacted equally well with BD-FraZip; however, none of the C-terminally truncated c-Jun mutants interacted significantly, confirming that these proteins were defective for heterodimerizationin vivo. Similar results were obtained when homodimerization was tested using the basic region-leucine zipper domain of c-Jun (amino acids 186–314) as a “bait” protein (BD-JunZip; data not shown). Thus, these two-hybrid experiments indicated that a region within the c-Jun C terminus between amino acids 182 and 256 was absolutely required for the interaction of c-Jun monomers with JNK in vivo. To test whether this region also contributed to the affinity of JNK binding in the context of c-Jun dimers, a c-Jun mutant carrying an internal deletion that removed amino acids 183–256 was fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD-c-Jun Δ183–256) and tested for interaction with BD-JNK, BD-FraZip, and BD-JunZip (Fig.4). As expected, AD-c-Jun Δ183–256 formed hetero- and homodimers equally as well as or better than AD-c-Jun and AD-v-Jun with BD-FraZip and BD-JunZip (Fig. 4,b and c). However, its interaction with BD-JNK was severely compromised (Fig. 4 a), confirming that the deleted region is required for optimal binding of JNK in vivo. The region between c-Jun amino acids 182 and 256 contains a P-Q domain and parts of the basic region DNA-binding domain. We considered the possibility that this region might make additional direct contacts with JNKin vivo; however, as with AD-c-Jun 1–182, c-Jun amino acids 186–314 did not interact detectably with BD-JNK (data not shown). As an alternative approach to this question, we therefore used purified recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli to determine whether the c-Jun C terminus alone could interact with JNK in vitro. Purified c-Jun protein forms a specific homodimer complex with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus TRE from the collagenase gene promoter (colTRE) (32Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar) in a gel retardation assay (Fig.5 a, arrow). When purified GST-JNK was added to this binding reaction a more slowly migrating complex formed (Fig. 5 a, asterisk) that was not observed on addition of either GST alone or an analogous GST-ERK fusion protein. Control experiments demonstrated that GST-JNK did not bind to DNA alone in the absence of c-Jun. Several observations indicated that this more slowly migrating species represented a ternary complex of c-Jun and GST-JNK bound to DNA. Firstly, anti-c-Jun antibodies disrupted both the homodimer and slower mobility complexes, demonstrating that c-Jun was a component of both (Fig. 5 b). Secondly, glutathione beads adsorbed with GST-JNK could deplete c-Jun-DNA complexes from solution, whereas incubation with beads alone or GST-adsorbed beads were without effect (Fig.5 c). To determine whether the c-Jun C terminus could interact directly with JNK in this context, we expressed a C-terminal fragment of c-Jun spanning amino acids 186–314 (Δ N c-Jun) in E. coli and analyzed its interaction with GST-JNK. Δ N c-Jun contains the complete c-Jun bZIP DNA-binding domain but lacks the N-terminal delta and transactivation domains. Δ N c-Jun bound the colTRE oligonucleotide as a distinct homodimer of higher electrophoretic mobility than full-length c-Jun homodimers (Fig.6 a, arrow). Importantly, as seen with full-length c-Jun homodimers, addition of GST-JNK but not of GST alone led to the formation of a more slowly migrating species, demonstrating the formation of specific ternary complexes by direct contacts between JNK and DNA-bound Δ N c-Jun (Fig. 6 a, asterisks). Thus, the c-Jun DNA-binding domain harbors an auxiliary JNK interaction domain and under certain circumstances can bind to JNK in isolation. In vivo, c-Jun predominantly forms heterodimers with Fos-related proteins. We therefore wished to analyze the effect of heterodimerization on the c-Jun-JNK interaction in vitro. When full-length c-Jun was mixed with a purified fragment of c-Fos encompassing only the basic region-leucine zipper domain (bZIP Fos) c-Jun-bZIP Fos heterodimer complexes binding to DNA were readily detected (Fig. 6 b, lane 3) by the appearance of a complex with higher electrophoretic mobility than c-Jun homodimers (Fig. 6 b, lane 1). Addition of purified GST-JNK resulted in a marked retardation of this complex, indicating the formation of a complex consisting of c-Jun, bZIP Fos, GST-JNK, and DNA (Fig. 6 b, lane 4). When Δ N c-Jun was combined with bZIP Fos, heterodimer complexes with higher mobility were detected (Fig. 6 b, lane 7). However, in marked contrast to c-Jun-bZIP Fos heterodimers, these complexes could no longer be bound by purified GST-JNK (Fig. 6 b, lane 8). Therefore, although a single copy of the C-terminal auxiliary interaction domain in combination with one copy of the delta region is sufficient for interaction with JNK, it is not sufficient on its own. JNK phosphorylates multiple regulatory sites within the c-Jun N-terminal activation domain, and a large body of evidence indicates that this stimulates c-Jun transcriptional activity (14Binetruy B.

Efficient modification of these sites is thought to depend on physical association of the kinase with c-Jun through an N-terminal docking site (the delta region), which is deleted from the v-Jun oncoprotein (21Hibi M.

Although the role of JNK as a positive regulator of c-Jun function is well established, less is known about the structural basis of the c-Jun-JNK interaction or the mechanism through which phosphorylation stimulates c-Jun transcriptional activity. In particular, it remains unclear whether phosphorylation modulates JNK binding in vivo and whether the physical interaction between the kinase and its effector has functional significance over and above facilitating catalysis. To gain further insight into these issues, we have investigated the interaction between JNK and c-Jun using a yeast two-hybrid approach. Using mutant derivatives of JNK and c-Jun we found that neither JNK catalytic activity nor phosphorylation of either the major (Ser63–Ser73) or less well characterized (Thr91–Thr93) c-Jun regulatory sites was required for binding of JNK in vivo. We also found that JNK could bind to a pseudo-phosphorylated mutant of c-Jun where Ser63–Ser73 and Thr91–Thr93 were replaced with negatively charged aspartic acid residues. This was unexpected, because it had previously been suggested that phosphorylation of Ser63–Ser73 (and possibly Thr91–Thr93) dissociated JNK from a GST-c-Jun affinity matrix (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). In similar capture experiments using GST-c-Jun 1–79 we found that the bulk of the active JNK remained bound after quantitative phosphorylation of the matrix, although a small amount of JNK was released independently of modification. This may account for the apparent discrepancy with previous work (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), because in these earlier experiments only JNK kinase activity was monitored, and the physical presence of JNK molecules could not be traced. At all events, both the yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments reported here are consistent with the notion that inactive JNK could exist in a preformed complex with c-Jun in vivo and that JNK could remain associated with phosphorylated c-Jun after kinase activation and catalysis. A further unexpected finding was that the regions of c-Jun required for efficient interaction with JNK in yeast differ significantly from those defined previously in vitro. Although the delta region docking site is essential in both settings, in contrast to what has been observed in vitro (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 36Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) it is not sufficient, because c-Jun sequences within or adjacent to the DNA-binding domain also exert a major influence on binding. Thus, deletions that remove part or all of the c-Jun bZIP domain greatly weaken interaction with JNK, whereas a mutant that additionally lacks an adjacent P-Q region (Fig. 3 a) fails to interact at all. Loss of dimerization potential likely accounts in part for the effect of the c-Jun bZIP deletions, because each of these mutants is defective for this function in vivo, and JNK has been reported to bind more avidly to c-Jun homodimers than monomers (24Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This cannot be the sole explanation, however, because a mutant lacking the P-Q region but capable of dimerization is also strongly impaired in its ability to interact with JNK. Furthermore, we have shown that purified recombinant GST-JNK protein can bind the c-Jun DNA-binding domain alone in vitro in the absence of the delta docking site, indicating that additional contacts between JNK and this region of c-Jun can occur and could potentially contribute to the overall stability of the complex. Our observations can best be summarized in a model (Fig.7) in which we propose that stable binding of JNK in vivo depends primarily on the N-terminal delta docking site but that this is augmented by additional contacts mediated by an auxiliary C-terminal interacting region. Either of these interacting regions alone can suffice to mediate binding of JNK inin vitro assays using purified recombinant proteins. However, both are required for efficient binding under the more stringent conditions that pertain in vivo. Unlike the delta region, the exact extent of the C-terminal interaction surface is at present not known; however, the current data suggest that it is likely to include, although may not be confined to, the P-Q region located N-terminal to the basic region. An important feature of this model is that it predicts that the overall affinity with which JNK binds to c-Jun will be influenced by the number of primary and auxiliary contacts that can occur within a given c-Jun-containing complex. Interestingly, recent structural and biochemical analyses have suggested that activated isoforms of the MAPK ERK2 form dimers with active and inactive ERK2 partners and that this is also true for other MAPK family members (39Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 40Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). These experiments indicated that dimerization might be part of the mechanism of MAPK action. Thus, if JNK dimers exist in cells, then our model predicts that these will interact most avidly with c-Jun homodimers as shown in Fig. 7 and less avidly with heterodimers formed between c-Jun and other bZIP partner proteins, unless the partner in question also provides additional JNK interaction domains. Further work will be required to evaluate this possibility. Finally, we have shown that JNK can form ternary complexes with DNA-bound c-Jun in vitro, leading to the intriguing question of whether such complexes exist in vivo. Stable association of JNK with DNA-bound c-Jun prior to kinase activation would clearly provide a powerful mechanism for ensuring rapid and selective activation of c-Jun transcriptional activity in response to signals that activate the JNK pathway. However, conflicting reports exist regarding the cellular localization of active and inactive JNK. In some cell types, JNK resides both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus under normal conditions but becomes concentrated in the nucleus after application of stresses which activate JNK (41Kawasaki H.

Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In other systems, however, JNK becomes activated in the nucleus following stress (43Mizukami Y.

Our own preliminary results using confocal microscopy suggest co-localization of c-Jun and JNK within the nucleus of unstimulated chicken embryo fibroblasts. 2E. J. Black and D. A. F.

https://openalex.org/W1969563856,"We previously reported that the responsiveness of hepatocytes to thyroid hormone is markedly attenuated when they were cultured as monolayers rather than spheroids. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the altered responsiveness, thyroid hormone receptor auxiliary proteins in the hepatocytes were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The major thyroid hormone receptor auxiliary protein was identified as 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α (RXRα) in the hepatocytes regardless of the culture conditions. The cytoplasmic fraction was shown to contain a protease(s) that cleaves RXRα at its amino terminus. The presence of the protease in the cytosol, but not in the nucleus, was ascertained by incubating full-length 35S-labeled RXRα with each fraction. Using various protease inhibitors, it was shown that cathepsin L-type protease could participate in the cleavage of the RXRα. The enzyme activity was much higher in the monolayers than the spheroids. Inhibition of this enzyme activity in the monolayer hepatocyte resulted in the increase of nuclear RXRα protein and the augmentation of T3-dependent induction of spot 14 mRNA. These results suggest that the changes in cathepsin L-type protease activity in the cytosol may alter the turnover of RXRα in the nucleus and modify the function of steroid receptor superfamilies that heterodimerize with RXRα.

Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development as well as for the regulation of a variety of metabolic pathways (1Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Mariash C.N. Kinlaw W.B. Wong N.C. Freake H.C. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 288-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptors; RXRα, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α; TRE, thyroid-hormone responsive element; TRAP, TR auxiliary proteins; DR, direct repeat; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MCA, methylcoumaryl-7-amide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Pal, palindrome; Lap, inverted palindrome. 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptors; RXRα, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α; TRE, thyroid-hormone responsive element; TRAP, TR auxiliary proteins; DR, direct repeat; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MCA, methylcoumaryl-7-amide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Pal, palindrome; Lap, inverted palindrome. which activate or repress the transcription of specific target genes in a ligand-dependent manner (2Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Wagner R.L. Fletterick R.J. Schaufele F. Baxter J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 758: 366-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TRs belong to members of the family of nuclear receptors which also include several steroid, retinoic acid, and vitamin D3 receptors. TRs are encoded by two genes, TRα and TRβ, as well as alternative splicing products of each (3Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). For transcriptional regulation by thyroid hormones, TRs bind to a specific DNA sequence (thyroid-hormone responsive element, TRE) of target genes by forming a monomer, a homodimer, and a heterodimer with TR auxiliary proteins (TRAPs) (4Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). TREs are composed of the arrangement of two common hexameric DNA half-site sequences (AGGTCA). The orientation of two half-sites is head-to-head (palindrome, Pal) or in an opposite orientation as an inverted palindrome (Lap), with the half-sites arranged head-to-tail as a direct repeat with 4 spacing (DR4). The heterodimer formation (TR/TRAP) on these TREs is suggested to be more stable and important for transcriptional regulation (5Hermann T. Hoffmann B. Piedrafita F.J. Zhang X.K. Pfahl M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 55-65PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies (6Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M. Mader S. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1419-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) identified 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs), which are also members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, as TRAPs in most tissues. Also demonstrated was that preferential expression of RXR isoforms in certain cell lines or tissues results in the apparent heterogeneity of TRAP on EMSA (9Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of the major target organs for thyroid hormones is the liver, in which a number of genes in the metabolic pathways such as spot 14 (10Zilz N.D. Murray M.B. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8136-8143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), malic enzyme (11Petty K.J. Desvergne B. Mitsuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7395-7400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and type I 5′-deiodinase (12Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5100-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) are regulated by T3 at the transcriptional level. These actions are mediated through TRβ which is a major form expressed in the liver (13Hodin R.A. Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have used primary hepatocyte cultures as a model to study thyroid hormone action in the liver, and we demonstrated that response of hepatocytes to T3 was markedly influenced by the culture conditions (14Menjo M. Murata Y. Fujii T. Nimura T. Seo H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2984-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When hepatocytes were cultured as spherical aggregates (spheroids) on a positively charged polystyrene dish, T3increased the expression of 5′- type I 5′-deiodinase gene. However, the T3 effect was markedly attenuated in hepatocytes cultured as conventional monolayer on a collagen-coated dish. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the altered responsiveness to thyroid hormone in the two culture conditions. It was demonstrated that RXRα was the major TRAP in hepatocytes cultured either as monolayers or as spheroids. The presence of a protease(s) in the cytosol, but not in the nucleus, cleaving RXRα at its amino terminus, was demonstrated by incubating full-length 35S-labeled RXRα with each fraction. With the use of specific protease inhibitors, this enzyme was identified as cathepsin L-type protease. This enzyme activity was much higher in hepatocytes cultured as monolayers than those cultured as spheroids. Introduction of E64d, a membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, in the monolayer of the hepatocytes resulted in the inhibition of RXRα-cleaving enzyme and the increase in the nuclear RXRα protein level. Furthermore, E64d augmented T3-dependent induction of spot 14 mRNA. We suggest that the altered cathepsin L-type protease activity in hepatocytes cultured in two different conditions could alter the turnover of RXRα in the nucleus and might, at least in part, modulate T3 responsiveness in vivo. The isolation of primary cultured hepatocytes was performed as described previously (14Menjo M. Murata Y. Fujii T. Nimura T. Seo H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2984-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Wistar rats by collagenase perfusion and plated onto dishes with two different kinds of surfaces, collagen-coated dishes (Iwaki Glass) for monolayer cultures and polystyrene dishes with positively charged surface (Primaria, Falcon and Becton Dickinson Labware) for spheroid cultures. These primary hepatocytes were grown in serum-free defined medium (14Menjo M. Murata Y. Fujii T. Nimura T. Seo H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2984-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Three days after the plating, the aggregates of hepatocytes called “spheroids” were formed on Primaria dishes, whereas hepatocytes were grown as a monolayer on collagen-coated dishes. At this time, the cells were harvested and subjected to preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extract. Two methods were employed to prepare the nuclear extracts. One method described by Schreiber et al. (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar) is applicable for small amounts of cells with rapid isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. However, the nuclear extracts prepared by this method contain a minor contamination from cytoplasmic fraction. The other method employs the procedure described by Shapiro et al. (16Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y .). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) with minor modification which results in a highly purified nuclear extract. However, this method requires large amounts of cells and cannot be used to extract the cytoplasmic fraction simultaneously. We will refer to the nuclear extract prepared by Schreiber method as “crude nuclear extract” and the one by a modified Shapiro method as “purified nuclear extract.” The minor modification of Shapiro method is as follows. The nuclear pellet after the centrifugation through a sucrose gradient was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in the nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and kept on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected. The concentration of proteins was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclear pellet after nuclear protein extraction was used to determine the cell DNA contents by the method of Burton (17Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) using herring sperm DNA as a standard. T3 binding assay was carried out using isolated nuclei according to the method of Ichikawa and DeGroot (18Ichikawa K. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 51: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activities of nuclear extracts from hepatocyte cultures were studied by using radiolabeled synthetic thyroid hormone-responsive elements (TREs), in the absence or presence of in vitro translated TRβ synthesized by the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The method for EMSA was described previously (19Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized TRβ (20Weinberger C. Thompson C.C. Ong E.S. Lebo R. Gruol D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) and RXRα (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) were also used for EMSA. The sequences of TRE oligonucleotides, Pal, Lap, DR4, and malic enzyme, were previously described (22Nagaya T. Nomura Y. Fujieda M. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Supershift analysis was performed using two anti-RXRα antibodies and one anti-TRβ antibody. The epitopes recognized by one of the anti-RXR antibodies (antibody N) was residues 92–102 (23Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Qi Y. Lechan R.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and by the other (antibody C) was residues 230–235 (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Anti-TRβ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In vitro translated RXRα was preincubated with the cytoplasmic or nuclear extract derived from either the monolayer or spheroid cultured hepatocytes for 30 min at 37 °C and then used for EMSA with in vitro translated TRβ. Alternatively, 35S-labeledin vitro translated RXRα was incubated with cytoplasmic extract and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). To characterize the protease, a series of inhibitors were added before the incubation of RXRα with the cytoplasmic extract. The final concentrations of protease inhibitors were as follows: antipain (50 μg/ml), aprotinin (60 ng/ml), bestatin (40 μg/ml), chymostatin (100 μg/ml), E64 (0.5 μg/ml), EDTA (0.2 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), Pefabloc® SC (0.1 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), phosphoramidon (4 μg/ml) (protease inhibitor set, Boehringer Mannheim), calpastatin (4 units/ml) (Takara,) and ovocystatin (100 μg/ml) (Takara). CA-074 (10−5m), CLIK-088 (10−4m), CLIK-112 (10−5m), and CLIK-121 (10−5m) (25Towatari T. Nikawa T. Murata M. Yokoo C. Hanada K. Katunuma N.

Bone Miner. Metab. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were also used. 35S-Labeled in vitrotranslated RXRα (5 μl) was incubated with the cytoplasmic extract (10 μg) from monolayer cultures for 1 h at 37 °C in 40 μl of the buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Two anti-RXRα antibodies (N and C) were used for the immunoprecipitation. The protocol for the immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was described previously (28Murata Y. Sueda K. Seo H. Matsui N. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L activity in cytoplasmic extracts from monolayer or spheroid cultured hepatocytes was assessed by the Inubushi method (29Inubushi T. Kakegawa H. Kishino Y. Katunuma N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using a substrate for both cathepsin B and cathepsin L (Z-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA), Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) (30Olbricht C.J. Cannon J.K. Garg L.C. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074 (25Towatari T. Nikawa T. Murata M. Yokoo C. Hanada K. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26Katunuma N. Kominami E. Paker L. Biothiols :. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 382-397Google Scholar). Ten micromoles of the substrate was incubated with the cytoplasmic extract from monolayers or spheroids in the cathepsin assay buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 8 mml-cysteine, 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 10−4m of CA-074 at 37 °C for 6 min. The reaction was stopped by 100 mmmonochloroacetic acid (pH 4.3). The fluorescence of the solution at 370 nm excitation and 460 nm emission was determined according to that from 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The cathepsin L activity was expressed as 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-liberating rate from Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. The nuclear extract from hepatocytes was prepared by the Schreiber method in the presence of leupeptin (1 μg/ml) to protect RXRα from the cleavage. Forty micrograms of the nuclear extract was electrophoresed through 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed using RXRα antibody (D-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by the method previously described (31Kikumori T. Kambe F. Nagaya T. Imai T. Funahashi H. Seo H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of bands was determined using the densitometric analysis program (NIH image version 1.44). Monolayer cultured hepatocytes were incubated with the membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64d (Taisho Pharmaceutical), beginning 1 day after the plating. On the 3rd day of the plating, 100 nm T3 was added, and the cells were harvested after 24 h. Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidine phenol/chloroform method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were separated by 0.8% agarose electrophoresis, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products), and hybridized with a labeled probe for spot 14 (f5-4, a gift from Dr. C. N. Mariash). Autoradiography was performed by exposing the hybridized membrane to Kodak X-AR (Eastman Kodak Co.). Radioactivity of the specific band was determined using Fujix Bioimage Analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Photo Film). The T3-dependent activation of spot 14 mRNA was expressed as fold induction (mean ± S.D. of triplicate results). The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the significance between groups was determined by Bonferroni's test. To assess whether the altered responsiveness to T3 in the hepatocytes cultured as monolayers and spheroids is due to alteration of TR amount, T3 binding capacity was determined in the nuclei prepared from the hepatocytes cultured as monolayers and spheroids. The T3-binding capacity was 92.5 fmol/100 μg of DNA in the hepatocytes cultured as monolayer and 99.6 fmol/100 μg of DNA in those cultured as spheroids. The determination was repeated twice, giving the similar results. It is thus demonstrated that the amount of TRs is not changed by the culture conditions. Since TR heterodimerize with TRAPs to exert T3 action, alteration of TRAP could be responsible for the altered responsiveness to T3. Thus, TRAPs in primary hepatocytes were analyzed by EMSA using the crude nuclear extract prepared by the Schreiber method (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). On DR4-TRE (Fig.1 A), in vitrotranslated TRβ bound to DR4 as a homodimer (D) and a heterodimer with RXRα (HD). The nuclear extract alone from monolayer (M-N) or spheroid cultures (S-N) did not result in any band shifts, suggesting that the nuclear extract may not have enough TRs to exhibit protein-DNA complexes. To analyze endogenous TRAPs, each nuclear extract was incubated with in vitro translated TRβ. The nuclear extract from monolayer cultures incubated with TRβ mainly formed a faster migrating complex (F). In contrast, the nuclear extract from spheroid cultures demonstrated two protein-DNA complexes in the presence of TRβ. A faster complex (F) migrated closely at TRβ homodimer and a slower one (S) was at the position of TRβ-RXRα heterodimer. To clarify whether the faster migrating complex includes TRβ homodimer, EMSA was performed in the presence of T3. As previously reported (33Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Forgione M. Umeda P.K. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3565-3568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of T3 eliminated homodimer binding but did not affect the RXRα-TRβ heterodimer formation (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of T3, the binding of both faster and slower migrating complexes did not disappear, suggesting that both complexes are heterodimers of TRβ and TRAPs in hepatocytes. On different TREs such as palindromic (Pal), inverted palindromic (Lap), and malic enzyme-TRE (Fig. 1 C), a similar pattern of protein-DNA complexes was demonstrated. Specifically, only the faster band (F) was observed in the crude nuclear extract from monolayer cultures and two retarded bands (F and S) in that from spheroid cultures. These results suggest that the nuclear extracts from monolayer or spheroid cultures contain different species of TRAPs. To characterize the TRAPs in hepatocytes cultured in the two conditions, antibodies to RXRα were added to the EMSA reactions, because a major TRAP in liver was previously reported as RXRα (34Lazar M.A. Berrodin T.J. Harding H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5005-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The epitopes of two RXRα antibodies are schematically depicted in Fig. 2 A. When the antibody C, recognizing the hinge region (amino acids 220–235) of RXRα (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar), was added to the EMSA reaction, the intensity of the faster (F) band in TRβ + M-N and TRβ + S-N mixture decreased, and a supershifted band was formed (Fig. 2 B, arrowheads). The slower band (S) in TRβ + S-N also reacted with this antibody. However, the antibody N raised against the amino terminus (amino acids 92–109) of RXRα (23Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Qi Y. Lechan R.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) did not decrease the binding of the faster migrating band in TRβ + M-N with no formation of the supershifted band. Similarly, the faster band in TRβ + S-N was not recognized by this antibody. However, the intensity of the slower band in TRβ + S-N decreased to form the supershifted band. Since the slower complex migrated close to TRβ-RXRα and was recognized by two RXRα antibodies, TRAP in the slower band is identified as full-length RXRα. On the other hand, the faster migrating complex might represent the RXRα with an amino-terminal truncation, since only the antibody to hinge region (Ab C) supershifted this band. Based on the epitopes of two RXRα antibodies and the requirement of RXR DNA binding domain for DNA binding, the site of truncation is speculated to be located near the junction of the amino-terminal region and the DNA binding domain (Fig.2 C). Supporting these results, the artificially constructed amino-terminal deletion of RXRα also formed a faster migrating complex with TRβ as similar as M-N did (data not shown). When using the highly purified nuclear extract prepared by the modified Shapiro method (16Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y .). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), the pattern of protein-DNA complexes on EMSA was quite different from that produced by the crude nuclear extract. As shown in Fig.3, the faster migrating complex was absent, and only the slower migrating complexes were observed in the nuclear extract from monolayer cultured hepatocytes (TRβ + M-N). Accordingly, the difference of protein-DNA complexes in the nuclear extracts from the hepatocytes cultured under these conditions was eliminated. These results suggest that the truncated RXRα does not exist in the nucleus and that the truncation observed in the crude nuclear extracts may be due to proteolytic cleavage during the preparation of nuclear extract by enzyme(s) present in the cytoplasmic fraction. To study further the cleavage of RXRα by cytoplasmic protease(s), the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared separately using the method of Schreiber et al. (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar), without any protease inhibitors. On Pal-TRE (Fig. 4 A), the nuclear extract from monolayer cultures (M-N) mainly formed a faster complex with TRβ (TRβ + M-N), whereas the one from spheroid demonstrated two retarded bands (TRβ + S-N). The mixture of in vitrotranslated TRβ, RXRα, and monolayer cytoplasmic extract (TRβ + RXRα + M-C) formed a similar TRβ-RXRα heterodimer. However, whenin vitro translated RXRα was preincubated with the cytoplasmic extract from monolayer cultures at 37 °C for 30 min and then EMSA was performed with TRβ, the faster migrating complex was demonstrated (Fig. 4 A, 7th lane, Inc (RXRα + M-C) + TRβ). This faster band was not observed by the preincubation of TRβ with the cytoplasmic extract (Inc (TRβ + M-C) + RXRα). These results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage of RXRα, but not TRβ, generates the faster migrating complex in EMSA. After preincubation of in vitro translated RXRα with the same amount (10 μg) of cytoplasmic extract either from monolayer or spheroid cultured hepatocytes, the faster migrating complex was predominantly demonstrated with monolayer but not with spheroid extracts (Fig. 4 B). It was thus suggested that RXRα cleaving activity was higher in the cytoplasmic extract of monolayer cultures, leading to a decrease of slower migrating complex in the nuclear extract from monolayer cultures. To analyze the time course of RXRα cleavage by the cytoplasmic enzyme, 35S-labeled in vitro translated RXRα was incubated with the cytoplasmic extract from monolayer cultures and analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). Surprisingly, full-length RXRα (54 kDa) was cleaved very rapidly, generating a 42-kDa band after a 1-min incubation. The proteolysis of RXRα was not observed with preheated (65 °C, 3 min) cytoplasmic extract (preheated CE + 60 min). To compare the proteolytic activity in the nuclear and the cytoplasmic extracts, 35S-labeled in vitro translated RXRα was incubated with each extract (Fig. 5 B). The RXRα-cleaving activity was predominantly in the cytoplasmic extract (RXRα + CE). Although the crude nuclear extract prepared by the Shreiber method had minor proteolytic activity (RXRα + crude NE), no RXR cleaving activity was observed in the highly purified nuclear extract by the modified Shapiro method (RXRα + purified NE). It is thus concluded that RXR proteolytic activity exists mainly in the cytoplasm and that the presence of proteolytic activity in the nuclear extract could be due to contamination by the cytoplasmic fraction. To characterize the product after RXRα cleavage, an immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using the two RXRα antibodies employed in the supershift analysis (Fig.6). 35S-Labeled full-length RXRα (54 kDa) was immunoprecipitated with either anti-RXRα antibody N or C. The 42-kDa RXRα cleaved by the cytoplasmic extract was recognized by antibody C but not by antibody N, indicating that this RXRα form lacks the amino terminus. This result is consistent with our EMSA results, which suggest the faster migrating complex contains RXRα with an amino-terminal truncation (Fig. 2). To characterize the enzyme responsible for RXRα cleavage, a series of protease inhibitors were added to the preincubation step, and then EMSA was performed with in vitro translated TRβ (Fig.7 A). Without any protease inhibitors, the preincubation of in vitro translated RXRα with monolayer cytoplasmic extract demonstrated the faster migrating complex with TRβ on Pal-TRE in EMSA (4th lane, Inc (RXRα + M-C) + TRβ). The generation of the faster band (RXRα proteolysis) was inhibited by antipain, chymostatin, E64, and leupeptin, suggesting that the enzyme responsible for RXRα proteolysis belongs to the family of cysteine proteases. To identify further the protease species among the cysteine proteases, calpastatin or ovocystatin was added to the incubation mixture of35S-labeled in vitro translated RXRα and the cytoplasmic extract from the monolayer hepatocytes. As shown in Fig.7 B, the presence of ovocystatin, but not calpastatin, inhibited proteolysis, suggesting that the cathepsin family of proteases, but not the calpain family, cleaves RXRα. When specific inhibitors for cathepsin B or L (cathepsin B-specific, CA-074 (26Katunuma N. Kominami E. Paker L. Biothiols :. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 382-397Google Scholar), and cathepsin L-type-specific, CLIK-088 and -112 (27Katunuma N. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) were added to the reaction, cathepsin L-type-specific, CLIKs (CLIK-088 and -112), but not cathepsin B-specific, CA-074, inhibited the RXRα cleaving activity in the cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 7 C). These results indicate that cathepsin L-type protease in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes cleaves RXRα at its amino terminus. Since the RXRα-cleaving enzyme in the cytoplasm was identified as cathepsin L-type protease, this enzyme activity was measured in the cytoplasmic extract of monolayer and spheroid cultured hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 8, the (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) liberating activity from Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Z-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, a substrate for both cathepsin B and L) in the presence of CA-074 was greater in hepatocytes cultured as monolayer than those as spheroid. These results correlate well the higher RXRα cleaving activity in the monolayer hepatocytes (Fig.4 B). To study the physiological significance of RXRα-cleaving protease in cytosol, a membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, E64d, which also inhibits cathepsin L-type protease activity, was added t"
https://openalex.org/W1972928995,"Previous experiments on DNA sequence context reported that base modification, replication, and repair are affected by the nature of neighbor bases. We now report that repair by mammalian alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylases (APNG) of 15-mer oligonucleotides with a central 1,N 6-ethenoadenine (εA), flanked by 5′ and 3′ tandem bases, is also highly sequence dependent. Oligonucleotides with the central sequences -GGεAGG- or -CCεACC- are repaired 3–5-fold more efficiently than those containing -AAεAAA- or -TTεATT- when using human or mouse APNG. Melting curves of the same duplexes showed that oligomers with G·C/C·G neighbors were less denatured than those with A·T/T·A neighbors at 37 °C. This sequence-dependent difference in denaturation correlates with the relative thermodynamic stability of oligomers with G·C/C·G or A·T/T·A neighbors. The dependence of repair on thermal stability was confirmed by enzyme reactions performed over 0–45 °C. Under these conditions, repair of εA flanked by G·C/C·G was dramatically increased at 37 °C with continuous increase up to 45 °C, in contrast to that with flanking A·T/T·A pairs, which was in agreement with the degree of denaturation of these duplexes. These results indicate that the thermodynamic stability conferred by base pairs flanking εA plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the duplex structure which is necessary for repair. Previous experiments on DNA sequence context reported that base modification, replication, and repair are affected by the nature of neighbor bases.

These results indicate that the thermodynamic stability conferred by base pairs flanking εA plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the duplex structure which is necessary for repair. Many laboratories have published data on the effect on efficiency of modification, replication, or repair of nucleic acids conferred by the immediate neighbor bases. In almost all cases, there was some measurable difference depending on sequence context. Most of the experiments on chemical modification which used a gene or a naturally occurring DNA led to a statistical analysis of the bases neighboring the lesion studied. These important data contributed to the hypothesis that localized DNA structure was an important determinant in the non-random distribution of adducts (e.g. Refs. 1Haseltine W.A. Gordon L.K.

In these experiments, specific sequences containing a modified base were primed and insertion and extension examined using a variety of polymerases. Usually the 5′ neighbor base effect was found to be an important factor, although the 3′ neighbor can also play a role. In addition, it has also been reported that the proofreading efficiency of polymerases is sequence-dependent (11Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Here again, specific neighbor sequences led to significant variations in the rate and extent of excision of a modified base by repair mechanisms including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, andO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. When a double-stranded structure is required, either as a partial duplex (template/primer) or as a full-length duplex, the stability of base pairs adjacent to the adduct can be an important factor in replication and repair. Thermodynamics has been a general method used to probe nucleic acid structure and strandedness (e.g. Refs.33Nelson J.W. Martin F.H. Tinoco Jr., I.

In some replication studies of templates containing modified bases, a correlation between the rate of insertion of a dNTP and the relative base pairing energies of the nearest neighbor base pairs was reported (16Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11247-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Shibutani S. Margulis L.A. Geacintov N.E. Grollman A.P.

In repair, it was assumed that G·C-rich neighbor regions would play a role in stabilizing the necessary double strand containing a mismatched base (22Jones M. Wagner R. Radman M. Genetics. 1987; 115: 605-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is likely to be true for all DNA modifying and repair enzymes which require a DNA duplex structure for activity except uracil-DNA glycosylase (41Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) andO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase both of which can act on single-stranded substrates, althoughO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is more active on double-stranded DNA substrates (42Demple B.

However, under the circumstances where repair is carried out by protein complexes such as the Escherichia coli UvrABC nuclease, the mechanism(s) underlying the sequence-dependent repair becomes more complicated as the efficiency of repair is also correlated with the stability of the preincision UvrB·DNA and UvrBC·DNA complexes (30Delagoutte E.

In the present work, we have carried out parallel studies of both repair by alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (APNG) 1The abbreviations used are: APNG, alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase; HAP1, human AP endonuclease 1; εA, 1,N 6-ethenoadenine; AP site, abasic site.

This adduct is efficiently removed by mammalian APNGs (44Singer B. Antoccia A. Basu A.K. Dosanjh M.K. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Gallagher P.E. Kusmierek J.T. Qiu Z.-H. Rydberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). We have now found a connection between the rate and extent of the APNG-mediated cleavage of εA-containing 15-mers and the thermal stability of these duplexes. Our work appears to be the first correlation between sequence-dependent glycosylase repair and degree of denaturation of the oligomer substrates. This may provide insights into sequence specificity of in vivo repair of εA or other adducts requiring a stable duplex structure.

It was shown to be more heat stable than the full-length human protein (52O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, O'Connor reported that there is no significant differences in the kinetic parameters of the full-length human APNG and the truncated form (52O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The purified 31-kDa mouse APNG protein (0.8 mg/ml) which lacks 48 residues from the amino terminus of the wild-type (wt) protein without loss of activity (53Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was a gift from Drs. R. Roy and S. Mitra. As with the truncated human APNG, there was no difference in kinetic properties of releasing m3A and m7G due to size (53Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purity of both proteins was found to be homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The human 5′ AP endonuclease (HAP1) (0.25 mg/ml) was a gift from Dr. I. D. Hickson. The crude HeLa cell-free preparation was used as a source for wild-type APNG protein activity and also an overall measurement of repair in the cell. The preparation of crude extracts from HeLa cells was carried out essentially as described by Singer et al.(44Singer B. Antoccia A. Basu A.K. Dosanjh M.K. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Gallagher P.E. Kusmierek J.T. Qiu Z.-H. Rydberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate precipitates, dissolved in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.125 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, were used in enzyme assays. The 15-nucleotide long oligodeoxynucleotides with a central A or εA were synthesized on a 1 μm scale and purified as described previously (21Litinski V. Chenna A. Sági J. Singer B. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The following 15-mer oligomers were used in this study: 5′-AGCGGNNXNNGAGCT-3′, where -NNXNN- are: -GGεAGG-, -CCεACC-, -AAεAAA-, and -TTεATT-. All control sequences were the same 15-mers in which A replaced εA in -NNXNN-. The complementary oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized contained a thymine opposite εA or A. Two complete sequences are shown in the form of duplexes (Fig.1). The sequences in common are outside the box and are shown as hydrogen bonded (•). The boxed central sequence is presented with unknown strength of hydrogen bonds (○) since it is possible that the region at the εA·T mismatch can be destabilized as reported for normal base mismatches and their neighbor bases (54Arnold F.H. Wolk S. Cruz P. Tinoco Jr., I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 55Borden K.L. Jenkins T.C. Skelly J.V. Brown T. Lane A.N.

The 15-mer oligonucleotides were 5′-end radiolabeled and annealed to their complementary strands as described by Rydberg et al. (57Rydberg B. Dosanjh M.K. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 86: 6839-6842Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the εA- or A- containing oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase in a kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 35 min. The labeled oligomers were then annealed to complementary 15-mers (1.5-fold molar excess) in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl by slowly cooling down from 90 °C to room temperature (1 h). The enzymatic assay used to examine APNG-mediated cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates was carried out essentially as described by Rydberg et al. (57Rydberg B. Dosanjh M.K. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 86: 6839-6842Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 58Rydberg B. Qiu Z.-H. Dosanjh M.K. Singer B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1377-1379PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 μl in 35 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 50 mm KCl, 0.6 mmMgCl2, 400 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol with 20 fmol of the 15-mer duplex. In the reactions when crude HeLa extracts were used, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) was added and bovine serum albumin was omitted. The reactions were stopped by addition of equal volume of gel loading buffer containing 90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue, heated at 95–100 °C for 2 min. This treatment yielded virtually identical amounts of cleavage of AP sites generated by the action of APNG on εA as that produced by the human 5′ AP endonuclease (HAP1) cleavage of the AP sites (Fig.2). Note that the protein concentration of HAP1 used was greatly in excess (25 ng) over that normally needed to cleave the same amount of AP sites (59Hang B. Rothwell D.G. Sági J. Hickson I.D. Singer B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15411-15418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The nonenzymatic method was used for all the cleavage reactions in this work. Electrophoresis of the reaction mixtures was carried out using a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The bands corresponding to the cleavage products and the remaining uncut substrates were scanned and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The curve fitting used the MicroCal Origin program (version 3.0). For the temperature-dependent experiments the standard enzyme reaction assay described above was used with differing reaction temperatures, 0–45 °C. In one type of experiment, a single reaction mixture was divided into six aliquots and each was incubated at a different temperature for 20 min with 2.5 ng of human APNG. 0 °C indicates on ice, 10 and 20 °C were controlled by adding ice to the water bath to maintain the required temperatures. Samples at 30, 40, and 45 °C were kept in water baths. All incubations were for 20 min with 2.5 ng of human APNG. In the second experiment, samples under standard conditions with 2.5 ng of human APNG were incubated at 20 °C for the indicated times (20 or 100 min) and then half of each sample continued an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Quantitation of APNG-mediated cleavage was by the standard gel electrophoresis which was scanned by a PhosphorImager as described under “Enzymatic Reaction.” Molar absorbance of the single strands containing only natural nucleotides was calculated by using the DNA/Oligo Quantitation Software of a Beckman DU 7400 diode-array spectrophotometer. In the case of the εA-containing oligonucleotides, the nearest neighbor interactions (60Borer P.N. Fasman G.D. 3rd Ed. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Nucleic Acids. 1. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1975: 589Google Scholar) were recalculated using the molar absorption coefficient of 5000 for εA, which was calculated from published spectral data (61Secrist III, J.A. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Molar absorbance of the εA-containing 15-mers was found to be lower by an average of 6%, as compared with the A-containing corresponding sequences. The double strands were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of the non-self-complementary single-strands in the buffer containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. These conditions differ from those used in enzymatic assays primarily in that the oligomer concentration is higher. Thermal transition profiles were measured using a Beckman DU 7400 diode-array spectrophotometer at 260 or 280 nm. A buffer containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, was used in all thermal denaturation experiments. For the determination of the melting curve at a single duplex concentration or for the analysis of the premelting region of the melting profiles a Beckman special Tm-6-cell holder was used. This has an internal thermometer, a Peltier temperature controller and is equipped with gas inlet accessory. The latter was used to flush the cell holder with nitrogen when measurements were started below 16 °C. The path length was 1 cm and the volume of samples was 0.32 ml. For the concentration dependence measurements, the Beckman normal 6-cell holder was used as described before (62Sági J. Chenna A. Hang B. Singer B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In both cases linear heating was used from 10 or 20 to 90 °C. The ramp rate was 0.2 °C/min in the range of ± 20 °C of theT m of the samples and 0.5 °C/min at other temperatures. Absorption values were measured at 0.5 °C intervals.T m values were obtained from the melting curves with the use of the MeltWin program (63McDowell J.A. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14077-14089Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Enthalpy (−ΔH O) and entropy (−ΔS O) data for duplex formation of the 15-mers were obtained in two ways: from the 1/T m − ln Ct plots (Fig. 3), where Ct is the total strand or duplex concentration, and from the melting profiles by using MeltWin, version 3.0. This program fits the shape of each curve to the two-state model with sloping base lines using a nonlinear least-square program (63McDowell J.A. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14077-14089Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the former method six duplex concentrations were used which ranged from 1 to 125 μM and measurements were carried out as described before (62Sági J. Chenna A. Hang B. Singer B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). From the parameters obtained from the 1/T m − ln Ctplots, only the −ΔH O values are shown in Table I. These were the averages of three to six determinations of separate samples. For the shape analysis with the melt curve processing program MeltWin the melting profiles were truncated at 20 and 90 °C.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the melting of the 15-mer duplexesCentral sequenceData from melting curve analysis with MeltWinData from 1/Tm − ln CtT m(°C)ΔTm(°C)−ΔH° (kcal/mol)−ΔS° (cal/mol · K)−ΔG°37(kcal/mol)ΔΔG° (kcal/mol)−ΔH° (kcal/mol)AAAAA55.7103.8289.714.0121.5AAɛAAA44.9−10.878.3220.310.0−4.093.9TTATT56.8100.1276.414.3115.8TTɛATT47.6−9.277.3214.910.5−3.8102.8GGAGG67.586.2227.015.8101.6GGɛAGG59.4−8.178.8211.413.3−2.596.2CCACC69.696.7255.217.4117.6CCɛACC62.2−7.480.4214.713.8−3.6102.0The measurements were carried out in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01m sodium phosphate, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). The values shown are the averages of three to six separate determinations. The T m values shown were determined at a duplex concentration of 8 μm. Standard deviation of the T m values averaged ± 0.5 °C. The average standard deviation for thermodynamic parameters of the MeltWin analysis was ± 3.6 kcal/mol for ΔH°, ± 10.6 cal/mol · K for ΔS°, ± 0.21 kcal/mol for ΔG°37, and ± 3.1 kcal/mol for ΔH° obtained from the 1/T m − lnC t plots.

Preliminary data on extent of cleavage of four 25-mer εA-containing oligomers with the same central sequences exhibited a definitive sequence dependence of cleavage of εA when using human APNG (64Singer B. Hang B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 7: 713-732Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The order of cleavage efficiency was -GGεAGG- or -CCεACC- > -AAεAAA- or -TTεATT-. The sequence -GGεATT- in the same 25-mer gave an intermediate level of cleavage. The length of these duplexes was considered to be too long for precise determination of the role of thermal stability in repair. Therefore, in this study the same flanking doublets were kept and both ends of the 15-mers truncated by 5 nucleotides in the new substrates, yielding the 15-mer sequences shown under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.1). In order to show both the extent and rate of repair of the 15-mer duplexes with εA flanked by differing neighbor bases, cleavage with human APNG was determined as a function of enzyme concentration for 20 min (Fig. 4 A) and of time using 2.5 ng of human APNG (Fig. 4 B). The 20-min time and 2.5 ng of APNG, which was within the linear portion of these cleavage curves, was used for all subsequent experiments involving human APNG. A representative gel is shown in Fig. 5which presents the cleavage of εA-containing oligomers after reaction with APNG or APNG + HAP1. Note that lanes 5–8 have a double-band on cleavage presumably resulting from the β-elimination mechanism due to high pH and high temperature in the treatment of samples (65Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 66Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When HAP1 is added to the APNG reaction (lanes 9–12) there is only a single band seen which is the result of cleavage of the phosphodiester bond 5′ to the AP site (65Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The 15-mers were in two classes in terms of repair efficiency: G·C or C·G neighbor pairing and A·T or T·A neighbor pairing. The A-containing control 15-mers were not cleaved in the presence of human APNG (data not shown). The εA-containing duplexes with G·C or T·A flanking bases were cleaved by wild-type crude HeLa extracts which contain full-length human APNG and the same preference for oligomers with G·C pairs was found (Fig. 6). Similar results of differential cleavage were also obtained with a purified cloned mouse APNG (Fig. 7). APNG, as expected, did not cleave the four single-stranded εA-containing 15-mers (data not shown).Figure 5Autoradiogram of cleavage of the four εA-containing oligomers using buffer only (lanes 1–4), 2.5 ng of human APNG (lanes 5–8), and 2.5 ng of human APNG plus 25 ng of HAP1 (lanes 9–12).

We have recently shown that the isolated p85 subunit exists as a dimer; therefore, we examined whether the heterodimeric enzyme was capable of further self-association. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that PI3K was a 1:1 complex of p85 and p110 under native conditions. However, binding of a diphosphotyrosine-containing peptide that mimics an activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor β induced an increase in the apparent molecular mass of PI3K. This increase was due to dimerization of PI3K and was dependent on PI3K concentration but not diphosphopeptide concentration. Dimer formation was also observed directly using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Diphosphopeptide-induced activation of PI3K (Carpenter, C. L., Auger, K.

In response to a number of cell stimuli, this two-subunit enzyme phosphorylates the 3′ position of inositol lipids to produce the second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate (PI-3,4-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3), which have been shown to bind to and activate plekstrin homology domain-containing proteins such as protein kinase B (AKT) and PDK1 (2Alessi D.R.

The catalytic subunit, p110, also contains several homology domains, including the kinase domain, a PIK domain whose sequence is conserved in PI3-kinases and PI4-kinases, as well as putative N-terminal p85-binding and Ras binding domains (6Zvelebil M.J.

It is likely that multiple events are required to transduce a signal via this lipid/protein kinase. Binding of the tandem SH2 domains in the regulatory subunit to specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs present on a range of molecules, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic signaling proteins, including IRS-1, has been reported to increase the intrinsic activity of PI3K (9Backer J.M.

For example, activation of PI3K by binding of Ha-RasV12 has been most convincingly demonstrated when Ras was immobilized in phosphatidylinositol-containing lipid vesicles (17Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of Ras may be to recruit PI3K to its membrane substrate, in a mechanism analogous to that of c-Raf activation by Ras (18Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar).Another common theme in activation of intracellular signaling proteins is dimerization or oligomerization, which can be induced by ligand binding and, in the case of RTKs, lead to auto- or trans-phosphorylation of the RTK and up-regulation of catalytic activity. Several intracellular protein kinases, such as c-Raf, have also been shown to be activated by dimerization (19Farrar M.A. Alberol I. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the 85-kDa subunits of PI3K exist as dimers in the absence of the catalytic subunit, whereas the low molecular mass isoforms of the regulatory subunit are monomeric. 2A.

C. Driscoll, and M. D. Waterfield, submitted for publication. In contrast, PI3K activity in unstimulated cells has been reported to have an apparent molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa (21Shibasaki F. Fukui Y. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Woscholski R. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the whole enzyme comprises one of each of the p110 and p85 subunits. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the binding of a peptide that mimics an activated PDGFβ receptor to the tandem SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit induces dimerization of the 200-kDa enzyme via an interface that includes regions of the regulatory subunits.DISCUSSIONOne of the first events in RTK-mediated signal transduction is growth factor-induced receptor dimerization or oligomerization (35Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization triggers the intrinsic kinase activity, resulting in trans- and auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and creation of specific binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins. SH2 domains bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequence motifs with a high degree of specificity (36Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 37Songyang Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), and the consensus sequence motifs that bind a number of SH2 domains have been defined, including that of the p85 subunit of PI3K (37Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Both SH2 domains in p85α bind a linear epitope with the sequence pYXXM (where X is any amino acid), and this sequence motif is present in a number of RTKs and intracellular docking proteins. Some signaling proteins, such as IRS-1 and Erb B3 (9Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have more than one sequence pYXXM motif, and the PDGFβ-R has two pYXXM motifs with seven amino acid residues between them (39Claesson Welsh L.

Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).The binding of a peptide containing both pYXXM motifs from the PDGFβ-R (Tyr-751/Tyr-740) (11Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R.

Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) has been shown to activate the intrinsic lipid kinase activity of PI3K when PI was the phosphorylation substrate, whereas peptides containing only one p85-binding site bind with lower affinity and activate the enzyme to a lesser extent. A mechanism for PI3K activation has been postulated in which both SH2 domains in p85 are simultaneously occupied by both phosphotyrosine residues in a diphosphopeptide, which causes a conformational change within the inter-SH2 region of the p85 subunit and activates p110 (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Binding of Tyr-740/Tyr-751 has been shown to induce a conformational change in the p85α regulatory subunit (12Panayotou G. Bax B. Gout I. Federwisch M. Wroblowski B. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which may be the same conformational change that is involved in the self-association of the PI3K heterodimer (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Binding of the two phosphotyrosine residues in the diphosphopeptide to SH2 domains in different PI3K molecules did not seem to be the mechanism by which dimerization occurs, as the formation of higher molecular mass complexes of PI3K was independent of diphosphopeptide concentration (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the diphosphopeptide does not participate directly in the dimerization event.Binding of a diphosphopeptide to the SH2 domains of PI3K therefore seems to affect another region of the protein, resulting in self-association of the enzyme (Figs. 1 and 3). In contrast, binding of singly phosphorylated peptides did not induce dimerization of PI3K (Fig. 1 B), even though Tyr-751 binds both SH2 domains of p85 with similar affinities (28Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can presumably occupy both SH2 domains simultaneously. Occupation of SH2 domains is therefore not sufficient to induce dimerization, and a subsequent event must be required which, given the distance constraints imposed by the seven residues between the two pYXXM motifs in this peptide, may involve the SH2 domains moving closer together. This would suggest that the conformational change occurs within the inter-SH2 region, which may act as a flexible linker between the two SH2 domains. The inter-SH2 region is the binding site for the p110 subunit (40Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), which may explain how an SH2 domain-mediated event could be transmitted to the p110 subunit. The variable length of the sequence between phosphotyrosine residues in proteins with more than one pYXXM motif suggests that not all binding events involving both SH2 domains would lead to dimerization. The insulin receptor (IR) has only 6 residues between tandem pYXXM motifs, whereas IRS-1 has 20 residues. PI3K is activated by a peptide derived from the IRS-1 sequence (10Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) but not the IR sequence (41Van Horn D.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the idea that it is the precise distance constraint imposed on the two SH2 domains that is important for inducing a conformational change in the inter-SH2 region. Different arrangements pYXXM motifs in three-dimensional space may therefore mediate signal specificity in PI3K signaling pathways.The conformational change in the inter-SH2 region that is transmitted to the p110 subunit results in the unmasking of a binding site for another diphosphopeptide-bound PI3K. This binding site must be obscured when the SH2 domains are not peptide-bound or when they are bound to singly phosphorylated peptides. It has previously been observed that immunoprecipitation of PI3K using a polyclonal antibody against p85α was less efficient in the presence of Tyr-740/Tyr-751 (11Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Chanudhuri M. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. Shoelson S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9478-9483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some surfaces on PI3K are less accessible when the SH2 domains are bound to diphosphopeptide. We have previously shown that p85α forms a homodimer and that the dimerization interface resides in the N-terminal half of the protein, which contains the SH3 and BH domains and two proline-rich motifs.2 Combinations of these N-terminal domains have also been shown to be dimers (42Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 43Chen J.K. Schreiber S.L. BioMed. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 1755-1760Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The SH3 and BH domains are therefore free to form a dimeric interface in p85α alone but not in the p110α-EE tag-p85α complex. This implies that p110 may interact with the SH3 and BH domains, preventing their interaction with each other, and that this interaction is released when the SH2 domains bind diphosphopeptide. This may also explain how the binding of SH3 or BH domain ligands to PI3K could regulate the catalytic activity (13Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C.

Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) is often an early step in signal transduction. Another emerging theme in receptor-mediated signaling is the formation of multiprotein complexes, some of which bind to dimeric receptors, and may also contain dimeric components. Formation of these complexes can result in the activation of one or more components of the complex, in recruitment to the juxtamembrane region of the cell, or in the creation of novel protein-binding surfaces. New binding sites can be generated by heterotypic or homotypic protein-protein interactions, which may allow recruitment of other components of the complex. Dimerization of PI3K does not directly activate the intrinsic kinase activity in vitro; therefore, the role of dimer formation may be to generate novel binding surfaces for recruitment of other cellular signaling proteins that may be the factors that moderate PI3K activity in vivo. The differences in the three-dimensional arrangements of pYXXM motifs in signaling proteins and their ability or inability to induce PI3K dimerization increases the repertoire of PI3K-containing multiprotein complexes and may be a mechanism that directs specificity in PI3K-mediated signal transduction downstream of different cell stimuli. Propagation of extracellular signals to the nucleus is mediated by a wide range of second messengers, which employ a number of common signaling mechanisms, such as dimerization or oligomerization, phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues, the binding of SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH, src homology; BH, BCR homology; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HP-SEC, high performance size-exclusion chromatography; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization; PDGFβ-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; pY, phosphotyrosine; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; 2-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; Bicine, N,N-bis(2- hydroxyethyl)glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: SH, src homology; BH, BCR homology; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HP-SEC, high performance size-exclusion chromatography; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization; PDGFβ-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; pY, phosphotyrosine; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; 2-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; Bicine, N,N-bis(2- hydroxyethyl)glycine. or phosphotyrosine binding domains to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, or binding of SH3 domains to proline-rich sequence motifs. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a dual-specificity kinase that has been implicated in a wide range of cellular events, including proliferation and cell migration (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In response to a number of cell stimuli, this two-subunit enzyme phosphorylates the 3′ position of inositol lipids to produce the second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate (PI-3,4-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3), which have been shown to bind to and activate plekstrin homology domain-containing proteins such as protein kinase B (AKT) and PDK1 (2Alessi D.R.

PI3K is also a serine/threonine kinase that can autophosphorylate either subunit (3Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Katsuga M.

A number of PI3K isoforms are known, which can be classified on the basis of their subunit composition and sequence homology. The class IA PI3Ks are heterodimers of a p110 catalytic subunit, of which there are three isoforms, p110α, p110β, and p110δ (6Zvelebil M.J. MacDougall L. Leevers S. Volinia S. Vanhaesebroeck B.

The catalytic subunit, p110, also contains several homology domains, including the kinase domain, a PIK domain whose sequence is conserved in PI3-kinases and PI4-kinases, as well as putative N-terminal p85-binding and Ras binding domains (6Zvelebil M.J.

A number of regulatory mechanisms for PI3K have been described, but no single event has been demonstrated to result in full activation of this enzyme. It is likely that multiple events are required to transduce a signal via this lipid/protein kinase.

This pathway includes processing and activation of initiator procaspase-8, redistribution of cytochrome c, and activation of procaspase-3. Bcl-2 functions at or upstream of procaspase-8 processing to inhibit all of these events and prevent cell death. This contrasts with the anti-apoptotic influence of Bcl-2 family proteins in the cell death pathway induced by Fas ligand or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in which Bcl-2 typically acts downstream of Fas/TNFR1-mediated activation of caspase-8. Moreover, E1A induces procaspase-8 processing and cell death in cells deleted of FADD, an adaptor protein critical for Fas/TNFR1 activation of caspase-8. The results indicate that E1A is capable of activating caspase-8 by a Bcl-2-inhibitable pathway that does not involve autocrine stimulation of FADD-dependent death receptor pathways.

In all cases examined to date, the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis suppressors function upstream of effector caspase-3 to inhibit cell death (16Boulakia C.A. Chen G. Ng F.W.H. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E.

This aborts downstream activation of the Apaf-l-procaspase-9 caspase activation complex, which requires cytochrome c as a constituent cofactor, and subsequent processing of procaspase-3 by caspase-9 (21Liu X.

In contrast, the death inhibitory activity of Bcl-2 family suppressors in response to Fas ligand or TNF occurs downstream of receptor-activated caspase-8 in most instances (24Boise L.H. Thompson C.B.

Here, we have examined the contribution of the FADD-dependent death receptor and cytochromec-Apaf-1-procaspase-9 caspase activation complexes to apoptosis induced by a model oncogene product in rodents, the 12 S E1A product of adenovirus type 5, and at what point Bcl-2 intercedes and blocks E1A-induced apoptosis. Depending on the cellular and viral contexts, the products of early region 1A mRNAs (12 S E1A and 13 S E1A) of adenovirus stimulate DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cellular transformation or apoptosis (28Shikama N. Lyon J. la Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the longer product of 13 S E1A mRNA, the 243-residue product of 12 S E1A, which lacks conserved region 3 (CR3), is incapable of activating most other early viral units. Thus, virus that produces 12 S E1A and that lacks the E1B region, whose 19- and 55-kDa protein products are inhibitors of apoptosis, represents a viral vector that efficiently delivers 12 S E1A as the main vector expression product. This product is a potent inducer of apoptosis in a wide variety of human and rodent cells, for which it exhibits an absolute dependence on functional p53 tumor suppressor protein (30Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 31Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 or E1B 19K protects cells against E1A (32Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) by inhibiting caspase activation (16Boulakia C.A. Chen G. Ng F.W.H. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Poirrier G.G.

Virus that expresses both 12 S and 13 S spliceoforms of E1A, and lacks E1B, induces additional apoptotic pathways as a result of expression of other viral proteins,e.g. the adenoviral death factor, E4orf4, which triggers p53- and caspase-independent apoptosis (3Lavoie J.N.

In this report, we demonstrate that 12 S E1A induces apoptosis by a pathway that does not require autocrine stimulation of FADD-dependent cell surface death receptors. In contrast to the caspase cascade activated by these cell surface receptors in response to ligand, Bcl-2 acts upstream rather than downstream of procaspase-8 in the E1A pathway. KB human epithelial cells stably expressing Bcl-2 have been described previously (34Nguyen M. Branton P.E. Walton P.A. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2. 1994; 69: 16521-16524Google Scholar). Those stably expressing dominant-negative C287A procaspase-9 (35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Elnemri E.S. Mol.

Infection with adenovirus type 5 dl520E1B− (expressing only 12 S E1A and no E1B products) (36Shepherd S.E. Howe J.E. Mymryk J.S. Bayley S.T. J.

Immunoblotting and microscopic immunofluorescence was conducted as described previously (3Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J.

Primary embryo fibroblasts were prepared from 9.5-day-old embryos of mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the entire coding region of FADD(38Yeh W.-C. de la Pompe J. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Ad5 dl52OE1B− is an adenovirus type 5 vector that produces the 243-amino acid product of 12 S E1A mRNA as the major vector expression product (36Shepherd S.E. Howe J.E. Mymryk J.S. Bayley S.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As documented previously (37Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), 243R E1A triggers apoptosis in KB human epithelial cells by a pathway that is inhibited by Bcl-2. This pathway includes activation of initiator procaspase-8 and cleavage of the caspase-8 target, Bap31 (Fig. 1). Bap31 is a 28-kDa polytopic integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that functions as a predicted regulator of apoptosis. Following induction of apoptosis, it is cleaved within its cytosolic tail by caspase-8, generating a 20-kDa membrane-integrated fragment (p20 Bap31) (37Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, Bcl-2 inhibits processing of procaspase-8 to the p18 catalytic subunit induced by 12 S E1A and blocks the appearance of the p20 Bap31 product. 12 S E1A expression results in a dramatic but transient increase in p53 levels (30Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 31Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 39Querido E. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3526-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this is not influenced by Bcl-2 (not shown), indicating that Bcl-2 acts downstream of this event on the E1A pathway. Immunostaining of KB cells with antibody against cytochromec revealed a redistribution of this mitochondrial protein throughout the cell in response to E1A expression. This began within 24 h (Fig. 2), at a time when most cells retained an intact plasma membrane, as judged by exclusion of trypan blue (Fig. 1). In contrast, Bcl-2 inhibited these E1A-induced events. Even after 48 h of E1A expression in the presence of Bcl-2, cells remained normal and retained cytochrome c in a punctate mitochondrial pattern, whereas control cells were obviously apoptotic (Fig. 2). To examine if cytochrome c redistribution in response to E1A expression plays a direct role in the E1A apoptotic pathway, or results indirectly as a consequence of apoptosis induced by a parallel pathway, we examined the requirement for cytochrome c's immediate downstream target, procaspase-9. Processing of procaspase-9 occurs by oligomerization-induced autocatalytic activation (35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Elnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) following its recruitment into the Apaf-1-cytochrome c caspase activation complex in the cytosol (23Li P. Nijhawan I. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Elnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). As a consequence, co-expression of catalytically inactive proenzyme exerts a dominant-negative (DN) influence on procaspase-9 processing. To that end, KB cells were created that stably express procaspase-9 DN-C287A (35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Elnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) at levels approximately three times that of the endogenous wild type proenzyme. As shown in Fig. 3, the procaspase-9 DN significantly retarded the death of these cells in response to E1A. Finally, we examined the contribution of FADD-dependent cell surface death receptors to the E1A apoptotic pathway. Mice harboring a homozygous deletion of the FADD gene have been created recently, from which embryonic fibroblasts can be obtained (38Yeh W.-C. de la Pompe J. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In contrast to fibroblasts taken from FADD+/+ mice,FADD-null fibroblasts were resistant to cell death induced by TNFα, whose receptor depends on FADD for activation of caspase-8. However, both FADD+/+ and FADD−/− cells exhibited equivalent sensitivity to death signaling by adenovirus lacking the E1B region (38Yeh W.-C. de la Pompe J. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Fig. 4extends these findings and shows that 12 S E1A expression in the FADD-null cells resulted in processing of procaspase-8 and cell killing. As demonstrated previously (38Yeh W.-C. de la Pompe J. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), these cells were resistant to killing by TNFα in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, which inhibits TNFα-induced survival pathways (Fig.4). E1A proteins are transcriptional regulators whose influence on cell proliferation depends on discrete regions within the molecule, which include conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2), together with a less well conserved amino terminus. These regions are common to the two forms of the protein (derived from 12 S and 13 S E1A mRNA) and function by binding to a family of proteins related to retinoblastoma protein. This releases the otherwise Rb-sequestered E2F group of transcription factors that turn on genes that stimulate cell growth. Additionally, CR1 and the amino terminus bind the p300/CBP family of transcription factor co-activators, resulting in repression of various genes contributing to terminal cellular differentiation (28Shikama N. Lyon J. la Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these responses of the cell to E1A expression are tied to the apoptosis-inducing properties of E1A is not presently known, but one possibility may involve regulation of gene products in concert with p53 that influence one or more of the caspase activation complexes of the cell (33Sabbatini P. Han J. Chiou S.-K. Nicholson D.W. White E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of apoptosis induced by coupling Myc expression with survival factor withdrawal, for example, it has been suggested that cell death involves Myc-induced autocrine stimulation of the cell surface death receptor, CD95/Fas/Apo-1 (14Hueber A.-O. Zörnig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The Fas-dependent caspase activation complex, or DISC (death-inducing signaling complex), is coupled to activation of procaspase-8 via the adaptor molecule, FADD (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). However, Myc is cytotoxic in mouse cells devoid of FADD (38Yeh W.-C. de la Pompe J. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.-B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), suggesting that other death pathways are influenced by Myc, including a pathway that does not involve caspases (2McCarthy N.J. Whyte M.K.B. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Here, we show that E1A not only is capable of inducing cytoxicity in the absence of FADD but that this is accompanied by activation of procaspase-8, indicating that this initiator procaspase is capable of being processed by a FADD-independent mechanism. One possibility is that processing of procaspase-8 is an end or by-product of Fas signaling via the adaptor protein, Daxx, and the JNK kinase cascade (43Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), although such a link has not yet been described. Another is that processing of procaspase-8 is a by-product of activation of effector caspase-3 via the Apaf-1-cytochromec-procaspase-9 caspase activation complex (23Li P. Nijhawan I. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Elnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). E1A induces release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 2) and activation of caspase-3 (16Boulakia C.A. Chen G. Ng F.W.H. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Poirrier G.G. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sabbatini P. Han J. Chiou S.-K. Nicholson D.W. White E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our finding that a dominant-negative mutant of procaspase-9 retards cell death in response to E1A (Fig. 3) indicates that this caspase activation complex contributes directly to the E1A-induced apoptotic pathway. A third possibility is that procaspase-8 is activated by a separate FADD-independent caspase activation complex and that caspase-3 is activated either as a consequence of cytochrome c release from mitochondria induced by caspase-8 (27Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or by a parallel pathway. One candidate is the Bap31 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-associated protein that can recruit procaspase-8 and a Ced-4-like adaptor (37Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3140-3143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bap31 is also a target of caspase-8 or related caspase during apoptosis induced by E1A, generating a proapoptotic fragment of the protein (37Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, we demonstrate here that Bcl-2 acts upstream to prevent E1A-induced activation of caspase-8 and cell death, which differs from the Fas/TNFR1 pathway in which Bcl-2 suppressors typically function downstream of the active enzyme (24Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 25Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.P. J. Biol.

This ability of Bcl-2 to block activation of both initiator and effector caspases in response to signaling by an oncogene like E1A likely contributes to the sustained suppression of apoptosis that is required to support manifestation of the cellular transforming properties of these otherwise death-inducing oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2085811801,"A series of plasmids were constructed containing two unidirectional ColE1 replication origins in either the same or opposite orientations and their replication mode was investigated using two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. The results obtained showed that, in these plasmids, initiation of DNA replication occurred at only one of the two potential origins per replication round regardless of origins orientation. In those plasmids with inversely oriented origins, the silent origin act as a polar pausing site for the replication fork initiated at the other origin. The distance between origins (up to 5.8 kilobase pairs) affected neither the interference between them to initiate replication nor the pausing function of the silent origin. A deletion analysis indicated that the presence of a transcription promoter upstream of the origin was the only essential requirement for it to initiate replication as well as to account for its polar pausing function. Finally, in vitro helicase assays showed that Escherichia coli DnaB is able to melt DNA-DNA homoduplexes but is very inefficient to unwind RNA-DNA hybrids. Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that replication forks pause at silent ColE1 origins due to the inability of DnaB helicase, which leads the replication fork in vivo, to unwind RNA-DNA hybrids.

The difficulty to generate palindromes involving ColE1 origins is a well known paradox (1Collins J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 45: 409-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mizuuchi K.

Indeed, co-orientation of replication origins is the most common organization found in nature for multimeric plasmids. Streptococcus pyogens broad host range plasmid pSM19035 is one of the few exceptions (3Ceglowski P. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. FEMS Microbiol.

Whether this peculiar replication behavior is specific forS. pyogens pSM19035-derived plasmids or a general feature for all plasmids containing two inversely oriented ColE1 origins is still to be shown. Moreover, nothing is known about the mechanism responsible for the transient pausing of replication forks as they encounter another silent and inversely oriented ColE1 origin; and the palindromic structure of pPI21 made it difficult to find out whether or not both origins were equally competent to initiate DNA replication. To answer all these questions, we constructed a series of E. coli plasmids containing two unidirectional ColE1 origins in either the same or opposite orientations. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (6Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) was then used to study the replication mode of these plasmids in order to investigate the interference between the origins and the efficiency of complete or partially deleted origins to initiate replication as well as to stall replication forks initiated at the other origin. We hoped these experiments would shed new light on the mechanism responsible for the polar pausing of replication forks at other silent and inversely oriented ColE1 origins. In this way they would help us to understand why palindromes involving ColE1 origins are so rare in nature and even difficult to obtain in the laboratory. The E. colistrain used in this study was DH5αF′. Competent cells were transformed with monomeric forms of the plasmids as described elsewhere (7Martı́n-Parras L. Hernández P. Martı́nez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22496-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin unless otherwise specified. To construct pHH0.5 and pHT0.5, the 759-bp-long AflIII-DraI fragment from pUC19 was blunt-ended with Klenow and cloned in both orientations into theSmaI site of pUC19 dephosphorylated with CIP. pHH2.0 and pHT2.0 were obtained by digesting pHH0.5 and pHT0.5 between the origins with HincII and CIP dephosphorylated. The 1,453-bp-longEcoRI fragment from YRp7′ containing the ARS1-trp cassette was blunt-ended with Klenow and cloned into HincII-cleaved pHH0.5 and pHT0.5. pHH5.8 and pHT5.8 were obtained by cutting pHH2.0 and pHT2.0 between the origins with EcoRV and CIP dephosphorylated. A 3,851-bp-long EcoRI-KpnI fragment from human rDNA was blunt-ended with T4 polymerase and cloned into EcoRV-cleaved pHH2.0 and pHT2.0. To construct pHH/BR-BR2.9, the 1,165-bp-longPvuII-DraI fragment from pBR322 containing the complete ColE1 origin was cloned into EcoRV-cleaved pBR322 dephosphorylated with CIP. pHH/BR-ΔRNAS2.9 was constructed inserting the 820-bp-long AlwNI-PvuII fragment from pBR322 into EcoRV-cleaved pBR322 that was previously made blunt-ended with T4 polymerase. To construct pHH/BR-Δpass2.9, the 759-bp-long DraI-AflIII fragment from pBR322 was blunt-ended with Klenow and cloned into EcoRV-cleaved pBR322. Finally, pHH/BR18-ΔRNAs2.9 was constructed cutting pHH/BR-ΔRNAs with EcoRI and HindIII to eliminate the tetracycline promoter, and this fragment was replaced with a 51-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pUC19 containing the multiple cloning site. Cells from overnight cultures were diluted 40-fold into fresh LB medium, grown at 37 °C to exponential phase (A 600 = 0.4–0.6), quickly chilled, and centrifuged. 1000 ml of cultured cells were washed with 20 ml of STE buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 5 ml of 25% sucrose and 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) were added, and the suspension was maintained on ice for 5 min. Afterward, 2 ml of 0.25m EDTA, pH 8.0, were added, and the suspension was kept on ice for another 5 min. Cell lysis was achieved by adding 8 ml of lysis buffer (1% Brij-58, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 0.063 mEDTA, pH 8.0, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and keeping the lysate for 15 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 26,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to pellet the chromosomal DNA and other bacterial debris. Plasmid DNA was recovered from the supernatant and precipitated by adding 2/3 volume of 25% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 1.25 m NaCl in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) and kept overnight at 4 °C on ice. The precipitated DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended and incubated in 5 ml of a preheated digestion buffer (100 μg/ml proteinase K in 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS), at 37 °C for 60 min. Proteins were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then extracted once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol overnight at −20 °C and resuspended in TE. The DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases (Boehringer Mannheim) as recommended by the manufacturer in the presence of 100 μg/ml RNase A. Analysis of RIs by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described elsewhere (7Martı́n-Parras L. Hernández P. Martı́nez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22496-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first dimension was in a 0.28–0.4% agarose gel in TBE buffer at 1 V/cm and room temperature for 22–38 h. The lane containing the λ DNA-HindIII marker sizes was excised, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and photographed. In the meantime, the lanes containing DNA RIs were kept in the dark. The second dimension was in a 0.85–1% agarose gel in TBE containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide at a 90° angle with respect to the first dimension. The dissolved agarose was poured around the excised lane from the first dimension, and electrophoresis was at 5 V/cm in a 4 °C cold room for 6–8 h. Gels were washed for 15 min in 0.25 n HCl before an overnight transfer to Zeta-Probe blotting membranes (Bio-Rad) in 0.4 n NaOH. Prehybridization was carried out in 2× SSPE (3.6 m NaCl, 0.2 m Na2HPO4, 20 mmEDTA), 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5% Blotto, and 250 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C. After 4 h, 6 × 105 cpm/ml of probe DNA labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming was added and incubated at 65 °C overnight. After hybridization the membranes were washed in 2% SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, followed by an additional 15 min in 0.5% SSC, 0.1% SDS also at room temperature. The last 15-min wash was in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Exposure of Curix RP2 (Agfa) films was carried out at −80 °C with two intensifying screens for 1–3 days. DnaB of E. coli was purified following a modification of the procedure developed by (8Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Three liters of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the DnaB overproducer (pET11b-DnaB) were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and a soluble fraction was obtained breaking the cells with liquid nitrogen and lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 10% glycerol). DnaB was then precipitated with 0.2 g/ml ammonium sulfate, resuspended, and dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATPm and 10% glycerol. The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with buffer A, and a gradient between buffers A and B (the same as buffer A but with 800 mm NaCl) was run. The DnaB fractions obtained were then pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose Hi-Trap prepackaged column (Pharmacia). A salt gradient was run between buffers A and B. DnaB fractions were then pooled and stored at −70 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. DnaB concentration was determined with a spectrophotometer at 280 nm. The DNA-DNA helicase substrate was prepared phosphorylating 10 pmol of the oligonucleotide: 5′-CAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCTTAAAAAAAAAAAA-3′ with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) in 50 μl of total volume. The phosphorylated oligonucleotide was purified through G-25 Sepharose, annealed to 1 pmol of pBlueScript KS+ single-stranded DNA in 100 μl of total volume and purified again through a CL-4B column. The RNA-DNA helicase substrate was obtained by an in vitrotranscription reaction of HindIII-cleaved pBlueScript KS+. The transcription reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 6 mm MgCl2; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 2 mm spermidine; 500 μm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP 800 Ci/mmol (Amersham); 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim); 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim); and 500 ng of DNA template. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Ten units of RQ1 DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min. The volume was increased to 100 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). A standard reaction mixture (in a total volume of 20 μl) for DnaB and helicase II contained 10 fmol of the specific substrate employed (DNA-DNA or RNA-DNA) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mmATP, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (9Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29138-29144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indicated amounts of DnaB or helicase II were added to the substrate and incubated for 10 min (helicase II) or 30 min (DnaB) at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of a dye mixture containing SDS-EDTA-sucrose and bromphenol blue. The end products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 3–10% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Exposure of Curix RP2 (Agfa) films to the dried gels was carried out at −80 °C with two intensifying screens for 1–12 h. The percentage of oligonucleotide released from the substrate was determined using a PhosphorImager densitometer. One of our primary goals was to find out whether or not the polar pausing of a replication fork at another origin was a general feature for all plasmids containing two inversely oriented ColE1 origins. We wanted to answer this question using two-dimensional gels to study the RIs of non-palindromic plasmids to determine if both origins were equally competent to initiate replication. Finally, we also wanted to know if the physical distance between the origins affected their capacity to interfere with each other and to act as a replication pausing site. Two series of plasmids were constructed containing two potentially active ColE1 origins either in the same or in opposite orientations. Each series comprised three different plasmids, where the distance between origins was approximately 0.5, 2.0, and 5.8 kb, respectively (Fig. 1). A small fragment of pUC19 containing the ColE1 origin was inserted into the SmaI site of this same vector, in both orientations. We previously confirmed that the aforementioned DNA fragment was able to confer autonomous replication to plasmids lacking a replication origin (data not shown). In this way we obtained the first two plasmids of each series: pHH0.5 and pHT0.5. HH points to the head-to-head orientation, while HT indicates head-to-tail orientation. 0.5 refers to the distance between the origins (in kb). Next, pHH2.0 and pHT2.0 were constructed where the distance between origins had increased from 0.5 to 2.0 kb. Finally, we built up pHH5.8 and pHT5.8, the third member of each series, where the distance between origins was approximately 5.8 kb. Fig. 1 shows the restriction maps and the construction sequence followed to make the pHH series. As indicated before, the pHT series was constructed in a similar fashion (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). We used a computer program (10Viguera E. Rodrı́guez A. Hernández P. Krimer D.B. Trelles O. Schvartzman J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to predict the shape of the RIs as well as the two-dimensional agarose gel patterns expected for each of the experiments performed throughout this study. To illustrate its usefulness, Fig. 2 shows the predictions made by the program for the RIs corresponding to pHH2.0 after digestion with KpnI. Two series of RIs were drawn by the program depending on whether initiation occurs only at the native origin, hereafter defined as oriα (shown to the left), or only at the new origin, named oriβ (shown to the right). If initiation only occurs at oriα, a bubble would be formed that would grow rightward until the replication fork reaches the right end of the fragment. At this point the molecular mass of the RI would be 1.54× the mass of the linear unreplicated form (between 1.43 and 1.58). When the replication fork reaches the right end of the fragment, the bubble would open up and the shape of the RIs would change abruptly from a bubble to a simple-Y. As the replication fork leaves the fragment by the right end, it re-enters by the left end still moving rightward, and the shape of the RIs changes again from a simple to a double-Y. If initiation only occurs at oriβ, the shape of the RIs would be similar, although in this case the replicating fork would progress leftward. More importantly, when the bubble opens up as the replication fork reaches the left end of the fragment, the mass of the RI would be 1.85× (between 1.74 and 1.87) instead of 1.54×, as in the previous case. If the replication fork initiated at one origin pauses as it encounters the other silent origin, a specific RI would accumulate in both cases with a relative mass of approximately 1.4×. The predicted two-dimensional agarose gel pattern corresponding to each series of RIs are shown in the lower part of Fig. 2. As indicated earlier, a similar prediction was made for all the plasmids analyzed throughout this study before the two-dimensional agarose gel experiments were actually performed. Plasmid DNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells that had been transfected with each of the six previously described plasmids. pHH0.5 and pHT0.5 DNAs were digested with ScaI, pHH2.0 and pHT2.0 were digested withKpnI, and pHH5.8 and pHT5.8 were digested withAlwNI. Finally, the RIs of all six plasmids were independently analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (6Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the autoradiograms corresponding to pHH0.5, pHH2.0, pHT2.0, and pHH5.8. pHH0.5 was hybridized with the entire pUC19 DNA, used as a probe. pHH2.0 and pHT2.0 were hybridized with the entire pHH0.5 DNA. Finally, pHH5.8 was hybridized with the 3,851-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment from human rDNA. As in all these cases, initiation of DNA replication could occur at either the native (oriα) or the new (oriβ) origin; the patterns observed in the autoradiograms were expected to be a mixture of both populations. In Fig. 3 A, corresponding to pHH2.0 digested with KpnI (see Figs. 1 and 2), thelower diagonal arc corresponded to linear forms (6Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 7Martı́n-Parras L. Hernández P. Martı́nez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 220: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The prominent spot at the far right end of the linear forms corresponded to the unreplicated linear form of the plasmid (1.0×). The other spot on the linear forms, to the left, corresponded to partial digestion of dimeric forms (2.0×). The prominent spot above the 1.0× linear form to the right was probably due to OC forms. The continuous signal extending upward from the 1.0× linear form to the upper part of the autoradiogram corresponded to a bubble arc. A discrete spot was observed on top of the bubble arc to the left of the OC forms. This spot was due to accumulated bubbles (5Viguera E. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Boistov A.S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22414-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A small arc formed by a series of spots with decreasing intensity was observed between the accumulated bubbles and the OC forms. This series of spots corresponded to knotted bubbles (5Viguera E. Hernandez P. Krimer D.B. Boistov A.S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22414-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another faint and continuous arc occurred just underneath the bubble arc (only visible in very long exposed autoradiograms). This faint arc corresponded to simple-Ys and was probably due to the RIs of multimeric forms of the plasmid (6Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 7Martı́n-Parras L. Hernández P. Martı́nez-Robles M.L. Schvartzman J.B. J. Biol.

Two discrete spots were clearly visible on the faint simple-Y arc. The relative mass of the molecules responsible for the smaller of these spots was slightly bigger than 1.5× as it occurred just to the left of the inflection point of the simple-Y arc. The other spot was due to molecules with a relative mass between 1.5 and 2.0×. A double-Y signal emerged from each one of these spots and extended upward and tilted to the left toward the signal corresponding to X-shaped recombinants. The intensity of both signals was very similar, and they became progressively stronger as they got closer to the X-shaped recombinants. Fig. 3 B shows the autoradiogram corresponding to pHT2.0 digested with KpnI. In this plasmid, both origins were co-oriented. The patterns observed were completely different from those corresponding to pHH2.0 digested with the same restriction enzyme (Fig.3 A). No signal indicative for accumulated bubbles or knotted bubbles were detected. Altogether, these results demonstrated that two-dimensional gels can be effectively used to monitor the efficiency of each origin to initiate replication by estimating the relative intensity of the double-Y signals corresponding to each origin. They also showed that initiation occurred at only one origin per replication round. The detection of accumulated bubbles and knotted bubbles in all the plasmids of the pHH series demonstrated that the peculiar replication behavior originally described for pPI21 was not specific for S. pyogenspSM19035-derived plasmids but a general feature for all plasmids containing two inversely oriented ColE1 origins. Finally, the differences observed between the pHH and pHT series demonstrated that stalling of the replication fork at the other silent origin was polar since it only happened if both origins were in opposite orientations. Fig. 3 C shows the autoradiogram corresponding to pHH0.5 digested with ScaI. The accumulated bubbles and two different termination signals were clearly distinguished. In this case the accumulated bubble had a relative mass of 1.15×. For this reason and due to its proximity to the prominent spot generated by OC forms, knotted bubbles were not clearly identified in the autoradiogram. In this particular plasmid, the termination signal for oriα started on the simple-Y arc with a relative mass of 1.53×, whereas the termination signal for oriβ started with a relative mass of 1.61×. Despite their proximity, both signals were clearly distinguished. Fig. 3 D shows the autoradiogram corresponding to pHH5.8 DNA digested with AlwNI. In this particular case, the accumulated bubbles had a relative mass of 1.89×. The prominent spot generated by these accumulated bubbles and the small arc formed by a series of spots with decreasing intensity, corresponding to knotted bubbles, were clearly identified. Since the fragment analyzed was palindromic (see Fig. 1), the termination signals corresponding to initiation of DNA replication at oriα and oriβ co-migrated in this autoradiogram. Detection of the signals corresponding to accumulated bubbles and knotted bubbles in all three plasmids containing inversely oriented origins indicated that the distance between them (up to 5.8 kb) affected neither their capacity to interfere with each other nor their ability to act as a replication pausing site. Fig. 4highlights some structural elements and the most important events going on at ColE1 origins as initiation of DNA replication progresses (15Marians K.J. Annu. Rev.

The ColE1 replication origin of the pUC vectors, oriα in our pHH and pHT series, has the lacZ gene with the polylinker inserted between pasH and pasL; the minimal origin we used as oriβ lacked both pasH as well as pasL. Nevertheless, both origins initiated replication quite efficiently (see Fig. 3). We ignored, however, whether or not these partially modified origins were as competent as abona fideorigin to initiate replication. To find out more about the role of the pas sites and the promoters for RNAI and II in the competence of ColE1 origins to initiate replication and to act as a pausing site, we constructed three new plasmids: pHH/BR-BR2.9, pHH/BR-Δpass2.9, and pHH/BR-ΔRNAs2.9. HH refers to the head-to-head configuration of the origins. The following first BR indicates that Oriα is a complete origin. Next, the nature of Oriβ is indicated; it could be either BR (a complete origin), Δpass (where pasL and pasH were deleted), or ΔRNAs (where the promoters for RNAI and RNAII were deleted). Finally, 2.9 indicates that both origins are 2.9 kb apart. To build up the first of these plasmids, the 1,166-bpDraI/PvuII fragment of pBR322, containing both promoters as well as both pas sites (see Fig. 4), was inserted into theEcoRV restriction site of this same vector. In this way we obtained a plasmid containing two complete ColE1 origins in opposite orientations. pHH/BR-Δpass2.9 was constructed by inserting the 759-bpDraI/AflIII fragment from pBR322 into theEcoRV site of this same vector. In this way we obtained a plasmid containing one complete origin and another origin lacking the pas sites, in opposite orientations (see Figs. 4 and5). Finally, the 823-bpAlwNI/PvuII fragment of pBR322 was inserted into the EcoRV site of this same vector to obtain pHH/BR-ΔRNAs2.9. The latter plasmid contained one complete origin and another origin lacking the promoters for RNAI and RNAII, in opposite orientations (see Figs. 4 and 5). In all these three plasmids, the distance between origins was approximately 2.9 kb. Fig. 5 shows the restriction maps corresponding to these plasmids. Plasmid DNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells that had been transfected with each of these three new plasmids. The DNAs were digested with HindIII and independently analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig.6 shows the autoradiograms corresponding to pHH/BR-BR2.9, pHH/BR-Δpass2.9, and pHH/BR-ΔRNAs2.9. They were all hybridized with pBR322 DNA used as a probe. In Fig. 6 A, corresponding to pHH/BR-BR2.9 digested withHindIII (see Fig. 5), the lower diagonal arc corresponded to linear forms. The prominent spot at the far rightend of the linear forms corresponded to the unreplicated linear form of the plasmid (1.0×). The continuous signal extending upward from the 1.0× linear form to the upper part of the autoradiogram corresponded to a bubble arc. A distinct spot, due to accumulated bubbles (5Viguera E."
https://openalex.org/W1976662287,"We have studied the relationship between the length of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and its intracellular translocation and stability using McArdle RH7777 (McA-RH7777) cells expressing recombinant human apoB variants, ranging in size from B15 to B100. The translocational status of apoB was assessed based on trypsin sensitivity of apoB using isolated microsomes as well as permeabilized cells. In isolated microsomes, shorter apoB variants (≤B48) were 75–100% resistant to exogenous trypsin digestion, whereas apoB variants larger than B48 were less than 40% trypsin-resistant. Experiments with hepatic microsomes isolated from rat or transgenic mice expressing human B48 and B100 also confirmed the high trypsin accessibility of B100 compared with B48. In permeabilized cells, apoB variants shorter than B48 were relatively resistant to exogenous trypsin (percentage of trypsin-resistant apoB greater than 70%) in contrast to recombinant human B72 and B100, which were only 55 and 42% trypsin-resistant, respectively. The trypsin sensitivity of human B100 was comparable with that of endogenous rat B100 in McA-RH7777 cells as well as endogenous B100 in HepG2 cells (percentages of trypsin-resistant cells were as follows: for human B100 construct, 42 ± 7.5%; for endogenous McA-RH7777 B100, 52 ± 2.9%; and for endogenous HepG2 B100, 46 ± 6.3%). Overall, an inverse correlation between the length of apoB and its resistance to exogenous trypsin was evident irrespective of the model system examined.An inverse relationship was also observed between the size of apoB and its co-translational resistance to proteasomal degradation. Truncated apoB constructs were relatively insensitive to proteasome inhibition by MG132 co-translationally (during the pulse) compared with the full-length B100, which was highly sensitive (apoB recovered in the presence of MG132 as a percentage of control was as follows: B15, 127%; B29, 94%; B48, 110%; B72, 140%; B100, 282%). Post-translationally (over a 2-h chase), a similar inverse relationship was found, with B100 being the least stable in comparison with truncated apoB variants. In summary, as the size of the nascent apoB chain increases, there appears to be a greater cytosolic exposure of the polypeptide, leading to a higher sensitivity to proteasomal degradation. We have studied the relationship between the length of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and its intracellular translocation and stability using McArdle RH7777 (McA-RH7777) cells expressing recombinant human apoB variants, ranging in size from B15 to B100. The translocational status of apoB was assessed based on trypsin sensitivity of apoB using isolated microsomes as well as permeabilized cells. In isolated microsomes, shorter apoB variants (≤B48) were 75–100% resistant to exogenous trypsin digestion, whereas apoB variants larger than B48 were less than 40% trypsin-resistant. Experiments with hepatic microsomes isolated from rat or transgenic mice expressing human B48 and B100 also confirmed the high trypsin accessibility of B100 compared with B48. In permeabilized cells, apoB variants shorter than B48 were relatively resistant to exogenous trypsin (percentage of trypsin-resistant apoB greater than 70%) in contrast to recombinant human B72 and B100, which were only 55 and 42% trypsin-resistant, respectively. The trypsin sensitivity of human B100 was comparable with that of endogenous rat B100 in McA-RH7777 cells as well as endogenous B100 in HepG2 cells (percentages of trypsin-resistant cells were as follows: for human B100 construct, 42 ± 7.5%; for endogenous McA-RH7777 B100, 52 ± 2.9%; and for endogenous HepG2 B100, 46 ± 6.3%). Overall, an inverse correlation between the length of apoB and its resistance to exogenous trypsin was evident irrespective of the model system examined. An inverse relationship was also observed between the size of apoB and its co-translational resistance to proteasomal degradation.

In summary, as the size of the nascent apoB chain increases, there appears to be a greater cytosolic exposure of the polypeptide, leading to a higher sensitivity to proteasomal degradation.

The unusual length of apoB100, as well as its composition, is believed to be responsible for its ability to recruit lipids in the assembly of lipoprotein particles (2Yao Z.M. Blackhart B.D.

In addition, the length of apoB appears to play a role in the metabolic fate of apoB-containing lipoproteins and may influence the intracellular biosynthesis and extracellular secretion (4Anderson K.M.

ApoB translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered to be an important step in the secretion of lipoprotein particles (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E.

Translocation of apoB appears to be dependent upon both lipid availability and the conformation of the nascent polypeptide (13Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two functionally distinct pools may form during translocation of apoB (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One pool is composed of intraluminal, trypsin-insensitive apoB that is assembled into lipoprotein particles, whereas the second pool is trypsin-accessible and appears to be associated with the ER membrane (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Davis et al. (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol.

It is important to note, however, that apoB translocation and its role in lipoprotein assembly and secretion remain controversial. While some laboratories have shown that apoB translocation is relatively efficient (14Pease R.J. Leiper J.M. Harrison G.B. Scott J. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2202-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that as much as 80% of apoB100 in HepG2 cells is resistant to trypsin digestion, while other groups (28Chuck S.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have found that endogenous rat apoB100 was 10–26% trypsin-resistant, whereas the endogenous rat apoB48 was 100% trypsin-resistant. In rat hepatocytes, endogenous apoB48 was reported to show 78% resistance to exogenous trypsin by Rusinol et al. (30Rusinol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 30% resistance by Davis et al. (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus clear that considerable controversy exists in the literature on the translocational behavior of apoB variants of different size.The intracellular stability of apoB both at the co-translational and post-translational levels has also been under intense investigation. Evidence to date supports the notion of a two-step degradation process involving co-translational degradation of nascent apoB chains and post-translational degradation of fully translated apoB. A number of recent studies have confirmed that nascent apoB molecules undergo rapid co-translational degradation mediated by the cytosolic proteasome (31Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X.

Nascent apoB chains appear to become ubiquitinated and degraded during the translational process (31Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that ubiquitinated apoB is also associated with the Sec61 complex of the translocon and that alteration in the translocation of apoB appears to induce this association (34Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this pool of ubiquitinated apoB has also been shown to be destined for proteasomal degradation (34Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to co-translational degradation, there is also evidence for post-translational degradation of apoB, which may occur in the lumen of the ER (27Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that in HepG2 cells, the post-translational degradation of apoB100 may occur in at least two distinct steps (35Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The first step is an ALLN-sensitive process that degrades translocation-arrested apoB molecules in the ER membrane, while the second step is a dithiothreitol-sensitive pathway that occurs in the ER lumen (35Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently identified an ER-60 protease homologue in HepG2 cells that is associated with apoB (40Adeli K. Macri J. Mohammadi A. Kito M. Urade R. Cavallo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22489-22494Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and may be involved in post-translational degradation of apoB (40Adeli K. Macri J. Mohammadi A. Kito M. Urade R. Cavallo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22489-22494Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, Chen et al. (34Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have speculated that retrograde translocation of apoB from the lumen of the ER to the cytosol may also be a mechanism of apoB degradation. There is thus evidence for both co-translational and post-translational mechanisms that may be involved in intracellular degradation of newly synthesized apoB molecules. The cytosolic proteasome appears to be involved in co-translational degradation of nascent apoB as well as possibly post-translational degradation via a retrograde translocation mechanism.In the present study, we attempted to further elucidate the translocational behavior of apoB and its intracellular stability by directly analyzing the expression of apoB in a number of different model systems. We analyzed endogenously expressed B100 and B48 in rat hepatocytes, transgenic mice and HepG2 cells, as well as McA-RH7777 cells transfected with human apoB cDNA of various lengths ranging from 15 to 100% of full-length apoB100 (hB15–hB100). Overall, studies in a number of model systems using both isolated microsomes and permeabilized cells indicate a clear correlation between the apoB size and its sensitivity to exogenous trypsin. The length of nascent apoB was also found to strongly influence its intracellular stability and its sensitivity to proteasomal degradation.DISCUSSIONWe performed a series of protease protection experiments to explore a correlation between the size of the apoB polypeptide and its sensitivity to exogenous trypsin using isolated microsomes and the permeabilized cell system (13Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The most beneficial advantage of using a permeabilized cell system is that permeabilization allows the organelles (ER and Golgi) to maintain both their morphology and integrity while permitting exposure to exogenous trypsin (48Plutner H.P. Davidson J.S. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have shown that control proteins such as α1-antitrypsin, transferrin, and albumin, secretory proteins found within the lumen of the ER, are completely resistant to trypsin digestion using this permeabilized cell system (13Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on protease protection experiments in permeabilized cells, the truncated apoB constructs examined, including hB15 and hB29, were found to be relatively insensitive to exogenous trypsin, suggesting minimal exposure to the cytosol. However, a significant increase in trypsin sensitivity was observed for hB72 and the full-length endogenous apoB100. A similar relationship was observed when investigating the trypsin sensitivity of the total steady state mass of apoB. The intracellular mass of the hB100 construct exhibited the greatest sensitivity to trypsin digestion, compared with the mass of shorter apoB variants, which generally showed a significantly lower trypsin sensitivity. Therefore, results observed in the protease protection assays using a permeabilized cell system appeared to be comparable with the data obtained from experiments in isolated microsomes. As a whole, the data from protease protection assays in different model systems appear to suggest that sequences within the extreme C-terminal domain of the full-length apoB (the region absent in truncated apoB variants) may be responsible for the increase in trypsin sensitivity of apoB100, which may reflect increased membrane association and higher cytosolic exposure.ApoB100 contains two amphipathic β-strand domains, β1 and β2, located within the 18–43% and 58–85% regions of apoB, respectively (1Sergest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is believed that these β-strand domains are responsible for the association of the apoB polypeptide with the ER membrane, thus slowing or stopping its translocation (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminally truncated apoB constructs used in the present study lacked either part or all of the β1 and/or β2 domain. The deletion of part or all of the β domains may be the underlying factor for the differences observed in the trypsin sensitivities of various apoB constructs. Based on the data from protease protection studies in permeabilized cells, the constructs that did not contain the β2 domain (hB15, hB29, and hB48) had the highest resistance to exogenous trypsin, whereas those containing part or all of the β2 domain (B72 and B100) were more sensitive to trypsin digestion. Moreover, the increase in trypsin sensitivity of these larger sized apoB proteins may be a result of inefficient translocation of these polypeptides across the ER membrane, thus resulting in increased accessibility to exogenous trypsin. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which specificcis-elements such as C-terminal β-strand domains may modulate apoB translocational status as well as its susceptibility to the proteasome.Truncated apoB constructs expressed in various cell lines have been used in several studies examining the apoB translocation process (12Thrift R.N.

The translocational efficiency of some of these short apoB constructs has also been assessed using protease protection assays. Rusinol and Vance (43Rusinol A.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Shelness and co-workers (16Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that apoB50 expressed in COS-1 cells (not expressing MTP activity) was efficiently translocated across the ER membrane and was minimally sensitive to exogenous trypsin. It is apparent that considerable variation exists in the assessment of translocational efficiencies of both endogenous apoB as well as truncated apoB variants. At least some of this variability may be due to differences in experimental conditions used in the isolation of microsomes and the protease protection assays. In the present study, we have attempted to circumvent some of these variables by using a permeabilized cell system, which did show differences in the percentage of trypsin sensitivity of apoB in comparison with the percentages obtained from isolated microsomes. However, the correlation between the apoB size and its trypsin sensitivity was observed in both experimental systems.An attempt was also made to provide a correlation between apoB size and its intracellular stability at both the co-translational and post-translational levels. MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, was used in assessing the intracellular stability of both endogenous and exogenous apoB variants. Our data indicated that co-translationally there was a slight increase in the intracellular stability of most truncated apoB variants (hB15, hB72, and rB48) in the presence of MG132. However, in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor, there was almost a 3-fold increase in the amount of endogenous rat apoB100 recovered co-translationally. Thus, the data revealed a substantial difference between truncated apoB variants and the full-length apoB100 with respect to their co-translational stability. It also suggests that truncated apoB variants are much less accessible to proteasomal degradation, most likely as a result of more efficient translocation.It is believed that incomplete translocation may result in the formation of a pool of apoB that becomes associated with the membrane and that a percentage of this pool of protein is exposed to the cytosolic face of the ER (10Davis R.A.

Based on our current observations, we hypothesize that the β2 domain in the C-terminal region of the polypeptide may be responsible for incomplete translocation and thus co-translational instability of full-length apoB. In addition, the fact that MG132 blocks the degradation of both exogenous and endogenous apoB100 also supports the notion that incomplete translocation leads to cytosolic degradation of apoB by the proteasome at the co-translational level. In addition, Benoist and Grand-Perret (32Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown that MTP activity prevents the proteasome mediated co-translational degradation of apoB100, particularly at the carboxyl-terminal sequences downstream of apoB65. They hypothesize that as the apoB polypeptide increases in size, there is a greater accumulation of lipophilic β-sheets in the protein (1Sergest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2044510331,"The major enzymes involved in the degradation of heme were identified in human platelets. It was determined that heme oxygenase activity levels in umbilical cord blood platelets were higher, whereas biliverdin reductase activity levels were comparable with that found in platelets from adults. In membranes prepared from adenosine diphosphate-activated platelets, UDP-glucuronic acid-dependent bilirubin conjugation was detected, whereas activity was negligible in unactivated platelets and undetected in serum and heat-inactivated platelets, and in platelets prepared from umbilical cord blood. Platelet fractions were analyzed by Western blot and shown to express heme oxygenase, biliverdin reductase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and there was concordance with known developmental profiles found in other tissues. Heme oxygenase expression was higher, whereas UGT expression was lower, in neonatal compared with adult platelets. These data suggest that platelets are involved in multiple steps of heme and bilirubin metabolism and that developmental regulation of these enzymes may be similar to that in other human tissues.

Heme oxygenase (HO), 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; BVR, biliverdin reductase; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. biliverdin reductase (BVR), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) form the major erythrocytic heme catabolic pathway in humans and most mammalian species (1Bissell D. Hammaker L. Schmid R. Blood. 1972; 40: 812-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Landaw S. Callahan E.J. Schmid R. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 914-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When senescent red blood cells migrate to the spleen, the globin portion of the hemoglobin molecule is removed and recycled to component amino acids. The heme moiety is metabolized by the sequential action of HO to form the linear tetrapyrrol biliverdin and BVR to form bilirubin. Bilirubin is transported to the liver, where specific UGTs catalyze conjugation with glucuronic acid. Bilirubin glucuronides are then secreted into the bile and ultimately excreted via the intestines (3Brown S.B. Troxler R.F. Heirwegh K.P.N. Brown S.B. Bilirubin: Metabolism. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1982: 1-38Google Scholar). The inducible form of heme oxygenase, HO-1, is expressed in many tissues including the liver, where it is reportedly higher in human neonates than in adults (4Rodgers P. Stevenson D. Clin. Perinat. 1990; 17: 275-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the brain and testes, total HO activity in the liver declines with maturation (5Maines M. Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). During the first week of life when fetal hemoglobin is degraded, there is an increase in HO activity attributed to increased expression of HO-1. Subsequently, there is a rapid decline in HO-1 expression while the expression of HO-2 gradually increases with maturity until, under normal conditions, HO-2 is the predominant form expressed in the liver (6Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Although heme degradation occurs primarily in the spleen and liver, heme-metabolizing enzymes are expressed in many tissues, suggesting role(s) that are distinct from red blood cell turnover. Heme metabolism is particularly important in response to cell injury, where it may play a role in cell-cell communication and antioxidant defense (7Williams M.

Carbon monoxide, which is produced as a consequence of heme oxidation, has been proposed to function as an intracellular messenger partially regulating cGMP levels (11Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of heme oxygenase are known to exist. HO-1 was first identified as a 32-kDa heat shock protein and is inducible by hyperthermic, oxidative, and other stresses and is widely distributed throughout the body, including the liver and spleen (12Fukuda K. Richmon J.D. Sato M. Sharp F.R. Panter S.S. Noble L.J. Brain Res. 1996; 736: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Choi A.M. Sylvester S. Otterbein L. Holbrook N.J. Am. J. Res.

Lett. 1995; 199: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HO-2 is the major glucocorticoid-regulated constitutive form present predominantly in adult liver connective and nervous tissue and has a molecular mass of approximately 39 kDa (6Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 20Raju V.S. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The recently identified HO-3 has a molecular mass of approximately 33 kDa and is closely related to HO-2 but is the product of a different gene. HO-3 is found in many tissues, including the liver, is reportedly immunochemically distinct from the other isoforms, and is not as efficient a heme metabolizer (22McCoubrey W. Huang T. Maines M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The cytosolic enzyme BVR catalyzes the final step in heme metabolism in mammals and some fish species by the conversion of biliverdin IXα to bilirubin IXα. The human enzyme has been purified and found to resolve into four isoelectric zones and two molecular mass forms (40.7 and 39.6 kDa) in the liver, whereas variants were detected in the kidney. Although the primary sequence of the human enzyme differs extensively from the rat enzyme, they share the unique property of having two distinct pH optima and requiring different cofactors for each pH value: NADH at low pH and NADPH at alkaline pH (23Maines M. Trakshel G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The capacity for heme metabolism is developmentally regulated. HO-1 is preferentially expressed in the liver rather than the spleen during late gestation but during the early neonatal period hepatic expression is diminished concurrently with the development of activity in the spleen (6Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 24Lin J.H. Villalon P. Nelson J.C. Abraham N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conversely, UGT activity toward bilirubin (and UGT1A1 expression) is absent from fetal liver but develops in the early neonatal period (25Wishart G.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Coughtrie M.W. Burchell B. Leakey J.E. Hume R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 729-735PubMed Google Scholar). These developmental changes have physiological and pathological consequences. For example, the developmental deficiency in hepatic bilirubin-UGT is a contributing factor in the high incidence of jaundice in human newborns (27Tiribelli C. Ostrow J.D. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1296-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UDP-glucuronosyltransferases also exist as multiple isoforms. UGT1A1 is the primary isoform responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin, although UGTs exhibit broad overlapping substrate specificity, and other isoforms, such as UGT1A4, are capable of catalyzing this reaction (28Ritter J.K. Crawford J.M. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1043-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggested to us that human platelets also have the capacity to metabolize heme and its degradation products (29Nowell S. Lang N. Leakey J. Frame L. 8th North American ISSX Meeting, Hilton Head, South Carolina, October, 1997. International Society for the study of Xenobiotics, Hilton Head, SC1997: 92Google Scholar). This report indicates that heme metabolizing enzymes are expressed in human platelets so that the potential exists for heme to be metabolized completely to bilirubin-glucuronide in situ. The platelet enzymes also appear to reflect the developmental regulation of expression reported for the hepatic forms. Histopaque 1077 and 1119, platelet aggregation kits, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid, hemin, biliverdin, direct bilirubin assay kits, bilirubin Lin-TROL, and bilirubin standards (total and direct) were from Sigma. Bilirubin was from Acros Organics (Pittsburgh, PA). [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Polyclonal antibodies to rat heme oxygenase-1, heme oxygenase-2, and biliverdin reductase were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Anti-UGT C-terminal peptide antibody was provided by Chris Patton (Gentest Corporation, Woburn, MA). Recombinant UGTs and adult human liver microsomes were also purchased from Gentest Corporation. Additional human liver microsomal and cytosol fractions that were used as positive controls were frozen samples stored at −80 °C. The neonatal human liver sample was a 2-day-old term infant who died of sudden infant death syndrome and was originally obtained with appropriate Institutional Review Board approval from Dr. Linda Perrot (Department of Pathology, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR). The rat liver S9 preparation was a 9,000 × g supernatant from an adult male Sprague-Dawley rat. Blood samples were obtained according to an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol (NCI-2888). Electrophoresis and Western blot reagents were from Novex (San Diego, CA). Detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the ECL chemiluminescense method from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In some instances, alkaline phosphatase visualization was used. Quantitation of immunoreactive bands was performed on a model 300A Computing Densitometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Blood samples from healthy adult volunteers (32 ml) and human neonates (8–16 ml, from umbilical cord) were collected in “yellow-top” ACD tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and stored at room temperature until processed (<12 h). Individual blood cell components were then isolated by centrifugation on discontinuous gradients of Histopaque-1077 and Histopaque 1119, using a modification of the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma procedure number 1119). Briefly, whole blood was layered on top of gradients and centrifuged at 700 ×g for 30 min (room temperature); lymphocytes and platelets comigrated as a distinct band in the top third of the tube of each gradient. These fractions were collected and diluted 3-fold with phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% ACD solution and centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min) to achieve an initial separation. Lymphocytes appeared in the pellet along with contaminating platelets, whereas the supernatant contained mostly platelets. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15% ACD/phosphate-buffered saline buffer and centrifuged at 150 × g (10 min) twice, and both “washes” were added to the original platelet pool. The diluted cell suspension was then centrifuged (500 × g, 20 min) to obtain a platelet pellet that was resuspended in a small volume of 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. To ensure the reflected platelet activities of the assays and not the contribution of contaminating cell types, an aliquot was analyzed for confirmation of platelet purity, using a model STKS Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Irving, TX). Isolated platelets routinely showed negligible contamination with other cell types (<0.08% white blood cells and <0.02% red blood cells). HO assays were performed on platelet membrane fractions that were prepared by disruption of the membranes by three 5-s bursts using a Sonifier Cell Disrupter (Ultrasonics Inc, Plain View, NY; setting 1), on ice. Platelet cytosol for the BVR assays was prepared by sonication followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. For activation of the platelets for UGT assays, washed platelets (approximately 109 cells/ml) were incubated with 20 μm ADP and 50 μm CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the platelets were placed on ice until they could be assayed for bilirubin glucuronidation activity. Heme oxygenase activity was determined by the method of Tenhunen et al. (30Tenhunen R. Marver H. Schmid R. Biochemistry. 1968; 61: 748-755Google Scholar) with the modifications of the assay detailed by Lincoln et al. (31Lincoln B. Mayer A. Bonkovsky H. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bilirubin production was measured by a difference spectrum between the reaction mixture and a blank that did not contain an NADPH-regenerating system. Each incubation contained 5 mm deferoxamine, 25 μm hemin, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and either 0.05 mg of rat liver S9 or 0.1 mg of platelet homogenate in a volume of 0.1 ml. The samples were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of an NADPH-regenerating system and then incubated for an additional 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of ethanol-Me2SO (95:5, v/v), and the samples were chilled on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were pipetted into a 96-well microtiter plate, and their absorbance at 450 nm was recorded. Activities were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 40 mm−1 cm−1 for bilirubin formation. To confirm that the increased absorbance was in fact due to the formation of bilirubin, samples were analyzed colorimetrically using a Sigma Diagnostic kit. Biliverdin reductase activity was assayed by the method of Tenhunen et al. (32Tenhunen R. Ross M.E. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 5 μm biliverdin dissolved in MeOH and enzyme. The reaction was started with the addition of an NADPH-regenerating system, and bilirubin formation was calculated as described previously (23Maines M. Trakshel G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcUA-dependent UGT activity toward bilirubin was determined colorimetrically by a modification of Walters and Gerarde (33Walters M.I. Gerarde H.W. Microchem. J. 1970; 15: 231Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) as developed by Sigma Diagnostics (procedure number 550/551). Briefly, bilirubin solution was prepared according to Van Roy et al. (34Van Roy F. Meuwissen J. De Meuter F. Heirwegh K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 31: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activated platelets (100 μl; approximately 0.1 mg of protein) were incubated with 100 μl of the bilirubin solution in the presence or absence of 2 mm UDP-GlcUA at 37 °C for 1 h. The formation of bilirubin glucuronides was detected colorimetrically and quantified by comparison with bilirubin glucuronide standards. Confirmation of the product as a bilirubin glucuronide was performed by HPLC according to the method of Coughtrieet al. (35Coughtrie M. Burchell B. Bend J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet microsomes (approximately 100 μg of protein) incubated for 1 h in 15 μl of incubation mixture containing 30 nmol of 14C-labeled UDPGlcUA, 6 nmol of bilirubin, 6 nmol of saccharo-1,4-lactone, and 1 μg of alamethicin in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 60 μl of acetonitrile followed by 30 μl of water. The resulting mixture was sonicated for 10 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. 80 μl of the supernatant was placed in an autoinjector vial for HPLC analysis. HPLC was performed on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Whatman PAC column. Solvent A consisted of 100% acetonitrile, whereas solvent B was 10 mm tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate in water. Products were eluted using a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and a gradient of 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B from 0 to 20 min. Detection of products was performed using a Packard Radiomatic 525 inline radioactivity detector (Packard Instrument Co., Meridian, CT) and a Waters 490 detector. Membrane fractions and cytosol were prepared by subjecting the platelets to three 10-s bursts on a Sonifier Cell Disrupter (Ultrasonics Inc, PlainView, NY; setting 1) on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Platelet membranes were resuspended in sucrose buffer, and protein amounts for both membranes and cytosol were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein determinations were performed on microscale using a Molecular Devices model 250 UV/VIS platereader. Bovine serum albumin was used for protein standards. Platelet proteins (10 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Novex 4–12% NuPAGE gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by the method of Towbin et al. (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natnl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar). Blotted proteins were exposed to the appropriate antibody and visualized by alkaline phosphatase or by chemiluminescense using Amersham reagents. Table I shows a comparison of HO activities derived from human platelet homogenate from both neonates and adults. Platelet HO activity in neonates was significantly greater than adult value by Student's t test (p < 0.02), although both activities were lower than the rat liver S9 fraction used as a positive control. As shown in Fig.1, a very similar developmental pattern was found in immunoreactive protein from platelets. Fig. 1 Acompares the expression of proteins reacting with a polyclonal antibody to rat HO-1 in human liver (lane 1), to platelet membranes from an adult human (lane 2), and to platelet membranes from newborn umbilical cord blood (lane 3). The level of expression of platelet-derived immunoreactive protein was comparable with or greater than the liver-derived form, although the molecular mass was slightly higher. Platelets from a human neonate expressed levels of immunoreactive protein that were four times higher than those of adults, as determined by densitometry. By contrast, the constitutive form, HO-2, was expressed at slightly higher levels in platelets from adults compared with newborns (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2and 3). Although expression was highest in the liver (Fig.1 B, lane 1), the developmental pattern of HO-2 expression in platelets was similar to that previously reported for the hepatic form.Table IEnzymatic activities of heme oxygenase, biliverdin reductase, and bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in liver and in platelets from human adults and umbilical cord bloodEnzyme sourceHeme oxygenase activityBiliverdin reductase activityBilirubin UGT activitypmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgpmol/min/mgRat liver S9 fraction1340.4 ± 102.1Adult platelets207.4 ± 32.4 (n = 8)0.98 ± 0.45 (n = 4)Neonatal platelets539.9 ± 115.5 (n = 8)aSignificantly greater than adult value by Student'st test (p < 0.02).NDbND, activity not detected.Adult human liver microsomes585cValues are for the individual samples used for the Western blot.Neonatal human liver microsomes84cValues are for the individual samples used for the Western blot.Lymphoblastoid-expressed UGT1A1176ADP-activated adult platelets34.5 ± 5.9 (n = 8)dSignificantly greater than unactivated value by Student'st test (p < 0.01).ADP-activated neonatal plateletsNDbND, activity not detected.SerumNDbND, activity not detected.Human liver cytosol20.0 ± 0.68Adult platelet cytosol28.6 ± 3.5 (n = 8)Neonatal platelet cytosol32.0 ± 4.9 (n = 8)Values are expressed as the means ± S.E.a Significantly greater than adult value by Student'st test (p < 0.02).b ND, activity not detected.c Values are for the individual samples used for the Western blot.d Significantly greater than unactivated value by Student'st test (p < 0.01).

As shown in TableI, the activity from adult human platelets was comparable with the activity found in human liver cytosol. BVR activity in umbilical cord blood platelets was slightly higher than either of the adult preparations. Fig. 2 compares the expression of BVR in human liver cytosol (lane 1), in adult platelet cytosol (lane 2), and in platelet cytosol from human neonates (lane 3). Immunoactive forms were present at approximately 40 kDa in both liver and platelet cytosols. Platelets were also assayed for UGT activity toward bilirubin. In preliminary studies, washed platelets were shown to have negligible glucuronidation capacity, regardless of whether the platelets were intact or sonicated. Incubation with detergents (CHAPS, Brij 58, and Triton-100) or with the channel-forming peptide alamethicin also failed to activate platelet glucuronidation capacity. However, when a series of platelet activators/aggregators (i.e. collagen, thrombin, ephinephrine, and ADP) were examined for their ability to stimulate the glucuronidation of bilirubin, ADP was found to be an effective activator. When platelets from adult volunteers were exposed to 20 μm ADP, UDP-GlcUA-dependent conjugation of bilirubin was significantly higher by Student's t test (p < 0.01) than in unactivated platelets (Table I). By contrast, activity was not detected in either unactivated or ADP-activated platelets from neonates or in adult or neonatal serum. Additional analysis of bilirubin glucuronide formation using [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid and HPLC separation of products confirmed these findings (Fig. 3). Fig.3 A is a representative radioactive trace of an incubation with activated platelets, and Fig. 3 C is the corresponding UV profile. Fig. 3 B shows the radioactive trace of an incubation using unactivated platelets, whereas Fig. 3 D is the corresponding UV profile. The glucuronide peaks were dependent on the presence of both UDPGlcUA and bilirubin in the incubation mixture and could be converted to free bilirubin and glucuronic acid by β-glucuronidase, and their retention times corresponded to those produced by incubations of rat or human liver microsomes. As shown in Table I, bilirubin glucuronide formation is considerably higher in adult human liver microsomes than in either neonatal liver microsomes or in activated adult platelets. Glucuronide formation by neonatal platelets was not detected, either colorimetrically or by HPLC. Developmental regulation of UGT expression in platelets was demonstrated by Western blot using an anti-peptide antibody directed against an exon common to all members of the UGT1A family. A representative Western blot is shown in Fig.4. UGT-specific immunoreactivity (approximately 53–55 kDa) was demonstrated in adult and neonatal human liver, recombinant UGT1A1, UGT1A4, platelet membrane fractions from adult humans, and platelet membrane fractions from human neonatal umbilical cord blood. With this antibody preparation, the amount of immunoreactive UGT in platelets from neonates (Fig. 4, lane 6) was almost undetectable compared with that of platelets from adults (Fig. 4, lane 5). This pattern of development is similar to many liver-derived isoforms of UGT, including the bilirubin-specific form. The molecular mass of the UGT1A immunoreactive protein corresponds to that of the major UGT1A band in adult human liver but was of a lower apparent molecular mass than either recombinant UGT1A1 or UGT1A4. Heme-metabolizing enzymes are found primarily in the liver and spleen, but many cell-types express them. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this enzyme system in platelets, although macrophages have been shown to mediate the breakdown (and detoxification) of heme to bile acids at sites of injury (37Pimstone N.R. Tenhunen R.P.T. Marver S. Schmid R. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1264-1281Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mammalian systems are also known to possess pathways of heme degradation that are carried out by enzymes other than the heme oxygenase system. Heme can be degraded by xanthine oxidase, hydrogen peroxides, and NADH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, but in these cases the product is a mixture of pyrrolic compounds instead of biliverdin or CO (38Guengerich F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We initially found immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activities for BVR and for bilirubin UGT, which led to attempts to identify HO isoform(s) that might be present in platelets. The three isoforms of HO identified thus far are all different gene products and are thought to be immunochemically distinct, although they share the same substrate specificity, cofactor requirements, and mechanistic characteristics (22McCoubrey W. Huang T. Maines M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 39McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, the protein detected in platelets using an anti-rat polyclonal antibody to HO-1 exhibited a molecular mass comparable with that reported for the newly identified HO-3 rather than that of human HO-1. HO-3 was first isolated in rat brain but later was detected in a variety of tissues and organs, including the liver (22McCoubrey W. Huang T. Maines M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Although rat HO-3 was reported to be immunochemically distinct from rat HO-1 in the original studies, it is possible that the polyclonal HO-1 antibody that we used in the present study cross-reacted with human HO-3 or with a novel HO isoform. Alternatively, the differences in molecular mass between the immunoreactive proteins found in human liver and platelets could be a result of differential post-translational modifications. However, when platelet membranes were probed with a polyclonal antibody to rat HO-2, the immunoreactive protein was the same apparent size as that reported in the literature and that observed in our human liver sample. The liver sample used here expressed high levels of HO-2 immunoreactive protein. The enzymatic activity toward hemin found in the platelets, therefore, cannot be attributed to a specific isoform at this point. Regardless of the identity of the isoforms present in platelets, it is noteworthy that they exhibit the same pattern of developmental regulation observed for hepatic isoforms. Biliverdin is a biologically active compound that has been shown to inhibit viral replication in vitro (40Mori H. Otake T. Morimoto M. Ueba N. Kunita N. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). BVR is the enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of biliverdin to bilirubin and, along with heme oxygenase, is also found in a variety of tissues and organs. The presence of this enzyme in platelets provides the next step in the pathway of heme degradation. The presence of UGT activity toward bilirubin in activated platelets provides the final stage in heme degradation. The UGT1A immunoreactive protein observed in adult human platelets showed an apparent molecular mass that corresponded to a major UGT1A band in human liver but was smaller than either recombinant UGT1A1 or UGT1A4. This suggests that either platelet bilirubin UGT activity is catalyzed by a UGT1A isoform other than 1A1 or 1A4 or that the apparent molecular mass of recombinant UGT1A1 differs from that of the constitutively expressed isoform. However, platelet bilirubin UGT activity was dependent on activation of the platelets with ADP. A defined sequence of events occurs when platelets are exposed to ADP. Discoid-shaped resting platelets are changed rapidly to spherical shape. Change in the physical form of the platelet is followed by platelet aggregation and release of dense granule contents (41Mills D. Robb I. Roberts G. J. Physiol. 1968; 195: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Whether ADP itself or a substance released from platelet dense granules is responsible for activation of bilirubin UGT activity has not been established. This finding could indicate that platelet-specific heme metabolism, along with the subsequent detoxification of bilirubin via glucuronidation, plays a role in restoring homeostasis at sites of injury (thrombus formation). In normally circulating platelets the bilirubin would be expected to diffuse out of the platelets and be conjugated by hepatic UGTs. But within a blood clot or at the site of injury this route of bilirubin detoxification would not be available. Hence, it is advantageous for the activated platelets to conjugate bilirubinin situ. Recently, the presence of UGTs, along with other protein components of the glucose-6-phosphatase system, has been demonstrated in human embryonic and fetal red blood cells but not in adult red blood cells (42Hume R. Burchell A. Allan B. Wolf R. Hallas A. Burchell B. Blood. 1996; 87: 762-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The developmental regulation of this system differs from the hepatic UGTs, where neonatal expression is low (resulting in an initial deficiency in the ability to conjugate bilirubin), but increases with maturation. In addition to normal developmental changes, hereditary deficiencies in bilirubin UGT activity are known to exist. These deficiencies are responsible for Crigler-Najjar Type I and Type II syndromes as well as Gilbert's syndrome, a more common deficiency that affects more than 5% of the population (43Owens D. Evans J. J. Med. Genet. 1975; 12: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Impaired UGT activity can also result in enhanced drug toxicity (44de Morais S. Uetrecht J. Wells P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); therefore, the significance of interindividual variability in human UGTs needs to be elucidated, a process that has been hampered by the limited availability of tissue. Platelets are a readily accessible source of enzymes that, in some cases, have been shown to arise from the same genes as those found in other tissues (45Jones A. Hagen M. Coughtrie M. Roberts R. Glatt H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study, it was demonstrated that the developmental profiles and enzymatic activities of platelet heme oxygenase, biliverdin reductase, and UGT(s) seem to correlate with the activity found in the liver."

Chaperones are a functionally related group of proteins increasingly synthesized under heat shock conditions to prevent protein aggregation (1Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the most prominent chaperone is GroEL, a member of the Hsp60 family, and its co-chaperone GroES. This chaperone system has been studied extensively in the past (2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). GroE, which is essential for viability under all environmental conditions (3Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) is a double-ring complex consisting of 14 identical subunits with a molecular mass of 57.2 kDa each (4Hemmingsen S.M.

GroEL possesses a potassium-dependent ATPase, which is regulated by the co-chaperone GroES (5Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a heptameric, ring-shaped molecule of 10-kDa subunits (6Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilley K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo as in vitro, the GroE-chaperone system increases the yield of correctly folded polypeptides by a highly dynamic, ATP-dependent binding and release mechanism (7Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). GroEL binds unfolded or partially folded polypeptides via hydrophobic (9Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L.

Biol. 1996; 262: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) interactions, thus preventing aggregation of folding intermediates (12Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Under permissive folding conditions, the presence of ATP is sufficient for release and productive folding, whereas under nonpermissive conditions the co-chaperone GroES is essential for assisted folding (13Schmidt M. Bücheler U. Kaluza B. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not clear how GroE promotes the folding of polypeptides under conditions in which off-pathway reactions are preferred. During the chaperone cycle, GroE binds the nonnative proteins inside the central cavity of the GroEL·GroES complex, thus providing a folding environment in which no unspecific intermolecular interactions with other nonnative proteins occur (14Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar,15Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). During this so-called iterative annealing mechanism (16Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the proteins are ejected from GroE into the bulk solution after ∼15–30 s, because of the ATP binding and hydrolysis on the opposite ring of the GroEL molecule (17Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), independent of their folding state (17Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 18Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, the GroE system is able to unfold kinetically trapped or misfolded nonnative polypeptides, which gives them a new possibility to fold correctly (17Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19Burston S.G. Skeigh R. Halsall D.J. Smith C.J. Holbrook J.J. Clarke AR. Ann. NY Acad.

Because the experiments addressing the mechanism of GroE were mostly performed with “chemically” denatured proteins, little is known about the underlying mechanism of GroE under stress conditions (2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Under heat shock condition in vitro, GroEL has been shown to interact with several unfolding proteins. These tightly bound polypeptides are protected against irreversible aggregation (21Höll-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 58-64Google Scholar). Reactivation is possible by changing the folding environment to permissive conditions in the presence of GroES and ATP (21Höll-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 58-64Google Scholar, 22Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Martin J. Horwich A.L.

Although these studies demonstrate the basic properties of GroE under heat shock conditions, little is known about the interaction of GroE with thermally unfolding, structured proteins. Here we set out to investigate the influence of GroEL on the thermal unfolding pathway of a model substrate protein in detail. For these studies we choose citrate synthase (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CS, citrate synthase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ- imino)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: CS, citrate synthase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ- imino)triphosphate. as a substrate, because its thermal unfolding has been studied before (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar,26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and because CS was identified as an in vivo substrate of GroE in E. coli (27Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (23Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chemically denatured CS has been used previously to study GroE function (12Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial CS from pig heart is a dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of 49 kDa each. It catalyzes the first reaction in the citric acid cycle, the condensation of oxaloacetic acid and acetyl-CoA to citric acid. The highly α-helical protein is nuclear-encoded and posttranslationally imported into mitochondria. Its three-dimensional structure was solved with a resolution of 2.7 Å (28Remington S. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 111-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). At elevated temperatures, CS loses its activity very rapidly with a midpoint of transition at 48 °C (29Zhi W. Srere P.A. Evans C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9281-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The inactivation is accompanied by structural changes in the molecule. Addition of the substrates oxaloacetic acid and acetyl-CoA stabilize the enzyme (30Wieland O. Weiss L. Eger-Neufeld I. Biochem Z. 1964; 339: 501-513PubMed Google Scholar, 31Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2157-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), shifting the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition to 66.5 °C (29Zhi W. Srere P.A. Evans C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9281-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This stabilization is due to huge conformational changes induced by substrate binding (28Remington S. Wiegand G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 111-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 32Wiegand G. Remington S. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Karpusas M. Branchaud B. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2213-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). During thermal inactivation, CS unfolds via inactive, dimeric intermediates, which are in equilibrium with the native state (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further unfolding of these intermediates leads to irreversible reactions and subsequent aggregation. We show here that GroEL interacts with structured dimeric unfolding intermediates of CS. These intermediates dissociate into monomers, which are stably associated with GroEL and held in a reactivatable state at elevated temperatures. GroEL and GroES were purified from the E. coli strain JM 109 TZ 136, bearing the multicopy plasmid DHαpOF 39 as described previously (34Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The concentrations of both proteins were determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: E 276 nm0.1% = 0.142 for GroES (34Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G.H. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and E 280 nm0.1% = 0.173 for GroEL (calculated according to Ref. 36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient used for the calculation of the GroEL concentration was corrected for minor tryptophan impurities present in the solution of the purified protein as determined by a titration of the tryptophan fluorescence (37Pajot J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, the absorbance spectrum of GroEL was corrected for intrinsic light scattering of the solution due to the large particle size of GroEL. Concentrations of GroEL and GroES in the text refer to the 14 or 7 mer, respectively. Dimeric mitochondrial CS from porcine heart (EC 4.1.3.7), with a molecular mass of 49 kDa per subunit, was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. CS stock solutions were prepared as described by Buchner et al. (26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The concentration of CS was determined using an extinction coefficient of E 280 nm0.1% = 1.78 (26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CS (7.5 μm) was diluted 1:100 into 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 (25 °C), 10 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithioerythrol in the presence or absence of GroEL (0.15 μm or as indicated in the figure legends) at 25 °C. Inactivation was then initiated by a temperature shift to 43 °C. To determine the inactivation kinetics, aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points, and CS activity was measured according to the method of Srere et al. (31Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2157-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Acetyl-CoA was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; oxaloacetic acid and DTNB were from Sigma. Reactivation of CS was started by shifting the temperature to 25 °C and by addition of different components as indicated in the figure legends. The kinetics of reactivation were determined as described above. Rate constants for the unfolding and refolding kinetics of CS were obtained from nonlinear fits using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). Rate constants for association or bi-uni-molecular reactions were fitted or simulated with the corresponding models using Scientist (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). CS (0.075 μm) was inactivated at 43 °C in the presence or absence of GroEL (0.15 μm) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithioerythrol. At the time points indicated, aliquots were withdrawn and immediately injected onto a TSK 4000 PW gel filtration column (TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany). The runs were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Elution of the proteins was detected online with a Jasco FP-920 fluorescence detector. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was 326 nm; in both cases the slits were set to 10 nm. CS dimer peak areas and CS-GroEL peak areas were calculated from the data points with the Borwin software (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany). CS·GroEL complex peaks were corrected for fluorescence originating from GroEL. CS (50 nm) was denatured in the presence of GroEL (40 nm) at 43 °C for 80 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCL, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithioerythrol. After temperature shift to 40 °C, GroES (120 nm) and AMP-PNP (2 mm) were added. After a further 5 min at 43 °C the samples were applied to carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were recorded at 120 kV and a magnification of 45,000× with a Philips CM12 electron micrograph (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). Digitized images were aligned, averaged, and subjected to a classification procedure based on eigenvector-eigenvalue analysis (34Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P.

Mitochondrial CS is a dimer consisting of two identical 49-kDa subunits. We chose this substrate to investigate the influence of GroE on protein unfolding under heat shock conditions because its thermal unfolding has been used before to analyze the function of other chaperones (25Jakob U.

It was known that equimolar concentrations of the GroEL tetradecamer are sufficient to suppress the aggregation of chemically unfolded CS completely (12Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used here, thermally unfolding CS loses its activity, with an apparent first order reaction within 50 min. The presence of stoichiometric or higher concentrations of GroEL exhibited no influence on the decrease in activity (Fig.1 A and data not shown). To test whether GroE affects the refolding of thermally denatured CS, reactivation of CS unfolding intermediates were induced by shifting the temperature to 25 °C (26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, only a few percent of CS activity can be recovered after a 15-min incubation at 43 °C in the absence of GroEL. In contrast, after inactivation in the presence of GroEL, almost all of the inactive CS intermediates can be refolded. However, the co-chaperone GroES and ATP are required for efficient reactivation (Fig. 1 B). Thus, GroEL binds CS unfolding intermediates stably and keeps them in a reactivatable state. Next we addressed the question of which unfolding intermediates are bound to GroEL. Previous experiments had shown that inactivation involves the formation of at least two inactive unfolding intermediates, which are still dimeric (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Here we determined the overall amount of reactivatable intermediates by monitoring the enzymatic activity and the amount of dimeric CS molecules during heat inactivation by HPLC-size exclusion chromatography. Fig.2 A shows the time course of formation of reactivatable CS intermediates during inactivation at 43 °C. In the absence of GroEL, the amount of intermediates increases during the first minutes, reaching a maximum at ∼12 min. The subsequent decrease is due to the aggregation of CS after further inactivation. In the presence of GroEL, the amount of reactivatable intermediates increases over 30 min to ∼90%. HPLC-size exclusion chromatography analysis of thermally unfolding CS shows that the disappearance of the CS dimer peak is much slower than inactivation of CS (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in agreement with earlier suggestions (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) that inactivation clearly precedes dissociation. Comparing the inactivation and the HPLC data, the amount of inactive dimeric unfolding intermediates of CS can be calculated by subtracting the amount of active CS at the different time points from the overall amount of dimeric molecules. The time course of appearance and disappearance of these dimeric but inactive intermediates corresponded very well with the distribution of intermediates measured in the activity assay (Fig. 2, A and B), leading to the conclusion that during thermal inactivation all reactivatable CS intermediates are in the dimeric state. Monomeric intermediates were not detectable, probably because of the fast aggregation of these species. To determine whether GroEL binds inactive dimeric CS intermediates, we performed HPLC-size exclusion chromatography experiments in the presence of GroEL. Fig. 2 C shows that the decrease in the dimer peak area in the presence of GroEL followed the same kinetics as inactivation in the absence of GroEL. Thus, GroEL binds dimeric unfolding intermediates of CS stably and holds them in a state that allows reactivation under permissive conditions. To investigate whether the GroEL-bound intermediates remain dimeric or dissociate, we followed the time courses of reactivation after a 15- or 60-min incubation at 43 °C, respectively (Fig. 3). If there were changes in the distribution of different unfolding intermediates of CS in the presence of GroEL, these differences should be visible in the reactivation kinetics because of differences in their refolding behavior. After a 15-min inactivation period, both the spontaneous and the GroE-assisted reactivation of CS intermediates followed a single exponential kinetic, with rate constants of 0.135 and 0.05 min−1, respectively. After inactivating CS for 15 min at 43 °C in the presence of GroEL, reactivation was initiated by shifting the temperature to 25 °C. Addition of ATP only, during reactivation, led to a much slower reactivation of CS than reactivation in the presence of the complete GroE system (GroEL·GroES·ATP) or the spontaneous folding reaction. This indicates that an additional reaction becomes rate-limiting, which should be the dissociation of the GroEL-bound intermediates from GroEL. So the detectable rate of folding corresponds to the apparent off rate of the CS intermediates from GroEL. Interestingly, this kinetic trace can only be described by two parallel first order kinetics. This indicates that at least two different intermediates were bound to GroEL. Because the off-rate of an intermediate from GroEL correlates with its affinity to GroEL, one of the intermediates has a high affinity for GroEL, resulting in an apparent rate constant for folding of 2.1 × 10−3min−1. The second intermediate has a lower affinity and therefore a faster apparent rate constant of folding (k = 0.015 min−1). Having analyzed the effect of the GroE system on reactivation after 15 min of inactivation, we asked whether there were any differences in the refolding of CS after a long time inactivation in the presence of GroEL. After 60 min of incubation at 43 °C, the ATP-induced refolding of the GroEL-bound intermediates is very slow (Fig.3 B). The kinetic trace followed one single first order kinetic, with an apparent rate constant of 2.35 × 10−3 min−1. This rate constant is very similar to the apparent slow folding phase of the ATP-induced renaturation reaction observed after 15 min of inactivation. Thus, the low affinity intermediate bound to GroEL is not protected against a conversion to a second high affinity intermediate during heat shock. The GroES·ATP-induced reactivation kinetics of GroEL-bound CS were very similar after inactivation for 15 or 60 min (Fig. 3 B). However, the kinetic traces after 60 min inactivation were found to be sigmoidal (also see Fig. 4), so that they could not be described with a single exponential function. After 15 min of inactivation in the presence of GroEL, reactivation at 25 °C in the absence of GroES and ATP showed a slow increase in activity, following a single exponential function. In contrast, after 60 min of inactivation there is no reactivation detectable in the absence of GroES and ATP, because of the higher affinity of the intermediates formed during long-term incubation at 43 °C. Unfolding in the absence of GroEL for 60 min led to the completely irreversible denaturation of CS (data not shown). From the results presented so far, we conclude that GroEL interacts with two different intermediates of CS during thermal unfolding, which exhibit different affinity to GroEL and of which at least one is dimeric (see also discussion). Having shown that GroEL binds dimeric unfolding intermediates of CS and that the GroEL-bound intermediates convert to a second, kinetically distinct intermediate with long term incubation at 43 °C, we asked whether these intermediates were still dimeric. To this end, we analyzed the concentration dependence of CS refolding in the presence of GroE after 60 min of inactivation in the presence of GroEL. As shown in Fig. 4, reactivation of these intermediates is strongly dependent on CS concentration, which implies that these intermediates are monomeric. The sigmoidal time courses further showed that the reactivation reaction comprises at least two consecutive reactions. At higher CS concentrations the kinetic traces converged, which indicates that a concentration-independent folding step becomes rate-limiting. It seems most likely that this step represents the folding of the inactive dimeric intermediate to the active enzyme, as previously suggested (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This is supported by the disappearance of the lag phase of the refolding reaction. To test the binding stoichiometry of GroEL for monomeric CS intermediates we performed a 90-min inactivation of CS in the presence of increasing amounts of GroEL. As shown in Fig.5, at a ratio of 0.5 GroEL14/CSmonomer the maximum yield of reactivatable intermediates was recovered. Because the CS unfolding intermediates are all in a monomeric conformation after a 90-min heat treatment, this shows clearly that GroEL has two independent binding sites for CS. As a control, we preformed GroEL14·GroES7·ADP complexes in which one substrate binding site is stably associated with GroES, so that only one substrate binding site is available per GroEL. In this case, after a 90-min inactivation of CS in the presence of the GroEL·GroES complexes, the maximum yield of recovered intermediates was obtained at a GroEL14/CSmonomer ratio of 1. If the GroEL-bound intermediates were still dimeric, a ratio of 0.5 should have been sufficient to achieve the maximal yield of reactivation. Electron microscopic studies have shown that substrates can be bound inside the central cavity of GroEL·GroES complexes (20Sparrer H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Due to the size of the cavity, only polypeptides smaller than 60 kDa can be sequestered in the GroEL cavity underneath a GroES molecule (41Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Because refolding of long term thermally denatured CS by GroEL is GroES- and ATP-dependent, we asked whether monomeric CS species with a mass of 49 kDa are encapsulated into the internal GroE cavity during the chaperone cycle. To test this, CS was denatured in the presence of GroEL for 80 min at 43 °C. Then, after a temperature shift to 40 °C, GroES and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP were added to form GroEL·GroES·CS complexes. Electron micrographs of these complexes show a stain-excluding mass inside the cavity of GroEL14·GroES14 complexes (Fig.6 A) and GroEL14·GroES7 complexes (Fig.6 B). As a control, GroEL was incubated at 43 °C for 80 min in the absence of CS, and then GroES and AMP-PNP were added. In this case, no stain-excluding mass inside the GroEL·GroES complexes was detectable (Fig. 6, C and D). This result proves directly that monomeric CS intermediates generated during heat inactivation are encapsulated in the GroE cavity. After 15 min of inactivation and preparation as described above, we also found stain-excluding masses of CS inside the central cavity of GroEL·GroES complexes. These masses correspond to the fraction of monomeric intermediates of CS at this time point (data not shown). However, if a substrate is not sequestered underneath GroES, it is not possible by negative staining to determine whether a molecule is bound to GroEL. As in the absence of GroES, GroEL adopts open and closed conformations; it is difficult to distinguish unambiguously between a closed GroEL molecule without and an open one with bound substrate. Under heat shock or other stress conditions many proteins lose their native conformation and denature rapidly, resulting in the population of irreversibly unfolded polypeptides and aggregates. To prevent such irreversible reactions and to maintain viability, the production of heat shock proteins is induced rapidly. In agreement with this view, elimination of the heat shock response in E. coliby disrupting the stress-sensitive transcription factor ς32 leads to protein aggregation and inclusion body formation with subsequent cell death after stress (42Gragerov A. Martin E. Krupenko M. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is known that the GroE chaperones promote protein folding under conditions under which no spontaneous folding occurs and prevent aggregation of many substrates under heat stress. However, because little is known about the thermal unfolding of substrate proteins, it remained unclear how the GroE system performs this task under unfolding conditions. We show here that the interaction of GroE with thermally unfolding CS can be dissected into several steps that occur before irreversible aggregation. Generally, GroEL has no influence on the inactivation kinetics of CS at high temperatures but suppresses the heat-induced aggregation of CS completely (26Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Addition of GroES and ATP to the GroEL-bound CS intermediates allows refolding under permissive conditions. This is in agreement with previous results on the effects of GroEL on thermally denaturing proteins (21Höll-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 58-64Google Scholar, 22Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, the kinetic analysis presented here suggests the following model for CS unfolding in the presence of GroEL at elevated temperatures (Fig. 7). The native CS dimer unfolds during heat inactivation to an inactive dimer, which exhibits native-like structure (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These intermediates are bound weakly by GroEL. Later during the unfolding process, the inactive dimers dissociate into monomeric intermediates, which possess a high affinity for GroEL. Surprisingly, also in the presence of GroEL the dimeric intermediates dissociate into monomers. This may be due to fast binding and release, so that dissociation occurs free in solution. The other possibility is that the dimeric intermediates are bound only via one CS subunit, so that one subunit may dissociate, whereas the other one is stably associated with GroEL. The possibility that GroEL binds only monomeric intermediates of CS, thus shifting the equilibrium between inactive dimers and monomers to the monomeric intermediate, can be excluded. In the presence of GroEL, such a shift in equilibrium would also affect the equilibrium between the native enzyme and inactive dimers, thus leading to accelerated inactivation. Such an effect was not detected in Fig. 1. Furthermore, in this case, inactivation should be dominated by monomeric species at any time point during inactivation. As a consequence, one would not expect to see any differences in the reactivation kinetics after 15 or 60 min of thermal unfolding, as was shown in Fig. 3. Because of the size limits of the cavity, only monomeric CS intermediates can be encapsulated in GroEL·GroES complexes, leading to asymmetrical and symmetrical particles, the so-called “bullets” and “footballs” (20Sparrer H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with substrate inside. Sequestration of CS inside GroE complexes is a prerequisite for efficient refolding under nonpermissive conditions. It is rewarding to compare the interaction of GroEL with thermally unfolding CS with that of two other major classes of chaperones. At least in the case of thermal unfolding of CS, these three classes of chaperones share the ability to suppress unspecific aggregation. The kinetic analyses, however, revealed differences in the interaction with nonnative conformations of CS. Hsp90 was found to interact only transiently with early dimeric unfolding intermediates, thus leading to an apparent stabilization of CS during thermal unfolding (25Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hsp25, a member of the small heat shock protein family, was shown to bind all unfolding intermediates of CS stably during thermal unfolding. Similar to GroEL, it has no influence on the inactivation kinetics. So far, reactivation is only possible in cooperation with other chaperones under permissive conditions (40Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 101-109Crossref Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A common theme that emerges from this and other studies is that chaperones seem to interact already with early, native-like unfolding intermediates, thus preventing the formation of aggregation-prone, unfolded conformations. GroE is set apart from other chaperones both by the range of conformations it interacts with productively and, importantly, by its ability to support folding under nonpermissive conditions. Although the later has attracted quite some attention, the mechanistic importance of the recognition of different conformations of a protein has not been incorporated into the current models of GroE action. Binding of a protein at different stages of folding by GroEL, as shown here for CS, may be the rule rather than the exception, because similar phenomena have also been described for the interaction of GroE with chemically denatured proteins. In this context, GroEL has been shown to interact both with the highly structured, native-like dimeric folding intermediate of an antibody Fab fragment and with its unfolded, monomeric intermediate (43Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GroEL binds two different nonnative states of β-lactamase (44Gervasoni P. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The interaction of GroEL with different nonnative conformations of a protein allows the chaperone to interfere early on with unfolding proteins by recognizing native-like species and preventing further irreversible species. At the same time, GroE is able to actively support the folding of largely unfolded proteins in a strictly GroES-dependent manner. The interplay of these reactions seems to be important for GroE to support survival under heat shock conditions.

The ATP-regulated transient association of Hsp70 with unfolded polypeptides prevents either further folding or aggregation of the chains (3McKay D.B. Adv.

Hsp70 proteins display a certain degree of peptide sequence specificity, which extends beyond recognition of the unfolded states. Several studies using random synthetic peptide or peptide-display phage libraries have revealed the preference of Hsp70s for binding of short peptides (heptamers) enriched in hydrophobic residues (5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.B. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrikson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 6Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R.

For instance, the presence of basic residues favors binding of peptides to bacterial DnaK and Hsc70, the cytosolic heat shock cognate protein, but not to BiP, the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70 (8Fourie A.M.

In this report we analyze the molecular basis for the specific interaction of Hsc70 with only one of two homologous eukaryotic proteins, both of which are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes but localize to different cellular compartments. The cytosolic (cAAT) and mitochondrial (mAAT) isozymes of rat liver aspartate aminotransferase have approximately 50% sequence identity and have nearly identical three-dimensional structures (13Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 87-285Google Scholar), but only mAAT interacts with Hsc70 either during synthesis in cell-free extracts (14Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I.

Because Hsc70 appears to play a role in the translocation of proteins into mitochondria (16Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werne-Washburne M. Craig A. Scheman R.

As is true for most translocated mitochondrial proteins, rat liver mAAT is synthesized as a precursor (pmAAT) with a N-terminal 29-residue presequence peptide (19Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that targets the protein for translocation into mitochondria. Mitochondrial presequences have been shown to bind to cytosolic Hsp70s (14Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24732-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), additional recognition sites must exist within the mature portion of the protein. We used a collection of synthetic peptides spanning the complete sequence of mAAT, or selected regions of cAAT, to identify binding sites for Hsc70 in the sequence of these enzymes. Phylogenetic analyses of different AAT isozymes were also carried out to explore possible evolutionary features of the Hsc70 binding sites identified in mAAT. Purification of pmAAT was carried out as described previously (22Altieri F. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youseff J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the absorbance of the bound pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor at 356 nm and a molar absorption coefficient of 8,500m−1 cm−1 andM r = 46,597 for pmAAT. Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain following published procedures (23Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Following the last ammonium sulfate precipitation, the protein was exhaustively dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and kept at 10 °C until use. Hsc70 protein concentration was measured from the calculated molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm of 47,800 m−1cm−1 and M r = 70,000 (24Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Acid unfolding of pmAAT was performed by titrating a stock solution of the enzyme in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 to pH 2.0, with diluted HCl (final protein concentration, 8 μm), followed by incubation for 90 min at room temperature. Refolding of pmAAT was initiated by rapid dilution of the unfolded protein at 10 °C in refolding buffer (40 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, pH 7.5) to 1.8 μm final monomer concentration. Reactivation was followed by monitoring the appearance of transaminase activity over time. The pmAAT transaminase activity was measured at 37 °C using aspartate and α-ketoglutarate as substrates, using a coupled assay with malate dehydrogenase as described previously (25Martinez-Carrion M. Turano C. Chiacone E. Bossa F. Giartossio A. Riva F. Fasella P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2397-2409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the ATPase activity of Hsc70, the chaperone (0.5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C in 40 mm Hepes, 45 mm KCl, 120 μmMgCl2, 60 μm ATP, pH 7. At different incubation times, a 20-μl aliquot was withdrawn and assayed for ATP content on a Turner TD 20-e luminometer, using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit from Sigma and following the manufacturer's instructions. The assay estimates ATP concentration from light emitted when firefly luciferase catalyzes the formation of adenylate-luciferin, which spontaneously decomposes (26Leach F.R. Webster J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 133: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When ATP is the limiting reagent, the light emitted is proportional to the ATP present in the sample, and the concentration of ATP can be calculated by reference to an ATP concentration standard curve. The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis of ATP was estimated in samples incubated at 37 °C in the absence of Hsc70. The collection of synthetic peptides spanning the complete amino acid sequence of rat liver pmAAT (19Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. B. M. Conti-Fine (University of Minnesota). The collection consists of 43 peptides (pm-1 to pm-43 starting with the N-terminal sequence of the pmAAT presequence) corresponding to 14-residue sequences of the pmAAT sequence (except pm-43, which has only 10 residues). Each peptide contains a 4-residue overlap with the previous peptide in the pmAAT amino acid sequence. The peptides were synthesized as described previously (27Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5431-5435Crossref Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The purity of the peptides was assessed by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac 218TP, 250, 4.6 mm) and an acetonitrile/water gradient (5–70% over 30 min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of the peptide preparations ranged from 50 to 95%. Most of the contaminating peptides represented truncated peptides randomly missing amino acids from incomplete coupling. Selected peptides were further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Bio-Rad C18 HiPore RP-318 semipreparative column (250, 10 mm), using the same gradient as before. Major peaks were collected, and the full-length peptide peak was identified by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition analyses. The presequence peptide, MALLHSGRVLSGMAAAFHPGLAAAASARA (pre-p), and the 14-residue peptides from the rat liver cAAT sequences (28Pavé-Preux M. Aggerbeck M. Veyssier C. Bousquet-Lemercier B. Hanoune J. Baruki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 263: 17459-17466Google Scholar) corresponding to several Hsc70-binding regions in pmAAT, SFFAQVPQAPPVLV (pc-5), GADFLGRWYIGTDN (pc-15), VLRVLSQMEKIVRI (pc-31), and VEYLVNEKHIYLMP (pc-41), were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer at the Molecular Core Facility and purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Phylogenetic trees of mAAT proteins were obtained by parsimony analysis of AAT sequences after alignment with ClustalW and Macvector software from Oxford Molecular (version 6.0, 1997). Parsimony analyses of AAT protein sequences were performed with the use of PAUP (29Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony,version 3.0b. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1989Google Scholar). In all cases, the amino acid sequences associated with the leader sequence were excluded. For phylogenetic analysis, sequences identified as aspartate aminotransferase were obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Swiss-Prot protein data base (http://expasy.hcuge.ch): Bos taurus cAAT (BovC), P33097; B. taurus mAAT (BovM), P12344; Gallus gallus cAAT (ChkC), P00504; G. gallus mAAT (ChkM),P00508; Rattus noruegicus cAAT (RatC), PIR JT0439; R. noruegicus mAAT (RatM), P00507; Mus musculus cAAT (MusC), P05201; M. musculus mAAT (MusM), P5202; Homo sapiens mAAT (HumM), P00505; Sus scrofa cAAT (PigC),P00503; S. scrofa mAAT (pigM), P00506; Medicago sativa cAAT (AlfC), P28011; Arabidopsis thaliana cAAT (ArbC), P46645; A. thaliana mAAT (ArbM), P46643; A. thaliana chloroplast precursor AAT (ArbP), P46644; Oryza sativa cAAT (RicC), P37833, PIR JC5124; O. sativa mAAT (RicM), PIR JC5125, D67643; Panicum millaceum cAAT (MilC), PIR S22378; P. millaceum mAAT (MilM), PIR S22379;Caenorhabditis elegans cAAT (CelC), Q22067; C. elegans mAAT (CelM), U39645; Saccharomyces cerevisiaecAAT (YstC), PIR S64854; S. cerevisiae mAAT (YstM), PIRS37933; Escherichia coli (Eco), P00509. The productive binding and release of substrates from Hsp70 proteins are coupled to the ATPase activity of the chaperone, which is controlled by the action of several cochaperones (3McKay D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the absence of nucleotides and cochaperones, the binding of substrate to Hsc70 is basically irreversible and will impair the binding of a different substrate. In addition, the weak ATPase activity of Hsc70 is stimulated upon binding of substrate (30Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14625-14635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Gao B. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2048-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, substrate binding to Hsc70 can be studied either by following competition with binding of another substrate (8Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by measuring the stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase activity. Because Hsc70 binds and stops refolding of acid-unfolded pmAAT (15Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), competition by a synthetic peptide should result in an increase in the fraction of pmAAT activity recovered. Thus, binding of the presequence peptide (pre-p) and 43 synthetic tetradecamers spanning the entire amino acid sequence of pmAAT was tested by comparing the yield of pmAAT reactivation in the presence of Hsc70 alone and Hsc70 that had been preincubated with a 70-fold molar excess of each peptide (32Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Martshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. VIII. Academic Press, New York1997: 481-492Google Scholar). These results are summarized in Fig. 1. Several peptides could not be tested either because they interfere with spontaneous refolding of pmAAT (N-terminal pm-4) or have low solubility in aqueous solutions. Seven peptides (pre-p, pm-5, pm-12, pm-15, pm-23, pm-31, and pm-41) were the most competitive. For these seven peptides, this competitive effect is concentration-dependent (data for the presequence is shown in Fig. 2), withk app values in the 4–10 μm range (Table I). Dissociation constants in the low micromolar range have been reported for the binding to different Hsp70 proteins of a number of small peptides (8Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gragerov A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Gething M.-J.H.

Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As is true for most unfolded proteins, mAAT rapidly collapses into partially folded intermediate states upon transfer to native-like conditions. The affinity of intact mAAT (or pmAAT) for Hsc70 could not be determined because the initial interaction of unfolded mAAT with Hsc70 under native conditions results in the formation of insoluble aggregates of the chaperone-pmAAT complex (15Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The differences in k app may indicate that affinity is sequence-specific, but it is also possible that for each region of pmAAT the true binding sequence has been spliced into several fragments on sequential synthetic peptides, so that at least some of the peptides may not contain the complete high affinity binding sequence. In fact, for several regions of the pmAAT sequence, the peptides around that which shows maximum competition also bind to Hsc70 (Fig. 1). Stimulation of the ATPase activity correlated well with peptide binding data obtained from competition experiments. Those peptides showing maximal competition with pmAAT for binding to Hsc70 induced an ATPase stimulation ranging from 1.5- to 2-fold (Table I). According to these results, we can tentatively conclude that any of these potential Hsc70 binding sites within the pmAAT sequence could be responsible for the observed interaction of the full-length protein.Figure 2Peptide concentration dependence of the competition between the presequence and pmAAT for binding to Hsc70. Competition assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 except that Hsc70 was preincubated with different concentrations of the synthetic presequence peptide for 120 min at 10 °C in refolding buffer. The data were fitted to a single exponential equation (solid line), and thek app value was estimated as the concentration of peptide at which 50% of the maximum reduction in pmAAT reactivation is achieved as reported in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IHsc70 binding properties of synthetic peptidesPeptide sequenceaBoldface is used to indicate mitochondrial peptides.

Open table in a new tab Binding of synthetic peptides to Hsc70 was tested by using the competition assay described in the legend to Fig. 1. To test whether the inability of Hsc70 to recognize full-length cAAT as a substrate (14Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol.

Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Pavé-Preux M. Aggerbeck M. Veyssier C. Bousquet-Lemercier B. Hanoune J. Baruki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 263: 17459-17466Google Scholar). The four cAAT tetradecamer peptides (pc-5, pc-15, pc-31, and pc-41) were synthesized and used in competition assays as described before. None of the cytosolic peptides competed with unfolded pmAAT for binding to Hsc70 or stimulated the ATPase activity of the chaperone (Table I). It appears that cAAT may actually lack recognition sites for Hsc70, at least in regions analogous to those identified in mAAT. The potential binding sites for Hsc70 identified in mAAT are scattered over the entire sequence of the protein in regions of both the small and large domains that in the native protein are folded into secondary structure elements, primarily α-helix (Fig.3). A recent NMR solution structure of the DnaK substrate binding domain (35Wang H. Kurochkin A.V. Dang Y. Hu W. Flynn G.C. Zuiderwerg E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7929-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) shows the peptide binding groove occupied with the extended C-terminal tail of itself, which is α-helical in native DnaK. Interestingly, the mAAT binding regions are for the most part exposed on the surface of the native protein (36McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The local secondary structure of the binding sites rather than their degree of exposure on the native structure might determine the discrimination between properly folded and unfolded mAAT by Hsc70. This implies that, because Hsp70 proteins bind peptide substrates in an extended conformation (5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.B. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrikson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 6Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Giersach L.M.

Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), either the chaperone is able to unwind structured protein segments in the partially unfolded protein or only extensively unfolded conformations of mAAT are suitable substrates for Hsc70. Such an essentially unfolded conformation is expected for nascent chains on cytoplasmic ribosomes or imported polypeptides emerging into the matrix, presumably the pmAAT substrates for cytosolic and mitochondrial Hsp70, respectively, in the intact cell. Both Hsp70s are important components of the machinery responsible for translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria (16Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werne-Washburne M. Craig A. Scheman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 17Sheffield W.P. Shore G.C. Randall S.K. J. Biol.

Cytosolic Hsc70 appears to be involved in maintaining translocated proteins in a partially unfolded, import-competent conformation until they engage the translocation machinery in the target membrane. Proteins remaining in the cytoplasm such as cAAT would not have this requirement and therefore could afford to fold quickly without the intervention of Hsc70. This proposal is supported by our previous finding that, after translation in cell-free extracts, cAAT folds much faster than (p)mAAT (40Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether Hsc70 displays similar selectivity toward other sets of proteins according to their cellular destinations is unknown. Many nascent chains have been found associated with Hsc70 in mammalian cells (41Beckman R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 42Nagata H. Hansen W.J. Freeman B. Welch W.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6924-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the distribution between cytosolic residents and proteins destined for translocation among them was never investigated. The 14-residue binding sequences shown in Table I display some of the features of the consensus motifs proposed for binding to BiP (large hydrophobic/aromatic residues) (7Flynn G.C. Pohl M.T. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 43Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) or DnaK (three to five hydrophobic residues flanked by basic residues) (12Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Although no consensus sequence has been proposed for cytosolic Hsc70, this chaperone seems to favor peptides with hydrophobic residues flanked on either side by basic residues (8Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gragerov A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All of the peptides in TableI have basic residues either following at least two hydrophobic residues (pm-5 and pm-12) or flanking small clusters of hydrophobic residues (pm-15, pm-23, pm-31). However, given the small number of binding peptides identified, their size about twice the apparent length of the Hsp70 binding motif (seven residues) (7Flynn G.C. Pohl M.T. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and the presence of some of the features described above in the non-binding cAAT peptides, it was not possible to develop a clear consensus sequence. The failure of rat liver cAAT peptides to bind to Hsc70 and the mapping of the binding sites identified to regions in mAAT with the lowest similarity score between the two isozymes (Fig. 3) suggest that differences in primary structure are likely responsible for the selective recognition of mAAT by Hsc70. The generality of this concept can be explored by phylogenetic analysis of different AAT isozymes. The three cladograms shown in Fig.4 represent the phylogenetic analyses using the (i) complete AAT amino acid sequence (excluding the presequence peptide), (ii) 84 amino acids from six Hsc70 binding peptides (pm-5, pm-12, pm-15, pm-23, pm-31, and pm-41; see Table I), and (iii) AAT sequence excluding these six peptides. All three analyses indicate that the duplication of mAAT and cAAT is ancient, as previously proposed (44Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and that all plant and vertebrate mAATs share a common origin. Analyses with the complete AAT sequences or sequences that exclude the six binding peptides (Fig. 4, A andC) indicate that yeast mAAT shares a common origin with all other mAAT proteins, and yeast cAAT shares a common origin with animal cAATs. Both observations are supported by large bootstrap values (97 and 80%, respectively). However, there is one striking difference among the three trees; when using the six Hsc70 binding peptides, yeast mAAT does not group with the other mitochondrial forms nor does the yeast cAAT group with the other cytosolic forms (compare Bwith A or C in Fig. 4). This observation suggests that yeast cytosolic Hsp70s may recognize different targeting sequences than Hsp70s from other eukaryotes. In fact, the affinity of Ssa1p, a yeast cytosolic Hsp70, for mitochondrial presequences appears to depend less on the specific primary sequence of a peptide than on the physical properties of the peptide such as its amphiphilic character (21Endo T. Mitsui S. Nakai M. Roise D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4161-4167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The variation in the topologies of the phylogenetic trees suggests that the six binding sequences are evolving differently than the rest of the AAT protein. This supposition is supported by the analysis of amino acid variation among vertebrate AATs. Specifically, the six binding peptides in vertebrate mAATs have significantly less variation than the same 84 amino acids in cAAT (12% for mitochondrial and 34% for cytosolic; chi-square p < 0.01). This is not because of more constraints on the mitochondrial form as a whole because in the protein excluding the six binding peptides, both mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms have approximately 19% variation (TableII). The previous observation of a greater conservation in mAAT (45Sonderegger P. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 609-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is thus supported only for the regions of the protein that bind Hsc70. The unique features of the Hsc70 binding regions versus the rest of the protein are also reflected in the amount of fixed differences between the two vertebrate isoforms. (A fixed difference is a variable site where all proteins of one isozyme type share a common amino acid that is different from the homologous site in the other isozyme.) There are more fixed differences between cAAT and mAAT in the binding peptides (51% or 43/84) than in remaining portions of the protein (39% or 134/325). That is, among all vertebrate mAAT and cAAT proteins, these two isozymes are more likely to have different amino acid residues in the six Hsc70 binding regions than in any other section of the protein.Table IIVariation within and between mAAT and cAAT proteinsNumber of variable sitesmAATcAATOverallBinding sequences (84 residues)10 (12%)29 (34%)34 (40%)Non-binding sequences (325 residues)63 (19%)61 (19%)107 (33%)The number and percentage of variable sites for the six Hsc70 binding sequences and the remaining non-binding regions were calculated for the vertebrate cAAT (5 sequences) and mAAT (6 sequences) proteins included in Fig. 4. Notice that the cAAT sequences that are homologous to the Hsc70 binding regions from mAAT have a significantly greater amount of variable sites (chi-square, p < 0.01). Number of overall variable sites is not a simple summation because some variable sites within one isoform are also variable in the other isoform. Open table in a new tab The number and percentage of variable sites for the six Hsc70 binding sequences and the remaining non-binding regions were calculated for the vertebrate cAAT (5 sequences) and mAAT (6 sequences) proteins included in Fig. 4. Notice that the cAAT sequences that are homologous to the Hsc70 binding regions from mAAT have a significantly greater amount of variable sites (chi-square, p < 0.01). Number of overall variable sites is not a simple summation because some variable sites within one isoform are also variable in the other isoform. The evolutionary analyses also shed light on the sequence features that may determine or at least contribute to peptide recognition by Hsc70. Comparison of the regions in the mAAT proteins that bind to Hsc70 with the non-binding regions reveals that non-binding regions have fewer consecutive hydrophobic residues. However, comparing analogous peptides from vertebrate cAATs and mAATs indicates that binding to Hsc70 is not determined solely by the number or distribution of hydrophobic residues in the sequence. For example, peptides pm-5, pm-31, and pm-41 have fewer total or consecutive hydrophobic residues than their corresponding peptides from cAAT; yet the latter do not bind Hsc70. Additionally, the number of basic residues or their localization relative to hydrophobic residues does not appear to represent binding determinants either. There is, however, one striking pattern, (F/A)KR, detected in the binding peptides pm-5 and pm-31 that always occurs in the corresponding homologous peptides among vertebrate mAATs but is never found in any other vertebrate cAAT sequences or in the non-binding regions of mAAT. This short sequence might therefore represent an important element of at least one of the recognition motifs for Hsc70. Hsc70 interacts specifically with several mAAT peptides distributed throughout the complete protein sequence. The phylogenetic data indicate that the six binding peptides analyzed are evolving differently than the rest of the protein. These 84 amino acids (i) produce a phylogenetic topology that differs from the complete sequences, (ii) are either more (cAAT) or less (mAAT) variable, and (iii) have more fixed differences between the two isozymes. Together these molecular and evolutionary analyses indicate that sequence divergence observed between the mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes might have evolved for the differential interaction of each enzyme form with the cellular machinery in charge of protein folding and sorting, and this may promote efficient translocation into mitochondria for mAAT and rapid folding in the cytosol for cAAT.

https://openalex.org/W2053199418,"Palmitoylation of cysteine residue 34 within the 67-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR 46), which may be anchored to the lipid bilayer, prevents the receptor from entering lysosomes (Schweizer, A., Kornfeld, S., and Rohrer, J. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 132, 577–584). In the present study, we examined the importance of the spacing between the transmembrane domain and the palmitoylation anchor site in the cytoplasmic domain for stability and trafficking of MPR 46. MPR 46 mutants with deletions of residues 20–23 and 24–29 expressed in baby hamster kidney cells were rapidly degraded with half-lives of less than 10 h. The replacement of residues 24–29 by alanine resulted in prolongation of receptor stability (t 12 ≈20 h). Whereas mutant MPR 46 could not be detected in lysosomal fractions and inhibitors of lysosomal proteases failed to prevent degradation, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin resulted in increased stability of mutant MPR 46. Pulse-chase experiments at low temperature and the acquirement of endoglucosaminidase H-resistant oligosaccharides indicate that the majority of mutant MPR 46 is degraded after leaving the Golgi compartment. Altered trafficking of mutant MPR 46 may be the result of decreased palmitoylation reaching 40% of wild type receptors. The data suggest that the spacing between the transmembrane domain and the proposed palmitoylation anchor site in the cytoplasmic domain of MPR 46 is important for a post Golgi sorting step preventing receptor degradation by multiple proteolytic systems including the proteasome.

The segregation of soluble hydrolases from the secretory route is believed to occur in the trans-Golgi network. Receptor-ligand complexes are packed in clathrin-coated vesicles that fuse with an acidified endosomal/prelysosomal compartment. Following the pH-induced dissociation of complexes, the enzymes are transferred to lysosomes, whereas receptors recycle to the Golgi for further rounds of transport or to the cell surface. Two mannose 6-phosphate-specific receptors with molecular masses of 46 (MPR 46) and 300 kDa are known (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev.

A di-leucine motif localized in the carboxyl-terminal region of MPR 46 is required for efficient sorting in thetrans-Golgi network (15Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These leucine residues (Leu64-Leu65) also contribute to rapid internalization of MPR 46 together with two other independent signals (Phe13 and Phe18, as well as Tyr45) in the 67-amino acid tail (16Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Denzer K. Weber B. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the transport of MPR 46 to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation of Ser57 has been shown to be critical (18Breuer P. Körner C. Böker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Recently, it was reported that the substitution of Cys34 in the cytoplasmic tail resulted in accumulation of mutant MPR 46 in dense lysosomes (19Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) resembling MPR 46 mutants with deleted residues 34–39 (20Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because Cys30 and Cys34 are reversibly palmitoylated, which may anchor the tail to the lipid bilayer, it has been speculated that a critical conformation of the cytoplasmic tail is required to prevent the delivery of MPR 46 to lysosomes (19Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In the present study we investigated the importance of spacing between the proposed palmitoylated anchor site at Cys34 in the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain for stability and trafficking of MPR 46. It has been shown that the spacing of the tyrosine-based sorting motif in the cytoplasmic tail of lamp1 relative to the transmembrane domain is crucial for delivery to dense lysosomes (21Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We analyzed MPR 46 mutants in which the length of the potentially intracellular loop was changed. The deletion of residues 20–23 or 24–29 resulted in rapid degradation of MPR 46, which could be decreased by respective alanine substitutions. Although lysosomal protease inhibitors impaired the degradation of a small percentage of the deletion mutants, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin almost completely prevented the degradation of the MPR 46 mutants.MATERIALS AND METHODS[35S]Methionine (100 Ci/mmol), [3H]palmitic acid (40–60 Ci/mmol), and Na125I were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was obtained from Sigma, lactacystin was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and Pansorbin (10%Staphylococcus aureus cell suspension) was from Calbiochem.Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Nucleic Acids Products Supply (Göttingen/Germany). The rabbit antiserum, an affinity-purified goat IgG against the human liver MPR 46, the rabbit antiserum (MSC-1) against the cytoplasmic tail of MPR 46, and the monoclonal anti-MPR 46 antibody (21D3) have been described previously (5Klumperman J.

The 21D3 antibody was iodinated with the aid of IODO-GEN (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to a specific activity of 2.7 μCi/μg.Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). Endoglucosaminidase H was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.DNA ConstructsHuman MPR 46 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Regina Pohlmann (this institute) and subcloned into pUC19 restricted with BamHI. MPR 46 deletion mutants Δ20–23, Δ24–29, and Δ50–54 (corresponding to residues 230–233, 234–239, and 260–264 of the full-length human MPR 46, respectively) were described previously (24Körner C.

The mutation was verified by sequencing with an ABI sequencer model 373 A.Cell Culture and TransfectionBaby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (clone BHK 21) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA and 1 μg of resistance plasmids using the calcium phosphate technique as described previously (18Breuer P. Körner C. Böker C. Herzog A.

Stable colonies selected for resistance against neomycin were isolated and screened for MPR 46 expression by 21D3 antibody binding (23Chao H.-J. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K.

Körner C. Böker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or by phosphoimaging (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji Photo Co.). The radiolabeled polypeptides were quantified by densitometric scanning (Hewlett Packard Scan Jet 4c IT) or by phosphoimaging, respectivelyOther MethodsContinuous uptake at 37 °C and internalization of MPR 46-specific 125I-labeled antibodies 21D3 prebound to cell surfaces at 4 °C were carried out as described (25Damke H. von Figura K. Braulke T. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After removal of cell surface-associated radioactivity by an acid wash step at pH 2.5, the cells were solubilized in 1 nNaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined with respect to cell protein (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213121) Google Scholar). Percoll density gradient fractionation was performed with a postnuclear supernatant derived from cells grown in a 10-cm dish as described (27Braun M. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After removal of Percoll, the membrane fractions were solubilized, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. MPR 46 were detected using the MSC-1 antibody (1:300) and the ECL Super Signal system (Pierce).DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this article demonstrate that deletions of 4 or 6 amino acids in the putative cytoplasmic loop between the transmembrane domain and the palmitoylated site at Cys34cause rapid degradation of MPR 46. The degradation is insensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteases but can be prevented by lactacystin, the most specific proteasome inhibitor known so far. In addition, the degradation of mutant MPR 46 appears to be a post-Golgi event.Previously it was shown that palmitoylation of Cys34anchoring the cytoplasmic domain of MPR 46 to the lipid bilayer may mask a sorting signal that directs the receptor from endosomes to lysosomes followed by degradation (19Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The diaromatic Phe18-Trp19 motif has been identified as key residues for sorting in endosomes (28Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) facilitated by the binding of the cytosolic protein TIP 47 (33Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Our present data indicate that the precise spacing between transmembrane domain and lipid anchor is also critical for MPR 46 sorting. However, the lack of mutant MPR 46 Δ24–29 accumulation in dense lysosomal fractions and the failure of lysosomal protease inhibitors to protect newly synthesized mutant receptors from degradation suggest that in the presence of the diaromatic Phe18-Trp19 endosomal sorting motif mutant MPR 46 are degraded by other nonlysosomal proteolytic systems.A clear inhibition of degradation of mutant MPR 46 is caused by the proteasomal inhibitors ALLN and lactacystin. Proteasomes have been implicated in the degradation of unfolded or unassembled proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as in down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins as part of feed back control (34Rock K.L.

After covalent attachment of ubiquitin, these membrane or soluble proteins appear to be retranslocated to the cytosol involving the sec61 complex (37Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). We could not detect any specific ubiquitin-modified mutant MPR 46 by Western blotting, 2P. Breuer and T. Braulke, unpublished results. which is consistent with findings that certain proteins do not require ubiquitination for proteasomal degradation (38Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 39McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The low temperature experiments and the degradation of mature MPR 46 mutants containing complex type, endoglucosaminidase H-resistant oligosaccharides indicate that the majority of mutant MPR 46 is degraded after leaving the Golgi while the intracellular site for degradation of MPR 46 Δ20–23 or Δ24–29 is still unknown. Furthermore, the impaired transport to the plasma membrane of mutant MPR 46 A24–29 suggests that these residues may be involved in the (endosomal) sorting process. The data cannot exclude the possibility that trafficking of mutant MPR 46 is altered due to decreased palmitoylation. It is likely that only 40% of receptors reached compartments in which palmitoylation of Cys34 occur and residual receptors are retained in an organelle for degradation. The mechanism of the lactacystin-sensitive degradation of MPR 46 in a post-Golgi compartment remains to be examined. At present, serine phosphorylation has been documented to trigger regulated degradation of ubiquitin-modified proteins by the proteasome (40Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D.

Receptor-ligand complexes are packed in clathrin-coated vesicles that fuse with an acidified endosomal/prelysosomal compartment. Following the pH-induced dissociation of complexes, the enzymes are transferred to lysosomes, whereas receptors recycle to the Golgi for further rounds of transport or to the cell surface. Two mannose 6-phosphate-specific receptors with molecular masses of 46 (MPR 46) and 300 kDa are known (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev.

Several signal structures have been identified in the cytoplasmic tail of MPR 46 needed for trafficking between internal membranes and the plasma membrane. A di-leucine motif localized in the carboxyl-terminal region of MPR 46 is required for efficient sorting in thetrans-Golgi network (15Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These leucine residues (Leu64-Leu65) also contribute to rapid internalization of MPR 46 together with two other independent signals (Phe13 and Phe18, as well as Tyr45) in the 67-amino acid tail (16Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Denzer K. Weber B. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the transport of MPR 46 to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation of Ser57 has been shown to be critical (18Breuer P. Körner C. Böker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the substitution of Cys34 in the cytoplasmic tail resulted in accumulation of mutant MPR 46 in dense lysosomes (19Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) resembling MPR 46 mutants with deleted residues 34–39 (20Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because Cys30 and Cys34 are reversibly palmitoylated, which may anchor the tail to the lipid bilayer, it has been speculated that a critical conformation of the cytoplasmic tail is required to prevent the delivery of MPR 46 to lysosomes (19Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the importance of spacing between the proposed palmitoylated anchor site at Cys34 in the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain for stability and trafficking of MPR 46. It has been shown that the spacing of the tyrosine-based sorting motif in the cytoplasmic tail of lamp1 relative to the transmembrane domain is crucial for delivery to dense lysosomes (21Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We analyzed MPR 46 mutants in which the length of the potentially intracellular loop was changed. The deletion of residues 20–23 or 24–29 resulted in rapid degradation of MPR 46, which could be decreased by respective alanine substitutions. Although lysosomal protease inhibitors impaired the degradation of a small percentage of the deletion mutants, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin almost completely prevented the degradation of the MPR 46 mutants.

Endoglucosaminidase H was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.DNA ConstructsHuman MPR 46 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Regina Pohlmann (this institute) and subcloned into pUC19 restricted with BamHI. MPR 46 deletion mutants Δ20–23, Δ24–29, and Δ50–54 (corresponding to residues 230–233, 234–239, and 260–264 of the full-length human MPR 46, respectively) were described previously (24Körner C.

Two adjacent regions (−8.2 to −7.5 kb and −7.5 to −7.0 kb) enhanced transcription of both A-chain and heterologous thymidine kinase promoters, whereas repression was observed in two other nearby regions (−9.9 to −8.2 kb and −7.0 to −5.9 kb). The −7.5 to −7.0-kb fragment, or J, was the strongest enhancer, and its activity was localized to a 66-base pair element (A-chain cell type-specific enhancer (ACE 66)). ACE66 activity was highly cell type-specific, with greatest activity seen in choriocarcinoma cell lines (4–10-fold enhancement). Progressive 5′- and 3′-deletions of the ACE66 revealed distribution of activity across the element, with nucleotides 1–33 being critical for function. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed cell type-specific patterns of high affinity protein binding to the element. Ethylation interference footprinting of JEG-3 extract localized guanine contacts on nucleotides 1–18 of both strands of the ACE element, whereas more extensive contacts were made with the phosphate backbone (nucleotides 1–32).

PDGF is a family of dimeric glycoproteins that arise from different combinations of two polypeptide chains, termed A and B, that are encoded by separate genes located on different chromosomes. The human A-chain gene contains 7 exons and is located on chromosome 7 (7pter-7q22), spanning approximately 24 kb (3Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of the A-chain promoter region has revealed complex interactions between an array of basal, mitogen-inducible, and silencer DNA elements. A highly GC-rich, S1 nuclease-hypersensitive region (−150 to +1) of the proximal promoter has been shown to contribute most of the basal transcriptional activity in a variety of cell lines, including human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) (20Lin X.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25614-25619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a nearby enhancer sequence (−496 to −486) (25Wang Z.-Y. Qiu Q.-Q. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The promoter is also under strong repressive influence of at least two silencer elements, one located within the first intron (26Wang Z.-Y. Masaharu N. Qiu Q.-Q. Takimoto Y. Deuel T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the other in the 5′-flanking region (5′ S1 nuclease-hypersensitive site) (27Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, elements mediating cell type-specific enhancement of transcription have yet to be identified within the −1800 to +8 region of the A-chain gene, suggesting that important regulatory elements may reside in more distally located DNA sequences. In this study, subfragments of the 5′-flanking region from −18 to −1.8 kb were analyzed by transient transfection in a panel of cell lines representing a wide range of A-chain expression levels. A cluster of positive and negative regulatory elements has been identified in a region between approximately −10 and −6 kb, including a 66-bp enhancer (ACE66) that exhibits potent, cell type-specific enhancer activity in choriocarcinoma cells. We further show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and ethylation interference footprinting that most of this activity in choriocarcinoma cells is mediated through binding of nuclear proteins to direct repeats of AP-1-like sequences within the 5′-portion of the ACE66 element. These findings represent the first detailed analysis of the distal 5′-flanking region of the A-chain gene and demonstrate its importance to cell type-specific patterns of A-chain transcription. Construction of the plasmids pAC261 and pUTKAT3 has been described (22Kaetzel Jr., D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermaker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). pAC261 contains a −261 to +8 fragment of the A-chain gene that mediates basal promoter activity, whereas pUTKAT3 contains the proximal promoter region of the thymidine kinase gene from herpes simplex virus (−150 to +150). To localize DNA elements in the far upstream region of the 5′-flanking region of the human PDGF A-chain gene, the −18.3 to −3.4-kb region from pACCATX-1 and the −5.2 to −1.8-kb region from pACCATX-11 (3Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1492-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) were subdivided into 15 fragments designated E through S by digestion with restriction endonucleases (Fig. 1). Specifically, E is a 1.65-kb KpnI-KpnI fragment; F is a 0.8-kbSstI-SstI fragment which overlaps with E; G is a 1.5-kb fragment derived from the 5′-end of pACCATX-11 and anSstI site; H is a 0.95-kb BglII-BssHII fragment which overlaps with G; I is a 1.1-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment; J is a 0.5-kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment; K is a 0.75-kb XbaI-XbaI fragment; L is a 1.7-kbBglII-XbaI fragment; M is a 1.8-kbEcoNI-BglII fragment; N is a 0.8-kbEcoNI-EcoNI fragment; O is a 0.5-kbBglII-EcoNI fragment; P is a 1.1-kbBglII-BglII fragment; Q is a 1.65-kbBglI-BglII fragment; R is a 0.95-kbKpnI-BglI fragment; and S is a 1.7-kbSalI-KpnI fragment derived from the 5′-end of pACCATX-1. The 15 fragments were inserted in both orientations (+/−) into the XbaI site of pUTKAT3. Fragments L, K, J, and I were inserted in both orientations into the XbaI site of pAC261, whereas fragment J was also inserted in both orientations into aBamHI site located 3′ to the cat gene (via anXbaI adapter) of a modified pAC261. Deletions of fragment J (−7.4 to −6.9 kb) were generated either by restriction endonuclease digestion of internal sites or by using standard polymerase chain reaction methods to amplify specific sequences. These polymerase chain reaction fragments contained 209 bp (J209) and 66 bp (J66) of the 3′-end of fragment J. The JΔBsp/pAC261 construct was made by using Klenow enzyme to blunt the ends generated by BspMI prior to re-ligation. pGL261-luc was constructed by inserting anXhoI-HindIII fragment of the PDGF A-chain promoter (−261 to +8) into pGL3-Basic (Promega), a promoterless plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene. Wild type ACE (J66) was inserted in the sense orientation into the NheI site of pAC261-luc. J+/pAC261-luc was constructed by inserting the BamHI-HindIII cassette containing fragment J and the A-chain promoter from J+/pAC261 into pGL3-Basic. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) for deletion and mutational analysis of the ACE element. Complementary strands were phosphorylated, annealed, and inserted into the NheI site of pAC261-luc. Sequence integrity of deletion mutants of fragment J and the ACE element was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing via the Sequenase procedure (U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by an automated fluorescent DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Binding reaction mixtures were scaled up from EMSA conditions by approximately 80-fold (800 μg of JEG-3 nuclear extract protein, 800 μg of poly(dI·dC), 0.3 pmol of probe). Non-denaturing electrophoresis was conducted as described above for EMSA, followed by autoradiography and electroelution of protein-bound and free DNA. DNA was precipitated in the presence of 5 μg of carrier tRNA by addition of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol to final concentrations of 300 mm and 70%, respectively. Pellets were rinsed with 70% ethanol, dried, and hydrolyzed at 90 °C for 30 min with either 143 mm NaOH or 1 m piperidine (90 °C, 30 min). NaOH cleavage products were prepared for analysis on sequencing gels by precipitation with sodium acetate and ethanol, a rinse with 70% ethanol, and drying under vacuum. Piperidine cleavage products were dried under vacuum and subjected to three cycles of resuspension in H2O and drying. Cleaved fragments were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and resolved by electrophoresis through 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, followed by autoradiography at −80 °C with intensifying screens for 24 h. To identify positive and negative regulatory sequences in the region from −18.3 to −1.8 kb of the PDGF A-chain gene, the region was subdivided into 15 fragments designated fragments E through S (Fig.1 A) and inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (tk) and catreporter gene. Transient transfection analyses were initially performed in HepG2 cells, which express significant amounts of PDGF-A transcripts under basal cell culture conditions (3Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1492-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Tsai T.F. Yauk Y.-K. Chou C.-K. Ting L.-P. Chang C. Hu C. Han S.-H. Su T.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Four adjacent fragments L, K, J, and I, which span the region between approximately −10 and −6 kb, conferred significant modulatory effects on tk promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). Fragment J exhibited the highest enhancer activity of all fragments tested, increasing catactivity by 3.4-fold when inserted in the correct orientation and 1.5-fold in the opposite orientation. A lesser degree of enhancement was also observed with fragment K, whereas fragments I and L significantly inhibited transcription. The four fragments had very similar activities when linked to a minimal A-chain gene promoter fragment (−261 to +8) in the plasmid pAC261 (27Liu B. Maul R.S. Kaetzel Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26281-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). When analyzed in JEG-3 (human choriocarcinoma) cells, deletion of fragment J from the 5′ terminus of the full-length −7.5 to +8 promoter region caused a 64% decrease in transcription (approximately 3-fold effect), consistent with long distance enhancer activity (Fig.1 D). Fragment J also enhanced transcription 2–4-fold in JEG-3 cells when placed in either orientation downstream of thecat gene, a distance of approximately 2 kb from the transcription start site (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence of fragment J was determined and is shown in Fig.2. Taken together, these results indicate that the distal 5′-flanking region of the A-chain promoter contains multiple enhancer and silencer elements and that the potent enhancer fragment J can act at a long distance from the transcription start site. To determine whether the fragment J enhancer functions in a cell type-specific manner, its activity was assessed in a panel of transformed and non-transformed cell lines representing a range of A-chain transcription levels. Fragment J enhanced A-chain transcription by 7.5-fold in JEG-3 cells and 3.8-fold in HepG2 cells when plasmids containing the homologous minimal A-chain promoter and catreporter gene were used (Fig.3 A). A small 2-fold enhancement was seen in the non-transformed monkey renal epithelial line CV-1, whereas activity was undetectable in another cell line of the same type (BS-C-1). When linked to the same minimal A-chain promoter fragment and the luciferase reporter gene, fragment J enhanced transcription by 10-fold in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 3 B), similar to the activity observed with the cat constructs, and was also highly active in two other choriocarcinoma cell lines, JAR and BeWo. Little or no enhancer activity was seen, however, in Hep3B (hepatocellular carcinoma) or the osteosarcoma lines U2-OS and Saos-2. The potent enhancer activity of fragment J in all three different choriocarcinoma cell lines tested, each of which express high steady-state concentrations of A-chain mRNA (Fig. 3 C), strongly suggests a role of the enhancer in maintaining a high rate of A-chain gene transcription in this cell type. The lack of enhancer activity in Saos-2, CV-1, BS-C-1, and HeLa cells is consistent with previous reports of low A-chain expression (17Betsholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Lind P. Urdea M.S. Eddy R. Shows T.B. Philpott K. Mellor A.L. Knott T.J. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 320: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 20Lin X. Wang Z. Gu L. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25614-25619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as our own observations (Fig. 3 C). To localize further the enhancer activity of fragment J, variants were constructed containing deletions at the 5′- and 3′-ends and relocated into pAC261 (Fig. 4 A). Although a 100-bp deletion of the 5′-end (JΔ5′) had no effect on enhancer activity in HepG2 cells, a 400-bp deletion of the 3′-end (JΔ3′) decreased activity by approximately 50%. An internal deletion of 160 bp near the 3′-end (JΔBspMI) resulted in a complete loss in enhancer activity, further localizing the minimal DNA element to the 3′-portion of J. Next, two DNA fragments consisting of the 3′-terminal 209 and 66-bp regions of J were inserted upstream of the minimal A-chain promoter and analyzed by transient transfection in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 3 B). Both subfragments displayed full, orientation-independent enhancer activity (3–5-fold), thus localizing the minimal element to the 3′-terminal 66 bp of fragment J. A highly synergistic enhancement of A-chain transcription (100-fold) was observed with three copies of the 66-bp element. In a separate set of transfection experiments conducted across a panel of human tumor cell lines, the minimal element retained the same hierarchy of cell type-specific activity seen with the parent fragment J, with highest activities seen in the choriocarcinoma cell lines (4–10-fold), lower levels (∼2–3-fold) in HepG2, U2-OS, and HeLa, and no activity in Hep3B and Saos-2 (Fig. 4 C). Similar trends of cell type-specific activity were seen with 3 copies of the element (Fig.4 D), with highly synergistic activity seen in the choriocarcinoma cell lines (40–150-fold), less but still synergistic activity in HepG2, U2-OS, and HeLa (15–17-fold), and no activity in Hep3B and Saos-2 cells. Based on the high cell type-dependent activity of the 66-bp enhancer, the element was named A-chain cell type-specific enhancer or ACE66. To identify functionally important subregions of the ACE66 element, a panel of oligodeoxynucleotides introducing 5′- and 3′-end point deletions was designed (Fig. 5 A). End points were chosen to correspond with borders of transcription factor binding motifs identified with the MatInspector paradigm (41Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). When these oligodeoxynucleotides were inserted into pAC261-luc and their activities analyzed by transient transfection in JEG-3 cells, none exhibited the activity of the full-length ACE66 sequence (9.3-fold enhancement; Fig. 5 A). Deletion of the ELK-1/E74A consensus sequence from the 3′ terminus of the element (deletion mutant ACE1–54) resulted in a reduction to 5.4-fold enhancement (42% loss). Although deletion of the EF1 consensus element (ACE1–43) had little further effect, removal of the EGR-3 site (ACE1–33) led to an additional loss in activity (2.4-fold enhancement remaining). Deletion of 10 bp from the 5′-end of ACE66 which removed the first AP-1-like site (ACE11–66) resulted in a significant decrease in activity to 3.6-fold. Whereas removal of 12 additional bp from the 5′-end (ACE23–66), which completely deletes the second AP-1-like site and bisects the Ets-1 site, did not diminish enhancer activity further, deletion of the third AP-1-like site (ACE34–66) resulted in almost complete inactivation. Taken together, this analysis demonstrated that DNA sequences distributed over the entire ACE66 element are required for full enhancer activity. Regions contributing to activity were localized to the first and third AP-1-like motifs (regions I and II), the central region containing the EGR-3 motif (region III), and the ELK-1/E74A motif at the 3′-end of the element (IV) (Fig. 5 C). Composite binding sites for ETS and AP-1 (FOS/JUN) transcription factors such as those present in the ACE element have been identified and characterized in other genes and appear to mediate signaling via the Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (42Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 43Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B.

To assess the contribution made by the potential composite element constituted by the ETS site and the third AP-1 site, point mutations were introduced into the ACE1–43 sequence that disrupted both the “GGA” core of the ETS site (GG → TT) and the AP-1 site (TGACTCA → AGATCTA). When tested in JEG-3 cells, the mutation resulted in a near complete loss of the activity seen with the ACE1–43 sequence (Fig. 5 B), indicating the necessity of nucleotides located within the composite"

The dynamic properties of the β-active site were probed by 31P NMR spectroscopy of the enzyme-bound coenzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The 31P NMR signal of the cofactor phosphate of the internal aldimine exhibits a single peak at 3.73 ppm with a line width of 12 Hz. In the presence of saturating concentrations of sodium ions, the 31P signal shifts to 3.97 ppm concomitant with a change in line width to 35 Hz. The latter indicates that sodium ions decrease the conformational flexibility of the coenzyme. In the absence of ions, lowering pH leads to the appearance of a second peak at 4.11 ppm, the intensity of which decreases in the presence of cesium ions. Addition ofl-serine in the presence of sodium ions leads to the formation of the external aldimine, the first metastable catalytic intermediate. The 31P signal does not change its position, but a change in line width from 35 to 5 Hz is observed, revealing that this species is characterized by a considerable degree of rotational freedom around the coenzyme C–O bond. In the presence ofl-serine and either cesium ions or the allosteric effector indole-3-acetylglycine, the accumulation of the second catalytic intermediate, α-aminoacrylate, is observed. The 31P signal is centered at 3.73 ppm with a line width of 5 Hz, indicating that the phosphate group of the coenzyme in the external aldimine and the α-aminoacrylate exhibits the same flexibility but a slightly different state of ionization. Because the α-aminoacrylate intermediate but not the external aldimine triggers the allosteric signal to the α-subunit, other portions of the β-active site modify their dynamic properties in response to the progress of the catalytic process. A narrow line width was also observed for the quinonoid species formed by nucleophilic attack of indoline to the α-aminoacrylate. The 31P signal moves downfield to 4.2 ppm, indicating a possible change of the ionization state of the phosphate group. Thus, the modification of either the ionization state of the coenzyme phosphate or its flexibility or both are, at least in part, responsible for the conformational events that accompany the catalytic process.

In the presence of either Li+, Na+, Cs+, or NH4+, the phosphorescence decay of the unique Trp-177 of the β-subunit, a residue located near the β-active site, is biphasic, and the average lifetime increases, indicating a decrease in flexibility of the N-terminal domain of the β-subunit. A similar effect is caused by glycerol 3-phosphate (14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cations affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In particular,k cat increases in the order Cs+ > K+ > Li+ > Na+. Furthermore, in the absence of cations, at pH 7.9, the predominant species is the α-aminoacrylate absorbing at 350 nm. Cs+, Rb+, and Li+ further stabilize the α-aminoacrylate and cause the formation of a new absorption at about 470 nm, tentatively assigned to a tautomer of the α-aminoacrylate. Na+ and K+ stabilize the external aldimine absorbing at 422 nm (15Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Schnackerz K.D.

In the present study, 31P NMR measurements of α2β2 complex of tryptophan synthase were employed to obtain information about the effects of allosteric compounds on the enzyme conformation as well as on the flexibility of enzyme catalytic intermediates. Indole-3-acetylglycine and indoline were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of highest quality commercially available and used without further purification. Tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium was purified from the Escherichia colistrain containing the plasmid encoding the trpA and trpB genes ofS. typhimurium (13Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane buffer adjusted with HCl. Absorption spectra were recorded for all samples before and after the NMR measurements. Fourier-transform 31P NMR spectra were collected at 121.496 MHz on a Bruker 300 MHz SWB superconducting spectrometer using a 10-mm multinuclear probe head with broadband 1H decoupling. The NMR tube contained the sample (2 ml) and 2H2O (0.2 ml) as field/frequency lock and was maintained at 10 ± 0.1 °C using a thermostated liquid nitrogen flow. A spectral width of 2000 Hz was acquired in 8192 data points with a pulse angle of 60 °. The exponential line broadening used prior to Fourier transformation was 10 Hz. Positive chemical shifts in ppm are downfield changes with respect to 85% H3PO4. The 31P NMR experiments were performed at high reactant concentrations and 10 °C to assure that the concentration of enzyme intermediates did not change within 2 h and that a good 31P signal with a reasonable signal to noise ratio could be obtained. 31P NMR spectra of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex were collected to observe the predominant catalytic species, the internal aldimine, the external aldimine, the α-aminoacrylate, and the quinonoid (Scheme FS1). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained to verify that no changes in the distribution of intermediates occurred during the relatively long time of the NMR experiment (maximally 2 h). The 31P NMR spectrum of the internal aldimine of the α2β2 complex exhibits a resonance at 3.73 ppm with a line width of 12 Hz (Fig.1 A and TableI). In the presence of 500 mmsodium ions, the 31P NMR spectrum reveals a single signal at 3.97 ppm with a line broadening of 35 Hz (Fig. 1 B). No change of the absorbance was observed in the presence and absence of sodium ions. In the presence of sodium ions and l-serine, the reaction catalyzed by the β-subunit of the enzyme leads to the accumulation of the external aldimine. The 31P NMR signal of the external aldimine does not change position but becomes much narrower (5 versus 35 Hz) (Fig. 1 C and TableI).Table I31P chemical shifts of intermediatesIntermediateChemical shiftLine widthRelevant figureppmHzInternal aldimine, pH 9.53.73121AInternal aldimine (Na+), pH 9.53.97351BExternal aldimine (Na+), pH 9.53.9751CInternal aldimine, pH 7.33.71, 4.1110, 122AInternal aldimine (Cs+), pH 7.33.75, 4.1110, NDaND, not determined.2Bα-Aminoacrylate (Cs+), pH 7.33.7252CInternal aldimine (IAG), pH 7.53.74123Aα-Aminoacrylate (IAG), pH 7.53.6563BInternal aldimine (Na+), pH 8.03.97354Aα-Aminoacrylate-External aldimine (Na+), pH 8.03.81∼8Quinonoid intermediate (Na+), pH 8.04.2∼104Ba ND, not determined.

The two31P NMR signals are very likely two conformations of the coenzyme. In the presence of 150 mm cesium ions, the signal at 4.11 ppm is diminishing (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of cesium ions and 400 mml-serine, the α-aminoacrylate is the predominant species (15Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L.

Mozzarelli, manuscript in preparation. very much likedl-α-glycerol 3-phosphate and indole-3-propanol phosphate. IAG was used in the 31P NMR measurements because it does not contain phosphate groups, and, therefore, its signals do not interfere with those of the coenzyme. The 31P NMR spectrum of the internal aldimine shows at pH 7.6 in the absence of IAG again two signals at 3.73 and 4.11 ppm (data not shown), very similar to those obtained at pH 7.3 (Fig. 2 A). Upon addition of 5 mm IAG (Fig. 3 Aand Table I), a concentration saturating the α-active site (K diss = 0.12 mm),2 the signal at 4.11 ppm almost completely disappears, and the signal at 3.73 ppm is predominant (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of 400 mml-serine and 5 mm IAG the predominant species is the α-aminoacrylate. The 31P NMR reveals a single signal at 3.65 ppm with a narrow line width of 5 Hz (Fig. 3 B), very similar to that obtained for the α-aminoacrylate in the presence of l-serine and cesium ions (Fig. 2 C). The31P NMR spectrum of the internal aldimine at pH 8.0 exhibits a signal at 3.97 ppm, similar to that observed at pH 9.5 (Fig.4 A and Table I). In the presence of l-serine, sodium ions, and 40 mmindoline, the predominant species is the quinonoid (Scheme FS1) (42Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F.

The31P NMR spectrum reveals two signals at 3.81 and 4.20 ppm, indicative of a mixture of the α-aminoacrylate and the external aldimine (3.81 ppm) and the quinonoid intermediates (4.20 ppm) (Fig.4 B). 31P NMR spectroscopy has been very helpful in studying the environment of the cofactor phosphate of PLP-dependent enzymes and various enzyme intermediates during catalysis. The effects of different amino acids on O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, a PLP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes an α,β-replacement reaction as tryptophan synthase, indicate the formation of different tautomers of enzyme intermediates that can be distinguished by31P NMR spectroscopy (26Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies of the effects of K+ and Na+ on the 31P NMR spectrum of the PLP phosphate group of d-serine dehydratase have shown that these cations stabilize conformational states, which are different with respect to O–P–O bond angles, and/or hydrogen bonding of the phosphate group of enzyme-bound PLP (32Kojiro C.L. Marceau M. Shafer J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Different31P chemical shifts of PLP have been observed in dialkylglycine decarboxylase in the presence of K+ (active form) and Na+ (inactive form). 3K. D. Schnackerz and J. W. Keller, submitted for publication. These differences have been attributed to changes in torsion angles C4-C5-C5′-OP4 of the PLP aldimine on the basis of the known three-dimensional structure of the decarboxylase (33Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Keller J.W. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 245: 151-179Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The 31P chemical shifts of both enzyme forms are pH-dependent.3 The distinctive 31P NMR signals of PLP in the active site of tryptophan synthase obtained in the absence and presence of either sodium or cesium, at pH values between 7.3 and 9.5, with and without the natural substrate l-serine and the α-subunit ligand IAG, indicate that the β-active site exhibits a conformational flexibility finely tuned by bound ligands. In the absence of cations, 31P NMR signals of PLP of the internal aldimine of tryptophan synthase vary as a function of pH in the range from 7.3 to 9.5 (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). The appearance of resonances to lower field when the pH increases has previously been observed for PLP-Schiff base model compounds and for PLP-dependent enzymes (34Schnackerz K.D. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 245Google Scholar). Resonances at lower and higher field have been attributed to the existence of the dianionic and the monoanionic state of PLP aldimine, respectively. The interpretation of31P NMR spectra is still largely empirical. Gorenstein (35Gorenstein D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 898-900Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) has proposed a correlation between the 31P chemical shift and O–P–O bond angles in phosphates. For a variety of different alkyl phosphates he showed that ionization to the dianionic form decreases the O–P–O bond angle by 3 ° with a concomitant downfield shift of 3–4 ppm, whereas for the monoanion and the free acid chemical shifts and O–P–O bond angles are similar (35Gorenstein D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 898-900Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because the 31P signals of free phosphopyridoxylaspartate show a pH dependence with limiting δ values of 0.75 and 4.3 ppm at low and high pH values, respectively (36Schnackerz K.D. Wahler G. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), chemical shifts of 3.65, 3.73, 3.97, and 4.11 ppm for PLP aldimine in tryptophan synthase are interpreted as species approaching the status of full dianion. The predominant relaxation mechanisms governing the 31P line width are expected to be dipole-dipole with neighboring protons and a contribution from chemical shift anisotropy. The Stokes-Einstein relationship predicts that τc and, therefore, the line width are proportional to the molecular weight. The line width observed for the coenzyme bound to the α2β2 complex of tryptophan synthase is 35 Hz in the presence of Na+ ions (Fig. 1 B), markedly smaller than 40–42 Hz, calculated for rigidly bound and solvent-protected PLP in tryptophan synthase. No change of the absorption and emission properties of the internal aldimine of tryptophan synthase is observed with pH (37Vaccari S. Benci S. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 61: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 31P NMR signal of tryptophan synthase from E. coli, dissolved in 0.1 mtriethanolamine, 200 mm Na+ was found to be pH-independent (25Schnackerz K.D. Bartholmes P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 1536-1539Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 31P signal at pH 9.5 in the absence of cations exhibits a 12 Hz line width (Fig.1 A), indicating a rather high mobility of the phosphate around the C-O bond of the cofactor. This value is much smaller than that found for the internal aldimine of the E. coli enzyme in the presence of 200 mm Na+ (25–35 Hz). These data suggest that the coenzyme experiences in the two enzyme forms different environment and/or a different rate of interconversion among an ensemble of conformations. In the absence of cations two conformational forms of the internal aldimine can be observed. Cation binding as well as temperature (data not shown) perturb the conformational equilibrium and alter the flexibility of the cofactor phosphate. In particular, sodium ions significantly decrease the mobility of the phosphate group of the internal aldimine reflected by an increase of the line width. The concomitant downfield shift might be the result of a small change in the torsion angle C4-C5-C5′-OP4. The effect of monovalent cations on conformational equilibria of the enzyme has also been probed by characterizing the phosphorescence decay of tryptophan 177 of the β-subunit, the only tryptophan present in tryptophan synthase (14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was found that the binding of monovalent cations, including cesium and sodium, leads to a significant increase in the species with longer lifetime, independent of the type of cation. These latter results indicate that monovalent cations stabilize a more compact conformation of the β-subunit (14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), altering a pre-existing conformational equilibrium (14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7535-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that different techniques reflect the properties of the microenvironment around the probe, the phosphate in the active site being about 20 Å distant from tryptophan 177 of the β-subunit, which is near the α,β interface. The three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex has revealed that Na+, K+, and Cs+ bind to the same site in the β-subunit, about 8 Å from the phosphate of PLP but too distant from the active site to play a direct role in catalysis (23Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Residues in this region make several contacts with the α-subunit and contribute to the wall that lines the indole tunnel. The number of liganding atoms, which make up the coordination sphere of these atoms, are different and depend upon the size of the cation. The cation binding loop (residues 304–308 of the β-subunit) undergoes a small shift of about 1 Å when Na+ replaces K+ or Cs+, allowing the side chain of Asp-305 of the β-subunit to take up two different orientations. In the Na+ complex, the carboxylate of Asp-305 forms a salt bridge with ε-ammonium group of Lys-167 of the β-subunit, whereas the K+ and Cs+ complexes favor another conformation where Lys-167 of the β-subunit forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of Asp-56 of the α-subunit (40Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effect of cations on the enzyme conformation is accompanied by a significant increase in catalytic efficiency of the β-site of tryptophan synthase as documented by the 20–40-fold increase ink cat/K m (15Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When the internal aldimine reacts with l-serine in the absence of the nucleophilic agent indole, external aldimine is preferentially accumulated at high pH in the presence of sodium ions, whereas the α-aminoacrylate accumulates at low pH in the presence of cesium ions. The 31P NMR signals of the external aldimine is characterized by a peak at 3.97 ppm with a line width of 5 Hz (Fig.1 C). The internal and external aldimine exhibit in the presence of Na+ a signal at the same position, but a large difference in line width is observed, indicating that the phosphate of the coenzyme of the external aldimine has a significantly higher flexibility when compared with the internal aldimine. This result is somewhat in disagreement with a suggestion derived from static and time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the internal and external aldimine, which showed that the external aldimine exhibits a very high fluorescence intensity and consistently longer lifetimes with respect to the internal aldimine. Findings were tentatively interpreted as evidence for the external aldimine being endowed with a lower flexibility than the internal aldimine. The three-dimensional structure of the internal and external aldimine show that the transition from one to the other is accompanied by a tilt of the coenzyme ring by about 10 °, keeping the phosphate at the same position (40Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). No significant difference has been found between the B factors of the phosphate in the internal and external aldimine. 4S. Rhee, personal communication. However, NMR data more precisely describe changes of the coenzyme flexibility taking place during catalysis. The α-aminoacrylate exhibits a 31P NMR signal at 3.65 ppm with a line width of 5 Hz, the same as that of external aldimine, indicating that there is no difference in the mobility of the phosphate of the two species (Fig. 2 C versus Fig.1 C). Again, on the basis of the emission properties of the coenzyme, it was suggested that the α-aminoacrylate is more mobile than the external aldimine (37Vaccari S. Benci S. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 61: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the α-aminoacrylate, recently determined (41Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.A. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), indicates that the phosphate tail of the coenzyme does not move with respect to the internal aldimine despite a 20 ° tilt of the PLP ring around the C5-C2 axis. This finding suggests that these catalytic intermediates do not differ in their relative flexibility but in their positions. When IAG binds to the α-subunit, a change of the distribution conformational is observed, as demonstrated by a change in the31P NMR signals (Fig. 2 A versus Fig.3 A). This result is in agreement with other spectroscopic data (5Kirschner K. Wiskocil R.L. Foehn M. Rezeau L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorescence measurements indicate a tightening of the β-subunit induced by α-subunit ligands (14Strambini G. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whenl-serine and IAG are simultaneously present in the absence of monovalent ions, the α-aminoacrylate is the predominant species. Accordingly, the NMR signal is the same as that observed in the presence of l-serine and cesium ions. Thus, the mobility of the phosphate is strongly linked to the type of intermediate present in the active site, independently of the experimental conditions required for its formation. In contrast, the B factor of the phosphate of the coenzyme in the l-serine-indole propanol phosphate-K87T andl-serine-glycerol 3-phosphate-K87T mutant complexes is higher than those observed in the absence of allosteric effectors.4 The discrepancy might be due to the lower resolution of these structures. In the catalytic reaction the α-aminoacrylate is attacked by indole to form a labile quinonoid species. A more long-lived quinonoid is obtained by reaction of the α-aminoacrylate with indoline, an indole analog (42Roy M. Keblawi S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6698-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The selective stabilization of this quinonoid is obtained at high pH in the presence of sodium ions. The 31P NMR signal shows a resonance at 3.81 ppm as in the absence of indoline and the appearance of a new resonance at 4.2 ppm with a relatively narrow line width (Fig. 4 B). Findings suggest that the quinonoid is almost as flexible as the α-aminoacrylate and external aldimine. No structural information is presently available on the quinonoid species. On the basis of kinetic and spectroscopic data, the catalytic transformation of internal to external aldimine has been proposed to be associated with a conformational transition from an open to a partially open state. The subsequent formation of α-aminoacrylate and the quinonoid species is accompanied by the formation of a closed state of the enzyme (9Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W.

Different conformations of the β-subunits send different signals to the α-subunits, thus keeping the activity of the two subunits in phase. The activation of the α-subunits by signals associated to the conformation of the α-aminoacrylate in the β-active site apparently takes place only when sodium ions are present (44Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The NMR data provide support to the occurrence of a change in coenzyme mobility in the transformation of the internal to the external aldimine but do not signal a conformational transition from the external aldimine to the α-aminoacrylate and quinonoid species. The phosphate of the coenzyme seems to be a loose anchor of the enzyme-bound PLP complexes. However, changes of the flexibility and the ionization state of the coenzyme phosphate are observed during catalysis. Other regions of the protein in the β-active site and at the α,β-subunit interface change their structural and dynamic properties in response to the presence of either the external aldimine or the α-aminoacrylate to trigger distinct regulatory signals, as clearly evidenced by the three-dimensional structures of the internal aldimine, the external aldimine, and the α-aminoacrylate (40Rhee S.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the αo protein influences behaviors such as locomotion and reproduction (14Mandel J.E. Korswagen H.C. Liu K.S. Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Simon M.I. Plasterk R.H.A. Sternberg P.W.

In both studies with mice deficient in αo, life span was significantly reduced.

One suggestion is that αoC differs from αoA at the N terminus and that it might be an unmyristoylated form of the protein (29Granneman J.G. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1995-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Li P.P. Andreopoulos S. Wong C.C. Vecil G.G. Warsh J.J. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Such speculations are made more plausible by the fact that the related αtprotein is heterogeneously modified at the N terminus (31Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18274-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y.

In this paper, mass spectrometry of intact α subunits and limited tryptic proteolysis studies, in conjunction with urea/SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ESI, electrospray ionization; GTPγS, guanylyl-imido-tripohosphate; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ESI, electrospray ionization; GTPγS, guanylyl-imido-tripohosphate; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, were used to determine the region of the structural differences between αoA and αoC. Surprisingly, the masses of the αoAand αoC proteins do not differ significantly despite their different mobilities on urea/SDS-PAGE. The N termini of αoA, αoB, and αoC are identical, but a region located at the C terminus was different between αoA and αoC, analogous to the region differing between αoA and αoB. This structural difference is localized to a part of the protein suggesting differential interactions of GoA and GoCwith receptors or effectors.DISCUSSIONThe αoC and αoA proteins are both major brain α subunits, accounting for approximately 35 and 60%, respectively, of the Go protein present in brain cortex.1 Available evidence suggests that they both arise from the same αo1 mRNA (21Kobayashi I. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kikkawa S. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Nurnberg B. Spicher K. Harhammer R. Bosserhoff A. Frank R. Hilz H.

The evidence for this is immunologic cross-reactivity at sites exhibiting marked variability between G protein α subunits and extensive common sequence.The putative modification differentiating these two proteins gives rise to marked differences in mobility of the proteins on urea/SDS-PAGE, possibly suggesting some substantial difference in their structures. Nevertheless, we have shown by ESI-MS that these two proteins differ by less than 2 Da in mass (Figs. 2 and 6). While not specifically identifying the difference between the proteins, these results set criteria to be met in proposing candidate modifications. Any modifications accounting for these proteins would have to result in only 1–2-Da mass difference between the two proteins.The Significance of N-terminal Modification of G Protein α Subunits and the Homogeneous Modification of αoThe N terminus of G protein α subunits is thought to have several important functions. It is a site of interactions with βγ dimers (44Neer E.J. Pulsifer L. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Navon S.E. Fung B.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), a site of interaction with the C terminus of the α subunit (48Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a possible site of receptor interactions (49Dratz E.A. Furstenau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and a probable site of membrane attachment of the α subunit (46Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 47Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Probably affecting all of these activities are the multiple modifications at the N terminus of αo (and other α subunit isoforms). The αo protein is predicted to be myristoylated on an N-terminal Gly after removal of the initiating Met (51Schultz A.M. Tsai S.C. Kung H.F. Oroszlan S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it can be palmitoylated through a thioester linkage on a Cys located at position 3 (52Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This palmitate may turn over in response to receptor activation of the protein (53Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 54Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For other G protein α subunits, the N terminus has been found to be a site of variable modification. In addition to palmitoylation at the N-terminal Cys, arachidonylation has been reported for αi, αq, αz, and α13 in platelets (55Hallak H. Muszbek L. Laposata M. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4713-4716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of transducin α, the N-terminal Gly is heterogeneously acylated, with either a lauroyl (C12:0) or a myristoyl (C14:0) group, the latter having varying degrees of unsaturation (31Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18274-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This variability appears to be functionally related to the ability of α to bind βγ (32Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report has identified a previously unknown, and still uncharacterized, modification of αs also located near the N terminus of the protein (56Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Until this study, we had considered it likely that variable modification of the N terminus of αo would account for the structural differences between αoA and αoC. In fact, it has been suggested that these proteins do differ at the N terminus, as myristoylated and unmyristoylated forms of αo (29Granneman J.G. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1995-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Li P.P. Andreopoulos S. Wong C.C. Vecil G.G. Warsh J.J. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation state was another possibility that we considered. Because the N terminus of α is involved in binding βγ dimers (44Neer E.J. Pulsifer L. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Navon S.E. Fung B.K. J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), these possibilities might have explained the different βγ composition of GoA and GoC (23Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Balcueva E.A. McIntire W.E. Mehta N.D. Schey K.L. Robishaw J.D. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite all of these presumptive arguments, we were unable to document any difference between αoA and αoC at their N termini. Furthermore, and in contrast to αt, we were unable to identify significant variability in the processing of the N terminus of the αo proteins. Whatever function this variability has in the retina, it is not evident in the abundant G proteins commonly purified from bovine brain (2Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it is important to note that we did not find any evidence for a palmitoylated form of any of the Go α proteins. Other analyses of Go purified from bovine brain have also not observed palmitoylation (57Buss J.E. Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7493-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The lack of this modification may be due to the reducing conditions (1 mm DTT) used in the purification, which could cleave the labile thioester linkage, or there may simply be low levels of palmitoylation in vivo. These studies do not dismiss a possible role of palmitoylation in the function of these proteins, but whatever this role may be, it does not account for the differences between αoA and αoC.αoA and αoC Differ in a Region Involved in Receptor and Effector InteractionsThese studies identify the region in αo between residues 210 and 354 as the part of the protein containing the structural difference(s) between αoA and αoC. This is the same region of the αo protein that is different in the αoA and αoB splice variants. Variation in the C-terminal region of the αo isoforms has diverse functional implications, including changes in nucleotide binding (58Padrell E. Carty D.J. Moriarty T.M. Hildebrandt J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cellular targeting (59Montmayeur J.P. Borrelli E. Science. 1994; 263: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and interactions with receptors and effectors (60Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 61Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 62Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). There is already evidence that differences between αoA and αoB influence these interactions. For example, antisense experiments have shown that the αoA and αoBisoforms couple specifically to muscarinic and somatostatin receptors, respectively (63Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In terms of effector specificity, αoB, but not αoA, has been shown to be able to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (64Kobayashi I. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Tohyama K. Kurachi Y. Ito H. Ui M. Katada T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and to mediate uptake of catecholamines by secretory vesicles (65Ahnert-Hilger G. Nurnberg B. Exner T. Schafer T. Jahn R. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).As the αoC isoform is not observed in heart (28Scherer N.M. Toro M.J. Entman M.L. Birnbaumer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or a number of cultured cell lines (27Spicher K. Nuernberg B. Jager B. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that it is neural specific and involved in such brain-specific functions as learning and memory. Indeed, there is evidence that amyloid precursor protein, critical in the formation of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease, functions as a receptor for Go (66Nishinoto I. Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Takahashi S. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nature. 1993; 362: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,67Okamoto T. Takeda S. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4205-4208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since several functions for Go have been proposed, structural heterogeneity resulting from both alternative splicing and variable modification may allow Go to perform divergent functions. For example, signaling pathways involved in calcium regulation, vesicular transport, and synaptic formation could all have a specific αo isoform. G proteins, composed of an α subunit bound to a βγ dimer, mediate the effects of many extracellular ligands that act on specific cell surface receptors (1Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Go is the major brain G protein, comprising up to 1% of particulate protein in bovine brain (2Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of Go is still unclear, but it has been implicated in the regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels (4Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackle K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the αo protein influences behaviors such as locomotion and reproduction (14Mandel J.E. Korswagen H.C. Liu K.S. Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Simon M.I. Plasterk R.H.A. Sternberg P.W.

In both studies with mice deficient in αo, life span was significantly reduced.

Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is an epithelial cell-specific growth factor that may be involved in the maintenance of mucosal epithelial populations and in mediating epithelial repair after injury. The sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene, which encodes an enterocyte brush border disaccharidase, has served as a model for study of intestinal-specific gene expression and differentiation. KGF down-regulated SI mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells but not the expression of other brush border enzymes. The down-regulation was dose- and time-dependent and specifically blocked by anti-KGF antibodies. Transfection experiments using SI promoter constructs demonstrated that KGF decreased SI gene transcription. In contrast, the stability of SI mRNA was not affected by incubation of Caco-2 cells with KGF. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that binding of nuclear proteins to the SI footprint (SIF) 3 and SIF4 regulatory elements within the SI promoter region was increased in Caco-2 cells that had been incubated with KGF. In transfection experiments using a construct in which tandem copies of the SIF4-binding site were inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter and luciferase gene, incubation with KGF resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. However, transfection with a similar construct containing tandem copies of SIF3 had no significant effect on SV40 promoter activity following KGF treatment. SIF4 may bind E4BP4, a previously identified transcriptional repressor protein. This factor may in part mediate the decrease in SI transcription by KGF in Caco-2 cells.

This occurs through proliferation of stem cells in the intestinal crypts (1Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gordon J.I. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 315-324Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), migration of daughter cells from the crypts onto the villi, and extrusion of cells into the intestinal lumen at the tips of the villi, possibly as a result of apoptosis or an ordered program of cell senescence (3Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Migration of enterocytes from the crypts to the villi is coincident with the acquisition of the differentiated phenotype that enables them to perform specialized digestive, absorptive, and barrier functions. The mechanisms that determine lineage-specific gene expression, or the process of differentiation as cells migrate from the crypts to the villi, are not well understood. The sucrase-isomaltase (SI) 1The abbreviations used are: SI, sucrase-isomaltase; bp, base pairs; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPP, dipeptidyl peptidase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; IAP, intestinal alkaline phosphatase; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; KGFR, KGF receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay. gene encodes a brush border disaccharidase that is expressed exclusively in enterocytes in the adult small intestine (5Traber P.G.

Biol. 1992; 38: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar). SI mRNA is absent from crypt epithelial cells and is initially expressed by enterocytes at the crypt-villus junction. It is highly expressed in the lower half of the villus, but expression is decreased in enterocytes at the villus tip (5Traber P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Chandrasena G. Sunitha I. Lau C. Nanthakumar N.N. Hennin S.J. Cell. Mol.

For these reasons, the SI gene has been extensively studied as an example of both intestinal- and differentiation-specific gene expression (8Traber P.G. Silberg D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Enterocyte-specific transcription of the SI gene is regulated by an evolutionarily conserved region of the promoter that extends approximately 180 bp upstream of the transcription start point and contains several regulatory elements for transcription in intestinal epithelial cells (8Traber P.G. Silberg D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cdx-2, an intestinal-specific homeodomain protein (9Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α) and HNF-1β transcription factors (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to sites in the conserved SI promoter region and to positively regulate gene expression. The integration of transcriptional regulatory elements is thought to play a critical role in regulating the complex spatial patterns of SI gene expression in vivo (8Traber P.G. Silberg D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a fibroblast-derived member of the fibroblast growth factor family that has potent activity for epithelial cells but not fibroblasts, endothelial cells, nor other non-epithelial cell types (11Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 12Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 820Google Scholar). The demonstration that KGF and KGF receptor (KGFR) mRNAs are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and that systemically administered KGF was able to rapidly induce the proliferation of epithelial cells from the foregut to the colon provides functional evidence for the ability of KGF to activate gastrointestinal epithelial populations in vivo (13Housley R.M. Morris C.F. Boyle W. Ring B. Blitz R. Tarpley J.E. Aukerman S.L. Devine P.L. Whitehead R.H. Pierce G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1767-1777Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KGF is highly overexpressed in inflammatory bowel disease (14Finch P.W. Pricolo V. Wu A. Finkelstein S.D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 441-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Brauchle M. Madlener M. Wagner A.D. Angermeyer K. Lauer U. Hofschneider P.H. Gregor M. Werner S. Am.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 1469-1476PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be involved in mediating epithelial repair after injury caused by inflammatory processes. In this study, we demonstrate that KGF down-regulates SI gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells by decreasing transcription from the SI promoter. This appears to be regulated in part by increased binding of a transcriptional repressor protein to a site in the SI promoter region. A subclone of the human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line, designated Caco-2/15, which had undergone a limited number of passages and exhibited high levels of sucrase-isomaltase expression (17Beaulieu J.-F. Quaroni A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. A. Quaroni (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, refed every 48 h, and subcultured serially when ∼80% confluent. Cells to be used in each experiment, including different treatment groups, were seeded at identical cell densities and were typically used 12–15 days after reaching confluence. However, most transfection experiments were performed on Caco-2 cells that were between 1 and 2 days preconfluence, since previous experience indicated that transfection efficiencies were significantly lower in postconfluent cells (18Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human KGFR cDNA construct used to synthesize antisense transcripts for use in the ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) has been previously described (14Finch P.W. Pricolo V. Wu A. Finkelstein S.D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 441-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The following human cDNA probes were generated by PCR and cloned into the vector pGEM3Zf(−) (Promega, Madison, WI) for use as hybridization probes for RPA: a 311-bp fragment of SI cDNA (bp 107–418) (19Green F. Edwards Y. Hauri H.-P. Povey S. Ho M.W. Pinto M. Swallow D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); a 260-bp fragment of the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV cDNA (bp 380–640) (20Tanaka T. Camerini D. Seed B. Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Kameoka J. Dahlberg H.N. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar); and a 282-bp fragment of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) cDNA (bp 138–420) (21Henthorn P.S. Raducha M. Kadesch T. Weiss M.J. Harris H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12011-12019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned fragments were sequenced to ensure the correct identity of the cloned fragment and that no errors had been incorporated during the amplification reaction. All fragments were orientated such that transcription with T7 RNA polymerase generated antisense transcripts fromHindIII-linearized templates. The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was a 316-bpSacI/BamHI fragment (nucleotides 109–427), and the human c-MYC probe was a 250-bpKpnI/EcoRI cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1197–1446). Both fragments were subcloned into the Triplescript vector such that transcription with either T3 or T7 polymerases generated the antisense transcript (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Transcript levels were determined using RPA using 32P-labeled antisense cRNA transcripts as hybridization probes. Ten μg of total cell RNA was hybridized overnight at 43 °C with 1 × 105 cpm of gel-purified probe. Hybrids were digested with 0.1 unit of RNase A and 20 units of RNase T1 (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for 60 min at 35 °C. Protected fragments were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gels and visualized by autoradiography. Caco-2 protein lysates were prepared in Staph A buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate) containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (1 mm) and aprotinin (10 μg/ml) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. KGFR was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate using 1 μg of an affinity purified anti-FGFR-2/KGFR rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as described previously (22Finch P.W. Murphy F. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar). Postconfluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were rinsed twice with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and then incubated for 1 h with the same medium. Cells were then incubated for a further hour in the same medium containing 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (NEN Life Science Products). Cell layers were washed three times with PBS, suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm mannitol, 1 mmPMSF, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml antipain, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin), and homogenized in a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (25 strokes with a motor-driven pestle). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and then supplemented with 200 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Aliquots of cell lysate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an excess of HS14, a mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (23Beaulieu J.-F. Nichols B. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20000-20011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Andrea Quaroni. Immune complexes were precipitated with Gammabind (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed 6 times with washing buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml antipain, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin), and released by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and labeled protein was detected by fluorography. The plasmids −324 HS-LUC and −3242 HS-LUC, containing bp −324 to +54 and −3424 to +54, respectively, of the human SI gene 5′-flanking region linked to a luciferase reporter gene (18Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Traber (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing tandem copies of the SI footprint 1 (SIF1) (24Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), SIF3 (24Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and SIF4 (25Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A290Google Scholar) transcription factor binding sites were synthesized containing XhoI restriction sites at either end and cloned into the corresponding site of the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega). To verify the presence and orientation of the inserted fragment, representative clones were sequenced. Resulting recombinants were called pSIF1-SV40:LUC, pSIF3-SV40:LUC, and pSIF4-SV40:LUC, respectively. In the pSIF3-SV40:LUC construct, the two SIF3 sites were inserted in the opposite orientation to the SV40 promoter, since this had previously been shown to maximally augment transcription (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pSIF1-SV40:LUC and pSIF4-SV40:LUC, the SIF1 and SIF4 sites were oriented in the same direction as the SV40 promoter. For transfections, cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and then incubated for 4 h with a calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate (26Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). After washing and incubation with DMEM, 10% FCS for 24 h, KGF was added to the cells at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates were briefly centrifuged in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material, and then extracts were stored in aliquots at −70 °C. For luciferase assays, 20 μl of cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) at room temperature. After mixing, the reaction was placed in a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs Inc., Mt. View, CA), and the light produced was measured for a period of 10–20 s, beginning 10 s after mixing. β-Galactosidase was measured by adding 50 μl of extract to 200 μl of assay buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and 50 μl of 15 mg/ml chlorophenyl red β-D-galactoside. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h or until the color had developed. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of assay buffer (without the β-mercaptoethanol), and then absorbance was read at 574 nm. A standard curve was prepared by diluting standards between 0.0 and 6.0 × 10−3 units of β-galactosidase in lysis buffer. Results were expressed as light units generated per unit of β-galactosidase activity. For these studies, pA3-LUC, a promoterless luciferase vector was used as negative control for luciferase activity following transfection into Caco-2 cells. pRSV-LUC, in which the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and enhancer are linked to the luciferase gene, or the pGL3-Promoter vector, in which an SV40 promoter drives luciferase expression, was used as positive control. Postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml KGF or vehicle alone. Actinomycin (10 μg/ml) was then added to the medium, and cells were harvested at different time points. Total RNA was prepared, and the level of SI transcripts was determined by RPA. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS, pelleted for 10 s, and then resuspended in cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF). Following 10 min incubation on ice, cells were vortexed for 10 s, centrifuged briefly, and then the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction, containing nuclear DNA-binding proteins, was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Complementary oligonucleotides with overlapping ends were annealed and labeled by filling in the ends with 32P-labeled dNTPs and Klenow enzyme. Binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mmHEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-nonspecific competitor DNA (28Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Gray T.A. Riordan M.F. Sartor C.I. Collins F.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5310-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein (5–7 μg of nuclear extract) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of labeled probe (1–2 × 104 cpm, 0.1–0.2 ng). Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25 °C in 4% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1.0 mm EDTA). Gels were pre-run at 15 mA for 30 min prior to loading. Electrophoresis of samples was continued for 2–3 h at 15 mA, following which the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line is a commonly used model system for absorptive enterocytes since the cells undergo spontaneous differentiation when they form confluent monolayers (29Fogh J. Fogh J.M. Orfeo T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 59: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 30Audus K.L. Bartel R.L. Hidalgo I.J. Borchardt R.T. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1990; 7: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To determine whether KGFR was expressed and how expression may change with degree of differentiation, we examined KGFR expression in Caco-2 cells at various times pre- and postconfluence. Both transcript and protein expression levels were lowest in preconfluent cells but increased significantly at the time the cells formed a confluent monolayer (day 4 after plating) (Fig.1, A and B). After 3 days at this high level, there was a gradual decline in expression with increasing time postconfluence. In order to determine whether functional signaling was possible in postconfluent cells, ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the KGFR was examined in a 12-day postconfluent culture of Caco-2 cells. Following triggering for 5 min with 100 ng/ml KGF, the cell lysate was specifically enriched for the KGFR by immunoprecipitation and then subjected to Western blotting analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C (middle panel), KGF treatment led to a modest increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the KGFR. This signal could be competitively inhibited by the inclusion of phenyl phosphate with the immunoprecipitation buffer, thus demonstrating specificity for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Having demonstrated functional KGFR signaling in postconfluent Caco-2 cells, we then sought to examine KGF effects on the enterocytic phenotype. Differentiation is indicated by increased expression of a number of brush border enzymes, including SI, IAP, and DPP IV, which are typical components of mature small intestine enterocytes. Following treatment of postconfluent cells with various concentrations of KGF for 24 h, there was a specific down-regulation of SI mRNA expression, in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2 A). In contrast, there was only a slight decrease in IAP expression, and while there were some fluctuations in DPP IV transcript levels, overall there appeared to be no significant change. The down-regulation of SI mRNA by KGF was not transient and was sustained over a period of at least 48 h (Fig. 2 B). To rule out the possibility that a contaminant such as endotoxin was responsible for the down-regulation of SI RNA, we preincubated KGF with the neutralizing monoclonal anti-human KGF antibody, 1G4 (31Bottaro D.P. Fortney E. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9180-9183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 2 h and then incubated this mixture with Caco-2 cells. No decrease in SI RNA was observed when compared with cells stimulated by KGF incubated with a nonimmune immunoglobulin, thus providing evidence for the KGF specificity (data not shown). To determine that KGF treatment also resulted in decreased SI protein synthesis, Caco-2 monolayers were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine for 30 min. Monolayers were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-SI monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. A single radiolabeled polypeptide of ∼200-kDa was present in control Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3), corresponding to the single chain SI precursor (23Beaulieu J.-F. Nichols B. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20000-20011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was a dose-dependent decrease in this SI protein species following incubation of postconfluent cells with increasing amounts of KGF (Fig. 3). Thus, incubation of Caco-2 cells with KGF results in down-regulation expression of both SI transcript and protein synthesis. To determine the mechanism by which KGF inhibits SI synthesis, we examined its effects on SI gene transcription and mRNA stability. To examine effects on SI transcription, the −324 HS-LUC and −3424 HS-LUC SI promoter plasmids, which contain 324 and 3424 bp, respectively, of the human SI gene 5′-flanking region (18Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected into Caco-2 cells. Following washing, cells were treated with either 100 ng/ml KGF or vehicle for 24 h, and luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Table I, luciferase activity directed by the −324 HS-LUC construct was decreased 39% when cells were incubated in the presence of KGF (p = 0.037). The basal level of activity of the −3424 HS-LUC construct was 2.7-fold higher than that of −324 HS-LUC, and this was decreased by 45% by KGF treatment (p = 0.032). In contrast, the promoter activities of both the negative (pA3-LUC) and positive (pRSV-LUC) control constructs were not significantly affected by KGF treatment (p = 0.718 and 0.606, respectively).Table IEffect of KGF on SI promoter activityPlasmid−KGF+KGFp aPaired Students t test; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.pA3-LUC396 ± 120431 ± 1090.718pRSV-LUC1.52 × 106 ± 2738831.62 × 106 ± 3033880.606−324 HS-LUC18966 ± 430811546 ± 48800.037−3424 HS-LUC52102 ± 1232728412 ± 157100.032The −324 HS-LUC and −3424 HS-LUC SI promoter constructs were co-transfected into Caco-2 cells along with pSV-β-galactosidase, treated for 24 h in the absence or presence of KGF, and cell lysates analyzed for expression of luciferase and β-galactosidase. pA3-LUC (promoterless) and pRSV-LUC (Rous sarcoma virus promoter and enhancer) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.

Values for luciferase activity are expressed as light units/unit of β-galactosidase activity. Results represent mean values ± S.D. from seven independent experiments. Given that the transfection experiments described above were performed on Caco-2 cells between 1 and 2 days preconfluence at a time when both KGFR and SI expression were still relatively low (Fig. 1, Aand B), we were interested in determining whether a greater KGF effect could be seen at later stages of confluence when the level of expression of these genes was higher. The results (shown in TableII) indicate that KGF can decrease SI transcriptional activity at all the time points tested but that a progressively greater effect was detected as the cells reached later stages of confluence (at 6 days postconfluence, a 72% decrease in luciferase activity was detected versus untreated cells, compared with a 42% decrease in preconfluent cells). Thus, KGF down-regulation of SI does not specifically correlate with KGFR expression, which although it reaches a peak at 2 days postconfluence (Fig. 1, A and B), it begins to decline by 4 and 6 days postconfluence. Also of note is the decrease in luciferase activity observed following transfection of cells at a later stage of confluency, indicative of decreased transfection efficiency in these cells (18Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol.
